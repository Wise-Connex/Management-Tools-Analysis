      "abstract": "<jats:p>Current state agricultural supply chain analysis for essential commodities like Teff in Ethiopia is necessary to avoid supply chain disruption caused by events like COVID 19. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of COVID-19 on the agriculture and food sector. It has taken into account both qualitative and quantitative mixed approaches. The study has been conducted to analyze the resilient teff value chain across teff supply chain members from production to consumption by comparing two production areas in Ethiopia. Cross-sectional descriptive surveys at different stages of the supply chain are identified. Data collection has been made based on the purposive sampling technique. It has then, analyzed the data and reach on conclusion. The findings revealed that wealth was not accumulated by farmers to create a sustainable supply of Teff to the consumers which is not enough to respond to the demand gap created in the event of supply chain disruption. Teff value chain analysis also indicated that consumers have low price expectations of Teff regardless of its high price at the retail shop. Since March 2020 Due to COVID 19 prevalence in Ethiopia, lockdown that disrupts goods and people move from rural to urban has resulted in a sharp Teff price increase from an average of 4200 per Quintal to 5000 Birr per Quintal in just one month at the retail shop. This has significantly benefited downstream supply chain members like wholesalers and retailers by hoarding Teff supply to consumers until regulatory bodies took action on price hikes by retailers. Finally, recommendations have been forwarded among the others include: to enlarge subsidies for Ethiopian farmers to boost agricultural production, hedge farmers against price fluctuation and avail warehouses for stocking agricultural commodities to buffer against future uncertainties are the major ones that the government has to apply. </jats:p>"

At a time when global supply chains are complex and subject to uncertainty, synchromodality has emerged at the forefront of research and practice as a tool to ensure efficient delivery performance and thus supply chain competitiveness. Despite synchromodality is attracting the attention of leading companies and policy makers, only scholars within the transport research community have engaged with the topic so far. We believe a supply chain management perspective is missing, but essential, to develop the full potential of synchromodality. Our study shows that synchromodality capabilities encapsulate four key elements: <jats:italic>visibility</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>integration</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>multi</jats:italic>‐<jats:italic>modal transport</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>flexibility</jats:italic>. Thanks to a three‐stage research approach exploiting multiple methods, this study conceptualizes, develops, and validates the first synchromodality measurement model, which reflects the multidimensional nature of the concept. We hope to set the stage for a number of potential future research opportunities that can explore synchromodality implementation and outcomes.</jats:p>",

Ethiopian pharmaceutical supply agency's distribution network is taken as a case to show the significance of the Kanban system. Monthly data for one year is collected and is accompanied by primary data obtained from direct observation and discussion with the company's management staff. ABC, XYZ, and ABC/XYZ matrix analyses were performed to determine items to be considered in Kanban implementation. By analysis, it is shown that the Kanban system can improve inventory-related costs by about 75%. While the Kanban system is rarely implemented in the pharmaceutical sector so far, it is understood in this study that it can bring improvements in the sector if properly implemented. Though it is shown by analyzing data on how the Kanban system can improve inventory-related costs, it is imperative to practically implement it for validation of its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Depending on the context, the entities of interest may be species, products, firms, countries, or supply chains. We discuss the concepts of niche breadth and niche overlap and provide a mathematical expression for computing the competitive effects of interacting entities on one another from niche breadth and overlap measures. We illustrate the competitor identification procedure with simulated data mimicking a situation where supply chains compete over logistics modes on which they rely for moving goods from point to point. Competition identification is invaluable to business sustainability as it allows the entities involved to remain sustainable and persist in a competitive environment by crafting effective strategies that allow them to continuously adapt to changes and mitigate the negative impacts of competition.</jats:p>"

The target population in this study was 40 County Government employees. The study employed the use of primary sources of data where the researcher used questionnaires. Quantitative data was analyzed through the use of frequency distribution, mean scores and standard deviations. Chi-Square test was used to determine whether there is significant association between the study variables. From the chi-square test, the study concluded that there is a positive and significant association between dependent variable (supply chain management performance) and the independent variable (e-procurement). This means that e-tendering, e-invoicing and e-payment have a positive and significant influence on supply chain management performance. The study recommended that institution should provide the supplier with access credentials for the supplier portal. This will increase users’ access to information in the e-procurement (electronic procurement) service with effective internet and thus an increase in chances of selecting the best supplier company for e-tendering. The system should enhance government financial controls and improve accounting, recording and reporting through proper systems of invoicing with regard to both the supplier and the institution. Automated procurement process should be specific with requisition, tendering, contract warding and payment. The goal of the e-procurement in the institution should be to enhance the quality of public service delivery in the county and to provide timely, transparent and accurate financial and accounting information across both national and county government.</jats:p>"

A systematic literature review method was used to get evidence from the current knowledge linked to this theme. The results have evidenced a strong gap related to Industry 5.0 approaches for the supply chain field. Forty-one (41) publications, including conference and journal papers, have been found in the literature. Nineteen (19) words, which were grouped in four (4) clusters, have been identified in the data analysis. This was the basis to form the four (4) constructs of Industry 5.0: Industry Strategy, Innovation and Technologies, Society and Sustainability, and Transition Issues. Then, an alignment with the supply chain context was proposed, being the basis for the incipient Supply Chain 5.0 framework and its research agenda. Industry 5.0 is still in an embryonic and ideal stage. The literature is scarce and many other concepts and discoveries are going to emerge. Although this literature review is based on few available sources, it provides insightful and novel concepts related to Industry 5.0 in the supply chain context. Moreover, it presents a clear set of constructs and a structured research agenda to encourage researchers in deploying further conceptual and empirical works linked to the subject herein explored. Organizations’ leadership, policymakers, and other practitioners involved in supply chains, and mainly those currently working with Industry 4.0 initiatives, can benefit from this research by having clear guidance regarding the dimensions needed to structurally design and implement an Industry 5.0 strategy. This article adds valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, by approaching the newest and revolutionary concept of the Industry 5.0 phenomenon in the supply chain context, which is still an unexplored theme.</jats:p>"

The specific objectives were; to determine the effect of supplier relationship management on organizational performance of Bata Shoe company, to determine the effect of customer relationship management on organizational performance of Bata Shoe company, to determine the effect of logistics on organizational performance of Bata Shoe company and to determine the effect of outsourcing on organizational performance of Bata Shoe company. For the purpose of this study, descriptive research design was used. This study primarily targeted all 90 employees of Bata Shoe Company working at the Supply chain Department. Since the sample is small the study sampled all the 90 employees. Primary data will be obtained for the study. A structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be utilized. Descriptive statistics involved percentages, means and standard deviation. Inferential statistics such as correlation and regression were used. The study found that supplier relationship management, customer relationship management, logistics, outsourcing have a positive and significant effect on organizational performance. Management of Bata Shoe Company should embrace effective supplier relationship management strategies in order to support efficient supply chain management. In addition, Bata Shoe Company should adopt the logistic practices. This is because findings show a positive association between logistic practices and organizational performance. Bata Shoe Company and other organization are also advised to adopt the outsourcing practices that are currently adopted at a very small extent because they can significantly improve organization performance from the current position.</jats:p>"

This paper presents an analytical framework to improve the structure of the objective function by comparing six various forms of single-objective and bi-objective problems. Problems 1 and 2 were defined to compare two perspectives of operation, water supply versus energy generation. Problem 3 was also designed to examine the effect of the intra-annual electricity demand, which was ignored in problem 2. Comparison of problems 4 and 5 shows the simultaneous effect of realistic water and electricity demand scenarios on finding an optimal Pareto front. Problem 6 considers a supply policy in which maximum hydropower generation in peak months is the main strategy to reduce socioeconomic tensions. These problems were analyzed for a period of 72 months in the operation of the Dez reservoir in the southwest of Iran. The results of comparisons showed that the average annual water supply in problem 1 is 334 Mm3 higher than in problem 2, while the mean annual hydropower generation in problem 2 compared with problem 1 increases by 58.9 GWh. Hydropower generation in problem 2 compared with problem 3 experiences a 31.8% decrease in the peak period and a 111% increase in the non-peak months, which can impose significant problems on the National Electricity Network. The Pareto front for problem 5 is better than for problem 4 at all points, meaning that the demand coefficient improves the Pareto front. The solutions of problem 6 can result in efficient meeting of water and electricity demand in critical periods and greatly improve practical planning.</jats:p>",

The chapter then illustrates some market trends that are increasing the complexity of supply chain management in luxury, followed by a brief discussion on how brands are reacting.</p>",

After the dynamic analysis of the proposed model, numerical simulation is performed, and a supply chain risk control strategy is proposed according to the simulation results. The research shows that the enterprise's complete recovery rate and risk infection rate have a greater impact on the risk propagation in the supply chain network. Enterprises should increase their awareness of risk management and control, improve their complete recovery rate, and reduce their risk of infection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s competitive business world, it is extremely important for decision makers to have access to decision support tools in order to make quick, right and accurate decisions. One of these decision-making areas is supplier or service provider selection. Supplier selection is a multi – criteria decision making process that deals with the optimization of conflicting objectives such as quality, services, cost, and delivery time. Although numbers of multiple criteria decisions making (MCDM) methods are available for solving MCDM problem, it’s observed that in most of these methods the ranking results are very sensitive. This work proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based framework that is used to evaluate supplier selection by using an entropy weight method (EWM) for calculation of weightage of each criterion, once the weightage is calculated the EWM is combined with Proximity Indexed Value (PIV) Method for calculating the supplier rank. Finally, the ranking performance of PIV method is compared with other MCDM Methods for same set of alternative and criterions. A numerical example along with graphical illustrations is considered and comparison analysis is provided to test the feasibility of the proposed method. In the illustrative example a manufacturing firm is looking for select most suitable supplier for supply among the ten-supplier based on four different criteria such as Price/Cost, Service, Quality and Delivery, in which Price/Cost is non-beneficial and the attributes pertaining to other criteria are beneficial one.</jats:p>"

The research made use of a 63-year long data series on the amount of rainfall available in the study area, an analysis of rainwater quality and an estimate of the population's monthly water demand in relation to the monthly harvestable rainwater supply. Rainwater supply for the months of September, October and November is 53.05 m3 which is considerably greater than the households' water demand of 25.56 m3 during the long dry season. This led to the design of a 27 m3 ferrocement tank as minimum storage requirement. Furthermore, a rainwater quality analysis showed that all tested parameters conform to water quality standards except for microbiological quality. The rainwater needs to be disinfected before consumption as potable water. Finally, cost estimates for installing RWH systems for low ($419), medium ($549) and high standard ($668) habitations were calculated. RWH can effectively serve as a water supply supplement in the Mvog-Betsi neighbourhood.</jats:p>",

Yet the literature on the impact and outcomes of violations of trust in buyer–supplier relationships is underdeveloped. In this study, we report the results from three complementary scenario‐based experiments that evaluate the impact of a supplier‐induced violation on a buyer's trust in that supplier. We establish a spillover effect of supplier integrity violations onto the buyer's competence dimension of trust, and of supplier competence violations onto the buyer's integrity dimension of trust. We also examine the role of inter‐organizational governance, finding that contractual and relational governance are differentially effective at mitigating trust damages experienced by a buyer after a supplier violation. Specifically, we observe that relational governance helps mitigate damages to buyer's trust following a supplier competence violation, whereas some evidence suggests that contractual governance serves to preserve buyer's trust following a supplier integrity violation. These findings have important theoretical and managerial implications for the management of buyer–supplier relationships. We discuss why the governance structures adopted by firms involved in a buyer–supplier relationship have distinct impacts on trust assessments following a violation.</jats:p>",

This Working Paper considers diverse commodity chains (leather, waste, recycling and sex) to explore the business realities that generate child labour in its worst forms. A review of the literature finds that occurrence of the worst forms of child labour (WFCL) in supply chain systems is contingent on the organising logics and strategies adopted by actors in both the formal and informal economies. Piecing together the available evidence, the paper hypothesises that a supply chain system is sensitive to the use of WFCL when downward pressure to take on business risk cannot be matched by the economic resilience to absorb that risk. Emergencies and persistent stressors may increase risk and reduce resilience, shifting norms and behaviour. There is a need for further work to learn from business owners and workers in the informal economy.</jats:p>"

Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical evidence on the impact of blockchain technologies (BT) on the SSCP. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to assess the relationship between BT and SSCP. More specifically, the study was conducted to examine the direct influence of BT on SCI and SSCP and the interactive effect of BT and SCI on SSCP. Based on the dynamic capability theoretical lens, the present study conceptualizes the use of BT as a specific IT resource to collaborate and reconfigure the ties with the upstream and downstream supply chain members to achieve SSCP. The results of the study support the hypothesis stating that BT positively influences the SSCP. The results recognize the role of SCI as a significant mediating variable between the BT and SSCP. The result indicates the strong influence of SCI with full mediation effect on the relationship between the BT and SSCP.\n</jats:p>",

Prior studies have focused on the ambidexterity dilemma and the need to adopt sustainable inter-organizational governance to drive I4.0 capabilities while achieving sustainable performance. To address these issues, this paper aims to explore the distinct and combined effects of several approaches such as digital business transformation (DBT), organizational ambidexterity (OA) and circular business models (CBMs) on the relationship between I4.0 capabilities and sustainable performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Drawing upon a hybrid methodology including structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, this paper develops and tests a hypothetical model using data collected from 306 organizations in Europe, Asia and Africa.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study findings lead to several important implications concerning the potential paths linking I4.0 and sustainable performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite increasing business interest in sustainability in general and in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), the ability to increase suppliers’ ecological and social performance is generally insufficient for many companies. In this study, we outline an implementation process model for sustainable supply chain management. We do so by synthesizing insights from a review of the sustainable supply chain management and organizational learning literature and a case study with a company aspiring to become a global leader in sustainable lighting. By combining these insights, we find that successful implementation of sustainable supply chain management requires sustainability to be anchored in a company’s vision and integrated into all functions. We also argue that organizational learning, especially learning with external stakeholders such as suppliers, an operational definition of socioecological sustainability among stakeholders, and procedural support for the cocreation of strategic plans for change are vital for achieving a truly sustainable supply chain. This definition and cocreation allow for attention to be directed toward strategic ecological and social practices, along with the joint handling of tradeoffs and economic considerations among stakeholders. As we build a foundation for an SSCM implementation process model, we use a science-based framework for strategic sustainable development. We call for more action-based research to uncover the complex nature of sustainable supply chain management, as there are unique challenges and dynamic relationships in every supply chain.</jats:p>"

Protecting and controlling the quality of the product in the food supply chain processes while minimizing the cost is a difficult and critical problem in the food industry. In this study, an application of a model that integrates the quality of the food in decision-making on distribution and production in a food supply chain is implemented using real-life data in Turkey. The degradation of quality of products in storage or transportation is usually based on the storage temperature, storage time, and other constants such as activation energy. Therefore, prediction for the quality of food products is a complex task because of the dynamics of storage conditions and various product characteristics. A methodological approach is proposed to model the degradation of food quality in this study. The rate of quality degradation of food products is evaluated by the proposed approach. A mixed-integer programming model is developed for the optimization of distribution and production planning. To solve the problem, GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) CPLEX solver is used as an optimization tool. The results of the case study shows that the suggested model in this study is implementable to the problem with acceptable solution time. In addition, the suggested model is adaptable for different types of food supply chains. This study aims to develop a methodological approach that can be used as a guide for decision-makers.</jats:p>"

The proposed macro-model is developed using simplification and build-up techniques for macro-modeling of operational amplifiers and simulates the basic static and dynamic characteristics, including input impedance, small-signal frequency responses at various voltage gains, output power versus supply voltage, slew-rate-limiting, voltage limiting, output offset voltage versus supply voltage ripples, and output resistance. Furthermore, the macro-model also takes into account the ground reference voltage in the amplifier at a single power supply voltage. The model is implemented as a hierarchical structure suitable for the PSpice circuit simulation platform. The sub-circuit is built using standard PSpice components and analog behavioral modeling blocks. The accuracy of the model is verified by extracting the model parameters for single-supply power operational amplifier TDA2005 from ST Microelectronics as example. The effectiveness of the model is validated by comparing the simulation results of the electrical parameters with the corresponding measured values obtained by experimental testing of sample circuits. The comparative analysis shows that the relative error of the modeled large-signal parameters is less than 15%. Moreover, an error of 15% is quite acceptable, considering the technological tolerances of the electrical parameters for this type of analog ICs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates optimal decisions in a green supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a leading retailer considering the green marketing and fairness preferences of member firms. Four Stackelberg game decision models are constructed in which the manufacturer and the re-tailer engage in green marketing separately when the manufacturer has no and has fairness preferences. The impacts of fairness preferences and green marketing on the optimal decision in the green supply chain are comparatively analyzed. The study finds that member firms perform green marketing regardless of the presence or absence of fairness preferences and that such be-havior increases the wholesale price, retail price, and market demand of low-carbon products as well as the profits of member firms and the supply chain. A more interesting finding is that the profit growth of member firms and the supply chain due to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s green marketing is more pronounced than that due to the retailer&amp;rsquo;s green marketing. When the retailer and the manufacturer engage in conduct green marketing, the manufacturer's fairness preferences have different effects on the wholesale price, retail price, market demand, level of green marketing efforts, member enterprises and profits of supply chain. Therefore, firms should consider the impact of green marketing and fairness preferences to make pricing and performance decisions, so as to achieve efficient operation of the whole supply chain and avoid double marginal effects. Finally, the above conclusions are verified through numerical simulation, providing a reference for the decision-making of member firms in the green supply chain.</jats:p>"

The output of logistics services also encompasses the so-called negative by-products, which have been increased in past decades and stress the need for a standardized, comprehensive and quantitative performance measurement. The reduction of the negative by-production, e.g., decarbonization in the transport industry, is commonly associated with a higher degree of logistics performance using different capabilities. Research aims of the study are twofold: to show the decisive components for sustainability performance of a logistics service provider (LSP) and to outline internal capabilities of LSPs as indicators of its sustainability-oriented firm performance. In the first step, firm performance is sampled using the lenses of sustainability. For this purpose, general and transport-related sustainability frameworks are summarized to identify how they differ in sustainability dimensions in order to help LSPs contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In the second step, decisive and evidence-based capabilities as indicators of sustainability-oriented performance are outlined using mixed methods by reviewing the literature.</jats:p>"

By constructing the supply chain of manufacturers and retailers with different market positions, two game types, decentralized decision making and centralized decision making are proposed, and the static and dynamic game methods are combined respectively for research. Although research has found that centralized decision making is always better than decentralized decision making under the static game mode, when considering the long-term dynamic evolutionary game, the average profit of decentralized decision making may be better than the average profit of centralized decision making. Moreover, there are complex dynamic characteristics under dynamic games. In order to fully understand the nature of the dynamic game systems, we discussed the stability, local bifurcation, and global bifurcation of these dynamic systems. It is found that although dynamic game systems may lose stability with changes in parameters, they are better than static game results in some cases, this is beneficial to decision-makers and has practical management significance.</jats:p>"

The consumers of this industry are aware of the unpleasant consequences of GHG emissions such as global warming and climate change, so food supply chain members should consider mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions besides economic and social goals. This paper examines the impacts of the supply chain structure and cooperation methods on the goals and decisions of a sustainable food supply chain. The proposed supply chain consists of one manufacturer and two suppliers, competition, and cooperation between those studied with centralized and decentralized structures. A single-level problem is solved for the centralized supply chain in the first scenario. The decentralized structure is then considered for the other four scenarios, and bi-level programming is used to model competition and cooperation between the members. Computational results demonstrate that the maximum total profit of the supply chain among all the decentralized scenarios is obtained with the alliance of the manufacturer and the first supplier. It is found economical to increase the budget in the scenarios where the supply chain members competed with each other. Moreover, increasing production capacity and budget reduce GHG emissions for the supply chain members forming coalitions.</jats:p>"

Three main utilizations of water are for livelihood, agriculture, and industry. Three properties of water are quantity, quality, and water right. Three control factors are sufficient for quantity, stable for quality, and fair for distribution. In the seriously global climate change, the conjunction uses for surface water and groundwater will be the long-term strategy, while the compensation for transferring the water volumes from agriculture to industry is a short-term purpose. In this article, the water supply-demand of Taiwan from 2010 to 2019 will be discussed and the example of 2016, a significant period, are given. Here, the calculation of compensation fee for transferring the water volumes from agricultural purpose to industrial utilization is also presented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world is facing economic, as well as social, crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing sustainable practices is one of the possible ways to address these issues. Adopting circular oriented techniques throughout the supply chain not only guarantees economic profitability, but also provides an edge to the organization in the market of fierce global competition. The concept of implementing circularity in the supply chain is novel and dynamic in nature, and it involves certain risk. In this study, a Bayesian Network methodology is adopted to analyze how the risk propagation takes place in a circular supply chain network of an automobile organization. The circular supply chain network consists of a group of manufacturers, retailers and recyclers, located in the Delhi–NCR region. Economic, environmental, social, technological, waste management, agile vulnerability, and risk of cannibalization are the major risk categories that were identified through an extensive literature review. Further, the impact of risk on the performance of the circular supply chain is analyzed by considering performance parameters such as lost sales, impact on supply chain revenue, and inventory holding cost. Risk exposure index is incorporated into the study to analyze the vulnerability of each node. The findings of the study reveal that the reverse side of the circular supply chain can be a source of risk propagation during the implementation of the circularity concept. This work is carried out under a single industry domain. In the future, risk propagation analysis can be examined in the supply chain of other sectors. The findings of the study can assist the supply chain managers and the risk experts to focus on the areas that are more vulnerable to risk.</jats:p>"

In addition, this article conducts coupling analysis on the characteristics of blockchain technology, such as intelligent contract, information sharing, traceability, and performance improvement requirements. The author embeds the alliance chain in the fresh food e-commerce supply chain and designs the blockchain information platform model from four levels: application layer, contract layer, network layer, and data layer, with the purpose of optimizing and improving the performance of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain. What is more, the Stackelberg game model between the supplier and the e-commerce platform was constructed to study and compare the profit changes of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain before and after the application of the blockchain information platform. Finally, the result of Stackelberg game is numerically simulated by Matlab software. The results show that blockchain technology is a booster for the development of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain to a higher stage of the whole industry chain management, coordination, and integration. Investing in the blockchain system within a certain budget range can not only improve the reliability of products, but also improve the performance of each main component of the fresh food e-commerce supply chain, as well as the overall performance. Results can offer a theoretical guidance for producer and retailer in investing in BIP, pricing decision, and supply chain coordination after applying BIP.</jats:p>",

Different technologies are available to enable waste heat recovery, which can enhance system energy efficiency and reduce total energy consumption. Power plants are energy-intensive plants with low-grade waste heat. In the case of such plants, recovery of low-grade waste heat is gaining considerable interest. However, in such plants, power generation often varies based on market demand. Such variations may adversely influence any recovery system's performance and the economy, including the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). ORC technologies coupled with Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES) may be used for power generation by utilizing the waste heat from such power plants. The heat of compression in a CES may be stored in thermal energy storage systems and utilized in ORC or Regenerative ORC (RORC) for power generation during the system's discharge cycle. This may compensate for the variation of the waste heat from the power plant, and thereby, the ORC system may always work under-designed capacity. This paper presents the thermo-economic analysis of such an ORC system. In the analysis, a steady-state simulation of the ORC system has been developed in a commercial process simulator after validating the results with experimental data for a typical coke-oven plant. Forty-nine different working fluids were evaluated for power generation parameters, first law efficiencies, purchase equipment cost, and fixed investment payback period to identify the best working fluid.</jats:p>"

It affects their customer service level, therefore, it is crucial to manage the scheduling of the financial data supply chain to elevate the efficiency of banking sectors’ performance. The primary tool used in the data supply chain is data batch processing which requires efficient scheduling. This work investigates the problem of scheduling the processing of tasks with non-identical sizes and different priorities on a set of parallel processors. An iterative dynamic scheduling algorithm (DCSDBP) was developed to address the data batching process. The objective is to minimize different cost types while satisfying constraints such as resources availability, customer service level, and tasks dependency relation. The algorithm proved its effectiveness by allocating tasks with higher priority and weight while taking into consideration customers’ Service Level Agreement, time, and different types of costs, which led to a lower total cost of the batching process. The developed algorithm proved effective by testing it on an illustrative network. Also, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the model parameters for networks with different sizes and complexities to study their impact on the total cost and the problem under study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that food supply chains are the most critical component of economic and human activities. It has also created a lot of interest among researchers, practitioners and policymakers to study the significant challenges of the food supply chain caused by the pandemic. Therefore this work wanted to investigate the critical supply chain challenges due to Covid-19 with the help of a systematic literature review of well-established articles published in interdisciplinary journals. The selection of thirty one papers was made through a research protocol that helped select and identify research papers which were coded with the help of qualitative software Atlasti 9.0 to study which supply chain challenge amongst disruption, forecasting and inventory was most prominently studied in the literature. Results of software coding revealed that disruption was coded 170 times whereas forecasting 10 times and inventory 37 times as challenges of food Supply Chain Management (SCM). Therefore, it was concluded that most of the researchers considered disruption as one of the significant food supply chain challenges. Further coding also revealed that lockdown and labour related issues were the primary reasons for food supply chain disruption.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the letter of credit’s efficiency has reduced over time as a result of its processing costs and speed. The space created by the decline of the letter of credit has been filled by trade parties turning to open account and prepayment terms, whilst using Supply Chain Financing (‘SCF’) techniques to provide the requisite liquidity. The advantages of such payment terms are principally their speed, convenience and cost, all of which the letter of credit increasingly lacks. Accordingly, it is unlikely that this trend towards SCF techniques will abate any time soon. Nevertheless, there are still legal difficulties associated with such payment and liquidity-enhancing techniques, as well as uncertainty associated with the regulatory and accounting treatment of these devices. If open-account trading and SCF techniques are going to eclipse the letter of credit as a payment mechanism, these challenges will have to be addressed.</jats:p>",

In our model, the green supply chain consists of one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer acts as a leader, which decides the variables: production quantity, wholesale price and green-level; the retailer acts as a follower, decides on the retail price. Centralized and decentralized optimal solutions are obtained to optimize the manufacturer's production, stocking and green-level decision while anticipating the retailer's price optimization decision. Through research, it is found that the stocking factor decreases with the increasing price elasticity and is not affected by the green-level elasticity; Lower price elasticity will increase the optimal selling price of the green product, while green-level elasticity has no effect on the price; Larger price elasticity or green-level elasticity will increase the optimal green-level of the green product; Lower price elasticity or higher green-level elasticity will increase the overall profitability of the supply chain; Profit sharing between manufacturer and retailer under the decentralized model only depends on price elasticity and green-level elasticity; The greater price elasticity, the more beneficial to the retailer, the greater the green-level, the more beneficial to the manufacturer.</jats:p>"

The paper has not been peer reviewed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Electricity systems around the world are changing, with the Paris Agreement of 2015 a catalyst for much current change. The Australian government ratified the agreement by committing to 26–28% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030. Reduction in emissions from electricity generation has become the focus of these targets. To decarbonize the grid to meet targets while building firm, dispatchable generation capacity to support the system, a new metric is required to measure success.

The NEM commenced operation in December 1998 and includes five regional market jurisdictions: Queensland, New South Wales (including the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. In 2020, the NEM incorporated approximately 40,000 km of transmission lines and cables, connecting approximately 57 GW of generation capacity to consumers.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This thermal generation mostly has consisted of coal- and gas-based technologies. Electricity grids are also changing from largely centralized electricity generation systems to more decentralized ones and from unidirectional electricity flows to bidirectional flows as part of the effort to reduce emissions. However, with increasing penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation, it is important to plan for and manage generation-asset investment to track the lowest possible total system cost and highest reliability path to a low-emissions future.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>A Competent, Diverse Grid</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A competent electricity grid is one that can keep the lights on, so to speak, within the legislated tolerance for outages and performance. A competent grid is adequate, reliable, secure, operable, and robust against externally driven disruptions.

However, metrics such as LCOE, based on grid-independent formulae to help power plant investors to maximize returns, are inappropriate for comparing technologies that deliver and demand a complex menu of services specific to the grid. A different metric is required to evaluate each technology’s contribution to the grid.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The work aimed to summarise methods of weather risk management and propose indices that will help to protect the interests of the water supply and sewerage industry in Poland. Three indices were proposed: a daily precipitation index, frost day index, and hot day index. The frequency of reaching these indices in Poland was verified with the use of meteorological data from 1970–2019, for 19 locations. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the climate change impact on the exceedance frequency of the proposed indicators. The results showed that the indexes were exceeded in the past once every 6 years, on average. The hot day index was exceeded the least often, but it was the only one with a clear (growing) trend observed.</jats:p>"

Many countries globally have an approved beta glucan health claim related to lowering blood cholesterol, an important biomarker for cardiovascular disease. However, the use of these claims has not been examined. The aim of this study was to explore the range and variety of oat and barley products in the Australian and global market within a defined range of grain food and beverage categories and examine the frequency of beta glucan health claims. Australian data were collected via a recognised nutrition audit process from the four major Australian supermarkets in metropolitan Sydney (January 2018 and September 2020) and Mintel Global New Product Database was used for global markets where a claim is permitted. Categories included breakfast cereals, bread, savoury biscuits, grain-based muesli bars, flour, noodles/pasta and plant-based milk alternatives and information collected included ingredients lists and nutrition and health claims. Products from Australia (n = 2462) and globally (n = 44,894) were examined. In Australia, 37 products (1.5%) made use of the beta glucan claim (84% related to oat beta glucan and 16% related to barley beta glucan, specifically BARLEYmax®). Of products launched globally, 0.9% (n = 403) displayed beta glucan cholesterol-lowering claims. Despite the number of products potentially eligible to make beta glucan claims, their use in Australia and globally is limited. The value of dietary modification in cardiovascular disease treatment and disease progression deserves greater focus, and health claims are an opportunity to assist in communicating the role of food in the management of health and disease. Further assessment of consumer understanding of the available claims would be of value.</jats:p>"

Traditional materials, such as Ni/YSZ anodes, YSZ electrolytes and perovskite cathodes have been utilized in a basic cell structure. Research and development focus has been placed on developing better electrochemical functional areas at both cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte interfaces.

The full height stack consists of 350 repeat units and a set of non-repeat parts. A repeat unit includes one ceramic cell, inner and outer seals, and a metallic interconnect which incorporates flow fields for both fuel and oxidant. Non-repeat parts include the end plates, manifolds, and compression components. The stack is capable of producing 7kW power when fueled with natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, or other fuels.

An attractive pathway to deployment of SOFC systems is through near-term market opportunities in natural gas fueled distributed generation (DG) applications. FCE is planning to take the advantage of the scalability, modularity, and fuel flexibility of the SOFC technology to transition the technology from small (sub-MW) systems to megawatt class power plants for distributed generation, and ultimately (through aggregation of fuel cell modules) to large stationary power plants for base-load utility applications using coal and/or natural gas fuel.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>FCE has recently designed, fabricated, and tested a 200kW natural gas fueled packaged system.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In thermal power plants, during the boilers functioning, heterogeneous deposits of substances must often be removed in order to prolong their operation and avoid their deterioration. The nature, type and quantity of deposits depend on the characteristics of the water supply systems and the chemical operating regime. For boilers with high deposits of copper and iron, the utilization of mineral acids for chemical cleaning is not quite effective, because their surfaces may be covered with a metal copper film. Organic impurities in the water supply affect the operation of steam generators, increasing electrical conductivity and lowering the pH. The heterogeneous composition of the deposits is unevenly distributed in the combustion system, making its cleaning a complex problem. For efficient chemical cleaning, the agents must have a minimal corrosive action on the metal surfaces, ensuring only the dissolution of the compounds on the surface of the boilers. To prevent corrosion of metals, inhibitors are introduced to diminish the reactions on the metal surface or at least to delay the kinetics of the reaction. This paper analyzes the implications of organic pollutants in the corrosion phenomena and chemical processes where they are involved. As an example, the power plant Borzesti affiliated to the Petrochemical Platform, Bacau County, Romania is presented. The adopted solution uses as an inhibitor, a synthesis between amino alcohol and a thiazole, in the presence of water. This inhibitor has been tested in the laboratory on different steels used in energy pipes, in different areas of the thermal circuits in the boiler, as pure steel or with different alloys. The methods used to reduce the effects of corrosion are briefly presented. Four classes of organic substances with properties of corrosion inhibitors in the organic acid environment were analyzed. The experimental results obtained, associated with a comparative analysis of corrosion rates, for different concentrations of inhibitors for a time interval of 4 hours are mentioned. In the second stage, the inhibitor behavior was analyzed for 6h and 8h. Corrosion rates are estimated by measuring the weight loss of the tested probes. Finally, the most suitable types of inhibitors, adapted at different metal compositions are presented, with a result in the cleaning of more than 98% of the surface of the boilers.</jats:p>",

Existe poca investigación práctica en el área, a pesar de que la necesidad de medidas de desempeño para asegurar la colaboración de la CS ha sido ampliamente reconocida en la literatura pertinente.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nEsta investigación tiene como objetivo desarrollar redes hipotéticas de cadenas de suministro para identificar y resolver diferentes dilemas que surgen cuando los miembros de la misma colaboran. También busca desarrollar un marco conceptual de uso de teoría de las restricciones (TOC) y las nubes de evaporación para lograr que los miembros de la CS reconozcan que hay muchos beneficios al involucrarse en una colaboración en la cadena de suministros. Teniendo en cuenta a Holt y Button (2000) y Gupta y Andersen (2018), en este artículo se exploran una serie de conflictos que varían desde conflictos muy genéricos que ocurren en cada red de CS hasta otros más específicos. Estos incluyen pronóstico, precios, entrega, riesgo e intercambio de información. Primero, se aplicó uno de los procesos de pensamiento de TOC, evaporación de las nubes, para comprender el lado del miembro de la cadena de suministro (CS). Esta herramienta permitió una comunicación efectiva al persuadir a los participantes de la CS de que la administración de la misma requiere entender las necesidades y deseos de todos sus participantes. En segundo lugar, se modeló la evaporación de las nubes como una herramienta para convencer a los miembros inmediatos de la CS de que la solución al conflicto central de colaboración de la cadena de suministro llega en forma de medidas Rendimiento Dolar-Dia (TDD) e Inventario Dolar-Dia (IDD). </jats:p>"

In this study, parameters affecting water consumption were examined within the scope of the study area, and the parameter reduction was realized with the help of Factor Analysis. Then, as a new method, the Band Similarity method was used together with the Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm, urban water demand models were produced and the temporal dependence of the relevant variables was examined. As a result of the study, it was seen that the Band Similarity method improved the results obtained with the optimization algorithm and helped to understand the temporal dependencies of the variables. The fact that the Band Similarity method, which was put forward for the first time in its field, worked successfully and produced results, can be said to be the main contribution of this study to existing knowledge.</jats:p>",

Cold Chain involvement has been a huge contribution to the dairy sector as it has helped the sector to flourish more as well as to unfold to its maximum potential.  Cold chain statistics provides the information to know about the present status of cold chain in the nation. Cold chain in the country is still under development and hasn’t been used to its utmost advantages and uses which will be explored in the forthcoming years.  The reason or challenges encountered by the cold chain while its practice are the major drawback for the lack of cold chain application in the country which also have been tapped upon in the study. The present scenario of the dairy sector with the application of cold chain helped to minimise the losses of the dairy sector by a huge margin.  The application of cold chain in dairy sector is practised in the storage and transportation of milk and its value based products hence government also provides schemes and initiatives for the usage of cold chain supply s it ensures zero wastage, affordable product, accessible product, healthy and nutritious products. The cold chain supply has essential steps of storage and transportation which have been explained in the study through the considerations of the appropriate design of cold storage based upon the product to be stored. There are various types of cold storage which must be taken into consideration while designing of cold storage. The cold chain supply of milk and its value added products varies from product to product and it must be ensured for preservation of quality and its shelf life throughout the cold chain supply by inhibiting the product from microbial attack hence the maintenance of the ambient temperature is absolutely necessary throughout the cold chain which is done by various practices in the dairy sector as mentioned in the study. The study in brief provides with the overview of the cold chain supply in dairy industry along with its challenges, applications, present scenario, statistics and assessment of the dairy sector for milk and its value added products from farm to consumers ensuring that there is no breakage of the cold chain until the product reaches the consumers.</jats:p>"

Three independent objective functions are thus simultaneously satisfied. The procedure involves four main tools: the multi-objective particle swarm optimization method (MOPSO) to find Pareto solutions in one run, the K-means clustering algorithm to reduce the size of the obtained non-dominated solutions, the pseudo-weight vector approach (PWV) to facilitate the decision making and to select some adequate solutions, and finally, CFD simulations to analyze the retained optimal solutions. The suitability of the proposed procedure is tested through an example of application. As results, a set of 20 solutions with different satisfaction levels is found and compared to existing solutions. A multi-objective optimization problem may have many different solutions; the originality of the present work lies in the proposed procedure, which explores several possible solutions and reduces their number to give help to the decision making. Furthermore, an approximate expression of spillway total cost is also derived as a function of flow energy dissipation rate.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we highlight the requirements and challenges of supply chain transparency. We then investigate a set of supply chain projects that tackle data transparency issues by utilizing Blockchain in their core platform in different manners. Furthermore, we analyze the projects’ techniques and the tools utilized to customize transparency.

Based on the advantages that complementary ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMD) can effectively overcome modal aliasing, white noise interference, and the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to handle problems such as gradient disappearance. A CEEMD–LSTM coupled long-term and short-term memory network model was developed and adopted for monthly precipitation prediction of Zhengzhou City. The performance shows that the CEEMD–LSTM model has a mean absolute error of 0.056, a root mean square error of 0.153, a mean relative error of 2.73% and a Nash efficiency coefficient of 0.95, which is better than the CEEMD–Back Propagation (BP) neural network model, the LSTM model and the BP model in terms of prediction accuracies.

The results show that the two-stage section channel with ice cover can effectively reduce the flow velocity in the channel and increase the retention time of water in the channel. By comparing with the experimental data, the accuracy of the analytical solution is high, which provides a theoretical reference for the transport of sediment and pollutions in a two-stage section channel with ice cover in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the new challenges arising from the transition of the energy industry to the path of intelligent development is to assess the effect of distributed generation (DG) on the prospects for the development of regional energy supply systems. Such an assessment requires that the factors characterized by high uncertainty be taken into account. In this case, it is expedient to employ a combination of the optimization method with the Monte Carlo method. Such an approach has already been adopted in a model (computer program) developed at the Melentiev Energy Systems Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This model is designed to determine the rational mix of new power plants (with investment risks assessed and factored in) and the likely cost of electricity generation in a given aggregated region. We propose using this model as a source of projected data for an approximate assessment of the DG expansion, given the projected conditions for the energy sector and electric power industry development. It may also provide the basis for an array of research tools for relevant studies. The new toolkit requires a more detailed representation of the administrative division and the inclusion of consumers with their sources of electric power generation in the generating capacity. Although such an estimate is approximate, it can give an overall idea of the extent to which the cost and demand for electricity may vary under different options for the DG expansion in a region.</jats:p>"

To reverse this tendency, it is essential to optimise the replacement plans of pipes. For this reason, companies demand pioneering techniques to predict which pipes are more prone to fail. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is designed to classify pipes according to their predisposition to fail based on physical and operational input variables. In addition, the usefulness and effectiveness of two sampling methods, under-sampling and over-sampling, are analysed. The implementation of the model is done using the open-source software Weka, which is specialised in machine-learning algorithms. The system is tested with a database from a real water network in Spain, obtaining high-accurate results. It is verified that the balance of the training set is imperative to increase the predictions’ accurateness. Furthermore, under-sampling prioritises true positive rates, whereas over-sampling makes the system learn to predict failures and non-failures with the same precision.</jats:p>"

Every player in a food supply chain must be able to create an internal and external traceability so that the chain traceability can be formed. However, building a suitable food traceability system is not an easy task. The development of a food traceability system has been identified as a complex problem due to the difficulty of accommodating the varied characteristics of each stage in the food supply chain and the interdependence between stages in the food supply chain. Therefore, to solve these complex problems a multimethodology approach is proposed. The multimethodology approach is believed to be able to solve complex multidimensional problems. This article describes a framework for multimethodology in the development of a food traceability system that involves the integration of the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Interpretive Structural Modeling (DEMATEL-ISM) and System Dynamics (SD). The vegetable oil industry which manages its products in bulk is an interesting case study for the development of a food traceability system because the upstream is in the commodity focused chain and the downstream is in the consumer driven value chain. Ultimately, the multi-methodological framework proved effective in answering the research question of \"How to develop a suitable traceability system for the bulk vegetable oil industry?\"</jats:p>"

We found that the agricultural sector (i.e., planting fiber crops) is responsible for primary water consumption and water pollution. In addition, different provinces assume different production roles. Guangdong is a major output province in apparel manufacturing. However, its economic output is contributed to by other regions, such as blue water from Xinjiang and Jiangsu and grey water from Hebei and Shandong. Our research reveals the significance of taking an inter-regional perspective on water resource issues throughout the supply chain in apparel manufacturing. The sustainable development of China’s apparel manufacturing relies on improving water-use efficiency and reasonable industrial layout.

Through literature review and expert opinion survey, we have identified a comprehensive list of SCC barriers under four main categories, namely, information-related, communication-related, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational barriers. Then we applied the Grey DEMATEL and Fuzzy Best-Worst methods to evaluate these SCC barriers and compared the results.

In order to explore the possibility of using DIES to intensify the hydromechanical processes, the emulsification of milk fat (homogenization of milk, preparation of spreads) and, in particular, the processing of cream cheese masses, were studied. Whole non-homogenized milk, fat emulsions, and cream cheese mass were the object of investigation. To evaluate the efficiency of milk homogenization, the homogenization coefficient change was studied, which was determined by using the centrifugation method, as it is the most affordable and accurate one. To provide the proper dispersion of the milk emulsion, six treatment cycles must be carried out under the developed cavitation mode in a static-type apparatus, here resulting in a light grain-like consistency, and exhibiting the smell of pasteurized milk. The emulsions were evaluated according to the degree of destabilization, resistance and dispersion of the fat phase. On the basis of the obtained data with respect to the regularities of fat dispersion forming in the rotor-type apparatus, the proper parameters required to obtain technologically stable fat emulsion spreads, possessing a dispersion and stability similar to those of plain milk creams, were determined. It was determined that under the DIES, an active dynamic effect on the milk globules takes place. The rheological characteristics of cheese masses were evaluated on the basis of the effective change in viscosity. The effect of the mechanical treatment on the structure of the cheese masses was determined.</jats:p>"

The results showed that: the main aquatic plant communities in this area evolved from submerged to floating leaf and emergent plants, which shows that the vertical distribution pattern of the aquatic plant communities was greatly affected by hydrology; the distribution pattern of aquatic plant diversity showed a good single curve in the vertical direction and a single curve in the horizontal direction; the results of ecological restoration showed that the average removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) by mixing the three plants were 86.76% and 93.89%, respectively.

It has become clear that the impaired erythropoietin production and altered iron homeostasis are not the sole causes of renal anemia. Eryptosis is a process of red blood cells (RBC) death, like apoptosis of nucleated cells, characterized by Ca2+ influx and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure to the outer RBC membrane leaflet. Eryptosis can be induced by uremic toxins and occurs before senescence, thus shortening RBC lifespan and aggravating renal anemia. We aimed to assess eryptosis and intracellular oxygen levels of RBC from hemodialysis patients (HD-RBC) and their response to hypoxia, uremia, and uremic toxins uptake inhibition. METHODS:  Using flow cytometry, RBC from healthy individuals (CON-RBC) and HD-RBC were subjected to PS (Annexin-V), intracellular Ca2+ (Fluo-3/AM) and intracellular oxygen (Hypoxia Green) measurements, at baseline and after incubation with uremic serum and/or hypoxia (5% O2), with or without ketoprofen. Baseline levels of uremic toxins were quantified in serum and cytosol by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS:  Here, we show that HD-RBC have less intracellular oxygen and that it is further decreased post-HD. Also, incubation in 5% O2 and uremia triggered eryptosis in vitro by exposing PS. Hypoxia itself increased the PS exposure in HD-RBC and CON-RBC, and the addition of uremic serum aggravated it. Furthermore, inhibition of the organic anion transporter 2 with ketoprofen reverted eryptosis and restored the levels of intracellular oxygen. Cytosolic levels of the uremic toxins pCS and IAA were decreased after dialysis. CONCLUSION:  These findings suggest the participation of uremic toxins and hypoxia in the process of eryptosis and intracellular oxygenation.</jats:p>"

These reforms include such tings as the merger of various water authorities, the corporatization of government business enterprises, the introduction of more commercially orientated water prices, and increased use of non-surface sources of water.</jats:p>",

In the process of offshoring- outsourcing, companies and nations have become interdependent in their efforts to bridge the supply chain network. However, during a pandemic, such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) that involved the closure of borders, and during which there was a high demand of lifesaving machines and personal protective equipment, many countries were left scrambling for critical medical products such as ventilators and personal protective equipment for doctors. Hence, the tendency away from offshoring and outsourcing to onshoring production. COVID-19 has elicited that countries need to invest in an onshore business if they are to remain afloat. However, investing in onshore (local) business calls for a tradeoff, which some countries cannot afford. Many countries lack skilled labour (developing countries), and where available, it is too expensive (developed countries) making onshore an expensive venture. Besides, promoting manufacturing companies means increased air pollution and greenhouse gases that are responsible for 4.2–7.0 million premature deaths every year, and which costs $4.6 trillion per year. Such death rates and cost can hinder the onshore business. Therefore, for countries to survive in the era of a pandemic, the best alternative is to build strong ties with offshore-outsource nations.</jats:p>"

It specifically profiled actors in the cashew supply chain by socioeconomic indicators, identified the risks associated with the cashew supply chain, ascertain the severity of the supply chain risks, and assessed the strategies employed by the actors to mitigate the effects of the risks. Multistage random sampling technique was used to select one hundred cashew nut farmers, twenty each of major buyers, warehouse owners and processors. Primary data used for the study was obtained using questionnaire design and interview schedule. Data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics.. More males were involved in the cashew supply chain than their female counterpart. The mean age was 37 years, 39 years, 40 years and 37 years for farmers, major buyers, warehouse owners, and processors respectively. Production and climate related risks were more recorded among the cashew nut farmers and processors. Financial related risks is a major source of risk among actors whose activities are marketing related, while government policy or institutional related risks was recorded across all actors in the cashew supply chain. Furthermore, 95% and 65% of farmers and processors respectively, in the cashew supply chain agreed to the severity of production related risks in their activities, while 85%, 80%, 75% and 70% of farmers, major buyers, warehouse owners and processors respectively, agreed to the severity of financial related risks. Climate related risk were more severe among the farmers (75%) while the severity of institutional related risk were more among major buyers (85%) and warehouse owners (75%).  The various strategies employed by actors across the cashew supply chain to mitigate the effects of risks were generally preventive strategies. Based on the findings from the study, the need for cooperative formation, financial literacy training, and awareness on the need for agricultural insurance participation by farmers and other agribusiness actors were recommended.</jats:p>"

The temporal complementarity between supply and demand at the building level provides opportunities for energy exchange between prosumers and consumers towards community-level self-sufficiency. Investigating different aspects of community-level energy exchange in cyber and physical layers has received attention in recent years with the increase in renewables adoption. In this study, we have presented an in-depth investigation into the impact of energy exchange through the quantification of temporal energy deficit–surplus complementarity and its associated self-sufficiency capacities by considering the impact of variations in community infrastructure configurations, variations in household energy use patterns, and the potential for user adaptation for load flexibility. To this end, we have adopted a data-driven simulation using real-world data from a case-study neighborhood consisting of ~250 residential buildings in Austin, TX with a mix of prosumers and consumers and detailed data on decentralized DERs. By accounting for the uncertainties in energy consumption patterns across households, different levels of PV and energy storage integration, and different modalities of user adaptation, various scenarios of operations were simulated. The analysis showed that with PV integration of more than 75%, energy exchange could result in self-sufficiency for the entire community during peak generation hours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. However, there are limited opportunities for energy exchange during later times with PV-standalone systems. As a potential solution, leveraging building-level storage or user adaptation for load shedding/shifting during the 2-h low-generation timeframe (i.e., 5–7 p.m.) was shown to increase community self-sufficiency during generation hours by 17% and 5–10%, respectively, to 83% and 71–76%.</jats:p>"

There are many aspects that can cause the company to be unable to achieve customer satisfaction, some of which are caused by delays or errors in one of the company's business processes such as what happened at PT. XYZ. The company is a supplier of fasteners automotive components for domestic and international multinational companies. To overcome the possibility of recurring errors, a strategy is needed to minimize the causes of the risk of errors when a business process takes place in the main supply chain, as well as to prevent the risk of loss from recurring. The purpose of this study was to compiling risk identification by providing preventive measures to risk agents, develop a mitigation strategy for selected risk agents based on the ratio of total effectiveness, overcoming difficulty levels and which mitigation measures can reduce many risk agents with high scores.The writing method used is House of Risk, with a risk assessment consisting of 2 stages, namely House of Risk 1 and House of Risk 2. There are 9 risk prevention measures that can be used, to reduce or eliminate the emergence of risk agents obtained from literature studies and discussions with stakeholders. From the results of phase 2 house of risk mapping, 9 risk mitigation strategy designs were obtained from literature studies and discussions with stakeholders. Among them are companies need to create a product information management system, provide location markers, assign team heads for monitoring activities, update skill matrixes, provide code standardization in product code data input, map delivery times and locations, use dashboard monitoring systems, provide retraining to employees. According to the scope of work, the integration between functions within the company is improved.</jats:p>"

Regional differences in the annual water supply of the population of Ukraine per capita in terms of local and transit runoff, forecast resources and operational groundwater reserves, the size of their intake, including daily, and indicators of total water supply in the average water and low water (95 %) years. A comparison with the water supply indicators of other European countries is made. According to the indicated sources of water supply, groups of regions in which the state of water supply is critical have been identified. It is recognized as necessary when developing programs to improve water use, first of all to pay attention to areas that have not only lower indicators of total water supply, but also lower levels of operational reserves and projected groundwater resources, which should be used to meet drinking and sanitation. hygienic needs. The structure of fresh water use and pollution of water discharged together with wastewater are characterized. Particular attention is paid to the disclosure of the level of development, the dynamics of groundwater production, the structure of their use, the nature and causes of pollution. The ecological consequences and main problems caused by the natural shortage of water resources and significant regional differences in their provision, pollution of surface and groundwater and violations of the norms of their use are outlined. It is proposed, taking into account the unfavorable state of water supply in Ukraine as a whole and critical in some regions, to pay attention to the need for gradual introduction of economic methods of influence, through differentiation of prices for water supply of different quality, to water consumers and other economic entities. exploitation of water bodies, collection, preparation, transportation of water resources, which would stimulate the preservation and restoration of this valuable and unalternative natural product.\nJEL classіfіcatіon: Q25</jats:p>"

An understanding of community knowledge and perception on climate change and drinking water supply will provide strategic directions for national and county government policy, adaptation strategies and development of community-based guidelines on climate change. This study assessed community knowledge and perception on climate change and drinking water supply in Nzoia River Basin. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Three counties were randomly selected from the basin for study with Busia representing the lower catchment, Kakamega middle catchment and Trans Nzoia upper catchment. The study was carried out from May, 2017 to September, 2017. Multistage random sampling technique was used to select the 403 households administered with questionnaires. An observation checklist was used by the interviewers to collect household- and community-related information. The study results revealed that the community largely comes from low socio-economic background: only 24 % had post secondary education or higher, the majority were small scale farmers, housewives, casual workers and househelps (58 %), and only 25 % earned a monthly income above Ksh. 20,000 (equivalent to US $200). The majority of the participants 81 % had some knowledge about climate change but 19 % did not. On level of knowledge about climate change, 70% know a little/something about climate change, 21% know nothing about climate change and 9% know a lot about climate change. Majority of respondents, 76% receive climate change news from mass media (radio, newspaper and magazines, television); and 81 % point out that climate change will have public health risks in the community. The knowledge level about climate change in the basin was average. National and county governments should work with the sector stakeholders in the basin to improve community knowledge and perception regarding climate change, drinking water supply and health needs with proper content. The results of this study will go a long way in bridging the gap between policy formulation and building adaptive capacity to climate change in the basin.</jats:p>"

Primary data was collected through questionnaire. A pilot study was conducted to measure the research instruments reliability and validity. Descriptive and inferential analysis was conducted to analyze the data while multiple and simple regression analysis were used to measure firms’ performance as influenced by supply chain automation. The data was presented using tables, graphs and charts. The study findings of supervision and control and relationship management have positive and significant association with firm performance. It was established that supervision and control and performance of financial intermediaries were positively and significantly related (r=0.221, p=0.000). Based on the findings the study concluded that supervision and control processes influenced the performance of financial market intermediaries in Kenya. This can be explained by the regression results which showed that the influence was positive and also showed the magnitude by which supervision and control processes influenced the performance of financial market intermediaries. The study recommended that supervision and control systems of the financial intermediaries should be fully automated.

This paper provides an integrated approach for assessing the impact of different operational constraints on distribution network reliability by incorporating component lifetime models, time-varying component failure rates as well as the monetary cost of customer interruptions in an all-inclusive probabilistic methodology that applies a time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation. A test distribution network based on the Roy Billinton test system is modelled to investigate the system performance when overloading limits are exceeded as well as when preventive maintenance is performed. Standard reliability indices measuring the frequency and duration of interruptions, and the energy not supplied are complemented with a novel monetary reliability index. The comprehensive assessment includes not only average indices but also their probability distributions to adequately describe the risk of customer interruptions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this holistic approach as the impacts of operational decisions are assessed from both reliability and monetary perspectives. This informs network planning decisions through optimum investments and consideration of customer outage costs.</jats:p>"

It is considered a tremendous boost to company digitalization; thus, considerable investments in blockchain are being made. However, there is no single blockchain technology, but various solutions exist, and they cannot interoperate with one each other. The ecosystem envisioned by the Industry 4.0 does not have centralized management or leading organization, so a single blockchain solution cannot be imposed. The various organizations hold their own blockchains, which must interoperate seamlessly. Despite some solutions for blockchain interoperability being proposed, the problem is still open. This paper aims to devise a secure solution for blockchain interoperability. The proposed approach consists of a relay scheme based on Trusted Execution Environment to provide higher security guarantees than the current literature. In particular, the proposed solution adopts an off-chain secure computation element invoked by a smart contract on a blockchain to securely communicate with its peered counterpart. A prototype has been implemented and used for the performance assessment, e.g., to measure the latency increase due to cross-blockchain interactions. The achieved and reported experimental results show that the proposed security solution introduces an additional latency that is entirely tolerable for transactions. At the same time, the usage of the Trusted Execution Environment imposes a negligible overhead.</jats:p>"

The paper makes an attempt to contribute to the discussion on the role of money supply as an instrument of monetary policy in achieving the economic growth.\nMethods. The study uses a new mathematical tool that takes into account the direct control effect of the instrument of monetary policy on the achievement of the target economic indicator.\nResults. I suggest three management scenarios in the impact of money supply on GDP: a change in the money supply with violations of the response to management in certain periods that determined the growth of GDP; the lack of response to control action; and a transition scenario, when a short-term positive impact is recorded from time to time, which, in fact, is close to the second scenario.\nConclusions. The first scenario includes Russia, the United States and Brazil, in which the instrument of monetary policy (the money supply) determined the growth of GDP with individual periods of disruption of management; the second scenario includes Germany, Denmark, and Japan, with no response to the management impact; the third scenario is observed in China, Norway, and India. This conclusion enables to identify the specifics of the impact of the set of monetary policy instruments on economic growth, considering the J. Tinbergen’s theory of economic policy.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the water balance intensities and elucidate the promoting factors and offset factors of water balance intensities for each country worldwide, focusing on food supply-demand balances and considering food trade balances on a global scale. The modified Laspeyres index method is applied to both a production-based water balance index (WBIPB) and a consumption-based water balance index (WBICB). The major promoting factor for the WBIPB is the renewable freshwater resources, whereas the major offset factor is the produced item preference. The major promoting factor for the WBICB is the consumed item preference, whereas the major offset factor is the producing area preference. Improving irrigation efficiencies of rice and cereals is effective because rice requires the largest blue water footprint intensities, considering irrigation efficiency on a calorie content basis in all of the items, whereas cereals are the largest share of calorie-based production quantities in all of the items worldwide.

An access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally becomes the principal source of hope. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines is not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced difficult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against concerns over their efficacy and safety. Our aim was to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues.\nMethods\nWe searched opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages. We provided data of the debate within three countries, drawn from social media postings and other sources. The opinion data was not restricted by source and time. This allowed to collect a wide range of possible opinions that could be expressed regarding COVID-19 vaccine supply and public’s participation in vaccine trials. We recognized ethical issues and possible questions concerning different ethical frameworks. We also considered additional information or scientific data, in the process of reasoning.\nResults\nAs a result, public views on their respective government policies on COVID-19 vaccine supply ranged from strongly negative to slightly positive. We extracted most important issues from public debates, for our analysis. The first issue involved trade-offs between quantity, speed, price, freedom, efficacy and safety in the vaccines. The second set of issues arouse in connection with the request to site a randomized trial in one of countries (Uzbekistan). After considering additional evidences, we weighed individual with public risks and benefits to make specific judgements concerning every issue.\nConclusions\nWe believe that our analysis would be a helpful example of solving ethical issues that can rise concerning COVID-19 vaccine supply round the world. The public view can be highly critical, helping to spot such issues. An ignoring this view can lead to major problems, which in turn, can become a serious obstacle for the vaccine coverage and epidemics’ control in the countries and regions.</jats:p>"

From this point on, defining a concept of this subject represents an issue that demands an interpretative effort, since several factors and theoretical approaches influence this category. The objective of this article is to demarcate a theoretical framework on sustainable supply chains and relate it to the barriers present in the measurement of sustainable performance. The method applied in this assessment combines systematic literature review, qualitative analysis of content and bibliometrics, through interconnected steps, which allow a detailing of the dimensions and under dimensions of the sustainability in the supply chain and the identification of the barriers that are associated with the measurement of performance. The material considered is supported through theoretical and empirical studies, which approached the formulation of the concepts and their applicability at different levels of the supply chain. This allows the content analysis to demarcate certain stages of development and the different theoretical approaches that respond and assist the concept. The results contribute to the definition of a roadmap to measure of sustainable performance, an issue that is the basis of future studies over this theme.</jats:p>"

However, most of the current research on LCECSC assumes that the decision-making body is rational, and there is less research on the irrational behavior of the e-platform altruistic preference. Therefore, aiming at the LCECSC composed of a single e-platform and a single manufacturer, this paper establishes two basic models with or without altruistic preference. Additionally, this paper combines the characteristics of online sales and assumes that altruistic preference is a proportional function of commission, then establishes a commission-based extended model with altruistic preference to further explore the influence of commission on its altruistic preference. The current literature does not consider this point, nor does it analyze the influence of other parameters on the degree of altruism preference. By comparing the optimal decisions and numerical analysis among the models, the following conclusions can be drawn that: (1) different from the traditional offline supply chain, the profit of the dominator e-platform is lower than the profit of the follower manufacturer; (2) when the consumers’ carbon emission reduction elasticity coefficient increases, service level, sales price, carbon emission reduction, sales, supply chain members profits, and system profit increase, ultimately improving economic and environmental performances; (3) the altruistic preference behavior of the e-platform is a behavior of ‘profit transferring’. The moderate altruistic preference is conducive to the stable operation and long-term development of LCECSC.</jats:p>"

Its water use has, however, increased since its designation as an economically fishery-based development area or minapolitan in 2012. This is due to the fact that groundwater resources in small island ecosystems surrounded by seawaters with a narrow diameter are easily affected by the insistence of seawater. Moreover, population pressure and land-use change are also feared to be affecting groundwater quality. Therefore, this research was conducted to analyze and evaluate groundwater resource quality in Pasaran Island using five wells on the entire island as sampling points selected based on census. The samples were tested for physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the laboratory and compared with water quality standards (Minister of Health’s Regulation No. 32/2007). The results showed relatively low water quality because the samples contained up to 3900 μS/cm salinity, 3771.9 mg/l chlorides, 31.7–141.52 mg/l nitrates, and 6.8–170 MPN/100ml total coliform which exceed the standards for drinking water. Meanwhile, wells 1, 4, and 5 were found to be safe for sanitation-hygiene purposes and well 1 was suitable for public baths even though they are not of drinking quality. This means the groundwater quality generally met Class II-water requirements for clean water supplies.</jats:p>"

Thus, appropriate planning is required to improve this industry. To achieve economic, social and environmental goals, a supply chain network is designed based on a multi-period and multi-product Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model in which the objective is to maximize the profit, minimize detrimental environmental effects, improve social effects, and minimize the number of lost demands. In addition, to improve forest industry planning, strategic and tactical decisions have been implemented throughout the supply chain for all facilities, suppliers and machinery. These decisions significantly help to improve processes and product flows and to meet customers’ needs. In addition, because of the presence of uncertainty in some parameters, the proposed model was formulated and optimized under uncertainty using the hybrid robust possibilistic programming (HRPP-II) approach. The ε-constraint technique was used to solve the multi-objective model, and the Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method was utilized to solve the model of more complex dimensions. A case study in Northern Iran was conducted to assess the efficiency of the suggested approach. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of important parameters on objective functions. The results of this study show that increasing the working hours of machines instead of increasing their number, increasing the capacity of some facilities instead of establishing new facilities and expanding the transport fleet has a significant impact on achieving predetermined goals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although natural ventilation has low efficiency and stability, its simulation remains relevant today. First, most of the legacy buildings are naturally ventilated. Secondly, production facilities with powerful heat emissions are designed precisely with the use of natural ventilation – aeration. After all, the air exchange in them is too great to provide it with mechanical systems. Finally, it is impractical to utilize the heat of the exhaust air due to the lack of close consumers of low-grade heat. Previously, when calculating aeration, only the value of the coefficient of the flow rate of holes in the self-similar area was used for the calculated parameters of the indoor and outdoor air. Modern approaches require modeling air exchange under variable internal and external conditions, under which air exchange can take arbitrarily small values. In this case, the mode of operation of the holes goes beyond the self-similar area. The most versatile is the Altshul chart. The diagram was built before the advent of powerful computers. Therefore, obtaining sufficiently accurate approximations of complex curves was a very time consuming task. In most cases, builds were done manually. At the same time, in the region of a small Reynolds number, a significant underestimation of the experimental data is noticeable Computer calculations cannot be based on graphical data and requires a mathematical description. However, Altshul provided only a formula describing a fairly narrow range. In this paper, an approximation of the experimental data is proposed. The regions for which experimental data are absent are described on the basis of the assumptions made in this work. The results make it possible to simulate natural air exchange in the widest possible range of external factors. </jats:p>"

As the COVID-19 epidemic continues to develop, the effective supply of FAPs during the epidemic prevention and control period has become a key part of the response to the epidemic in metropolitan areas. Based on the game theory, this study constructed a three-level supply chain consisting of suppliers, TPL service providers and retailers to guarantee the supply of FAPs in metropolises in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. By Stackelberg principle game theory, the optimal epidemic prevention effort level, preservation effort level, wholesale price, retail price and optimal profit result in the supply chain dominated by supplier and retailer are respectively solved. In this study, in addition to the characteristics of FAPs such as easy loss and perishable, COVID-19 epidemic factors such as virus infection coefficient and epidemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model to ensure the effective supply of FAPs in metropolitan areas. The main research conclusions are as follows. (i) In the context of COVID-19, compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, the level of preservation efforts and epidemic prevention efforts will have a greater impact on the retail prices of FAPs in metropolitan areas. (ii) When the supplier is in the dominant position, the sensitivity coefficient of the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit of the supplier. Compared with other members, they have stronger control ability and decision-making ability, so that their profits are greater than those of other members. (ii) Compared with suppliers who are in the leading position of guarantee and supply, when FAPs retailers are in the leading position of guarantee and supply, TPL service providers have a higher level of epidemic prevention efforts and preservation efforts for FAPs.

We used image hashing to compare and remove relatively similar images as data cleaning step and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by observing the classification accuracy. We used cloud computation to train the model. This trained model will be helpful to achieve the goal.

Update the demand, the level of deterioration of the product, and the number of intermediaries is the causes of the bullwhip effect most investigated. On the other hand, the product’s safety and the quality of the information are the quality factors of the chain of supplies of perishable products more researched.

The specific objectives were to determine the role of logistics cost, logistics quality, logistics productivity, and logistics cycle-time on logistics performance measurement in Kuehne Nagel logistic company. The study was anchored on the SCOR model, resource-based view, theory of constraints and transactions theory. The study adopted a descriptive research design. The study target population was 72 managers comprising of top, middle and supervisory level managers. A census of all the managers was done. The study used questionnaires to collect data. A multivariate regression model was used to link the independent variables with the dependent variable. The study findings indicated that logistics cost and logistics metrics performance are negatively and significantly associated. the results further indicated that logistics quality, logistics productivity and logistics cycle-time had positive and significant association with logistics metrics performance the regression results showed that there is a negatively significant relationship between logistics cost and logistics metrics performance. Further, results indicate that there is positively significant relationship between logistics quality, logistics productivity, logistics cycle-time and logistics metrics performance. Based on the findings, the study concluded that there is negative and significant relationship between logistics cost and logistics metrics performance. Further, the study concluded that there is a positive and significant relationship between quality, productivity, cycle-time and logistics metrics performance. From the findings, the study recommended that logistic companies should find ways of reducing their logistics cost, since it affects their performance; should adopt measures towards improving the quality of their services; should invest in improving their productivity; and lastly logistic firms should adopt efficient time management systems. This will ensure maximum utilization of time as a resource.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of the circular economy (CE) is receiving encouraging attention among scholars and practitioners, as a convenient solution to move away from the linear economy concept without neglecting the goals of sustainable development. The main goals of the CE are the closing of resource loops and the keeping of resources in the system for as long as possible at the highest utility level. However, as a result of the lack of internationally accepted definitions of the CE and several unsolved barriers, an excessive and inconsistent number of different CE applications exist. Most fields are mainly focusing on making a linear system circular instead of applying the CE principles in a holistic way. This paper presents a strategy to close the mentioned inconsistency gap, by contrasting currently discussed CE barriers and goals and thereof deriving two areas with a need for action (1. identifying the needed collection, sorting, and recovery infrastructure, and 2. developing circular product design guidelines). The strategy itself consists of connecting these two areas through an improved information exchange between the end-of-life (EOL) and beginning-of-life (BOL) of products. The result is CE design guidelines which are in accordance with the available or needed collection, sorting, and recovery infrastructure. The proposed strategy presents an innovative solution to apply CE principles in a holistic manner, based on EOL-driven product design.</jats:p>"

Robust knowledge on impacts is the first step to taking action, but long-distance food supply chains and indirect effects on and around farms make understanding impacts a challenge. This paper looks at the tools available for businesses in the food industry, especially retailers, to monitor and assess the biodiversity performance of their products. It groups tools according to their general scope to evaluate what is monitored (processes on-site, pressures on landscapes, impacts on species), at what scale (specific products, company performance, country-wide consumption levels), and compared to which baseline (pristine nature, alternative scenarios, governance targets). Altogether we find major gaps in the criteria for biodiversity or the criteria is weak in certification and standards, business accounting and reporting systems, and scientific modelling and analysis (biodiversity footprints). At the same time, massive investments have been made to strengthen existing tools, develop new ones, increase uptake and improve their effectiveness. We argue that business can and must take a leading role toward mitigating biodiversity impacts in partnership with policy makers and customers. Zero-deforestation commitments, for example, will need to be upheld by supporting changed practices in consumption (e.g., choice editing) and combating degradation within agricultural systems will require a shift toward more regenerative forms of farming (e.g., with norms embedded in robust standard systems). Operational targets are integral to monitoring biodiversity performance across all scales.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the power supply using 100 Wp solar cells produced a capacity of 20 Ah, 60 Ah, and 100 Ah on the battery. Charging with a solar energy source on a 20 Ah battery takes a duration of 5 hours to be fully charged, while 60 Ah and 100 Ah batteries cannot be fully charged in one day. Charging a battery that has been run at a full level takes a duration of 15 hours at a temperature of 30oC to 34oC.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the growth of online peer-to-peer markets. Using data from TaskRabbit, an expanding marketplace for domestic tasks at the time of our study, we show that growth varies considerably across cities. To disentangle the potential drivers of growth, we look separately at demand and supply imbalances, network effects, and geographic heterogeneity. First, we find that supply is highly elastic: in periods when demand doubles, sellers perform almost twice as many tasks, prices hardly increase, and the probability of requested tasks being matched falls only slightly. The first result implies that in markets where supply can accommodate demand fluctuations, growth relies on attracting buyers at a faster rate than sellers. Second and perhaps most surprisingly, we find no evidence of network effects in matching: doubling the number of buyers and sellers only doubles the number of matches. Third, we show that the cities where market fundamentals promote efficient matching of buyers and sellers are also those that are the fastest growing. This heterogeneity in matching efficiency is related to two measures of market thickness: geographic density (buyers and sellers living close together) and level of task standardization (buyers requesting homogeneous tasks). Our results have two main implications for peer-to-peer markets in which network effects are limited by the local and time-sensitive nature of the services exchanged. First, marketplace growth largely depends on strategic geographic expansion. Second, a competitive rather than winner-take-all equilibrium may arise in the long run. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy. </jats:p>",

The applications of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different processes of supply chains have assisted companies to improve their performance. Procurement can be considered a critical process in supply chain management since it can provide novel opportunities for supply chains to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. However, I4.0 applications can be costly and may not be reasonably affordable. Therefore, the benefits of implementing these technologies should be clarified for procurement managers before investing in the digitalization of the procurement process. Despite the importance of this issue, few papers have attempted to address the effects of I4.0 technologies and smart systems in procurement. To fill this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement has been used in this study. By reviewing 70 papers through appropriate keywords, a conceptual framework is developed to classify different value propositions provided by the different applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement processes. Results reveal nine value propositions that can provide a better understanding for the procurement department to analyze the benefits of implementing the related I4.0 technologies in different activities. Finally, findings and future study opportunities are concluded.</jats:p>"

We focus on establishing a dynamic Stackelberg game model with bounded rational expectation and analyzing the game evolution process. The effects of key parameters on the Nash equilibrium solutions and their stability are investigated, as well as the complex dynamical behaviors of the CLSC system are explored by using the stability region, bifurcation graph, the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), strange attractors, etc. Moreover, the performance of channel members under different values of parameters is researched by utilizing the (average) expected profits or utilities index. The analysis results reveal that the excessive fast adjustment speed of the manufacturer will lead to the system losing stability and falling into chaos. Also, the retailer’s risk aversion and the third party’s fairness concerns have a destabilization effect on the Nash equilibrium point, while the possibility of supply disruption has different effects on the scope of the adjustment speed of decision variables of the manufacturer. Furthermore, in most cases, an over the top adjustment speed of the manufacturer is disadvantageous to all the channel members for more expected profits, but the third-party can achieve a better performance when the system is in periodic state. Finally, the time-delay feedback control method is proposed to eliminate the system chaos.</jats:p>",

Roof-harvested rainwater is generally microbiologically contaminated and thus needs to be treated effectively to meet drinking standards. Filtration of rainwater with sand coated by silver nanoparticles enhances the microbial removal efficiency. In this study, the filtration parameters of treating rainwater with biologically synthesized nanosilver coated sand are optimized. Of the various synthesis methods, the biological method was chosen due to benefits such as cost-effectiveness and its eco-friendly nature. Silver nanoparticles were synthesised using papaya fruit extract and then coated on sand. The synthesized nanosilver coated sand was subjected to characterization methods such as energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. With silver coated sand as control, multiple long duration tests were performed to treat rainwater with nanosilver coated sand to find the optimal values for filtration parameters such as filter bed depth and empty bed contact time (EBCT). The crystallite size of the nanosilver coated sand was found to be 43.8 nm. The optimal values for filter bed depth and EBCT were found to be 12 cm and 15 minutes respectively. The rainwater treated with nanosilver coated sand met drinking water standard IS 10500: 2012 until the media got exhausted.</jats:p>",

So, this is an important factor in measuring the Supply Operations Chain that occurs in these commodities. The high costs incurred in this sector encourage us to continue to improve our operational performance to reduce costs as low as possible. The condition is what the public/consumers want so that the gap between production costs and distribution costs of existing products is not too far away. This study aims to measure consumer satisfaction with the Supply Chain in the area and optimize the Supply Chain model that can be done to improve operational processes in the upstream (supplier) and downstream (distribution channels) of the Supply Chain in Central Java. The data analysis method used is the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR). This model serves to weigh the importance of measuring customer satisfaction with the Supply Chain in the area, and efforts to improve operational performance can be made by minimizing failure in the process so that delivery to consumers is on time. The results of the SCOR model show that Asset, Agility, and Cost are variables that must be improved in the logistics process in Central Java. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the impact of covid-19, the global and domestic manufacturing supply chains, almost suffered from the serious interruption crisis of manpower flow, logistics, information flow and capital flow. The risk of supply chain disruption has become the primary risk of the supply chain. However, some risk inducement of supply chain interruption is complex and diverse, so it is very difficult to grasp and screen the risk data needed for research from the supply chain operation data. To improve the robustness of supply chain for boosting the domestic and international circulation of China's manufacturing, in this paper, according to the characteristics of China's manufacturing supply chain and its risk incentives, the data needed for risk prediction modeling has been sorted out through questionnaire survey, and a regression model of risk prediction for manufacturing supply chain by using empirical method would be put forward. Then, C4.5 decision tree method is used to train and evaluation the risk prediction model. The conclusion shows that the customer satisfaction has great diagnostic value for risk, and the model has a strong sensitivity to market information risk and market order risk. The conclusion is more consistent with general cognition, and the model fits well, indicating that the model proposed in this paper has a certain theoretical significance, and its practical application value is worthy of further testing.</jats:p>",

A scenario analysis compared four integrated systems for beef, pork and broilers. Slaughter cattle diets were either business as usual (BAU) or grass fed (GF), and the combined red meat consumption could not exceed the recommendation for human health. The four consumption scenarios included (PS1) equal beef and pork with BAU beef, (PS2) equal beef and pork with GF beef, (PS3) more pork and less beef with GF beef and (PS4) more pork and less beef with BAU beef. Broiler consumption was increased to force all four scenarios to provide the same amount of protein. All four scenarios required similar feed grain areas (2.5 to 3 Mha). At 2.3, 4.4, 2.2 and 1.2 Mha for PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4, respectively, the areas in harvestable forage showed much greater variation. From high to low GHG emissions, the ranking of scenarios was PS2, PS1, PS3 and PS4. Although allowing for avoidance of soil organic matter loss changed this ranking, the carbon footprint of beef production was still double or more that of pork in all four PS. To reconcile the agro-ecological benefits of beef with reducing GHG emissions, PS3 may be better than PS4. Along with eating more pork and broilers, and less red meat overall, consumers can choose GF beef as an occasional alternative.</jats:p>"

Society's heightened scrutiny and new government policy is forcing businesses and nations to act in lieu of reputational, financial, and legal repercussions. However, slavery hides within complex supply chains, making it difficult to identify instances of human exploitation. This study takes a consumption perspective by investigating the potential of footprinting in exposing modern slavery impacts embodied in upstream supply chains. A multi‐regional input–output analysis extended with a slavery satellite account enables footprints of direct and indirect incidents of modern slavery to be quantified. The footprints reveal a displacement of slavery from developed to developing nations through the global supply chains of production. Accountability for enslavement significantly increases for countries and regions like North America, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan due to a high dependence on imports with embodied human exploitation. The results expose hotspot sectors, including construction, trade, and agriculture. These footprints go beyond current estimates of slavery in supply chains, revealing hidden impacts and the true risk, which may enable more effective action into improving global social sustainability and support companies to responsibly manage their supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although there are highly discrete stochastic demands in practical supply chain problems, they are seldom considered in the research on supply chain systems, especially the single-manufacturer multi-retailer supply chain systems. There are no significant differences between continuous and discrete demand supply chain models, but the solutions for discrete random demand models are more challenging and difficult. This paper studies a supply chain system of a single manufacturer and multiple retailers with discrete stochastic demands. Each retailer faces a random discrete demand, and the manufacturer utilizes different wholesale prices to influence each retailer’s ordering decision. Both Make-To-Order and Make-To-Stock scenarios are considered. For each scenario, the corresponding Stackelberg game model is constructed respectively. By proving a series of theorems, we transfer the solution of the game model into non-linear integer programming model, which can be easily solved by a dynamic programming method. However, with the increase in the number of retailers and the production capacity of manufacturers, the computational complexity of dynamic programming drastically increases due to the Dimension Barrier. Therefore, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach is introduced, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of solving the supply chain model.</jats:p>"

While much has been written about private standards from the perspectives of different academic fields, there has never been a dedicated literature review to examine their interaction with global food supply chains. In this systematic review, 45 peer reviewed articles on private food standards, selected through extensive searches in four academic databases are critically appraised. Our analysis reveals that the most studied European private food safety standards are owned by retail conglomerates and therefore place the retail sector in a position of influence in the supply chain. These standards influence supply chain structures, market access, and the efficiency of food safety management systems. They also challenge the traditional relationship shared by actors in the supply chain with public authorities and the World Trade Organization. In the recent years, their scope has expanded to include topical issues such as environmental sustainability, worker safety, and animal welfare. Overall, the review suggests that European private food safety standards alter the operations of modern agri-food supply chains to accommodate consumer wishes while allowing the retail sector to exert its influence without taking on additional legal and economic liability.</jats:p>",

The initiative was addressed at forest owners, forest and processing enterprises, retailers, and supporting organizations. This study reports the results of a survey performed to assess the effectiveness of the project two years after its launch. The survey, in the form of a questionnaire submitted to all adhering organizations, investigated different aspects such as motivations for adherence to the project, satisfaction with the project, sale of the labeled material, and promotion of the specific label. The results provide a detailed outline of the above aspects. Through the various findings, the project is perceived as effective in supporting the region, enhancing an organizations’ image, and limiting price fall. Yet, further efforts should be aimed at increasing networking and business opportunities. Some recommendations are also offered for similar projects in the future, as forest disturbances are increasing worldwide in frequency and intensity due to climate change.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, in this paper, we consider supply chains with joint production of GHG emissions, operating under either a carbon-tax regime, wherein a regulator levies a penalty on the emissions generated by the firms in the supply chain, or an internal carbon-pricing scheme. Supply chain leaders, such as Walmart, are assumed to be environmentally motivated to induce their suppliers to abate their emissions. We adopt a cooperative game-theory methodology to derive a footprint-balanced scheme for reapportioning the total carbon emissions amongst the firms in the supply chain. This emission responsibility-allocation scheme, which is the Shapley value of an associated cooperative game, is shown to have several desirable characteristics. In particular, (i) it is transparent and easy to compute; (ii) when the abatement-cost functions of the firms are private information, it incentivizes suppliers to exert pollution-abatement efforts that, among all footprint-balanced allocation schemes, minimize the maximum deviation from the socially optimal pollution level; and (iii) the Shapley value is the unique allocation mechanism satisfying certain contextually desirable properties. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management. </jats:p>",

In this case, the water supply scheme includes: pumping stations of the first rise, which take water directly from the water; water treatment system (purification); pumping stations of the second and third rise, pumping clean water over long distances and supplying it to settlements [1]. If the settlement is located in an area where there are no large open water sources, or the geographical location of the settlement allows the use of groundwater, in which case artesian wells are used as a source of water supply. Usually small settlements are supplied with water from artesian wells. Artesian wells are widely used for water supply of villages, industrial water supply, for irrigation (irrigation systems), in the mining industry, to reduce the level of groundwater. The advantage of using artesian wells to supply the population with drinking water is that the water is extracted from great depths and purified using natural filters [2]. Thus, the cost of water treatment is significantly reduced. The disadvantage of using artesian wells is usually low productivity of the well, the strong dependence of water volumes in the well on climatic and weather conditions, depletion of the well as a result of large-scale construction or extraction of natural minerals such as shale gas [3].</jats:p>"

The present study attempted to analyse the price transmission between Indian and international markets and study the supply response of small cardamom to changes in price. The co-movement of prices of small cardamom exist between the Indian and international markets after trade liberalisation and the price transmission has been from the international market to the Indian market. The short-run disequilibrium has been found between the Indian and international prices of cardamom, which got corrected with varying speed of adjustment. The positive and significant elasticity of supply of small cardamom with respect to its own two year lagged price has been established.

Using the knowledge and theory of supply chain management and logistics, this paper studies the method of constructing supply chain and promotes the reform of tobacco industry\n and the development of logistics construction. Methods: This paper makes a systematic and comprehensive research by using JIT method. Based on reality and overall situation, make a comprehensive and systematic strategic plan for the development of tobacco industry. This paper analyzes the\n current situation of tobacco supply chain management, and puts forward the countermeasures to solve the current situation of tobacco supply chain. Results: Tobacco logistics and supply chain management in China has just started, is still in the exploratory stage, and there are still many imperfections\n and areas that need to be improved. Although many tobacco enterprises have initially built cigarette logistics centers with Municipal Bureau companies as the main body, the information construction has also reached a certain level. Overall, the integration of resources between industrial and\n commercial enterprises is far from enough. At present, only some provinces and cities have realized the logistics resource sharing of industrial and commercial enterprises in the same city, and the informatization has also reached a high level. The phenomenon of repeated logistics construction\n in the whole tobacco industry is still serious. Conclusion: In order to realize the integration of logistics resources in the whole industry and reduce the overall cost, tobacco companies should first strengthen the joint reorganization of the industry and establish large tobacco industry\n groups. Secondly, efforts should be made to realize the organizational structure adjustment and business process re-engineering of industrial enterprises. Thirdly, on the basis of the existing logistics level, establish a third-party logistics company across administrative regions to realize\n the informatization of the whole cycle of cigarette distribution..</jats:bold>\n      </jats:p>",

Delays in the supply chain can bring consequences such as the lack of food products by retailers, transporters and manufacturers. Thus, this study aims to examine the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in small- and medium-sized food companies in the central region of Portugal, identifying potential problems and pointing out the respective solutions. For this purpose, the study uses a qualitative methodology through semi-structured interviews. It was found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have a codified supply chain and that generally, these companies have a minimal budget, which requires a constant search for new suppliers that represent a reduction in costs. Moreover, most of the companies surveyed faced unexpected challenges, such as a lack of alternative suppliers. The present paper is original because it studies the supply chain in SMEs in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it allows the ascertainment of practical suggestions for these companies to improve, as well as contributing to the clarification of the literature on the supply chain in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

The production process aims to send goods for use by consumers. This process does not have full visibility and uses a manual process to track the movement of ingredients. This results in a lack of data transparency in drug production, a major problem often faced by the pharmaceutical industry in supply chain management. The process without data transparency will reduce the quality and assurance of drugs and the ability to record information in the drug production process. Based on these problems, this study develops a mobile application by implementing a blockchain system to support the system supply chain management process from material sources, production processes to distribution to consumers. This research was conducted with a prototyping model approach in application development and multichain as blockchain technology. This research produces a mobile application with a blockchain system in the supply chain management process.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With rapid development and deployment of clean energy technology, demand for certain minor metals has increased significantly. However, many such metals are by-products of various host metals and are economically infeasible to extract independently. Meanwhile, by-product metals present in the mined ores may not be extracted even if they are sent to smelters along with host metal concentrates if it is not economically favorable for the producers. This dependency poses potential supply risks to by-product metals. Indium is a typical by-product metal, mainly from zinc mining and refining, and is important for flat panel displays, high efficiency lighting, and emerging thin-film solar panel production. Current indium supply–demand forecast models tend to overlook the volatile and competitive nature of minor metal market and are mostly based on top-down approaches. Therefore, a bottom-up agent-based model can shed new light on the market dynamics and possible outcome of future indium supply–demand relationship. A multi-layered model would also be helpful for identifying possible bottlenecks of indium supply and finding solutions. This work takes indium as an example of minor metal market and sets up an agent-based model to predict future market situation and supply–demand balance. The market is modeled as a Cournot competition oligopolistic market by refineries with capacity restriction based on host metal production. The model maintains active Nash equilibrium each year to simulate competitions between suppliers. The model is validated and verified by historical data and sensitivity analysis. Several scenarios are also explored to illustrate possible uncertainties of the market.</jats:p>"

In 2011, the first digital contraceptive logistics management information system (cLMIS) was launched, enabling supply chain data visibility from the federal level to health facilities. The system has built-in modules on forecasting and supply planning, inventory management, consumption reporting, business intelligence tools, automatic email and SMS alerts. Using these features, policy-makers and health managers annually forecast needs, and procure contraceptives accordingly. Aims: The objective of this research was to understand the existing technological platforms for family planning (FP) supply chain data visibility and the potential impact on contraceptive commodity security. Methods: The authors reviewed available published and grey literature papers on contraceptives and supplies in Pakistan. We extracted data from the cLMIS, evaluated indicators including reporting compliance, reported stock-out rates, and contraceptive performance. The analysis was validated by reviewing supply chain and FP indicators, such as average monthly consumption, months of stock, and couple years of protection. Results: The cLMIS has resulted in improved distribution, early warning and accountability at the lowest tiers in the FP supply chain in the public sector. At the facility level, FP commodity availability increased from 40% in 2009 to 84% in 2018. Conclusion: Contraceptive supply chain has seen significant growth over the past decade to meet expanding reproductive health evidence to inform strategic decisions; cLMIS is a prime contributor to improvements registered in FP stock availability at public sector facilities</jats:p>",

In this paper, on the basis of the existing evaluation indicators of grain system, we establish a multi-level index system through principal component analysis. After that, we integrate the index into the grain system index through entropy weight method and coefficient of variation method, and establish a comprehensive evaluation model. On the basis of the evaluation model, the index is calculated twice, and the optimization model is established combined with the multi-objective programming algorithm. The simulation results show that the two weights of energy efficiency and per capita cultivated land area account for a large proportion in the optimized system.</jats:p>",

The exceptional locomotory capacity of these invertebrate athletes seemingly depends upon effective coupling between the cardiovascular system and skeletal muscles, but how these systems are integrated has not been well defined. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between aerobic muscle fibers within the skeletal muscles used to power running and the blood vessels supplying these muscles. We used histochemical staining techniques to identify aerobic versus glycolytic fibers and to characterize membrane invaginations within the aerobic fibers. We also determined how the diameters of these two fiber types scale as a function of body size, across two orders of magnitude. Vascular casts were made of the blood vessels perfusing these muscles, and special attention was given to small, capillary-like vessels supplying the fibers. Finally, we injected fluorescent microspheres into the hearts of living crabs and tracked their deposition into different muscle regions to quantify relative hemolymph flow to metabolic fiber types. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that ghost crab muscles are endowed with an extensive arterial hemolymph supply. Moreover, the hemolymph flow to aerobic fibers is significantly greater than to glycolytic fibers within the same muscles. Aerobic fibers are increasingly subdivided by membrane invaginations as crabs increase in size, keeping the diffusive distances relatively constant. These findings support a functional coupling between a well-developed circulatory system and metabolically active muscle fibers in these invertebrates.</jats:p>",

The established International Indices that determine the level of reliability of the functioning of electric networks are considered, and information on the compliance of the condition of electric networks in Russia with these indices is analyzed. Analytical information on the damage rate of elements of these networks and their causes in Europe, America, and Russia is presented. The emphasis is placed on the fact that the most common damage is characteristic of overhead power lines, especially 6–10 kV lines. As an object of research, two branches of the Irkutsk electric grid company (IEC) were taken, one of which provides electricity to rural consumers, the other — mainly to consumers residing in the territory of the city Irkutsk. The characteristics of these electric networks, their territorial location and basic technical data are presented. To conduct analytical monitoring of the level of reliability of overhead power transmission lines, logs of disconnection of the Eastern and Southern electric networks of the IEC over a long-term period were used. On the basis of this information, tables of failures and their consequences in the studied electrical networks were compiled for monthly average data over the period under examination for various causes of damage. To plot time diagrams of the parameters under examination, computer programs were compiled in the Matlab system, the use of which made it possible to obtain visualization of changes in failures for various reasons for the electrical networks under consideration. The information on the time of power supply interruptions in these networks, as well as the amount of electricity underutilized by consumers during these interruptions and its cost are analyzed. It is shown that in the electric networks under consideration, most of the power failures are related to the territorial dispersion of these networks, and the low level of equipment controls and insufficient qualification of operating personnel, as evidenced by the significant number of failures for unknown reasons. Besides, a significant part of the failures is due to damage to the overhead line wires, switching equipment and the effect of wind load. Recommendations for improving the condition of power transmission lines and a number of measures aimed at improving the level of reliability of power supply are presented.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this retrospective descriptive study were to characterize the CT findings and clinical features of ASANL , and to determine the breed predisposition in a population of referral canine cases. Thoracic CT images, in which the caudal lung lobes were fully inflated and the pulmonary artery could be traced to the periphery, were reviewed. A total of 1,950 dogs were enrolled, and the aberrant vasculature equivalent to ASANL in humans was detected in 48 dogs. Shetland Sheepdogs (7/48, odds ratio [OR] = 8.0, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.00001), Miniature Dachshunds (19/48, OR = 3.9, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.00001), and Labrador Retrievers (6/48, OR = 4.5, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.0009) were over‐represented. The affected lung lobes were the right caudal lobe (24/48, 50%), the left caudal lobe (21/48, 43.8%), and bilateral caudal lobes (3/48, 6.3%). The aberrant vessels originated from the left gastric artery (14/48), descending thoracic aorta (8/48), celiac artery (6/48), and splenic artery (1/48). In the remaining 19 cases, the origin of the aberrant vessels could not be determined. Although the clinical significance of ASANL in dogs remains unclear, surgeons should be aware of this finding prior to lobectomy of the caudal lung lobes to avoid intraoperative systemic arterial bleeding.</jats:p>",

Although government authorities sought to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by restricting travel and in-person activities, failure to deploy time-sensitive strategies in ramping-up of critical resource production exacerbated the outbreak. Here, we developed a mathematical model to analyze the effects of the interaction between supply chain disruption and infectious disease dynamics using coupled production and disease networks built on global data. Analysis of the supply chain model suggests that time-sensitive containment strategies could be created to balance objectives in pandemic control and economic losses, leading to a spatiotemporal separation of infection peaks that alleviates the societal impact of the disease. A lean resource allocation strategy can reduce the impact of supply chain shortages from 11.91 to 1.11% in North America. Our model highlights the importance of cross-sectoral coordination and region-wise collaboration to optimally contain a pandemic and provides a framework that could advance the containment and model-based decision making for future pandemics.</jats:p>"

Based on this, forecasts of consumption and tariffs for heat energy are of great importance for the development of the country and the life of the population. Meanwhile, the deterioration of equipment and pipelines in the heat supply industry is great and funds are needed for the modernization and reconstruction of basic production facilities. Because of this, amendments were made to the federal law \"On heat supply\" on the introduction of price zones for heat supply and an increase in tariffs for heat energy using an innovative method. This method is called \"alternative boiler room\". This article is aimed at disclosing the “alternative boiler house” method, the tariff consequences of the transition to long-term free tariffs for heat with the establishment of a limit level by the “alternative boiler house” method are considered. Calculations were made of the forecast heat tariffs to achieve the level of the “alternative boiler house” and taking into account the elasticity of demand for the price of heat for Rubtsovsk. It has been proven that with an increase in heat tariffs with a rate of \"inflation +1%\" until 2027, heat tariffs in Rubtsovsk will reach the maximum level of an \"alternative boiler house\" and will become a real source of technical re-equipment of the heat supply system in the city. The article considers the tariff consequences of the transition of state regulation to the determination of the marginal price by the \"alternative boiler house\" method for the regions. The Ministry of Energy of Russia highly appreciated the results of the transition to a new method of regulating tariffs for thermal energy in Rubtsovsk.</jats:p>",

Consumers may also encounter sudden crisis events that occur in the tourist attraction during their visit, and the occurrence of crisis events can damage the low-carbon goodwill of the tourist attraction to the detriment of the sustainable development of the supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how tourism firms can develop dynamic strategies in the pre-crisis environment if they envision the occurrence of a crisis event and how crisis events affect interfirm cooperation. This paper uses stochastic jump processes to portray the dynamic evolution of low-carbon goodwill in the context of crisis events and introduces the methods of the differential game and Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory to study the sustainable operations of low-carbon tourism supply chains. Our findings provide important managerial insights for enterprises in the tourism supply chain and suggest that they need to not only become aware of the tourist attraction crisis events, but also, more importantly, they need to adjust their appropriate input strategies based on the degree of anticipation of the crisis.</jats:p>"

Despite considerable efforts, many households still rely on unimproved water sources. This research aimed to understand the reasons behind household reluctance to collect potable water from improved sources in urban and rural settings. Sixteen water points were selected purposively and a household survey conducted on the selected improved water source users. The result shows that in the urban areas people were satisfied with the water services provided. However, the poor could not afford the high cost of water and households sought unprotected alternative sources. Seventy-seven per cent of the urban and 65% of the rural households collect water from unimproved sources. Family size was the determinant factor for household water consumption from improved sources. Reliability, queuing time, high quality, and distance were associated with households' reluctance to collect potable water from improved sources. In conclusion, households' dependency on unprotected sources had a direct impact on the sustainability of schemes. Social factors are also fundamental when thinking about the sustainability of schemes.</jats:p>",

This model, however, raises two problems in reality to search for false content: (1) a single point of failure is easily triggered by a centralised architecture, in particular where a root-key fails, because of its lack of dependency on keys across sites, and (2) an unnecessary certificate chain overhead for signing verification. This research suggests a key organization framework built on a blockchain in NDN, which addresses lack of mutual confidence among sites with no trust-based anchors. In particular both site nodes shape a licence blockchain to save public key hatches to guarantee validity, and the proxy gateway takes part to check that contacts among the router then the blockchain are overly regular. In accumulation, NDN is revamped to hold, validate and revoke a publicly important information object and scheme. The findings of our review and appraisal suggest that fewer verification numbers and greater verification reliability can be supported in the proposed arrangement.</jats:p>",

Sitting on top of minimum capital requirements, regulatory capital buffers introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) are costly regions of \"rainy day\" equity capital designed to absorb losses and provide lending capacity in a downturn. Using a novel set of confidential loan level data that includes private SME firms, we show that \"buffer-constrained\" banks (those entering the pandemic with capital ratios close to this regulatory buffer region) reduced loan commitments to SME firms by an average of 1.4 percent more (quarterly) and were 4 percent more likely to end pre-existing lending relationships during the pandemic as compared to \"buffer-unconstrained\" banks (those entering the pandemic with capital ratios far from the regulatory capital buffer region). We further find heterogenous effects across firms, as buffer-constrained banks disproportionately curtailed credit to three types of borrowers: (1) private, bank-dependent SME firms, (2) firms whose lending relationships were relatively young, and (3) firms whose pre-pandemic credit lines contractually matured at the start of the pandemic (and thus were up for renegotiation). While the post-2008 period saw the rise of banking system capital to historically high levels, these capital buffers went effectively unused during the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to: (1) empirically test the usability of these Basel III regulatory buffers in a downturn, and (2) contribute a bank capital-based transmission channel to the literature studying how the pandemic transmitted shocks to SME firms.&amp;lt;/ns2:p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Fresh water is essential for human beings and for the stability and sustainable development of any nation. Many regions in the interior of Syria have an insufficient water balance. This has caused severe shortages of freshwater as a result of climate change. Syria's main source of fresh water, rivers and groundwater, suffers from low levels due to the lack of rainfall amounts. The war in Syria exacerbated water stress, in particular the effects of the war on water sources such as the Euphrates River and the ‘Feijah’ source that feeds the capital Damascus. All of this has prompted us to seek other non-traditional sources such as atmospheric water, which is a renewable and relatively clean source. This paper is considered to be the first of its kind in Syria. Experimental results from semi-arid and arid regions have shown good potential for harvesting dew and fog water as a supplementary and complementary source to the existing freshwater supply.</jats:p>",

The incorporation of indigenous meanings and conceptualizations of belonging into provenance are explored. First, we consider how the gradual transformation of marketplaces into market and consumer activism catalyzed the need for provenance. Guided by this, we discuss the meaning of provenance from an indigenous and non-indigenous rationale. Driven by the need for a qualitative understanding of food, the scholarship has utilized different epistemologies to demonstrate how authentic connections are cultivated and protected by animistic approaches. As a tool to mobilize place, we suggest that provenance should be embedded in the immediate local context. Historic place-based indigenous knowledge systems, values, and lifeways should be seen as a model for new projects. This review offers a comprehensive collection of research material with emphasis on a variety of fields including anthropology, economic geography, sociology, and biology, which clarifies the meaning of provenance in alternative food systems. It questions the current practices of spatial confinement by stakeholders and governments that are currently applied to the concepts of provenance in foods, and instead proposes a holistic approach to understand both indigenous and non-indigenous ideologies but with an emphasis on Maori culture and its perspectives.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the principle of various voltage doubling circuits are analyzed, the steady state analytical formula under ideal state is obtained and their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. According to the above analysis and comparison, this paper proposes that the topological structure of the voltage doubling circuit for the 500kV HV power supply is the symmetrical CW multiplier circuit. Then the ripple expression of the symmetrical CW multiplier is deduced, the reason of voltage sag is analyzed, and the calculation expression is given. Finally, a simulation model of the voltage doubling circuit of the HV multiplier power supply was built in ANSYS Simplorer.

This article proposes a detailed summary of several models of agricultural supply chain finance from the perspective of supply chain management and analyzes the applicable conditions and basic processes of these models. It also analyzes the structure of the agricultural supply chain through typical cases, introduces the operation of supply chain finance, and evaluates and analyzes its effectiveness and problems. The experimental results in this paper show that, compared with other storage methods, this solution has obvious advantages in data query efficiency and data storage cost. Without a central server, the entire distributed system will have a certain degree of efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. When the amount of grain data reaches 100,000, 1 million, and 10 million, the system data integrity check time is 0.0263 seconds, 0.3251 seconds, and 1.5032 seconds, respectively. The program seems very useful.</jats:p>",

However, these have not yet been utilized for supplying energy to the rural community. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>The techno-economic viability of the hydro, wind, and solar hybrid power potential of Seyemtribua village in the Geba Catchment, Northern Ethiopia was evaluated using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software package. The hydrologic, meteorological, and demographic data collected from different sources were contemplated to analyze the power output and demand of the village. The simulation and optimization techniques in HOMER were employed for the possible configuration of micro-hydro, wind, and solar power hybrid systems. Besides the standalone, two and more systems were also combined to evaluate the technical capability of the hybrid system. The hourly and daily electrical load of the community was obtained using survey data from selected households.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>The mean annual power output that can be harnessed from the micro-hydro, solar, and wind is 272.4 kilowat, 161.8 kilowat, and 96.8 kilowat, respectively. The combination of these energy sources is sufficient to satisfy the power demand of the village. However, the mean hourly variation of power output from the hybrid system demonstrated shortage during peak load times which can be assisted by a generator output. The economic analysis revealed that the hybrid system is feasible and cheaper than other sources of energy besides its environmental benefit.<jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The potential of energy production from hybrid systems (solar, wind and micro-hydro power systems) and its economic feasibility for remotely located villages in Ethiopian condition is promising. We suggest decision-makers, governmental and non-governmental agencies, power authorities, and investors consider such hybrid systems for rural electrification in Ethiopia.</jats:p>"

The samples were collected from various places at the marshes, in Dhi-Qar governorate. The method that used in the present study is the can technique by Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs) with CR-39 detectors. Also, it was determined the average internal effective dose risk (AED), with lifetime cancer risk due to ingestion of 222Rn and 226Ra in drinking water. The average values of 222Rn, 226Ra and uranium 238U concentration in water samples were found to be 288.02 ± 31.21 Bq/m3, 0.45 ± 0.04 Bq/L, and 0.60 ± 0.06 ppm, respectively. The average values of AED (in mSv/y unit) caused by ingestion of 222Rn and 226Ra in the samples of the study were found to be 0.019 ± 0.002 and, 0.093 ± 0.01, respectively. The average values of total AED and lifetime cancer risk values were calculated to be 0.11 ± 0.01 mSv/y and (4.34 ± 0.47) × 10−4, respectively. The average concentration values of 222Rn and 226Ra were found to be within the global average limitations (0.4 Bq/L), and (1 Bq/L) that are recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993 and 2011, while the average of 238U concentrations were higher than that of the global average limitation (0.566 ppm) that was recommended by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When some results of AED due to 222Rn and 226Ra concentrations, in the samples under study, were compared with the worldwide median value it was found that the lifetime cancer risk in all samples of the present study were higher than the safety limit for the healthy drinking water. Therefore, consuming the water of marshes in the Dhi-Qar Governorate, Iraq, for cooking and drinking (which is contaminated with alpha emitters like 222Rn, 226Ra, and 238U) may lead to a considerable variation in the internal effective dose.</jats:p>",

One of the possible solutions is to obtain freshwater from drifting icebergs. The towing of large icebergs is the topic analyzed in various freshwater supply projects conducted in different zone-specific regions of the world. These projects show general effects of iceberg transport efficiency but do not present a detailed methodology for the calculation of their mass losses. The aim of this article is to develop the methodology to calculate the mass losses of icebergs transported on a selected route. A multi-agent simulation was used, and the numerical model to estimate the melting rate of the iceberg during its energy-efficient towing was developed. Moreover, the effect of towing speed on the iceberg’s mass loss was determined. It was stated that the maximum use of ocean currents, despite longer route and increased transport time, allows for energy-efficient transport of the iceberg. The optimal towing speed of the iceberg on the selected route was recommended at the range of 0.4–1 m/s. The achieved results may be of interest to institutions responsible for sustainable development and dealing with water resources and freshwater supply.</jats:p>"

Since at least 1990, designing and operating this supply chain, and adapting it to ever-changing military requirements, are highly complex and tightly coupled problems, which the highest levels of DoD recognize as weaknesses. Military supply chains face a wide range of challenges. Decisions made at the operational and tactical levels of logistics can alter the effectiveness of decisions made at the strategic level. Decisions must be made with incomplete information. As a result, practical solutions must simultaneously incorporate decisions made at all levels as well as take into account the uncertainty faced by the logistician. The design of modern military supply chains, particularly for large networks where many values are not known precisely, is recognized as too complex for many techniques found in the academic literature. Much of the literature in supply chain network design makes simplifying assumptions, such as constant per-unit transportation costs regardless of the size of the shipment, the shipping mode selected, the time available for the delivery, or the route taken. This article avoids these assumptions to provide an approach the practitioner can use when designing and adapting supply chain networks. This research proposes a simulation-based optimization approach to find a near-optimal solution to a large supply chain network design problem of the scale faced by a theater commander, while recognizing the complexity and uncertainty that the practicing military logistician must deal with.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, we can find the right innovation to handle the three distinctive areas of the different Mbay cities. Mountain areas need water conservation that applies ecological concepts, while urban plains need hydraulic handling to drain flood water from the city, and rice fields also need ecological handling so that rice fields are protected from overflowing sea water when high tide occurs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning methods have been extensively studied and have been proven to be very useful in multiple fields of technology. This paper presents a deep learning approach to optically detect hidden hardware trojans in the manufacturing and assembly phase of printed circuit boards to secure electronic supply chains. Trojans can serve as backdoors of accessing on chip data, can potentially alter functioning and in some cases may even deny intended service of the chip. Apart from consumer electronics, printed circuit boards are used in mission critical applications like military and space equipment. Security compromise or data theft can have severe impact and thus demand research attention. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be implemented in a manufacturing environment with limited training data. It can also provide better coverage in detection of hardware trojans over traditional methods. Image recognition algorithms need to have deeper penetration inside the training layers for recognizing physical variations of image patches. However, traditional network architectures often face vanishing gradient problem when the network layers are added. This hampers the overall accuracy of the network. To solve this a Residual network with multiple layers is used in this article. The ResNet34 algorithm can identify manufacturing tolerances and can differentiate between a manufacturing defect and a hardware trojan. The ResNet operates on the fundamental principle of learning from the residual of the output of preceding layer. In the degradation issue, it is observed that, a shallower network performs better than deeper network. However, this is with the downside of lower accuracy. Thus, a skip connection is made to provide an alternative path for the gradient to skip forward the training of few layers and add in multiple repeating blocks to achieve higher accuracy and lower training times. Implementation of this method can bolster automated optical inspection setup used to detect manufacturing variances on a printed circuit board. The results show a 98.5% accuracy in optically detecting trojans by this method and can help cut down redundancy of physically testing each board. The research results also provide a new consideration of hardware trojan benchmarking and its effect on optical detection.</jats:p>"

In the case of the food industry, understanding consumer needs and maximizing its utility are essential. In this study, we analyze consumers’ 12 meta-values (e.g., safety, taste, health, price, environment, etc.), then suggest the strategy of food cold-chain management satisfying consumers’ perception. We focused on consumers from three countries in Asia: Korea, China, and Japan. The survey was conducted with over 1000 consumers in those three countries, and a random parameter logit model was utilized to determine the importance of each food value that could affect consumers’ food choice. Similarities and differences were both found in share of preference of each food value across countries. While safety is one of the top three values in all three countries, naturalness and nutritional value ranked among the top three only in China. To propose the consumer-centric strategy of food cold-chain management, we investigated the relationship between each food value and each node of supply chain based on the big data analysis. It shows that consumers prefer when the entire supply chain is managed where each node is organically connected with each other instead of individual nodes being managed separately. Further, strategies for food cold-chain management should be developed differently by country, incorporating differences of consumers’ preferences on food value. These results would motivate governments and companies related to food cold chain to reconsider their marketing strategies on the import and export food market.</jats:p>"

The first devices require a pressure of 1200-1300 Pa to ensure an optimal combustion process, and the second 2000-2500 Pa. The permissible minimum pressure in the distribution network can be significantly lower than required by gas equipment. Pressure control actually allows you to influence the efficiency of the gas combustion. A study of the change in the gas flow rate and the time of its combustion when heating a fixed volume of water at different pressures has been carried out. The study was carried out on household stoves from different manufacturers. The pressure range was from 1800 to 2600 Pa. The coefficients of change in the efficiency of gas use (δ) during the operation of the devices, depending on the pressure in front of the burners, have been determined. Based on the analysis of the results obtained, the optimal pressure was determined to be 2400 Pa. In this case, the minimum efficiency occurred at a pressure of 1800 Pa (deviation by 40%). At pressures of 2000 and 2500 Pa, on average, the deviation of the efficiency was 20%. The dependence of gas consumption on the intensity of its combustion was also analyzed. The experiments were carried out at constant pressure on burners of different power. It has been determined that when using a burner with a minimum power, the volume of gas used is reduced by 1,3 times with an increase in the heating time by about two times in comparison with a burner with a maximum power.</jats:p>"

Кроме того, использование энергетических роутеров позволяет улучшить качество электроэнергии в части несимметрии и несинусоидальности напряжения. Приведены результаты моделирования режимов работы изолированной системы электроснабжения, включающей следующие элементы: энергетические роутеры, ветрогенерирующая установка с нечетким регулятором угла поворота лопастей ветротурбины, малая гидроэлектростанция и турбогенераторная установка с прогностическими регуляторами напряжения и скорости вращения ротора.

Цель исследований состояла в определении эффективности использования энергетических роутеров в изолированной системе электроснабжения для подключения накопителей электроэнергии и установок распределенной генерации, работающих на возобновляемых источниках энергии. Результаты компьютерного моделирования различных режимов работы позволили сформулировать следующие выводы. Применение энергетических роутеров для подключения к ИСЭС генерирующих установок на возобновляемых источниках энергии позволяет эффективно регулировать напряжение и частоту. В отличие от использования обычных силовых трансформаторов энергетические роутеры позволили получить следующие положительные эффекты: снизить провал частоты в сети 10 кВ при подключении дополнительной нагрузки; уменьшить время переходного процесса для частоты при кратковременном трехфазном коротком замыкании; значительно ограничить провалы напряжения и перенапряжения. Применение прогностических регуляторов скорости вращения ротора у генераторов ТГУ и малой ГЭС позволило убрать колебательность, снизить время переходного процесса и значительно уменьшить перерегулирование для частоты в режимах подключения дополнительной нагрузки и кратковременного короткого замыкания в сети ИСЭС даже при использовании обычных силовых трансформаторов. При резком уменьшении скорости ветра прогностические АРС дополнительно уменьшают колебательность, время переходного процесса и величину перерегулирования. Использование энергетических роутеров позволяет значительно уменьшить влияние на ИСЭС изменений генерируемой мощности установок РГ, работающих на возобновляемых источниках энергии.</jats:p>"

It is important to know the perceptual driving factors affecting the decision to drink in order to effectively improve the public acceptance of tap water. In this study, household water management practices and their influencing factors for Yangon city residents are revealed through questionnaires. Residence time in Yangon city is significantly associated with water consumption behaviour. Decisions for drinking come from organoleptic perception rather than important safety considerations. The future consumption of tap water is influenced by income and perception of overall quality. Preferred billing method is associated with education, family size, income and willingness to spend more for better quality water.</jats:p>",

Users can read the consumed volume using a smartphone application. This stimulates a more rational way of using water, besides enabling alerts for leaks in pipes, faucets, showers and toilets. The accuracy of this sensor was compared with a mechanical flow meter and an ultrasonic sensor in the laboratory, all presenting errors smaller than 10% of readings for water flow above 2 L/min. The quality of the ZigBee network was analysed, in terms of interference with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth devices and a microwave oven, to assess if there are data losses in the sensor network and only Bluetooth caused losses, showing robustness in the combined ZigBee and Wi-Fi.</jats:p>",

Markups typically rise during periods of peak demand, but this historical relationship explains only part of the large increase during the pandemic. We present evidence that pandemic-related labor market frictions and operational bottlenecks contributed to unusually inelastic credit supply, and that technology-based lenders, likely less constrained by these frictions, gained market share. Rising forbearance and default risk did not significantly affect rates on “plainvanilla” conforming mortgages, but it did lead to higher spreads on mortgages without government guarantees and loans to the riskiest borrowers.

The central parts of a UV-disinfection device are the UV lamps. Despite their importance, their characterisation and quality assurance is far from being a matter of course and had not been regulated so far. This holds especially with regard to their temperature behaviour. The UV radiation (UVR) emittance of Mercury-Low-Pressure- and Amalgam-Low-Pressure-lamps (LP-lamps) depends on temperature. Each lamp type has its own optimal temperature where UVR emittance is highest. At lower or higher temperatures, UVR emittance is reduced. Additionally LP-lamps do not emit homogeneously along their length and this emission profile can change with temperature. In this paper, we present a standardized method to measure the UVR emittance of LP-lamps along the length in water in dependence of water temperature. This method has been included in the updated Austrian standard ÖNORM M 5873-1 (2020) and in the new release DIN 19294-1 (2020). With this method, the UVR emittance of LP-lamps can be characterized and different types of lamps can be compared.</jats:p>",

To this end, based on the requirement analysis of the hydrogen fuel cell gas supply system, this paper focuses on the genetic algorithm optimization PID control strategy of the hydrogen fuel cell gas supply system. The simulation model is built on the Matlab/Simulink platform and compared with the conventional PID algorithm in the model. The simulation results show that the comprehensive index of PID control algorithm optimized by genetic algorithm is better than that of conventional PID algorithm, which proves the improvement effect of the proposed control strategy on the dynamic response of the gas supply system.</jats:p>",

China increased imports and decreased exports of this personal protective equipment, removing supplies from world markets. Shortages led to European Union and US export controls as well as other extraordinary policy actions, including a US effort to reserve supplies manufactured in China by a US‐headquartered multinational. By April 2020, China's exports had mostly resumed, and over the rest of the year its export volumes surged. But China's export prices also skyrocketed and remained elevated through 2020, reflecting severe and continued shortages. This paper explores these and other government actions, such as US trade war tariffs and US industrial policy in the form of over $1 billion of subsidies to build out its domestic personal protective equipment supply chain, as well as potential lessons for future pandemic preparedness and international policy cooperation.</jats:p>",

Collars were examined in two asymmetrical shapes with dimensions of and at three levels of installation relative to the bed: at bed level itself, and at 1 and 2 cm above the bed. The results revealed that the presence of the collar not only reduced the ultimate scouring depth but also delayed the formation of the scouring hole. This impact was observed to be greater as the size of the collar increased. In addition, lowering the alignment of the collars can lead to their better performance and efficiency in the cost of the design. Therefore, collars installed on the bed surface indicated good performance in controlling scour. On the other hand, once the flow characteristics around the bridge pier with and without collar were examined, it was determined that affecting the downstream flow reduces the strength of the vortices and changes the reciprocating behavior and the displacement of the vortices.</jats:p>",

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is the method used in this system, determine the results of relative proximity to the ideal solution so that it can produce priority values ​​from several areas. This method was chosen because it considers the distance to the positive ideal solution and the distance to the negative ideal solution by taking relative proximity to the positive ideal solution. Based on the comparison to the relative distances, an alternative priority arrangement can be reached. Based on the comparison to the relative distances, an alternative priority arrangement can be reached.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this research work is to provide supply chain managers with a formal and generalizable approach that furnishes accurate guidelines to achieve a 2D performance integrating both Lean and Green. Despite the fact that several research works have been conducted in the framework of Lean and Green, at a conceptual level, the relationship between both paradigms is still ambiguous. Furthermore, the literature revealed a lack of relevant and generalizable approaches that explicitly demonstrate how to successfully implement Lean and Green in a relevant and integrated way. Since risks are the main obstacles disrupting performance, this research work addresses the identified gap by proposing a risk management approach (RMA) for Lean Green performance in a supply-chain context. Risk cannot be managed if not well-identified; hence, a rigorous literature investigation was conducted to define this concept in a supply-chain context. Later, risk was introduced into Lean and Green aspects. Subsequently, through a comprehensive review of previous risk identification studies, a novel classification of supply chain risks in a Lean Green context was provided. At a corporate level, risks often include several sources that cannot be treated at once. Therefore, a risk assessment analysis was performed, employing an analytic hierarchy process for its ease of use and broad adaptability. The output of this analysis provides visibility for an organization’s position toward performance goals and underlines crucial risks to be addressed. The risk treatment process was upgraded in this approach to a detailed analysis that aims at investigating the root causes behind the prioritized risks. Deployment of the approach on a corporate level revealed that treating a risk may negatively affect treating another. Indeed, thinking Lean is not necessarily Green, which stands with the fact that Lean Green supply chain challenges may outstrip classic optimization methods and techniques; therefore, its management requires innovative approaches. Thereby, our findings support the applicability and efficiency of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) in this setting. Although the case study focused on a specific company, the developed framework can be customized to fit different cases.</jats:p>"

In post‐industrial societies ‘old’ class divides on economic issues coexist with ‘new’ class alignments on cultural topics. While there is cumulated evidence of social classes’ distinct placement on these issues, this paper argues that the strength of class divides depends on the extent to which these issues are politicized by political parties. Studying preferences on economic and cultural issues (attitudes towards redistribution, immigration, gay rights and European integration), this study shows that class divides in preferences are context dependent. The multilevel analyses drawing on data from the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey for 27 European democracies demonstrate that classes’ differences in preferences are accentuated on issues strongly contested and emphasized by parties, and mitigated on issues where party conflict is weaker. Adding to recent literature on parties and class conflict, this study identifies another stage at which parties can affect the strength of class voting. The varying strength of class divides across contexts also has implications for parties’ ability to garner support beyond a single class. This becomes increasingly unlikely in contexts of high issue politicization.</jats:p>",

The results show that when making quality investment decisions, the survival‐seeking supplier focuses on financial constraints, whereby large constraints pressure the firm to invest more in quality innovation. By contrast, profit‐seeking suppliers are encouraged by a large potential market. Investment‐sharing contracts are proven to facilitate \"win‐win\" vertical R&amp;D cooperation in the supply chain.

The heat exchanger system provides the energy to the water to be treated in the daytime, while the concrete part provides the energy storage in the desalination evaporator at night time. The experimental test results showed that the increase of distilled water through the heating system is very important in comparison to the productivity of the conventional solar still. The obtained results indicate that the use of energy storage increases productivity by 50% in the nocturnal period. Indeed, the daily productivity of the concrete solar still, strongly affected by the heat transfer produced via concrete to the water evaporator, is presented in this study.

The main objective of this study is to develop a method for suppressing the rate of heat transfer to improve the reliability of a piston turbocharged engine. A brief review of the literature on improving the reliability of piston engines is given. Scientific and technical results were obtained on the basis of experimental studies on a full-scale model of a piston engine. The hot-wire anemometer method was used to obtain gas-dynamic and heatexchange characteristics of gas flows. Laboratory stands and instrumentation facilities are described in the article. The data on gas dynamics and heat exchange of stationary and pulsating air flows in gas-dynamic systems of various configurations as applied to the air supply system of a turbocharged piston engine are presented. A method of thermomechanical improvement of flows in the intake system of an engine based on a honeycomb is proposed in order to stabilize the pulsating flow and suppress the intensity of heat transfer. Data were obtained on the air flow rate and the local heat transfer coefficient both in the exhaust duct of the turbocharger compressor (i.e., without a piston engine) and in the intake system of a supercharged engine. A comparative analysis of the data has been carried out. It was found that the installation of a leveling grid in the exhaust channel of a turbocharger leads to an intensification of heat transfer by an average of 9%. It was found that the presence of a leveling grid in the intake system of a piston engine causes the suppression of heat transfer within 15% in comparison with the baseline values. It is shown that the use of a modernized intake system in a diesel engine increases its probability of failure-free operation by 0.8%. The data obtained can be extended to other types and designs of air supply systems for heat engines.</jats:p>"

The paper is devoted to studying the power supply system of an alumina refinery inLam Dong Province,Vietnam. The tasks that need to be solved for improving the power quality in the power supply system were analyzed. It was shown that non-linear loads significantly degrade the power quality that in turn leads to equipment damage, malfunction and decreasing the refinery productivity. Models of the refinery power supply system were developed and, using which, the quality of power was assessed at the 6 kV voltage utility bus of the power supply system, as well as at the 6 kV and 0.4 kV buses of distribution substations of individual refinery’s subdivisions. Analysis of the simulation findings showed that the nonlinear loads lead to significant distortions of sinusoidal forms of voltages and currents, and decreasing the power factor. Based on the simulation results, it was concluded that voltage harmonics and current harmonics at nonlinear load at the low voltage buses of 0.4 kV and at the buses of 6 kV exceed the permissible limits of the harmonics in accordance with IEEEST519-1992 international standard. Proposals were developed for improving the power quality in the refinery power supply system. For suppressing higher harmonics of current and voltage, it was recommended to use special power quality regulators in the alumina refinery power supply system. It was proposed to use active harmonic filters as the power quality regulators. The proposed solutions allowed obtaining practically sinusoidal forms of voltages and currents in the alumina refinery power supply system.</jats:p>"

Green logistics service supply chain (LSSC) operations play a significant role in reducing the environmental burden of the supply chain, and the risk preferences of logistics enterprises lead to more uncertainties in the green management of LSSC. Much research has been limited to case studies of green LSSC, and the different combinations of risk preferences among LSSC participants have generally been ignored. This paper investigates the impact of the risk preference on the equilibrium behavior of an LSSC composed of one logistics service integrator (LSI) and one logistics service provider (LSP) under fuzzy decision environments. Considering the fact that the greening innovation cost and the parameters of the demand function are all characterized as fuzzy variables, the games between the LSI and LSP with different risk preferences were comprehensively proposed under three scenarios. Then, the optimal decisions of the LSP and LSI were drawn, and numerical examples are presented. The results show that an optimistic risk attitude can appropriately improve the greening level, price, and green innovation cost of logistics services, while both risk appetite and risk aversion can lead to an increase in the outsourcing price. Moreover, when the decision maker is risk neutral, the partner’s risk attitude has a significant effect on the value of the decision variables and the cost. Finally, the optimal profits of different risk preference behaviors between the LSI and LSP vary among the game models under fuzzy environments. Subsequently, we obtained three management insights. Total involvement and cooperation among participants were vital factors for an improvement in green management in the LSSC. Additionally, risk preference plays a key role in how LSSC participants make decisions under fuzzy environments. Additionally, a dominant position in the LSSC plays a crucial role in generating profit.</jats:p>"

It may contribute to integrating variable renewable energy sources if production is sufficiently flexible in time. Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power sector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we find a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility. For lower shares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible small-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables and/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen supply chains gain importance, as they allow to temporally disentangle hydrogen production from demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial, followed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale hydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly through reduced renewable curtailment. Energy modelers and system planners should consider the distinct flexibility characteristics of hydrogen supply chains in more detail when assessing the role of green hydrogen in future energy transition scenarios.

Since there a limited research in the field of use social media in the supply chain, proposing the use of such platforms for third-world business might enable these enterprises to survive globally.  Exploratory case studies performed by authors to drill down and figure out the issues faced by their business and how these businesses are trying to survive. Case studies are used to learn more about studied issues and unfold the hidden one. The study proposes a model of how the socialized platforms could give more visibility and knowledge discovery tool along supply chain channel. The model is extended that incorporates supply chain challenges in developing countries and the significant role of social media in proposing solutions. The proposed model will merge to business operating in developing countries context. Since the adoption of ERP systems was not enough to optimize business performance there, the proposed value of using social media as the most affordable platform will enable transparent supply chain activities along the integrated pipeline. The study provides the interrelated perspective of supply chain challenges and proposed solutions to overcome such issues.  Many perceived values had been acknowledged of business such as more transparency with customers, prompt shipment notification or inventory drop, minimize supply chain risks and manage unfrozen external factors, working closely with multi-tier partners, optimize data exchange on day-to-day transactions. Social media could alert supply chain partners with potential risks. Prediction markets are proposed to adapt for better management.</p>",

When solving a mathematical model under various boundary conditions, there is a problem of the reliability of numerical calculations, therefore there is a need to solve the mathematical model by an analytical method. For example, a mathematical model of heat and mass transfer processes in a heat accumulator during its charging and discharging is solved analytically by the Green's function method, similarly, a mathematical model of heat carrier heating processes in solar collectors is solved. The specific definition of the Green's function corresponds to a specific problem in mathematical physics. Green's function contains complete information about the studied equation, and with its help one can construct a solution for any inhomogeneity. The development of the method of Green's functions for solving boundary value problems of unsteady heat conduction of generalized type on the basis of the Maxwell-Cattaneo-Lykov law is proposed. On the basis of the introduced Green's function of the differential equation, the Green's function of the boundary value problem is determined. Green's function of a boundary value problem is considered as an element of the set of Green's functions of an equation or a system of equations. Boundary conditions are formulated in accordance with the specified law. When considering specific problems, in a number of cases, it is expedient to transfer the integral form of writing boundary conditions of the second or third kind into a differential form equivalent to the integral one. The proposed integral relations for analytical solutions of boundary value problems of unsteady heat conduction for equations of hyperbolic type. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function of the boundary value problem are given and its analytical representation is given in terms of the fundamental system of solutions and boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are formulated for hyperbolic models of heat conduction in integral and differential forms. Boundary value problems for a semi-infinite region are considered, analytical solutions are obtained, their analysis is carried out, and temperature jumps at the heat wave front are calculated. Illustrative problems for a semi-infinite region are considered, and the heat wake region and the unperturbed region are described.</jats:p>"

If this issue is addressed in the management of sustainable building materials and waste management in the implementation of construction projects, in the context of sustainability, cost management and supply chain management affect the overall success of construction projects. The aspect of sustainability is based on reducing costs and, thus, also material items. At the same time, there is a focus on the use of waste or its economic and ecological disposal. Finally, sustainability means the setting up of logistics processes. Information and communication technologies can significantly help supply chain and cost management and construction waste management. This means, on the one hand, minimizing the consumption of materials and, thus, also costs, and on the other hand, by optimally setting up the supply chain and logistics, using materials and funds efficiently and optimizing waste management. The research discusses the impact of information and communication technology on a sustainable chain and cost management on various construction projects in Slovakia. The research aims to analyze information and communication technology’s influence on a sustainable chain and cost savings of waste in construction projects. The main research hypothesis is based on the assumption that information and communication technology positively affect sustainable chain and cost management of waste in the Slovak construction industry. Data collection was performed through an online questionnaire. It contained three primary areas of data collection: The first part contained questions about the characteristics of the research sample. The second concerned the use of information and communication technologies and the third pertained to their impact on sustainability and reducing the costs of the waste management process in construction. The research samples consisted primarily of foreign companies operating in Slovakia. From the point of view of the participants in the construction project, these were developers, contractors, sub-contractors and designers. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to confirm this hypothesis. The research provides an overview of information and communication technologies and their impact on supply chain and cost management of waste in construction.</jats:p>"

This research evaluates the incentive, which makes the DisCos in Nigeria prefer the estimating billing system to a much more efficient smart prepaid metering system. To carry out the research, four Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) customers were selected. The estimated bills of these customers, which they received before they got smart prepaid meters, were compared with their prepaid meter bills for an equal period. EEDC was found to be over-billing these customers under the estimated billing system by a yearly average per customer of 64,901.67 Nigerian Naira (170.79 USD).</jats:p>"

From 2012–2014, soils in northern Ontario James Bay lowlands were cultivated with bush beans and potatoes, grown in sole and intercropping configurations, in an open field and an agroforestry system enclosed by willow trees. The objective of this study was to compare the supply rates of 15 plant-available nutrients in these soils using in situ ion exchange membranes. After three years of cultivation, the agroforestry site had significantly greater supply of PO4, Ca, and Zn and these nutrients had positive correlations with yield. By contrast, the open site had significantly greater supply of Mg, SO4, and B; these nutrients, and Al, had negative correlations with yield. Whilst there were no differences between sole and intercropping configurations, significantly greater supply of NO3, Ca, Cu, Fe, and Zn occurred early in the growing season, compared to significantly greater supply of K, SO4, B, and Al later in the season. Significantly greater yields have been harvested in the agroforestry site and it is suspected that the presence of a willow shelterbelt improves the microclimate and plant-available PO4, Ca, and Zn.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to study and develop a new type of visual numerical simulation software for the transient process of pipeline network system. Firstly, the software architecture design is illustrated. Then, three tiers of software architecture, i.e., back-tier, middle-tier and front-tier, are studied and developed. Finally, the practical application procedure of the software is illustrated and the accuracy of calculation results is verified. The results indicate that the visual numerical simulation software is designed based on C/S architecture. The software architecture contains back-tier, middle-tier and front-tier. The back-tier includes the model and the algorithm. The middle-tier realizes the decoding of the topology of the pipeline network system and the interaction between the back-tier and the front-tier. The front-tier integrates the visual interface and pre-post processing. The main interface includes a menu bar, a visual modeling area and a parameter input dialog box. The software has the features of professionalization, visualization, generalization, modularization and intellectualization. The software can calculate the transient process for the pipeline network system of both, pressure flow without the pump and pressure flow with the pump. The physical laws reflected from the calculation results are correct. The calculation results are accurate.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, the track line, train operation and other large timescale subsystems are realized by the pure digital simulation. And the time-sensitive subsystems, such as train traction system, braking system, auxiliary power supply system and network system etc., are built by the semi-physical simulation.

Consumption concentration of particles is 0.094 kg / kg of air. Currently, one of the main directions of Ukraine's strategic development is to achieve energy independence. To achieve this, it is necessary to implement systems for the use of energy resources available in our country. Since a significant part of the country's economic activity is occupied by agricultural activities, the use of low-grade fuels, most of which are waste in this area, is relevant and profitable for economic and environmental reasons. Reconstruction of boilers, improvement of methods and ways of combustion in vortex furnaces of low-grade fuels will significantly reduce the consumption of imported natural gas and bring the country closer to the status of energy-independent state. coke burnout is 100%.

The indices of terms of trade for groundnut has shown mixed trend whereas for rapeseed &amp; mustard trend remained favourable from 1996-97 to 2010-11. The ratio of index of procurement prices to index of input prices for rapeseed &amp; mustard was more than one during this period reached to as high as of 165 in 2003-04 over the base of 100 in 1996-97. Like rapeseed &amp; mustard, terms of trade for soybean cultivation in Baran was found favourable for about a decade (1996-97 to 2008-09) and afterward had shown mixed trend of ups and downs. The decline in indices can be attributed to relatively higher rate of increase in prices of inputs than of output prices. Based on the study it was suggested to conduct regular studies for better understanding the trend in prices of farm inputs and outputs that will help in revising the existing policies with confidence. To remove the disparity between ‘prices received and paid’, concerted efforts should be made to maintain the parity, which will help farmers in buying inputs and other items of household consumption.</jats:p>"

The cluster analysis produced impact scores with five cluster centers that grouped countries with similar key compound indicators and impact scores. Three countries (Gambia, Libya, &amp; Mauritius) were classified as outliers. Libya presented a unique case with the highest impact score on energy input for raw water abstraction, associated with largescale pumping from deep groundwater aquifers. Multivariate analysis of the key indicators for 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are either water-secure or water-stressed illustrate the relative impact of drivers on energy input for municipal water supply.

Using input–output tables from the EORA dataset, our contribution is threefold. First, we conceptually revise the approache to analyse input–output relationships and underline the difference between the bilateral flow of value added and trade and distinguish between the producers and consumers of value‐added. Second, we distinguish between the supply and demand channels through which these countries can be affected by the disruptions in GVCs. Third, we apply this empirical exercise on an understudied region, namely the Mediterranean region that is characterised by its involvement in several trade agreements that might boost their integration into GVCs. Our main findings show that, first, most of the countries have relatively larger backward GVC linkages than forward ones. Second, in the Northern shore of the Mediterranean, Italy and France are net suppliers of value added since they produce more value‐added absorbed abroad than the foreign value‐added they consume. Third, our results highlight also the limited integration between Southern shore partners, whose integration is almost completely driven by linkages with Southern European developed countries.</jats:p>",

Our previous works highlighted that the influence of nitrogen can strongly vary regarding plant cultivar/pathogen strain combinations, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The present work aims to explore how nitrogen supply can affect the molecular physiology of <jats:italic>P. brassicae</jats:italic> through its life epidemiological cycle. A time-course transcriptome experiment was conducted to study the interaction, under two conditions of nitrogen supply, between isolate eH and two <jats:italic>B. napus</jats:italic> genotypes (Yudal and HD-018), harboring (or not harboring) low nitrogen-conditional resistance toward this isolate (respectively). <jats:italic>P. brassicae</jats:italic> transcriptional patterns were modulated by nitrogen supply, these modulations being dependent on both host-plant genotype and kinetic time. Functional analysis allowed the identification of <jats:italic>P. brassicae</jats:italic> genes expressed during the secondary phase of infection, which may play a role in the reduction of Yudal disease symptoms in low-nitrogen conditions. Candidate genes included pathogenicity-related genes (“NUDIX,” “carboxypeptidase,” and “NEP-proteins”) and genes associated to obligate biotrophic functions of <jats:italic>P. brassicae</jats:italic>. This work illustrates the importance of considering pathogen’s physiological responses to get a better understanding of the influence of abiotic factors on clubroot resistance/susceptibility.</jats:p>"

In the present study, three situations were studied: a rectangular pier without a cable (type I), a rectangular pier with a cable that has a diameter equal to 10% of the pier diameter, and a cable twist angle of 15 degrees (type II), and a rectangular pier with a cable 15% of the pier diameter and an angle of twist of 12 degrees (type III). Tests were carried out with different flow-approach angles: zero, 5, 10, and 15 degrees. Dimensional analysis based on the π Buckingham method was performed. Then, the effect of different parameters, and their importance for estimating scour depth was investigated. Piers with an angle of 15 degrees with respect to the direction of flow had the greatest depth of scouring. Cables can reduce scour depths at this angle; for the second and third classes of piers, the scouring is 10 and 22% compared to the first pier classification. For the second type of pier, angles of 5, 10, and 15 degrees led to increases in scouring depths of 3, 21, and 37% compared to the zero-angle situation.</jats:p>",

Managing construction projects supply chain, which is traditionally void of transparency, has led to issues of corruption, vested interest, clientelism, ghosting, bid rigging and poor professional ethical standards. The centralized nature of data management in the construction industry is characterized by the lack of visibility and transparency of details and this lack of visibility is a major cause of inefficiency in construction project delivery. The objective of the paper is to assess the indicators for adaptability of projects supply chain using blockchain technology. The article adopts a bibliometrix strategy to extract qualitative data from existing peer-reviewed articles. The research design is a combination of different approaches, including bibliometric and visualization, bibliometric and content analysis, as well as bibliometric, visualization and content analysis. Data was obtained from articles indexed on SCOPUS and Web of Science. R-studio was used for data analysis, while VosViewer was used for visualization. The paper is a part of an on-going research. The research is exploratory and adopts a pragmatist approach. The research is expected to develop a framework that will introduce transparency and provenance in projects supply chain using blockchain technology. Findings from this review show that there are indicators for adaptability of construction projects supply chain using blockchain.</jats:p>",

A considerable challenge in this respect is the significance of contamination at a junction. Beside the population affected and the volume of the contaminated water consumed, importance of each junction is a parameter that must be taken into account in placing the sensors. This parameter directly concerns the service provided by each junction as well as the sensitivity and social consequences of junction contamination. The present study defines a new objective function for minimizing the effect of junction contamination with respect to its importance. Using a robust approach, this study applied the NSGA-III algorithm to solve a 5-objective problem. The algorithm was tested on a hypothetical network and a benchmark network and the Pareto response was selected for each scenario based on the slope of the different points. The proposed method suggested 12, 12, and 11 sensors for the three scenarios in the hypothetical network. The results show that sensor placement by this method yielded good performance in comparison with the other solutions presented in a benchmark network.</jats:p>",

Drawing on notions from the regulatory and sociology literature, i.e. transparency and normativity, and by interviewing anti-slavery activists and experts, this study explores the limitations of the disclosure and transparency requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act and, more specifically, how anti-slavery activists experience and interpret the new regulations and the regulators’ implementation of the regulation. This research found limited confidence among anti-slavery activists regarding the Act’s call for transparency in relation to the elimination of slavery from global supply chains. The research also found that the limits of the transparency provisions within the Act appear to hinder the attainment of normativity. This study provides new and unique insights into the critical role that social activists play in exposing the lack of corporate transparency and failures of responsibility to protect workers within global supply chains.</jats:p>",

Therefore, growing conditions have significant pharmaceutical and economic importance for <jats:italic>Cannabis sativa</jats:italic>. Phosphorous is an essential macronutrient that affects central biosynthesis pathways. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that P uptake, distribution and availability in the plant affect the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. Two genotypes of medical “drug-type” cannabis plants were grown under five P concentrations of 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (ppm) in controlled environmental conditions. The results reveal several dose-dependent effects of P nutrition on the cannabinoid profile of both genotypes, as well as on the ionome and plant functional physiology, thus supporting the hypothesis: (i) P concentrations ≤15 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> were insufficient to support optimal plant function and reduced photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance and growth; (ii) 30–90 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> P was within the optimal range for plant development and function, and 30 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> P was sufficient for producing 80% of the maximum yield; (iii) Ionome: about 80% of the plant P accumulated in the unfertilized inflorescences; (iv) Cannabinoids: P supply higher than 5 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> reduced Δ<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) concentrations in the inflorescences by up to 25%. Cannabinoid concentrations decreased linearly with increasing yield, consistent with a yield dilution effect, but the total cannabinoid content per plant increased with increasing P supply. These results reveal contrasting trends for effects of P supply on cannabinoid concentrations that were highest under &amp;lt;30 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> P, vs. inflorescence biomass that was highest under 30–90 mg L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> P. Thus, the P regime should be adjusted to reflect production goals.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy sector is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, making the adoption of sustainable supply chain practices crucial for reducing its carbon footprint. This paper presents a framework for implementing sustainable supply chain practices in the energy industry, aimed at minimizing environmental impact while maintaining operational efficiency. The framework integrates key principles of sustainability, focusing on resource optimization, emissions reduction, and circular economy practices. Central to this framework is the adoption of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient technologies, and low-carbon transportation methods throughout the supply chain. To effectively reduce the carbon footprint, companies in the energy sector must prioritize sustainability at every stage of the supply chain—from raw material sourcing to production, distribution, and end-of-life management. The framework emphasizes the importance of adopting clean technologies such as electric vehicles, energy-efficient manufacturing processes, and carbon capture and storage systems to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, promoting transparency and collaboration among suppliers, manufacturers, and customers is critical for ensuring that sustainability goals are met across the entire supply chain. Data analytics and digital tools are also integral to optimizing supply chain operations and improving sustainability outcomes. These technologies enable real-time monitoring of emissions, waste, and resource usage, providing companies with actionable insights to further reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, integrating circular economy practices—such as recycling and reusing materials—ensures that resources are used efficiently, waste is minimized, and products are disposed of responsibly.The paper also explores the role of policy frameworks and regulatory requirements in driving sustainability in energy supply chains. Governments and international organizations can play a pivotal role by setting standards, offering incentives, and promoting best practices to encourage companies to adopt green supply chain strategies. Ultimately, the adoption of sustainable supply chain practices in the energy sector is essential for achieving long-term environmental goals and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.</jats:p>"

The Indonesian Citrus and Subtropical Fruits Research Institute (ICSFRI) between 2018 and 2020, distributed 296,297 certified citrus commercial seedlings for East and Central Java provinces. Meanwhile, an evaluation of the program showed that it is applicable as a reference to improve and forecast stability in citrus fruit supply. This study was conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics, meanwhile, a total of twenty citrus varieties were distributed. The main variety distributed in East and Central Java were tangerine cv Pontianak and mandarin cv Batu55 respectively, while three regencies in East Java and two in Central Java were sampled as the study locations, thereafter, a total of 73 beneficiary farmers were selected as respondents. The result showed that the death rate for distributed seedlings was relatively low, with the tangerine cv Pontianak indicating the highest death compared to mandarin cv Madura. This implies that the supply of tangerine and mandarin is expected to increase approximately by three thousand tons within the next two to three years. Besides this amount is predicted to consitute 3% of import in 2019. However, to actualize this, improvement in water availability, weather forecast, as well as farmer empowerment need to be considered to meet up with citrus supply, both in quantity and quality.</jats:p>",

This has impaired the systems integration and connectivity among the modes of transport in a region. In the United Kingdom, High Speed 2, a large-scale railway project with a planned completion date in 2033, affects many transport stakeholders. The project influences the existing transport systems, but the transport systems integration design has not been well depicted, resulting in a pressing concern on systems connectivity and social value. This is evident by many public protests along the planned route of the project.

Focusing on Indonesia’s Riau province, I show how transboundary publics and geographically dispersed users of peatland resources collectively engage in environmental stewardship around sustainable forms of peatland development and activities aimed at mitigating the socio‐ecological costs of growth. The paper explores three types of peatland commons centred on social agroforestry using paludiculture (wet cultivation) techniques, fire mitigation strategies, and green supply chains around sustainable peatland products. I argue that while these market‐based commons are still in their infancy, they inscribe a specific set of transboundary governance relationships that seek to reform rather than resist capitalism by promoting both the protective and productive functions of carbon‐rich peatlands as profitable environmental goods of public value.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of local exhaust ventilation systems continues to be the most reliable way to capture pollutants in the technological processes of various industries. The main purpose of the application of local exhaust ventilation systems is the effective capture of pollutants in the places of their formation. Improving the efficiency of local exhausts and, accordingly, reducing the load of general ventilation can be achieved through the use of air screens. For baths filled with liquids most often used activated on-board suction pumps that operate on the scheme of \"jet-suction\", which are structurally located on the same axis of the supply nozzle and slotted drain. According to this principle of operation, various activated extractors require air exchange in large volumes with significant energy consumption and at the same time with insufficiently high sanitary and hygienic indicators. In order to increase the efficiency of the local ventilation system, especially for tanks with large open surfaces, fundamentally new aerodynamic schemes are required, the feature of which is the formation of dynamic screens with inflow and rotation flows. On the basis of analytical research the basic possible variants of the device of the two-level air-jet screen of an industrial bath by drawing up balance equations for achievement of the maximum efficiency factor η are considered. The analysis of theories of interactions of inflow jets, suction flares and convective flows from liquid surfaces is carried out. The aerodynamic problem of a flat turbulent flow is considered, in which inflow jets interact with a 180 ° expansion, forming a two-level closed rotating system with concentrated flow, which is affected by convective flows with harmful substances from an industrial bath. The assumptions and calculations confirmed the fundamental possibility of using a system of two-level air-jet screens for large baths.</jats:p>"

In order to analyze the influence of different scenario combination models on the microgrid energy storage dispatching strategy, taking the residential user microgrid system as an example, a microgrid dispatching problem environment model was constructed. In the case of changes in multiple factors such as power generation and load, the coordinated control of compound energy is a complex optimization decision-making problem. Different schemes may affect the stability of the system’s power supply, utilization efficiency and economic benefits. To this end, this article uses three deep reinforcement learning algorithms and compares them with experiments. The results show that there are obvious differences in the ability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to converge to the optimal strategy, but it also proves the feasibility and effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in the coordinated control of composite energy storage problems, which has strong academic significance and engineering value, and can be used to deal with similar problems.</jats:p>",

Sentul City, which is an independent city in Bogor Regency which has a high population, is in an area that lacks water, because of this Sentul City requires infrastructure and policies that are able to ensure the availability of water for its residents. One of the paradigms of water management in urban areas is a water sensitive city. One of the steps in this paradigm is wastewater management and rainwater harvesting. The dynamic system modelling method is used to predict the impact of implementing several policies that will be taken to manage water resources. The objectives of this study are to build dynamic models to predict water supply and demand and to analyze policies for wastewater management and rainwater harvesting. Sentul City water demand is estimated will reach 122 105 000 m3 and a water crisis will occur in 2027. The wastewater recycle policy can inhibit the water crisis until 2030 and the negative water balance will last until 2040. Combining wastewater recycle and rainwater harvesting can increase water availability by 240% and prevent a water crisis.</jats:p>"

The controller plays an important role in achieving stabilization of reverse osmosis (RO) systems to guarantee the desired water product and concentration. The super-twisting (STW) sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm guarantees performance while reducing chattering. Supposing that all the state variables are not available by sensors, the observer is implemented to provide state estimation. Since smart operations depend on control algorithm and sensor availability, the proposed strategy provides robustness to ensure the water productivity even under uncertainties or under failure of sensors. The robustness is guaranteed by active controller where 80% of disturbance is eliminated in product water flow and that of product water quality is approximately 95%. As well, the state observer can produce precise predictions of the unmeasured states. Sliding mode control with observer provides the system with stability, while assuring better performances against uncertainties. Finally, the active controller with state estimator can guarantee a robust control strategy and monitoring system to extend the life of the filters and membranes, while ensuring sustainability. This control strategy is highly recommended for smart operations of desalination plants.</jats:p>",

The experiment was laid out as 3 x 4 x 2 factorial in a split-split plot design with three replicates. Data were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at p =.05. Albizia lebbeck amended plots consistently had significantly higher values in 2014, 2015 and combined means (12.8 kg ha-1, 13 kg ha-1, 12.9 kg ha1) of cob length, (345.8 kg ha-1, 311.8 kg ha-1, 328.8 kg ha-1) of grains per cob and grain yield (2097.3 kg ha-1, 1667.7 kg ha-1, 1881.9 kg ha-1) throughout the cropping seasons and combinedeffect respectively compared to Parkia biglobosa. Positive significant correlation was experienced between the growth and yield components. Inclusion of nitrogen fertilizer and fertilizer trees improved the production of these maize varieties compared to control.

Because of climate change, the availability of water in cities will undergo changes in the next decades. As urban trees have a very positive influence not only on microclimate but also on biodiversity and life quality in general, they need to be protected. Thus, we need to know how to measure and calculate the availability of water for street trees to optimize their site conditions and water supply. This study presents Hydro-Pedo-Transfer Functions (HTPFs) for predicting water supply and actual evapotranspiration of street trees for varying urban conditions. The HTPFs are easy to use, and the input parameters can either be mapped easily or taken from local climate agencies or soil surveys. The first part of the study focuses on the theoretical background and related assumptions of the HTPFs for predicting water supply, and on obtaining the potential and actual evapotranspiration of urban street trees using easily available data. The second part gives information and exemplifies how this input data can be measured, mapped, or predicted. Calibration of the HTPFs were done using the sap-flow measurements of three Linden trees (Tilia cordata). Exemplarily, the HTPF scenarios for the varying urban site conditions of Berlin are presented. The water supply and actual evapotranspiration of the street trees severely depend on the local climate (summer rainfall and potential evapotranspiration), site conditions (catchment area, soil available water, and degree of sealing), and on the tree characteristics (species, age, and rooting depth). The presented concept and the equations build a good and flexible frame that is easy to program using a spreadsheet tool or an R script. This tool should be tested and validated also for other cities and climate regions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, 75% of emergencies at power supply facilities are caused by single-phase ground faults. The currently used methods of thermal imaging and ultrasonic testing do not allow accurately identify the cause of accidents in electric power distribution systems. The current search generators, due to their low power, cannot cover the entire section of the diagnosed network. The article suggests the use of digital technologies for the intelligent diagnostics of the insulation of power supply system with insulated neutral in the operating mode, allowing on-line diagnostics of the network and analyzing the data obtained for the early prevention of emergency situations. In order to avoid disconnecting sections and diagnose the system in operating mode, it is proposed to check the system using a currentlimiting capacitor, which will be connected to the live parts of each phase under voltage and accurately determine the location of a single-phase short circuit for any number of feeders. The relevance of these studies is due to the fact that, for example, during two years at one of the manufactures 19 emergencies related to single-phase ground faults were recorded. Four of these cases led to a complete stop of the production. Therefore, the development of digital technologies for the implementation of smart diagnostics of the insulation of an energized power supply system with insulated neutral will be of interest to practitioners, scientists, researchers, graduate students and other specialists seeking to study the latest achievements in smart agribusiness for their subsequent application in the real world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply of domestic hot water (DHW) on college and university campuses is indispensable and is also one of the main components of campus energy consumption. The density of residential patterns and similar occupancy behavior of college students make it economical to use centralized systems to cover the DHW demand, and utilization of solar energy can make the systems more economical. Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) is a promising key technology that can minimize the imbalance between the availability of solar energy and thermal energy demand. In this paper, a solar-assisted ground-coupled heat pump (SAGCHP) system that meets the DHW demand of 960 students was investigated by means of dynamic simulation and energy-economic analysis. The simulation results in terms of the underground heat balance are compared with a standalone GCHP system and a SAGCHP system without STES. Results show that heat recharging operations during university summer and winter breaks (when there are minimal students on campus) lead to improved underground heat balance and energy performance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on system performance was carried out by varying solar collector arrays. It was found that there exists an optimal value of solar collector area to achieve the lowest system lifecycle cost (LCC).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes the dynamics of supply chain diversification in a contested East Asia and their implications for India–South Korea cooperation in the post-COVID-19 era. Major powers have sought to restructure supply chain by designing a strategy to reduce their reliance on China-controlled supply chain. The United States–China trade and technological war, Asian regional powers’ escalating conflicts with a rising China, and pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions have played key roles in driving the restructuring process. India and South Korea, Asia’s two major economies, have also re-evaluated their supply chain strategies. As this paper explains, on the one hand, India has been striving to emerge as a supply chain hub for key industries by ending China’s control. On the other hand, South Korea has also been aiming to diversify its supply chain beyond China under the New Southern Policy. Against that backdrop, critical developments concerning supply chain cooperation have occurred between the two countries amid the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has not only facilitated the opening of high-level political exchanges on supply chain but also brought tangible outcomes, as Korean companies have become active participants in India’s quest to build an India-centric supply chain. I conclude this study by contending that the two countries are “natural partners” in reshaping the supply chain dynamics in East Asia in the post-COVID-19 era.</jats:p>",

A self-designed questionnaire developed and distributed to the subjects using stratified sampling technique, and the data obtained has been presented in frequency and percentage. The results obtained revealed that, there is a scarcity of portable water supply to households in Kano metropolis. The problem emanated from lack of pipe-borne water which necessitated the dependence of the house-holds water supply on vendors that obtained water from boreholes and some hand-dug wells lacking proper hygienic practices. More so, the respondents were willing to pay for pipe borne water delivery, yet, they depend on vendors as their major water suppliers as alternatives.

The aim was to analyse the contextual shortfalls that undermine the effectiveness and sustainability of private operators (PO) in water supply. POs had limited capacity to manage affairs of the water supply systems (WSS). Specifically, their skills were lacking to manage the electromechanical components of the systems, meter reading, and they exhibited poor customer care skills. Intermittent power supplies rendered the WSS unreliable. Solar systems were reported to have erratic frequencies and output which also ultimately resulted in inconsistent water supply. However, the POs hardly pursued corrective measures. The weak enforcement of regulatory policies propagated non-uniformity in tariff implementation approaches across districts contributing to lower willingness to pay. The POs’ focus on profits presents a unique challenge as they attempt to minimise energy expenses in a bid to widen profit margins. We conclude that the limited technical and managerial capacity of POs in running water supply systems is a critical cause of unsatisfactory service delivery to water users. Finally, the weak water governance and regulatory policy enforcement and the non-adherence to water tariff plans not only affect PO economies of scale but also hamper efficient service delivery.</jats:p>",

Combined with a multi-choice goal programming model, the ideal cooperation coefficient between urbanization and water resources utilization efficiency in each provincial region was calculated under the condition of a coordination equilibrium. The results show that the urbanization level of China's provincial regions is uneven. The urbanization level of the eastern coastal developed areas is the highest, followed by the central area, and the western area is the lowest. Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Beijing and Shandong are at a high level of urbanization. The total factor productivity (tfp) of two-thirds of the provincial regions changed to be &amp;gt;1. During the observation period, water use efficiency of most provinces in China improved. The distribution characteristics of urbanization level and water resources utilization efficiency are not consistent. There is no mutually beneficial relationship between urbanization and water resources utilization in most provincial regions. In a few areas, there is a partial benefit cooperation relationship between them. There is a mutually beneficial relationship in a few regions but the level of coordination in the provincial Chinese mainland is relatively low, and needs to be improved.</jats:p>",

However, subsidy fraud often occurs, such as misreporting cost information to secure subsidies. Inspired by this, our study aims to explore the optimal decision-making problem of the three-level (government + enterprises + farmers) poverty alleviation supply chain under asymmetric cost information. Four-stage models are constructed to capture the interactions among these three players. Additionally, numerical examples are used to analyze the implications of key parameters, such as cost coefficient and punitive measures coefficient, on supply chain members’ optimal decision and profit. Our findings demonstrate that both the enterprise and the farmer can obtain maximum profit from the misreporting behavior. Unfortunately, this behavior always damages the profit of other participants and weakens the efficiency of subsidy policy. Moreover, to mitigate the negative implication of misreporting behavior, the government can establish punitive measures to curtail misreporting. Our work provides important policy implications for governments and enterprises. To ensure that more consumers have access to poverty alleviation products, government organizations should prioritize such projects. In addition, the provision of public facilities and technical guidance should be more effective and prompt to share enterprises’ and farmers’ costs. We further recommend that subsidy policies be formulated according to recipients’ performance in poverty alleviation projects, with corresponding supervision and punitive measures. Finally, in cooperating with farmers in poverty alleviation, enterprises should maximize their interests and reduce costs through technological innovation and channel sharing.</jats:p>"

This study was aimed to investigate the fish species availability, supply chain, quality loss, price behavior and constrains associated with fish marketing in order to provide better suggestion for efficient fish marketing in Jamalpur district of Bangladesh. Data were collected form Sadar upazila markets by using a structured interview schedule, focus group discussions (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII) with the stakeholders involved in supplying fish from farm to fork, such as- aratdars, retailers, and consumers during 2020-21. A total 78 fish species were found (72 Fresh water and 2 Marine water), among them 20 frequently, 17 less amount, 25 occasionally, and 16 species were rarely available in the market. It was estimated that 72% fish species were sourced from culture fishery whereas 28% were from capture fishery. About 91.5% fishes in Jamalpur markets were supplied locally, whereas rests were from other districts. The post-harvest quality losses of fish in the sampled markets were assessed which indicate that small indigenous species (SIS) spoiled quicker than medium to large sizes fishes due to different factors. The price behavior of the fish market influenced by the demand of the fish species, quality, size, catching sources (culture fishery or capture fishery) and the purchasing time (beginning, middle or last time of market). The study found positive correlation between the market price and fish quality. Several problems of fish market were identified resulting consumer dissatisfaction and financial losses for fish traders. Considering the importance of fish market to the economy, this study suggested to take necessary steps for establishing modern fish market to ensure the adequate quality maintenance of fish with efficient marketing.</jats:p>"

A systematic literature review is used to examine the breadth of the sustainable supply chain literature. The papers obtained are screened and analysed using established procedures to produce bibliometric and thematic analyses. The findings show the evolution of this young field around key research groups with few papers looking beyond focal firms to immediate suppliers and even fewer examining multiple tiers. Whilst numerous organisational factors are identified, few works consider most of them together and none capture their interrelationships at such breadth. Within this field lacking in theory, the originality of the work is the assembly of environmental and social practices into an integrated framework for their diffusion across supply chain tiers in the design and implementation of supplier development initiatives. There is recognition of where in the supply chain these practices are applied. The implications of this research are a framework around which supply chain diffusion theory can be tested and subsequent potential for its deployment in business to guide sustainable practice adoption.</jats:p>",

This paper examines a two-stage supply chain of e-commerce sales channels under different cooperative models. We find that consumers’ green preferences are the main factor that affects green product market demand. The manufacturer and the retailer can raise the levels of green technology innovation and extend green promotional services to expand product market demand in online and offline channels. However, consumers’ e-commerce preferences and online free-riding behaviors affect the manufacturer’s sales channel choice. The retailer can improve the level of green promotional services to hold offline channel market demand, while promotional behaviors have a positive/negative spillover effect on online market demand if the level of free riding falls above/below consumers’ e-commerce preferences. The higher the cooperative level is, the later the manufacturer will open the online channel and close the offline channel to ensure a high level of green promotional service from the cooperative retailer. The results show that the stronger the level of cooperation among all members is, the better the economic, ecological, and social benefits will be. Therefore, we design a revenue-cost sharing contract that can effectively motivate green technology innovation and green promotional services and afford all members win-win profits.</jats:p>"

The changes also affected seaports being the key links of maritime supply chains. The purpose of the research study described in this article was to identify the sources and kinds of disruptions observed in various maritime supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the operations of various types of seaport terminals, namely those serving bulk (universal, specialised) and general cargoes (universal, specialised). An additional purpose was to identify the dependencies between the type of terminal and its main function, and the tactical decisions adopted by the particular terminals. The research was carried out using the multiple-case study method. The study covered some selected port terminals functioning in Polish seaports (Gdańsk, Szczecin, Świnoujście), applying direct, semi-structured in-depth interviews. The analysis of the results was carried out using the inductive reasoning method. The research study has shown that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic some maritime supply chains ceased to exist, some of them were operating with decreased cargo volumes, while in other cases the transshipment volumes actually rose during the pandemic. Among terminal operators’ tactical responses to disruptions in maritime supply chains, there were pro-active and adaptive measures. Pro-active (offensive) measures included actions taken by an enterprise in order to engage in new maritime supply chains, and even participating in establishing new maritime chains in response to limitations caused by the pandemic. Adaptive (defensive) measures covered actions taken by the port terminals as a consequence of changes in the existing maritime supply chains, caused by the pandemic in the port’s foreland or hinterland. The research study results revealed that the terminals extent of engagement and tactical decisions related to the pandemic were depended on the type of terminal (universal or specialised) and its main function played within a supply chain.</jats:p>"

On the basis of this station, experimental studies of the influence of the operation of a solar power plant on the quality of energy at the consumer have been carried out. This study was carried out using a Fluke 345 power quality analyzer. The authors analyzed the experimentally obtained data on voltage changes and harmonic distortions at the consumer in two series of experiments (with a solar power plant in operation and with a solar power plant disconnected). On the basis of the analysis, conclusions were drawn about the reduction of peak voltage deviations at the consumer and a decrease in the total harmonic distortion factor when the solar power plant is operating. The relationship between voltage and harmonic distortion is described mathematically. Based on the results of the studies, conclusions were drawn about improving the quality of energy for an agricultural consumer when supplied with electricity from a grid solar power plant in parallel with a centralized grid.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the effect of the load factor of frequency converters and thyristor converters on electrical power quality. Recommendations for reducing the influence of higher harmonics and switching overvoltages on the characteristics of electrical power are provided. Higher harmonics were measured by a PKK57 complex device for controlling electrical parameters and a digital oscilloscope of the Tektronix TDS 2024V type. Impulse switching overvoltages were recorded by an active resistance divider of the DNEK-10 type and the above-mentioned oscilloscope. The obtained data were processed by the Loginom 6.4 software and the methods of mathematical statistics. The lower threshold level of the load factor of frequency converters and thyristor converters was set equal to 0.8, at which the sinusoidal distortion of voltage curves correspond to the RF standard of electrical power quality. The suppression degree of higher harmonics from the 5th to 17th frequency by power transformers with a capacity of 250–6,300 kV. A ranged from 95 to 45%. The use of the ‘transformer–converter–electric receiver’ system as applied to the power supply systems of mining and processing enterprises was substantiated. It was shown that electric motors with a capacity of up to 2,500 kW inclusively require protection against switching overvoltages. Conventional RC-absorbers based on RC-circuits connected to the terminals of electric motors are shown to be highly efficient for protecting electric motors against switching overvoltages. Thus, the quality of electrical power in power supply systems of mining and processing enterprises in Russia can be ensured by frequency converters and thyristor converters with a load factor of 0.8 or greater. Provided that the transformer capacity does not exceed 1,000 kV. A, a more efficient and less expensive ‘transformer–converter–electrical receiver’ system is recommended. Effective protection of electric motors of up to 2,500 kW inclusive can be provided using the proposed conventional RC absorber, which maintains the overvoltage rate at a level not exceeding 1.7.</jats:p>"

In order to reduce the water shortage and water spill in this region, a nonlinear optimization model for the joint operation of a system of a reservoir and two pumping stations is developed in this paper. In this model, the water supply of the reservoir and pumping volume of the pumping stations in each period are two types of decision variables, which are subjected to the annual available water in the reservoir, water rights of the two pumping stations and the operation rule of the reservoir. However, modern intelligent algorithms may fail in dealing with constraints of if-statements like the operation rule of the reservoir in this model. In light of the shortcoming of the classical genetic algorithm, a modified genetic algorithm is proposed by comparing the different methods for dealing with constraints. The modified algorithm shows a better adaptability to the operation rule. The modified genetic algorithm may provide a reference for similar modern intelligent algorithms to solve optimal water resources allocation for systems of multiple reservoirs and multiple pumping stations.</jats:p>",

Unusual water consumption may be due to a faulty water meter, fraudulent tampering with a water meter, or a leak in the water pipes within the consumer's property. We apply several anomaly detection methods to a real dataset of 22,877 mechanical water meters located in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. The dataset is unlabeled such that no discrimination is given for any meter whether it records a normal water consumption or not. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that abnormal water consumption (registered by a given water meter) can be identified based on previous records of water consumption measured by the same meter. We tested our hypothesis using well-known anomaly detection methods, namely: z-score (zs), local outlier factor (lof), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (dbscan), minimum covariance determinant (mcd), one-class support vector machine (ocsvm), and isolation forest (forest). In the settings of our experiments, we observed that zs, lof, ocsvm and forest support our hypothesis, contrasting with dbscan and mcd.</jats:p>",

A very good correlation between the rate of forming of the colmations and the concentration of bivalent iron was obtained, on the basis of which the maximum recommended flows and velocities were defined, which are in good agreement with the values from previous articles and studies. The effects of regenerations on yield and the total volume of extracted water (up to 2 times higher than in the case of no regeneration) were investigated using a mathematical and software model. A correlation was developed linking the ratio of the amounts of water extracted with and without regeneration, to the aquifer hydraulic resistance, the coefficient of local hydraulic losses reduction due to regeneration, and the number of regenerations. The factor equal to the square root of the number of regenerations increased by one was added to the expressions for the maximum recommended values of inlet velocities and flows per lateral. The differences in flows and extracted volumes between operating modes with constant flow between regenerations and a constant, minimal water level were also examined using the model. The ratio between the total extracted volumes when the drawdown is kept equal to maximum and when the flow between the regenerations is kept constant reaches up to 1.25.</jats:p>",

Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) is a standout amongst the most functional and major circuit elements within the analog and mixed-signal circuit style. It is additionally one of the more intricate cells to plan. Due to the rising performance of new generation MOS transistors, the complexity of integrated circuit is continuously increasing with time. The reduction in component sizing is one of the main reasons for integrating millions of transistors into a single chip. There is a great demand for battery powered equipment like a laptop, wireless communication, and implantable devices. In all these devices, it is essential to maintain low power dissipation to achieve good battery life and weight. The main feature of the research is to design a pseudodifferential transconductor circuit for a low supply voltage application with the targeted gain greater than 20 dB using Mentor Graphics software. The designs are done in Pyxis Schematic and Pyxis Layout using eldo platform for simulation to simulate the functionality of the transconductor circuit. From the postlayout simulation, with supply voltage of 1.2 V, the gain of 30 dB with cut-off frequency of 398 kHz has been achieved.</jats:p>",

Aging pipes are prone to failure, causing significant financial losses and service disruptions. The increasing number of aged pipes and limited budget for pipe rehabilitation or replacement necessitates water infrastructure asset management to ensure sustainable water supply services. In this study, contingent valuation was used to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) and value improved water supply services through the implementation of asset management. To estimate the WTP at the individual and county levels, we performed a nationwide survey including eight provinces and 24 counties/cities with distinct water supply service performances. At the individual level, the median WTP estimated using the double-bounded dichotomous choice model was 249.50 KRW/month (0.22 USD/month). The results showed that high-level satisfaction of customers with water supply services and positive price perception of water bills resulted in a high WTP. At the county level, decreasing water supply service performances were associated with a low WTP, indicating that proper interventions by local utilities are required to achieve sustainable water supply services. Our results provide a quantitative basis for decision-making in implementation of water infrastructure asset management.</jats:p>"

Conventionally, this challenge is addressed by adopting optimal groundwater pumping strategies. Currently, on Unguja Island (Zanzibar), urban freshwater is supplied by desalination, which is expensive and energy-intensive. Hence, desalinization cannot be afforded by rural communities. This study demonstrates that the innovative Kilimanjaro Concept (KC), based on rainwater harvesting (RWH) can remediate seawater intrusion in Unguja, while enabling a universal safe drinking water supply. The reasoning is rooted in the water balance of the whole island. It is shown that if rainwater is systematically harvested, quantitatively stored, and partly infiltrated, seawater intrusion will be reversed, and a universal safe drinking water supply will be secured. Water treatment with affordable technologies (e.g., filtration and adsorption) is suggested. The universality of KC and its suitability for small islands is demonstrated. Future research should focus on pilot testing of this concept on Unguja Island and other island nations.</jats:p>"

We build on normal accident theory (NAT), a multilevel theory describing the relationship between a firm's latent conditions (systemic managerial, technology, and social factors) and human errors. Latent conditions can have the unintended consequence of intensifying the impact of a human error, thus, we hypothesize a moderating effect of latent conditions on the relationship between errors and delivery delays. Hypotheses are tested using archival shipment data provided by a Fortune 500 company and archival carrier violations data. A multilevel design, with 299,399 shipments (level 1) nested within 97 carriers (level 2), was tested using mixed effects regression modeling. The results indicated that both dispatcher and driver errors were related to the probability of a late delivery, and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays. The moderating effects of several carrier latent conditions were significant and positive, indicating that both types of errors were more strongly associated with the likelihood of late delivery and that dispatcher errors were associated with longer delays when moderated by carrier latent conditions. The results are discussed from the perspective of NAT and technology management, developing prescriptions, and suggesting opportunities for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research suggests that increased reliance on digital sources (e.g., blogs, social media, online forums) exhibited by the emerging millennial workforce may affect procurement decisions. These arguments contend with studies which indicate that organizational buyers rely on decision shortcuts (e.g., brand, loyalty, and peer opinions) to mitigate risk or to simplify purchase decisions. One can argue that buyers gain more information from digital sources, which may attenuate the role of these shortcuts. At the same time, digital sources may be used to strengthen prior beliefs, which can increase bias toward decision proxies. This study draws from information processing theory to understand the role of digital sources of information in decision‐making, in the context of business purchasing. Based on the Accessibility‐Diagnosticity framework, we introduce a Digital Embeddedness construct to conceptualize the extent to which information from digital sources is integral to an individual’s decision‐making. Analysis of survey responses from 196 purchasing managers suggests that more digitally embedded buyers are more willing to adopt innovations, yet interestingly, focus more on vendors from strong brands and peer opinions. We also find that while more digitally embedded buyers feel more cognitively attached to their existing vendors, this attachment does not translate into purchase loyalty. We discuss implications for buyer‐supplier relations and B2B marketing. By elucidating individual‐level differences in the use of digital sources, this research also has implications for future work that examines the interpretation of digital information to inform business decisions. </jats:p>",

At present, China’s economy is facing severe environmental pollution and resource shortage, and recycling waste resources is the key for enterprises to obtain better development prospects, so the closed-loop supply chain model has become the focus of enterprises. For enterprises, the problem of recycling and manufacturing is also quite cumbersome and complex, the government can intervene to solve the problem, with subsidies to promote the recycling of waste goods. Therefore, this study mainly from the two-channel supply chain, closed-loop supply chain and government intervention three angles, to car tire recovery as the research object, using the relevant theory of the Stackelberg game to study the differences between channels. By constructing the model without government subsidy and the model with government subsidy, this paper studies the role of government subsidies in the recycling process of waste tires, and analyzes the influence of government intervention measures on the game among manufacturers, retailers and consumers. The results show that the government subsidy will improve the overall profit level, increase the total demand for tires in the market, and reduce the environmental impact of used tires. By using the theory of dual-channel closed-loop supply chain and other relevant knowledge, the concrete application of closed-loop supply chain in waste material recovery will be promoted.</jats:p>",

In this study, we compare geochemical parameters of bottled water from the great lakes region and seek to correlate mineralization, hydrochemistry and geological facies of the water reservoir. Based on the results obtained from major ions, trace elements and stable isotopes, 15 bottled waters were analyzed. Bottled waters show low mineralization and various chemical facies, with mainly the dominance of sodium due to the occurrence of alkaline granites in the East Africa region. Bottled water quality was evaluated using various classification systems. All bottled waters show low mineralization attributed to low rock-water interaction with granite, and to unconfined aquifer close to the surface fed by direct infiltration and possibly with high transit fractured circulation. In this region, the very high population density with high agricultural activities lead to strong anthropogenic conditions, but most of the bottled waters do not show any evidence of influence. However, this does not prevent regular control of water quality. Stable water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) highlighted the altitude of aquifers and waters origin of the bottled waters, which is linked to direct rainfall infiltration.</jats:p>",

In real-world systems, applying control techniques that need a large amplitude signal is impractical. In the literature, there is no study that considers the control of supply chain systems subject to control input limitations. To this end, in the current study, a new control scheme is proposed to tackle this issue. In the designed control input, limitations in control inputs, as well as robustness against uncertainties, are taken into account. The proposed scheme is equipped with a fixed time disturbance observer to eliminate the destructive effects of uncertainties and disturbances. Additionally, the super-twisting sliding mode technique guarantees the fixed-time convergence of the closed-loop system. After that, a symmetric supply chain system is presented, and its chaotic attractors are demonstrated. Finally, the proposed controller is applied to the symmetric supply chain system. Numerical simulations exhibit the proposed scheme’s excellent performance even though the system is subjected to control input limitations and time-varying uncertainties.</jats:p>"

The goal of the research was to assess what mutual relationships exist between insufficient drinking water supply and the socio-economic level of municipalities with less than 2000 inhabitants. The basis of the study is formed by data collected via a questionnaire survey of the mayors of 2110 municipalities. For the purposes of the analysis, the Drinking Water Supply Threat Index (DWSTI) composite indicator was established. Subsequently, the effect of selected factors on DWSTI was determined via correlation and regression analysis, and results were compared for two size groups of municipalities indicate water supply problems. The digging of new wells for individual needs is seen to be the most significant signal of problems. The absence of water supply infrastructure results in a heightening of the socio-economic deprivation of small municipalities, as it limits new building and becomes a limitation to their development. A solution is possible based on regional or trans-regional financial and managerial support of development together with an active approach on the part of municipalities.</jats:p>"

The vulnerability of public supply wells to water quality degradation may temporarily increase during these types of events. The Walkerton, ON, Canada, tragedy (2000) highlighted the threat to human health associated with the rapid transport of microbial pathogens to public supply wells during dynamic recharge events. Field research at the Thornton (Woodstock, ON, Canada) and Mannheim West (Kitchener, ON, Canada) well fields, situated in glacial overburden aquifers, identified a potential increase in vulnerability due to event-based recharge phenomena. Ephemeral surface water flow and local ponding containing microbial pathogen indicator species were observed and monitored within the capture zones of public supply wells following heavy rain and/or snowmelt. Elevated recharge rates beneath these temporary surface water features were estimated to range between 40 and 710 mm over two-week periods using analytical and numerical modelling based on the water level, soil moisture, and temperature data. Modelling also suggested that such events could reduce contaminant travel times to a supply well, increasing vulnerability to water quality degradation. These studies suggest that event-based recharge processes occurring close to public supply wells may enhance the vulnerability of the wells to surface-sourced contaminants.</jats:p>"

The component supplier intends to adopt new technologies to reduce production costs, but the new technologies usually require significant investment costs. The encroachment into retailing can bring more revenue to manufacturers, but the significant costs of establishing and maintaining direct channels and the potential conflicting interests with the retailer might discourage the manufacturer’s encroachment. This study aims to address these dilemmas facing the component supplier and manufacturer by investigating an interesting scenario in which they both can obtain benefits. Within the given context, the manufacturer’s encroachment increases the order of the components, which motivates the supplier to make more technological investments to reduce production costs. The reduction of component costs enables suppliers and manufacturers to reduce the wholesale prices of components and final products. In this case, the manufacturer’s encroachment can benefit both the manufacturer and the retailer. This study is one of the first to investigate how the interaction between the manufacturer and supplier helps solve their respective dilemmas and provide benefits to the whole supply chain.

Competition from quality-weighted universities in the same region as the focal university decreases the number of research and licensing agreements, although the highest-ranked 13.4% of universities benefit from the regional co-location of other high-quality universities for license income.

Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply–demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply–demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio‐demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot‐ and coldspots of supply–demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot‐ and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio‐demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate‐regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply–demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in “nature‐based” solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices.</jats:p>",

Among a series of environmental problems caused by shale gas exploitation, the most hidden and the most difficult part to control and recover is groundwater pollution in the development zone, which has been paid more and more attention by the government and the public. Starting from the shale gas exploitation process, this paper discusses the research status and problems of shale gas exploitation on groundwater pollution prevention and control from both international and domestic Chinese directions, and considers the future development of groundwater prevention and control work: to strengthen the supervision and management of wastewater treatment; to explore and evaluate shale gas resources and to plan regional water resources; to update and improve relevant environmental laws to strengthen the support for shale gas development; to make public supervision and development transparent; and to optimize the whole development process.</jats:p>",

Terdapat beberapa mobil yang disediakan oleh PT. Metito Indonesia, setelah tangki pada mobil di isi, maka mobil-mobil tersebut mengantarkan air sesuai dengan jadwal yang ditentukan ke berbagai daerah. Masalah yang terjadi adalah penjadwalan yang rumit dilakukan karena masih menggunakan aplikasi MS. Excel sehingga dengan banyaknya permintaan air bersih maka penjadwalan berubah-ubah dan hal ini sangat merumitkan PT. Metito Indonesia sehingga memperlambat proses pengelolaan data dan penyajian laporan. Oleh karena itu dibutuhkan sebuah sistem yang dapat membantu PT.

First of all, if calculated according to the accumulated hours of 8,760 hours of wet bulb temperature below 14°C (including 14°C), Guiyang City (moderate area) has a total of 4327 hours, accounting for 49.39% of the total. Zunyi City (a region with hot summer and cold winter) has a total of 4469 hours, accounting for 51.02% of the whole year. For areas with hot summer and warm winter, such as Xingyi City (a hot winter and warm area), a total of 4404 hours, accounting for 50.27% of the whole year. Weining County (an area with cool summer and cold winter) has a total of 6792 hours, accounting for 77.53% of the total. In addition, if it is in winter (December, January and February), when the wet bulb temperature is 14°c, the cooling hours for Guiyang, Xingyi, Zunyi and Weining are 2152h, 2159h, 2130h, 2160h, which accounting for 97.46%, 99.95%, 98.61% and 100% of the cooling hours in winter. With the help of the above data, we can find that, first of all, these cities have little difference in the number of cooling hours in different climate zones in winter, and they all have the possibility of adopting cooling tower cooling technology. Secondly, in the transitional season, when the wet bulb temperature is 14°c as the switching temperature, the cooling hours of Guiyang, Xingyi, Zunyi and Weining are 2175h, 2232h, 2339h, 3858h, respectively. It can be said that these cities have the possibility of adopting cooling tower cooling technology. It is worth mentioning that in the transitional season, the cool summer and cold winter areas represented by Weining have more obvious advantages in climate and energy saving using cooling tower cooling technology.</jats:p>",

The yield and area under rice production are also facing threats due to the consequences of climate change such as erratic rainfall and seasonal variation. Thus, the main aim of this work was to find out the supply response of rice in Malaysia in relation to both price and non-price factors. To achieve this target, time series analysis was conducted on data from 1970 to 2014 using cointegration, unit root test, and the vector error correction model. The results showed that the planted area and rainfall have a significant effect on rice production; however, the magnitude of the impact of rainfall is less conspicuous for off-season (season 2) rice as compared to main-season rice (season 1). The speed of adjustment from short-run to long-run for season-1 rice production is almost two-and-a-half years (five production seasons), while for season-2 production, it is only about one-and-a-half year (three production seasons). Consequently, the study findings imply the supply of water to be enhanced through better water infrastructure for both seasons. Moreover, the area under season 2 is continuously declining to the point where the government has to make sure that farmers are able to cultivate the same area for rice production by providing uninterrupted supply of critical inputs, particularly water, seed and fertilizers.</jats:p>"

Reusing treated wastewater for non-potable purposes is a promising opportunity toward the aforementioned resolutions. In this study, we present two optimization models for integrating reusing systems into existing sewerage systems to bridge the supply–demand gap in an existing water supply system. In Model-1, the supply–demand gap is bridged by introducing on-site graywater treatment and reuse, and in Model-2, the gap is bridged by decentralized wastewater treatment and reuse. The applicability of the proposed models is evaluated using two test cases: one a proof-of-concept hypothetical network and the other a near realistic network based on the sewerage network in Chennai, India. The results show that the proposed models outperform the existing approaches by achieving more than a 20% reduction in the cost of procuring water and more than a 36% reduction in the demand for freshwater through the implementation of local on-site graywater reuse for both test cases. These numbers are about 12% and 34% respectively for the implementation of decentralized wastewater treatment and reuse.</jats:p>"

This article mainly studies the intelligent control system in desert area based on photovoltaic microgrid power supply. The system uses shielded twisted pair to transmit signals, and electrostatic interference and electromagnetic induction interference are effectively suppressed. After ensuring that the encoder feedback is correct and the motor movement direction is consistent with the command direction and the safety of the movement stroke, the PID parameters of the motor are tuned in PAMCturningpro. For the performance test of this system, the design and implementation of the test plan should be carried out according to the concurrent support target and response time target proposed in the performance analysis of the system. Concurrent users use the LoadRunner tool to create the customer test machine to simulate the concurrent access and operation of the system. In each iteration process, the test results are recorded in the same way as the benchmark test and finally the system can still achieve the expected performance when the actual concurrency reaches the limit of 5007. The results show that the intelligent control system in this paper has the advantages of low cost, convenient operation, perfect function, high precision, stable and reliable operation, etc. and has good practical value.</jats:p>",

In the hybrid model, hourly water demand data are first reconstructed to generate appropriate samples so as to represent the characteristics of time series effectively. Then, the mind evolutionary algorithm is integrated into a back propagation neural network (BPNN) to improve prediction performance. To investigate the application potential of the proposed model in hourly water demand forecasting, real hourly water demand data were applied to evaluate its prediction performance. In addition, the performance of the proposed model was compared with a traditional BPNN model and another hybrid model where the genetic algorithm (GA) is used as an optimization algorithm for BPNN. The results show that the proposed model has a satisfactory prediction performance in hourly water demand forecasting. On the whole, the proposed model outperforms all other models involved in the comparisons in both prediction accuracy and stability. These findings suggest that the proposed model can be a novel and effective tool for hourly water demand forecasting.</jats:p>",

In the current research, morphological, quantitative and qualitative hydrological, and land use factors as well as the combined factor, which is the combination of effective variables of the aforementioned factors, have been used to estimate River Water Withdrawal (RWW) for agricultural uses. Lavasanat and Qazvin are selected as study areas, located in the Namak Lake basin in Iran, with Bsk and Csa climate categories, respectively. Estimation of RWW is performed using single and Wavelet–hybrid (W-hybrid) data-driven methods, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Wavelet–ANN (WANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Wavelet–ANFIS (WANFIS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Wavelet–GEP (WGEP). Due to the evaluation criteria, the performance of the WGEP model is the best among the others for estimating RWW variables in both study areas. Considering the W-hybrid models with data de-noising for estimating RWW in the Lavasanat and Qazvin study areas, the obtained values of RMSE for WGEP11 to WGEP15 and WGEP21 to WGEP25 equal 67.268, 54.659, 80.871, 50.796, 15.676 and 105.532, 96.615, 105.018, 160.961, 44.332, respectively. The results indicate that WGEP and ANN are the best and poorest models in both study areas without regarding climate condition effects. Also, a combined factor which includes River Width (RW), minimum flow rate (QMin), average flow rate (QMean), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Cultivated Area (CA) variables is introduced as the best factor to estimate RWW variables compared with the other factors in both the Bsk and Csa climate categories. On the other hand, qualitative hydrological and land use factors were the weakest ones to estimate RWW variables in the Bsk and Csa climate categories, respectively. Therefore, the current study explores how the mathematical relations for estimating RWW have a significant effect on water resources management and planning by policymakers in the future.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the multi-objective framework of the problem has been widely studied by researchers. This paper integrates three different levels of decision planning in supply chain network design: location-allocation problem for strategic planning, inventory planning management for tactical planning, and vehicle routing for operational planning. A location-inventory-routing problem based on the economic production quantity model with environmental concerns is considered. This study aims to minimise the total cost of operating facilities, inventory and distance travelled by the vehicles as the first objective while minimising the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission cost as the second objective. Due to the complexity of the problem, a non-dominated sorting and ranking procedure is applied into a Multi-Objective Hybrid Harmony Search-Simulated Annealing (MOHS-SA) algorithm to find the trade-off between these two objectives. Computational experiments on the benchmark instances indicate that the proposed MOHS-SA algorithm can produce well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective problems.</jats:p>",

Farmer investment in wood production and the degree of formality in the sector depends on access to and conditions of the market, the nature of the regulatory frameworks that govern rights to and movement of timber, and access to financing. We evaluate the process of formalization of a thriving and adaptive existing supply chain for small-dimension lumber originating in the fallows of smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. Through field research over three years based in semi-structured interviews with diverse actors in the Amazon, we found that the supply chain for fallow timber is driven entirely by informal and some illegal transactions. A key reason for this is the lack of an appropriate regulatory mechanism by which producers can gain authorization to harvest and sell this timber. We identify conditions necessary to formalize this sector, and evaluate the degree to which these are met under several scenarios. We recommend that the state develop mechanisms that recognize property rights of long-term residents and establish a simple fallow forestry registration mechanism; and that local governments or non-governmental organizations adopt adaptive and collaborative approaches to support farmers and provide training, information and networking among actors. State recognition of and support for fallow forestry, coupled with producers organizing for collective action on processing and marketing their timber, could result in the formalization of a significant volume of timber, improvements in income security for rural people, and the development of local entrepreneurial activities.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the world's leading manufacturers of this type of engines are actively engaged in research and development work aimed at developing, designing, manufacturing and putting them into operation. In this class of engines, there are a number of limitations that do not allow the existing experience of converting four-stroke marine engines to gas fuel to be applied to them. In this regard, each manufacturer develops its own approaches to solving this problem. As a result, two fundamentally different approaches were outlined - this is the supply of gas fuel directly to the working cylinder at the beginning and at the end of the compression stroke. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. Earlier, the authors showed that in addition to the already implemented technical solutions, other approaches can be used related to the supply of gas fuel into the working cylinder under a pressure of 4.0...6.0 MPa, which allow combining the advantages of both methods implemented in practice and significantly reduce their inherent disadvantages. In particular, reducing the residence time of the gas-air mixture in the working cylinder of the engine during the compression stroke is an effective method of combating knocking combustion that occurs in low-pressure engines. In turn, this time depends on the pressure under which the gas fuel is supplied to the gas supply module and on the characteristics of its outflow through the flow path of this device. This article is devoted to the study of the influence of the design features of the flow path on the formation of the trajectories of gas fuel movement and the parameters of its outflow from the gas module to the working cylinder under conditions of changing back pressure.</jats:p>"

Supply chain research has started to advance the field's understanding of SCT, but many questions remain, including how SCT should be conceptualized, how firms can effectively facilitate it, and the benefits of providing it, especially when BCT is utilized. The gaps suggest the need for fundamental theoretical development about the resources and capabilities underlying the development, application, and derived value of SCT. This research designed a case study around a BCT implementation project between a small artisan coffee producer and a startup BCT service provider.

We find that buyers tend to reject offers if the payoff inequality increases from one period to the next. We coin this dynamic form of inequity aversion as “ratcheting aversion.” We show that under short‐term contracting, the buyer's ratcheting aversion limits the supplier's leeway to exploit information revelation in earlier periods because suppliers fear contract rejections in later periods. As a result, the suppliers' empirical benefit of offering long‐term contracts over short‐term contracts is significantly larger than theory predicts. Furthermore, long‐term contracts enable supply chain partners to achieve less volatile supply chain performance than short‐term contracts because the buyers' ratcheting aversion leads to more contract rejections under short‐term contracting. While normative theory predicts that suppliers should include all future informational rents of the buyers in the first‐period offer, thereby creating large payoff differences between periods, we show that it can be behaviorally optimal for the supplier to make offers that lead to more equitable payoffs between periods. </jats:p>",

Such lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact through supply chains, which are a network of firms for production, by simulating an agent-based model of production using supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the interactions between lockdown regions, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We find that a region’s upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on whether it lifts the lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked through supply chains. These results indicate that the economic effect produced by exogenous shocks in a region can affect other regions and therefore this study proposes the need for inter-region policy coordination to reduce economic loss due to lockdowns.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data sharing between upstream and downstream entities is vital for the success of a supply chain. However, distrust, privacy concerns, data misuse, and the asymmetric valuation of shared data between entities often hinder data sharing. This problem calls for a secure, efficient, fair, and trustworthy data‐sharing mechanism. The key to such a successful system hinges on how to trace the data usage, determine the value of the seller’s data to the buyer and then compensate the seller accordingly. To this end, we design and implement a blockchain‐enabled data‐sharing marketplace for a stylized supply chain. We demonstrate how a blockchain can be used to overcome these impediments in supply‐chain data sharing and provide a detailed tutorial with a step‐by‐step implementation for how to set up such a data exchange prototype using Hashgraph. </jats:p>",

Taking the typical hilly area of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China as an example, based on the assessment matrix of land use and ecosystem services, we used the method of spatial heterogeneity assessment and self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) to explore the identification and regionalization of critical areas of ecosystem services at regional and small scales. The results show that there was spatial heterogeneity and scale effects of ecosystem services under the two scales. The small-scale supply–demand pattern was greatly affected by microtopography and land use patterns, and the importance of ecosystem services was as follows: forest area in the upper part of the mountain &amp;gt; orchard and dry area in the middle and lower part of the mountain &amp;gt; valley farming area &amp;gt; flat town and farming area. The regional-scale supply–demand pattern was greatly affected by landscape structure, location conditions and social economy, and the importance of ecosystem services was as follows: south &amp;gt; west &amp;gt; north &amp;gt; central. The SOFM network quantitatively identified four types of ecological areas with clear dominant functions at regional and small scales. The balance between supply and demand in the studied ecosystem service areas was I &amp;lt; II &amp;lt; III &amp;lt; IV, in which IV was the critical area in terms of supply and I was the critical area in terms of demand. This assessment framework can improve the spatial accuracy and objectivity of the quantification and mapping of ecosystem services, and provide new ideas for multi-scale identification and expression of ecosystem services.</jats:p>"

If the salinity and ion concentrations of the feedwater rises above the maximum design concentrations, then the plant may ultimately fail. BWRO plants typically use groundwater as a feedwater source. Prior to the process design, a detailed groundwater assessment is made to characterize the source aquifer system and to develop a solute-transport model that is used to project the changes in water quality over the expected useful life of the facility. Solute transport-modeling performed for the Collier County (Florida) South BWRO facility, which was designed to produce 30,303 m3/d with an expansion to 75,758 m3/d, used an aquifer system conceptual model that assumed upwards migration over time of brackish waters with higher salinities into the production zones. This conceptual model is typical of how most BWRO systems developed in the United States operate. The original solute transport model predicted a range of increases in dissolved chloride concentrations over a 20-year period from a low of 5 mg/L/yr, a mid-range of 35 mg/L/yr, and a high range of 85 mg/L/yr. Actual data collected over a 11- to 13.5-year period showed that the dissolved chloride concentration average of the feed water decreased by 16 mg/L/yr. The original conceptual model was found to be inaccurate in that it suggested an upwards recharging system, whereas downward leakage (or perhaps lateral migration) of fresher water appears to be occurring in the system. This is an example of a long-term solute-transport model audit, which is rarely performed, in which a new conceptual model was found to be applicable to an aquifer system used to feed a BWRO facility.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the use of such an active filter will improve the power quality and the normal trouble-free operation of the equipment in general. A control system with an adaptive phase-locked loop often has the advantages of a reliable and efficient control system. It makes it possible to quickly respond to dynamic changes in the load, which is typical for the operation of functional equipment of autonomous objects. The control system becomes more flexible, reliable, efficient and provides an instantaneous value of the compensation current from the measured values of the load current curve. Calculations can be carried out in real time. LMS, NLMS, RLS algorithms are considered as adjusting the weighted adaptive phase-locked loop in the system for correcting the supply voltage parameters. Based on the simulation of algorithms carried out in the MATLAB environment, a comparative analysis of their effectiveness is made. It is shown that the NLMS algorithm has the highest suppression quality and minimum transient time. The NLMS algorithm works in real time and is recommended for use in the supply voltage correction system.</jats:p>"

The highest complexity of its application may be found in the scope of the Supply Chain (SC), due to being composed of numerous interrelated organizations, often with quite different characteristics. In addition, the current context of the fourth Industrial Revolution, also called Industry 4.0 (I4.0) that, when occurring within SC, gave birth to what has been called Supply Chain 4.0 (SC4.0), the context in which even more complex challenges to KM could be expected.

It complements and expands previous literature reviews in terms of its focus on SC4.0. In addition, it proposes, grounded in the results achieved, a conceptual model for KM in the context of SC4.0. It was identified that I4.0 brought important changes to the management of supply chains of the Industry 4.0 era and KM within it, although human factor – mainly behavior and relationships – remain a central aspect despite the increased adoption of a broad range of new technologies. Factors that enhance or limit KM in SC4.0 were also discussed and summarized, as well as the main relationships between them.

In this large academic medical system, we used a systematic team approach to proactively maintain an adequate PPE supply. The team consisted of staff from multiple departments including infection prevention, environmental health and safety, operational efficiency, and supply chain. The healthcare system solicited donations of PPE, and our team was tasked with developing a sustainable method to provide healthcare workers with safe and effective N-95 respirators. Respirators are normally fitted to our 6,000+ healthcare workers through a fit-testing process using 4 models of N-95s. We received &gt;60 models, many in small quantities, posing a new level of complexity that prevented use of our typical fit-testing method. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Donated respirators were manually verified on the CDC/NIOSH website to validate approval or approved alternative. A categorization system was developed, and respirators were sorted based on quality, style, and condition. User seal checks replaced qualitative fit testing due to the uncertain and quickly changing respirator supply. Staff were educated about the importance of performing a seal check to evaluate respirator fit and were provided instructions for what to do if they failed a seal check. We performed limited quantitative fit testing on a small group previously fit tested to 1 of the 4 models of N-95s normally stocked to identify the most effective alternative respirators to serve as substitute N-95s. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We were able to provide staff with new N-95s and delay the release of reprocessed N-95s. Overall, 18 models of respirators were tested on staff for filtration effectiveness and fit. We deemed 61% masks to be of last resort, and these were not released. We determined that 39% were acceptable as an alternative for at least 1 of our usual respirator models. However, only 3 models (17%) available in small quantities fit wearers whose size was in shortest supply.

First, applying differential game theory, optimal strategies for design innovation, and pricing under decentralized and centralized scenarios are obtained. At the same time, the optimal strategies under the two decision-making scenarios are compared and analyzed. Second, a two-part tariff contract is introduced to coordinate the decentralized ODM supply chain. Finally, we further establish a Nash bargaining model among members of the supply chain. It is found that, in a centralized system, the design innovation efforts, product quality levels, and supply chain profits in the decentralized decision scenario are lower than that in the centralized decision scenario, but the selling price relationship in both scenarios depends on the parameters of the operating system.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to model and compare the performance of four different systems, using solar energy as a renewable energy source for DHW production. A novel microchannel (MC) solar thermal collector and a microchannel-based hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collector (PVT) were fabricated (utilizing a microchannel heat exchanger in both cases), mathematical models were created, and performance was simulated in TRNSYS software. A water-to-water heat pump (HP) was integrated with these two collector-based solar systems, namely MCPVT-HP and MCST-HP, to improve the total solar fraction. System performance was then compared with that of a conventional solar-thermal-collector-based system and that of a PV-resistance (PV-R) system, using a monocrystalline PV collector. The heat pump was added to the systems to improve the systems’ efficiency and provide the required DHW temperatures when solar irradiance was insufficient. Comparisons were performed based on the temperature of the preheated water storage tank, the PV panel efficiency, overall system efficiency, and the achieved solar fraction. The microchannel PVT-heat pump (MCPVT-HP) system has the highest annual solar fraction among all the compared systems, at 76.7%. It was observed that this system had 10% to 35% higher solar fraction than the conventional single-tank solar-thermal-collector-based system during the wintertime in a cold climate. The performance of the two proposed MC-based systems is less sensitive than the two conventional systems to collector tilt angle in the range of 45 degrees to 90 degrees. If roof space is limited, the MCPVT-HP system is the best choice, as the MCPVT collector can perform effectively when mounted vertically on the facades of high-rise residential and commercial buildings. A comparison among five Canadian cities was also performed, and we found that direct beam radiation has a great effect on overall system solar faction.</jats:p>"

With improvements in both processor speed and memory, these models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This review focuses on the recent progress in mathematically based decision making to account for uncertainties in the fresh fruit supply chain. The models in the literature are mostly based on linear and mixed integer programming and involve variants such as stochastic programming and robust optimization. The functional areas of application include planting, harvest optimization, logistics and distribution. The perishability of the fresh fruit supply chain is an important issue as is the cycle time of cultivation and harvest.</jats:p>"

This study assessed physician perception of these policies.Design: A cross-sectional study design.Setting: Large academic medical center.Patients/participants: Physicians in inpatient and outpatient practice, as stratified by physician specialty for psychiatry or addiction medicine (Psych/AM), primary care, and others.Interventions: A survey was administered electronically from July to September 2019, with survey items adapted from published opioid policy evaluations.Main outcome measure: Assessment of physician reason for the use of PDMP and perception of PDMP clinical utility. Responses by specialty were compared via chi square testing.Results: There were N = 214 responses (response rate ~10.9 percent), representing n = 15 from Psych/AM, n = 58 primary care, and n = 143 from other specialties. The most frequently reported reason for PDMP use across specialties was to examine prescribing history for patients currently using opioid analgesics (6.7 percent Psych/AM; 50.1 percent primary care; 38.6 percent others; p = 0.027). Fewer Psych/AM physicians agreed that the policy hinders the clinical work day as compared with primary care physicians (46.7 percent vs. 58.6 percent). More primary care agreed the policy was a good idea relative to Psych/AM (62.1 percent vs. 53.3 percent). More primary care than Psych/AMs agreed that the policy made it more challenging for chronic pain patients to access opioid therapies (77.6 percent vs. 53.3 percent).Conclusions: The perceived workflow burden and unintended consequence of decreased chronic pain patient access to opioid pharmacotherapies suggest further opportunities for pharmacist–physician collaboration in managing affected patients.</jats:p>"

More than two billion people are affected by nutritional deficiencies caused by zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) deficiency. Therefore, biofortification is a strategy supposed to be economical, sustainable and easily implemented to increase the micronutrient content in the crops. However, micronutrient distribution, especially Zn and Fe, within the spike has been rarely reported. For this, different concentrations of Zn (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 μmol L–1) and sucrose (2%, 4%, 6%) were supplied at Zn concentrations of 30 and 90 μmol L–1 under detached-ear culture. The results showed that grain weight and grain Zn, Fe and protein contents were higher in superior grains than in inferior grains, and higher in central spikelets than in basal and apical spikelets. Zn supply significantly improved grain Zn, Fe and protein content. Increasing sucrose concentration at low and high Zn supply levels significantly increased grain weight, and grain Zn, Fe and protein contents. The percentage increase in dry weight and nutrient contents of superior and inferior grains was higher in central spikelets than in apical and basal spikelets. It is concluded that grain position significantly affected the grain weight and nutrient content, and these effects could be improved by application of Zn and sucrose. These findings suggest Zn and sucrose application for increasing mineral nutrients contents in wheat grain, and mechanisms of nutrient accumulation in relation to external sucrose and Zn supply should be elucidated in the future.</jats:p>"

The pressure distribution characteristics of the water supply system reveal that the hydraulic transition process of the water supply system of the deep well pump group is even worse. Then, according to its hydraulic characteristics, a cost-effective water hammer protection measure-a one-way surge tank and air valve combined protection plan was selected. Finally, the calculation and analysis of the hydraulic transition process of setting the system one-way surge tank and air valve joint protection plan are carried out.

Some livestock systems engage in feed–food competition as arable land is used for livestock feed rather than as crops for food; reducing the global supply of food. There is a growing argument that to meet future-food demands sustainably, feed–food competition must be minimized. To this end, we evaluated the effectiveness of two refined metrics to quantify feed–food competition in three livestock systems; dairy and its beef, suckler beef and pig production in Ireland. The metrics are edible protein conversion ratio (EPCR) and the land-use ratio (LUR). The EPCR compares the amount of human digestible protein (HDP) in livestock feed against the amount of HDP the livestock produced, calculating how efficiently it produces HDP. However, the LUR compares the potential HDP from a crop system on the land used to produce the livestock's feed against the HDP the livestock system produced. In both metrics, a value &lt;1 demonstrates an efficient system. The EPCR values for dairy beef (0.22) and suckler beef (0.29) systems consider them efficient producers, whereas pig production (1.51) is inefficient. The LUR values designate that only the dairy beef (0.58) is a net positive producer of HDP from the land used for its feed, with crop production producing more HDP than suckler beef (1.34) and pig production (1.73). Consequently, the LUR can be deemed to be more suitable to represent feed–food competition in livestock production.</jats:p>",

To explore the impact of COVID-19 on the circulation of manufacturing industry products at different geographical scales, we drew upon a case study of development zones in the city of Weifang in China to analyze the characteristics of firms’ logistics networks in these development zones, and how these characteristics have changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data used in this study were collected from fieldwork conducted between 26 August 2020 and 15 October 2020, and included the supply originations of firms’ manufacturing sources and the sales destinations of their goods. We chose the two-mode network analysis method as our study methodology, which separates the logistics networks into supply networks and sales networks. The results show the following: First, the overall structure of firms’ logistics networks in Weifang’s development zones is characterized by localization. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the local network links have further strengthened, whereas the global links have seriously declined. Moreover, the average path length of both the supply and sales logistics networks has slightly decreased, indicating the increased connectivity of the logistics networks. Second, in terms of the network node centrality, the core nodes of the supply logistics networks are the development zones and the city in which the firms are located, whereas the core nodes of the sales logistics networks are the core companies in the development zones. However, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the centrality of supply originations and sales destinations at the local scale has increased, whereas the centrality of supply originations and sales destinations at the global scale has decreased significantly. Third, the influencing factors of such changes include controlling personnel and goods circulation based on national boundaries and administrative boundaries, forcing the logistics networks in the development zones to shrink to the local scale. Moreover, there are differences in the scope of spatial contraction between supply logistics networks and the sales logistics networks.</jats:p>"

The master‐slave control structure is adopted, and a reference air mass flow rate and the motor voltage of the air compressor are taken as control targets, respectively. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used as a parameter tuner for MPCProportion Integral (PI) controller. The results indicate that both MPCFPI and DDPGMPCPI can achieve better control performance indices in comparison to classic controller under step response and a typical driving cycle. The DDPG‐guided cascade controller is also capable of regulating the OER tracking error and the derivative of rotation speed of the air compressor, which reveals the potential for extending the longevity of the FCS.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We examine decision‐making to invest in drinking water infrastructure in coastal Bangladesh where increasing saline intrusion in aquifers intersects with high levels of poverty for the 20 million people living in the coastal region. Multi‐objective optimization is used to explore the trade‐offs between two public policy goals: (a) maximizing overall access to improved water supplies (the greater good) and (b) maximizing access for the population with the lowest welfare (the greater need). To elucidate this trade‐off, we make use of groundwater salinity measurements, an extensive household survey and an audit of drinking water infrastructure in 1 out of Bangladesh’s 139 polders, which is home to nearly 60,000 people. We quantify the costs of a variety of drinking water supply options including deep tube wells, desalination plants, and piped systems. The recommended solutions are sequences of investments in water supply assets that are optimized to specified locations within the polder. The method is potentially scalable and transferrable to inform investments to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (Target 6.1) of universal access to safe and affordable drinking water.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, government subsidies for R&amp;D are one of the key factors that affect foreign-funded R&amp;D activities and their innovation output and performance in global supply chains. (2) Methods: in this paper, firstly, based on two sets of time series and dynamic panel data, we propose a distribution time lag model to test the effect of R&amp;D subsidy policies from the macro perspective. Secondly, we employ the propensity score matching method to test the micro effect of R&amp;D subsidy policies. (3) Results: our empirical results show that there are significant differences in the impacts of R&amp;D subsidy policies on foreign capital funded innovation and domestic innovation. The main effect of government subsidy on foreign capital R&amp;D is to improve the innovation output. However, regarding domestic R&amp;D, it is to promote innovation performance. (4) Conclusions: Government subsidy is the main cause of the individual differences among the foreign funded R&amp;D institutions in terms of innovation output and innovation performance. From the perspective of global supply chains, our analysis and results provide managerial and policy insights on subsidizing foreign investment in R&amp;D in China.</jats:p>"

While the bulk of arterial supply to the tumour is derived from the external carotid system, some degree of contribution from the internal carotid artery (ICA) is common. ICA branch embolisation in this setting has previously been avoided due to concerns over ischaemic neurological complications, possibly contributing to the increased intraoperative blood loss observed in patients with tumours with ICA supply. There is a marked paucity of reports of embolisation of ICA branches supplying JNA in the medical literature. We present a case of successful embolisation of an aberrant pharyngeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery arising from the proximal cervical ICA, which was making a significant contribution to tumour blood supply in a male adolescent with a very large JNA. </jats:p>",

There is agreement that dominant economic paradigms need to change to comply with the sustainability principles of environmental integrity, economic resilience, and social equity. However, so far, little empirical evidence has been generated to what extent and under which conditions sustainable international coffee supply could be realized through small intermediary businesses such as roasteries, breweries, and/or retailers. This case study reports on a collaborative project between a small coffee brewery and its customers in the U.S. and a small coffee roastery and its suppliers in Mexico that demonstrates how sustainable coffee supply could look like and explores under which conditions it can be realized. A research team facilitated the cooperation using a transdisciplinary research approach, including field visits and stakeholder workshops. The project (i) assessed the sustainability challenges of the current supply and value chains; (ii) developed a vision of a joint sustainable coffee supply chain; (iii) build a strategy to achieve this vision, and (iv) piloted the implementation of the strategy. We discuss the project results against the conditions for sustainable international coffee supply offered in the literature (why they were fulfilled, or not). Overall, the study suggests that small intermediary coffee businesses might have the potential to infuse sustainability across their supply chain if cooperating with “open cards.” The findings confirm some and add some conditions, including economic resilience through cooperation, problem recognition, transparency, trust, and solidarity across the supply chain. The study concludes with reflections on study limitations and future research needs.</jats:p>"

A balance between water supply and demand must be considered for a long‐term plan. However, water demand projections are often highly uncertain. Climate change could impact the hydrologic processes, and consequently, threaten water supply. Thus, understanding the uncertainties in future water demand and climate is critical for developing a sound water supply plan. In Illinois, regional water supply planning attempts to explore the impacts of future water demand and climate on water supply using scenario analyses and hydrologic modeling. This study is aimed at developing a water supply planning framework that considers both future water demand and climate change impacts. This framework is based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate the watershed hydrology and conduct scenario analyses that consider the uncertainties in both future water demand and climate as well as their impacts on water supply. The framework was applied to water supply planning efforts in the Kankakee River watershed. The Kankakee River watershed model was calibrated and validated to observed streamflow records at four long‐term United States Geological Survey streamflow gages. Because of the many model parameters involved, the calibration process was automated and was followed by a manual refinement, resulting in good model performance. Long‐range water demand projections were prepared by the Illinois State Water Survey. Six future water demand scenarios were established based on a suite of assumptions. Climate scenarios were obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection Phase 5 datasets. Three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, are used in the study. The scenario simulation results demonstrated that climate change appears to have a greater impact on water availability in the study area than water demand. The framework developed in this study can also be used to explore the impacts of uncertainties of water demand and climate on water supply and can be extended to other regions and watersheds.</jats:p>",

A better understanding of its influence is of great significance to future land use planning and water resources management. Since 2011, the local government has implemented a land remediation plan, and the LULC in the Yanghe Reservoir Basin has undergone major changes. This paper uses The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to study blue water (BW) and green water (GW) resources in three typical years (a wet year, dry year, and normal year) under two LULC scenarios in the basin in 2010 and 2017. The results show that from 2010 to 2017, the area of cultivated land and residential construction land increased by 227.28% and 269.23%, respectively; the area of unused land, woodland, and grassland decreased by 98.84%, 35.90% and 39.52%, respectively. Compared with the results of the 2010 LULC scenario, the average BW of the three typical years under the 2017 LULC scenario decreased by 11.66%, 52.32%, and 21.95%, respectively, and the average GW flow increased by 6.72%, 2.90%, and 6.83%, respectively, and the average GW reserves decreased by 14.80%, 11.39%, and 7.67%, respectively. Therefore, this study believes that changes of LULC have led to a significant decrease in runoff and an increase in evapotranspiration in the basin.</jats:p>",

The critical buckling pressure and displacement (p–δ) curves, temperature changing curves, hoop and axial strain of the lining monitoring section and the strain changes with system pressure (p–ε) of the lining under the action of different diameters, different lining wall thickness and different ventilation modes were obtained through five groups of full-scale tests. The variation principles of the post-buckling pressure and the reduction regularity of the flowing section of the lining were further investigated. By comparing different pipeline buckling models and introducing thin-shell theory, the buckling model of liner supported by existing pipe was established. The comparison between the test results and thin-shell theory indicates that one of the significances of the enhancement coefficient k value is to change the constraint condition of the aspect ratio, l/R, thus increasing the critical buckling pressure of the lining. Finally, an improved lining buckling prediction model (enhancement model) is presented. A previous test is used as a case study with the results showing that the enhanced model is able to predict critical buckling pressure and lobe-starting amount of the liner, which can provide guidance for trenchless restoration of the liner with thin-walled stainless steel.</jats:p>"

Although there is evidence that nitrogen (N) affects frost tolerance of juvenile conifers, the magnitude and direction of such effect can diverge among species. The influence of the N source on frost tolerance has been barely studied. Particularly, how organic N sources could affect the cold acclimation dynamics of seedlings is poorly understood. We studied morpho‐physiological responses to organic N supply (amino acids) in comparison to inorganic N in seedlings of two Mediterranean pine species: <jats:italic>Pinus halepensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. sylvestris</jats:italic>. Fertilization was applied at low and high N doses (30 and 130 mg N seedling<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the first growing season. Then, tolerance of seedlings to freezing stress was evaluated through the cold season. This study confirmed that organic N supply promotes growth of both species as effectively as inorganic N sources. At low N availability, seedlings had acute phosphorus deficiencies when grown with inorganic N, but not with organic N. Likewise, high organic‐N availability improved chlorophylls concentration. Both species increased their frost tolerance through time, especially during late autumn. Although organic N supply did not show clear benefits on frost tolerance, it seemed to enhance cold acclimation via increases of compatible solutes, such as soluble sugars and proline, particularly in <jats:italic>P. halepensis</jats:italic>. Thus, the effects of organic N supply could depend on the extent that such osmolytes contribute to the dormancy strategy of the species. Other species‐specific mechanisms to cope with freezing stress are further discussed.</jats:p>",

This new solar still device is based on installing a dome slope cover on the walls of the solar still. The main objective of such a still is to concentrate more sunrays at the still's bottom basin, through the increased area of the dome glass cover. Experiments are conducted under the climate conditions in Hangzhou city, China, for testing the operational performance of the dome slope type solar still and the fourfold slope still, so as to make a comparative analysis between them. Assessment of the dome slope still's feasibility is performed based on energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and enviroeconomic methodologies, as well as energy payback time. Results show that the productivity of the dome slope still is 36% higher than that of the fourfold slope still, and the dome slope solar still enhances the average hourly energy efficiency by 34%. Due to the higher energy and exergy outputs of the dome slope solar still throughout its lifetime, the novel solar still proposed in this study mitigates more CO2 compared with the fourfold slope still. Overall, incorporation of the dome slope cover with the still is found to be promising in terms of freshwater yield, cost, and energy payback time compared with the conventional one. The dome slope single basin solar still appears to be effective from exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental parameter analysis.</jats:p>",

To understand the relationship between sodium chloride (NaCl) and increased N application rates, a pot study was performed in which the ammonical (NH4+) form of N was applied as urea to maize crops at different rates (control, 160, 186, 240, 267, 293, and 320 kg N ha−1) using two salinity levels (control and 10 dS m−1 NaCl). The results indicate that all biochemical and physiological attributes of the maize plant improved with increased concentration of N up to 293 kg ha−1, compared to those in the control treatment. Similarly, the optimal N concentration regulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., catalase activity (CAT), peroxidase activity (POD), and superoxide dismutases (SOD), and also increased the N use efficiencies of the maize crop up to 293 kg N ha−1. Overall, our results show that the optimum level of N (293 kg ha−1) improved the salinity tolerance in the maize plant by activating stress coping physiological and biochemical mechanisms.

This paper presents how to exit from the standalone status and enter into debugging mode following a practical ultra-low power design methodology. In addition, the discharge and regeneration effects are analyzed and modeled to minimize the error using the sensor node self measurements. Once the method is presented, its implementation details are discussed including other solutions like wake up wireless modules or a pin interruption solution. Its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The method proposed is evaluated with several simulations and laboratory experiments using a real aquaculture sensor node. Finally, all the results obtained demonstrate the usefulness of our new method to gain the control of a standalone sensor node. The proposal is better than other approaches when the hibernation time is longer than 167.45 μs. Finally, our approach requires two orders of magnitude less energy than the best practical solution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With the wider recognition of the concept of environmental protection and sustainable development, more and more manufacturers have begun to implement green manufacturing strategies. However, green development is a gradual process, and the coexistence of ordinary and green products is common. This paper examines the competition between ordinary products and green ones based on supply chains, and discusses the impact of retailers’ horizontal cooperation on pricing, greenness, market demand, profit, and other related decisions and results. Model solutions and numerical experiments have shown that consumers’ green preference (CGP) has a positive impact on the results of green products and negative effects on those of ordinary ones; however, the impact of competition intensity (CI) is more complex, and the trend tends to change if it exceeds a certain critical value. In general, cooperation encourages retailers to raise prices and make manufacturers lower wholesale prices, but the retail and wholesale prices of green products are always higher than the corresponding prices of ordinary ones. Market demand can be reduced due to cooperation, but it is conducive to strengthening green products’ greenness. However, if CI exceeds a certain threshold, the greenness will be weakened by cooperation. Both retailers can benefit from cooperation easily and they always reach a win-win situation, but manufacturers suffer badly as a result. Nevertheless, when CI is weak, cooperation will bring a greater profit improvement to the whole chain of ordinary products; in this case, if a retailer is willing to compensate for a manufacturer’s profit loss and help it benefit from cooperation, the manufacturer will encourage the retailer to cooperate horizontally with the green retailer, but the green chain will be seriously damaged. When CI is strong, the greenness of green products is not obvious enough, and cooperation can bring some chances to achieve a win-win situation for two chains; if the green retailer can obtain a larger share from cooperation under this scenario, it can also enable its manufacturer to obtain compensation and change the profit increment from negative to positive. From an overall perspective, when CI is very weak or very strong, horizontal cooperation is conducive to improving the profit of the entire supply chain competition system, but when CI is relatively flat, independent operation for each chain is more advantageous; if the competition status is stable and unchanged, independent competition will be superior to horizontal cooperation.</jats:p>",

However, the number of undernourished people has resumed growth in the 2010s amid food supply disruptions, economic slowdowns, and protectionist restrictions to agricultural trade. Having been common to most nations, these challenges to the food security status of the population still vary depending on the level of economic development and national income of individual countries. In order to explore the long-run determinants of food supply transformations, this study employs five-stage multiple regression analysis to identify the strengths and directions of effects of agricultural production parameters, income level, price indices, food trade, and currency exchange on supply of calories, proteins, and fats across 11 groups of agricultural products in 1980–2018. To address the diversity of effects across developing nations, the study includes 99 countries of Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa categorized as low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income economies. It is found that in low-income countries, food supply parameters are more strongly affected by production factors compared to economic and trade variables. The effect of economic factors on the food supply of higher-value food products, such as meat and dairy products, fruit, and vegetables, increases with the rise in the level of income, but it stays marginal for staples in all three groups of countries. The influence of trade factors on food supply is stronger compared to production and economic parameters in import-dependent economies irrelevant of the gross national income per capita. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the research on how food supply patterns and their determinants evolve in the course of economic transformations in low-income countries.</jats:p>"

Quantitatively evaluating the benefits of forest water supply functions is important to effectively mitigate the impacts of land development, climate change, and population growth. Here, by integrating a water balance model and national drinking water data, we determined the amount of surface water yield originating on different forest ownership types at a fine resolution (88,000 watersheds) and tracked that water through the river network to drinking water intakes and the populations they serve. We found that forested lands comprised 36% of the total land area but contributed 50% of the total surface water yield. Of the 23,983 public surface drinking water intakes depending on surface water sources, 89% (serving around 150 million people) received some (&gt;0.01%) surface water from forested lands, and 38% (serving about 60 million people) received more than 50% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands. Privately-owned forests were the most important water source in the eastern U.S., benefiting 16 million people, followed by federal forests (14.4% of the total water supply). In contrast, federally-owned forested lands were the dominant water source (52% of the total water supply) in the West. Privately-owned forests are the most vulnerable to future land use change and associated water supply impacts. Continuing programs that support private forest landowners with financial and technical assistance through federal and state forest management agencies and potentially developing payment for ecosystem service schemes could maximize benefits for landowners so they may retain their land assets while minimizing forest loss and associated impacts on critical ecosystem services including the provisioning a clean and reliable water supply for the American public.</jats:p>",

The situation urges us to face many issues never experienced before, aimed at mitigating a multitude of sanitary and social risks. The current pandemic has affected the food system in many ways: significant changes in dietary habits and in the health status of people; the food chain is broken, which has an effect on food security (including making it difficult to find or to buy fresh food at affordable prices); unemployment or underemployment is rising due to the damages of the food sector; there is a lack of food‐socialising events which has an effect on people’s mental status; and there are concerns about food safety. To mitigate all these issues, the implementation of innovative technologies urges. We have mapped the scientific studies and online information on 3D food printing (3DFP) about the effects of 3DFP on the food system and people’s health when adopted in food industry, restaurants, hospitals, schools, offices, homes, etc. Finally, this information has been examined in light to the future challenges of the food chain also considering the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, demonstrating its potential benefits to mitigate this and future pandemics.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that: (1) the biofilm total cell count (TCC) and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) were the highest at a flow rate of 1.5 m/s, which were 3.7 × 104 cells/cm2 and 1.1 × 103 CFU/cm2, respectively; (2) Proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance (RA) among all samples, and the RA in biofilm (78.85%) was higher than that in water (48%−59%); (3) when the pollutants and biofilm were partially shed, the total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 0.011, 0.36, and 0.5 mg/L at most, respectively; and (4) dissolved oxygen (DO) was sufficient during non-full flow water transport and nitrification occurred. The highest removal rates of ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N) and nitrous nitrogen (-N) reached 27.16% and 66.76%, respectively.

On this basis, the influence of carbon trading on regional sustainable development is empirically analyzed. The results show that the establishment of carbon trading pilots alleviates the negative impact of unfair profit distribution. Increasing the commission rate in a reasonable range improves the profitability of LCE-SC. Nevertheless, with the enhancement of consumers’ low-carbon preference, a lower commission rate is more beneficial to carbon emission reduction. The total carbon emission is positively related to the commission rate. However, the unit carbon emission decreases first and then increases with the commission rate. The influence of the carbon price sensitivity coefficient on the service level is first positive and then negative, while the influence on the manufacturer’s profit goes the opposite. The empirical analysis confirms that the implementation of carbon trading is conducive to regional sustainable development and controlling environmental governance intensity promotes carbon productivity.</jats:p>"

This environmental sustainability is related to different SDGs, but mainly to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The strategies and measures used to improve this aspect of the food supply chain must remain in balance with other sustainability aspects (economic and social). In this framework, the interactions and possible conflicts between food supply chain safety and sustainability need to be assessed. Although priority must be given to safety aspects, food safety policies should be calibrated in order to avoid unnecessary deleterious effects on the environment. In the present review, a number of potential tensions and/or disagreements between the microbial safety and environmental sustainability of the fresh produce supply chain are identified and discussed. The addressed issues are spread throughout the food supply chain, from primary production to the end-of-life of the products, and also include the handling and processing industry, retailers, and consumers. Interactions of fresh produce microbial safety with topics such as food waste, supply chain structure, climate change, and use of resources have been covered. Finally, approaches and strategies that will prove useful to solve or mitigate the potential contradictions between fresh produce safety and sustainability are described and discussed. Upon analyzing the interplay between microbial safety and the environmental sustainability of the fresh produce supply chain, it becomes clear that decisions that are taken to ensure fresh produce safety must consider the possible effects on environmental, economic, and social sustainability aspects. To manage these interactions, a global approach considering the interconnections between human activities, animals, and the environment will be required.</jats:p>"

In light of AFM1′s harmful potential, a human health exposure assessment and risk characterization were performed for all age populations of central Italy with regard to milk and cheese consumption by means of the margin of exposure (MOE). In total, 16,934 cow and ewe’s milk samples were collected from 2014 to 2020 and analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening method, confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD). The average concentration of AFM1 in cow’s milk ranged from 0.009 to 0.015 µg/kg, while in ewe’s milk, the average concentration ranged from 0.009 to 0.013 µg/kg. The average amount of AFM1 exposure ranged from 0.00005 to 0.00195 g/kg bw/day, with the main contributor represented by drinking milk, followed by the consumption of soft cheeses. A high level of public health concern related to the youngest consumers has arisen from risk characterizations highlighting the need for constant monitoring of AFM1′s occurrence in milk by inspection authorities, alongside regular updates with regard to exposure assessments.</jats:p>"

According to the above analysis, the results find that the capital-constrained manufacturer prefers financing only when meeting certain conditions. Furthermore, financing might be detrimental to the manufacturer but always beneficial to the retailer.

Here, we describe the development of a single-component nasopharyngeal swab (GrooveSwab) composed of medical grade polypropylene that can be mass manufactured using conventional injection molding. The design inspired by cat tongue papillae consists of a non-absorbent stacked ring structure that allows for efficient and comfortable collection of viscous mucus samples and faster release into collection medium compared to traditional absorbent swabs. GroveSwabs were evaluated in 2 clinical studies in the US and Peru and demonstrated 90% or better concordance with commercial swabs. The simplified NP swab offers a reliable, lower cost, and more manufacturable alternative to absorbent swabs to avoid future shortages.</jats:p>"

This study quantifies spatially explicit the availability of marginal land in the EU, its production biomass potentials for eight different crops, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of advanced biofuel supply chains. Available land is mapped based on land marginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land‐related sustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a water‐use‐to‐biomass‐production approach while considering the available land, location‐specific biophysical conditions and crop‐specific phenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from energy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both land‐related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the carbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that meets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5–21 Mha 2030 and 2050, respectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is suitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of lignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for each available location) varies between 1951 PJ year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 2030 and 2265 PJ year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 2050.

The large variability in GHG performance is strongly determined by the spatial heterogeneity, which dictates the type of feedstock produced under specific local biophysical conditions, the crop characteristics, and the best conversion pathway. Negative GHG emissions are related to increased carbon stocks for the biomass and soil organic carbon pools compared to the land prior to conversion. When for each location, the advanced biofuel supply chain with the highest GHG performance (lowest net GHG emissions) is selected, 618 PJ year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of advanced biofuels can be produced by 2030. Under REDII GHG emission criteria, slightly less (552 PJ year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) is viable. Smart choices on location, crop type and supply chain design are paramount to achieve maximum benefits of bioenergy systems.</jats:p>",

To study the influence of the main parameters of electrical equipment on the equivalent resistance of the distribution busbar. METHODS. We use element-by-element methods for calculating active power losses using equivalent resistance on the example of a section of the main circuit of the shop network. Factors affecting the equivalent busbar resistance, such as the root-mean-square load factor, the load graph shape factor, the resistance of the contact connections of switching devices, and the ambient temperature, are investigated. RESULTS. The values of the resistances of the branch lines from the busbar are calculated taking into account the heating of the conductors and the resistances of the circuit breakers and magnetic starters installed on the line during the element-by-element calculation. The relations in the value of the equivalent resistance of the busbar to the values of the resistances of the contact connections of low-voltage electrical devices installed on the branch lines from the busbar, the values of the resistances of the branch lines taking into account heating, the value of the resistance of the busbar and the values of the resistance due to the heating of the busbar are revealed. CONCLUSIONS. The share of each of the studied parameters in the value of the equivalent resistance of the busbar is determined. The value of the relative error in determining the equivalent resistance of the busbar depending on the number of connected electric receivers and taking into account the studied parameters is calculated.

Results show that the adsorption capacity of montmorillonite, raw sand and washed sand to atrazine sequentially weakens. In different media, the time for atrazine concentrations to peak in washed sand with montmorillonite (WSM), raw sand and washed sand is 60, 135 and 105 minutes respectively, and the peak concentration accounts for 84, 90 and 95% of the initial concentrations. Under different flow rates, the peak time in washed sand at flow rates of 100, 150 and 200 mL/min is 135, 105 and 75 minutes, and the peak time in WSM is 90, 60 and 45 minutes, respectively. Results from this study indicate that increasing flow velocity and suspended colloids concentrations can promote the migration of atrazine in aquifers, while the presence of clay minerals in sand and gravel layers can reduce atrazine migration. Thus, during Yellow River water recharging, the sand and gravel layer of Yufuhe River is helpful to protect the aquifer, but the colloids-associated migration of atrazine can contaminate groundwater in underlying karst aquifer.</jats:p>",

In this study, loose deposits in real DWDS were collected from regions frequently experiencing ‘yellow water’. Cytotoxicity of healthy human liver cells was used to evaluate the toxicity risks of the particle samples. The results showed that the loose deposits would have a realistic discoloration risk (turbidity &amp;gt; 10 NTU) when their concentrations were higher than 10 mg/L. The water sample containing 1,000 mg/L loose deposits had a dark yellow color (100–300 PCU) and cytotoxicity (viability of human liver cells during cytotoxicity tests 59.18–80.69%), while the water sample containing 1 mg/L loose deposits did not have obvious color (&amp;lt;15 PCU) and cytotoxicity (&amp;gt;97.00%). Particle size showed a stronger correlation with relative viability (r = 0.761) than other properties (specific area, metal content, contact angle, saturation magnetization and electron transfer number). However, it is interesting to note that both turbidity and color had a low correlation with relative viability, thus the toxicity of the particles could not be properly judged using turbidity or color. This study gives an important guidance that although the loose deposits could be visualized during water discoloration, its toxicity risks could not be evaluated through aesthetic indicators.</jats:p>",

Direct correlation of water treatment efficiency with changes in species during coagulation has not been addressed. We investigated the correlation under different hydraulic conditions and water treatment efficiencies including changes in removal of turbidity, ultraviolet adsorption at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Results highlighted that Al species (monomeric species as Ala, medium polymeric species as Alb and colloidal species as Alc) behaved differently during coagulation and treatment efficiencies were affected. When varying the mixing speed, the removal of Alc species had a strong negative correlation with water treatment efficiency but under other hydraulic conditions positive correlations were found. The removal of Ala species was positively correlated with water treatment efficiency, but under other hydraulic conditions the low abundance of Ala species meant the correlation was difficult to observe. The Alb species were significantly and positively correlated with water treatment efficiency with the highest correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.87. The correlation of metallic species with removal efficiencies of the DOC and the UV254 produced higher R2 values. Correlation of the rate of removal of Alb species with the removal efficiencies of the DOC or the UV254 was better than for Alc.</jats:p>",

However, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> sequestration in forests is radiatively offset by emissions of nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O), a potent greenhouse gas, from forest soils. Reforestation, an important strategy for mitigating climate change, has focused on maximizing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> sequestration in plant biomass without integrating N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions from soils. Although nitrogen (N)‐fixing trees are often recommended for reforestation because of their rapid growth on N‐poor soil, they can stimulate significant N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions from soils. Here, we first used a field experiment to show that a N‐fixing tree (<jats:italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</jats:italic>) initially mitigated climate change more than a non‐fixing tree (<jats:italic>Betula nigra</jats:italic>). We then used our field data to parameterize a theoretical model to investigate these effects over time. Under lower N supply, N‐fixers continued to mitigate climate change more than non‐fixers by overcoming N limitation of plant growth. However, under higher N supply, N‐fixers ultimately mitigated climate change less than non‐fixers by enriching soil N and stimulating N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions from soils. These results have implications for reforestation, suggesting that N‐fixing trees are more effective at mitigating climate change at lower N supply, whereas non‐fixing trees are more effective at mitigating climate change at higher N supply.</jats:p>",

The historical data of each index is collected by field investigation as sample data and brought into the neural network for training. The output vector of the only output layer of the network is used as the evaluation result of the supplier. This paper divides the operation mode of green supply chain into four stages and puts forward improvement tools for the functional modules in each stage. Enterprises can use the tools in the modules to improve the operation efficiency of green supply chain. According to the green level evaluation demand of green supply chain, this paper uses the hierarchical method to evaluate it. According to the survey results, this paper uses arithmetic average method to deal with the operation and establishes a secondary index after decomposition. Finally, this paper uses confirmatory factor analysis to test the measurement model and further uses analysis of variance to test the relationship between the two types of social cues and behavioral willingness. The data shows that the orderly fluctuation range of the east, middle, and west cross-border logistics subsystems basically remains at around 0.2 to 0.6. The results show that the establishment of the green supply chain model has a very positive significance for the implementation and development of the green supply chain in China’s manufacturing industry. Through the research of profit and profit distribution in the green supply chain, it provides guidance for the green supply chain to effectively select the supply chain members to cooperate and calculate and distribute the profit reasonably, so that the green supply chain management can be widely used in reality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve low-carbon technology, the government has shifted its strategy from subsidizing low-carbon products (LCP) to low-carbon technology. To analyze the impact of government subsidies based on carbon emission reduction levels on different entities in the low-carbon supply chain (LCSC), game theory is used to model the provision of government subsidies to low-carbon enterprises and retailers. The main findings of the paper are that a government subsidy strategy based on carbon emission reduction levels can effectively drive low-carbon enterprises to further reduce the carbon emissions. The government’s choice of subsidy has the same effect on the LCP retail price per unit, the sales volume, and the revenue of low-carbon products per unit. When the government subsidizes the retailer, the low-carbon product wholesale price per unit is the highest. That is, low-carbon enterprises use up part of the government subsidies by increasing the wholesale price of low-carbon products. The retail price of low-carbon products per unit is lower than the retail price of low-carbon products in the context of decentralized decision making, but the sales volume and revenue of low-carbon products are greater in the centralized decision-making. The cost–benefit-sharing contract could enable the decentralized decision model to achieve the same level of profit as the centralized decision model.</jats:p>"

Although blockchain could offer the traditional industry new energy, there are still some predictable difficulties in the early stage of its application, such as the structure of the blockchain-based system, the role of regulators in the system and high transaction fee by block packing. In this paper, we establish a pioneering quality control system for the green composite wind turbine blade supply chain based on blockchain technology. Firstly, the framework of this system is proposed to ensure that the quality of the product could not only be examined and verified by regulator, but also be monitored by other related nodes. Next, we develop a new way to store the data by hash fingerprint and the cost of transaction fees is significantly reduced in the case of a large amount of data. Then, the information on-chain method is developed to realize the data traceability of each node. At last, the tests of this system are carried out to prove its validity, the satisfactory results are obtained and information supervision and sharing role of the regulators are discussed.</jats:p>"

SAT from four lactating Holstein cows was incubated with one of the following media: ideal profile of amino acid as the control (IPAA; Lys:Met 2.9:1, Lys:Arg 2:1), increased Met (incMet; Lys:Met 2.5:1), increased Arg (incArg; Lys:Arg 1:1), or incMet plus incArg (Lys:Met 2.5:1 Lys:Arg 1:1) with or without 100 μM exogenous cell-permeable Ce (N-Acetyl-d-sphingosine). Ceramide stimulation downregulated the overall abundance of phosphorylated (p) protein kinase B (AKT), p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p-eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Without Ce stimulation, increased Met, Arg, or Met + Arg resulted in lower p-mTOR. Compared with control SAT stimulated with Ce, increased Met, Arg, or Met + Arg resulted in greater activation of mTOR (p-mTOR/total mTOR) and AKT (p-AKT/total AKT), with a more pronounced response due to Arg. The greatest protein abundance of glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) was detected in response to increased Met supply during Ce stimulation. Ceramide stimulation decreased the overall protein abundance of the Na-coupled neutral amino acid transporter SLC38A1 and branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK). However, compared with controls, increased Met or Arg supply attenuated the downregulation of BCKDK induced by Ce. Circulating ceramides might affect amino acid, insulin signaling, and glutathione metabolism in dairy cow adipose tissue. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm the role of rumen-protected amino acids in regulating bovine adipose function.</jats:p>"

To examine the status of regional water resources security in the Huaihe Eco-economic Belt, this study builds a comprehensive evaluation index system based on the ‘Driving-Pressure-State-Impact-Response’ (DPSIR) framework, combines the entropy weight method and Lotka–Volterra symbiosis model to calculate the water resources security status from 2010 to 2018. Then the fixed effects regression model is used to analyze the factors affecting the water resources system. The results show that: (1) The status of water resources security in the Huaihe Eco-economic belt decreased from 2011 to 2017 and, thereby transitioned from a safe to a dangerous state. The coordination index of the economic system and water resource system was only −0.17 in 2017, and the partial development model benefited the economy but damaged the water resources. (2) The security status of 25 prefecture-level cities improved significantly, and the number of cities with status of alert or above increased from 11 to 15. However, there are apparent differences among the regions. The status has shifted to ‘north and south being better than east and west’. The water resources security status of Jining, Linyi, and Lu'an have improved, whereas Yancheng, Taizhou, Pingdingshan, and other cities showed rather poor development during 2017. (3) The correlation coefficient of the economic system was −0.154 and hindered the development of the water resources system. The correlation coefficients of the added value of the tertiary industry and the expenditure on energy conservation and environmental protection was 0.699 and 0.180 respectively and played a positive role in promoting the water resources system. It is necessary to optimize and adjust the industrial structure and protect the environment.</jats:p>",

The root response ratio of rth3 was greater than that of WT at low P, but could not completely compensate for the loss of root hairs. This suggests that plants enhanced P acquisition through complementarity between lateral roots and root hairs, and thus regulated nutrient foraging and shoot growth.

Not only fertilizer N, but also N from other available sources should be considered in N supply capacity. We conducted a 10-year farming experiment using a split-plot design with two different main fertilizer management approaches and three N application strategies as add-on sub-treatments. Based on the experiment, we estimated the total N supply (TNsupply) for the summer maize cropping system, through considering environmental, soil, crop residue, and fertilizer N sources. An appropriate TNsupply was established by correlating TNsupply with the relative yield (RY), N input and output, and N use efficiency (NUE). The results revealed a wide variation in TNsupply (from 88 to 755 kg ha−1). The RY, N input, and N output fitted well to TNsupply using linear-plateau, linear, and linear-plateau models, respectively. The lower limits of TNsupply for achieving the maximum RY and N output were 361 and 358 kg ha−1, respectively. The relationship between N input and N output was described as linear-plateau. We determined the slope of the linear curve (55.4%) as the lower limit of NUE, beyond which the upper limit of TNsupply was determined to be less than 497 kg ha−1. Thus, appropriate TNsupply values ranged from 325 to 497 kg ha−1 for summer maize production, which could ensure enough N supply for higher yields and avoid excessive N input for higher NUE and lower environmental N loss. Our findings highlight that TNsupply can be an alternative indicator for evaluating N management.</jats:p>"

The aim of this research is to identify the determinants of the elderly employment in the context of active ageing. The author analysed secondary data collected by the international and Latvia’s institutions as well as by Latvia’s researchers who have studied the elderly. The results of these studies and the data of Latvia’s statistics show that the rapid growth of the elderly employment in Latvia is more likely not an indicator of active ageing, but the elderly’s attempt to overcome poverty. 60.3 % of the elderly in Latvia continue to work in order to increase their current income, and only 10.2 % – for non-financial reasons, which is one of the lowest values in the EU. The gap between the average income of Latvia’s population and the income of people 65+ is increasing over the past 10 years. The elderly in Latvia work mainly in education and health care. These sectors have relatively lower average wages and are therefore less attractive to young people, so the elderly employment in them shows not only the importance of knowledge and experience, but also the difficulties in attracting new employees. The author concludes that Latvia is still far from real active ageing, which is typical for the most competitive EU countries. In order to move in this direction, it would be useful to use the experience of the EU’s active ageing initiatives.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, this study demonstrates the possibility of applying the thermodynamic state variable exergy as a physical reference property of a system within the PhO method. To explain the approach, the heat generation in the wood pellet-fired boiler is compared to the supply from a heat pump, which itself is connected to a power plant. Furthermore, the process-independent PhO is explained in order to illustrate the limitations of feasible optimization. Additionally, possible research topics such as the integration of dynamic behavior in the method are approached. As a conclusion, the differences between the methods outline the advantage of the PhO in the optimization process.</jats:p>"

Understanding hydrological cycle and water quality changes in response to pollution control measures is fundamental for a better water management there. Using coupled MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 modeling, various hydrological components in Yanghe Basin in a semiarid area of North China were quantified for three typical hydrological years and concentrations of COD and TP in a national monitoring section of Yanghe were evaluated with/without pollution control measures. The modeling results show that the underground water storage of Yanghe Basin becomes depleted due to evapotranspiration compensation and groundwater utilization regardless of hydrological condition, indicating an unsustainable in-situ water resource utilization. Water quality goals set for Yanghe (COD ≤ 20 mg/L and TP ≤ 0.2 mg/L) can hardly be achieved if pollution control measures are not taken, especially for a dry hydrological year. Depending on hydrological conditions, non-point source control technology-related projects in a 109-km2 village and a 7-km river-channel wetland in mainstream of Yanghe will have a positive effect or negligible effect on water quality improvement. To meet water quality goals, implementation of three wetlands is an effective and economic way.</jats:p>",

The creation of photoconverters based on thin films from a variety of materials and compounds is a promising direction in the development of solar energy. Unfortunately, the efficiency of these photoconverters is not yet high enough, but the cost of equipment for their creation, and hence the cost of instrument structures, is already quite acceptable.The investigated solar cells were obtained by the method of thermal vacuum evaporation using a UVN67 vacuum unit with modified internal equipment.After manufacturing, solar cells (SCs) were investigated under standard laboratory conditions adopted for the study of solar cells for ground-based use, i.e. in the AM 1.5 mode with a luminous flux power of 100 mW / cm2 and a temperature of 25 ° C. To study degradation processes in such solar cells after measuring the initial parameters The solar cells were placed in a sealed plastic box and kept for 4 years at a temperature of 15-25 ° СChecking the elements demonstrate high degradation resistance, which provides general requirements for the material and the conditions for its creation promising for use as unconventional sources of power supply for emergency response systems and ensuring the use of information and technical methods for preventing emergency situations as a result of fire in conditions of damage to the power supply of emergency response systems.</jats:p>"

One of the most important tasks for investors in the context of the coronavirus crisis is the analysis, assessment and effective management of risks that can affect investment projects before investing. And also, the investor must identify the factors that negatively affect the project and develop measures to reduce their negative impact. Based on the above, it can be said that improving the risk management methodology and evaluating investment projects based on modern and best practices has become one of the urgent tasks. In this article, the author explains the essence of risk management and presents the main stages of risk management developed by foreign and domestic economists, and also expresses her own opinion about the stages of risk management of investment projects in the form of a scheme. The article also presents the content of the methods of risk analysis that are frequently used in practice. In particular, the author shows the essence of methods for assessing investment risks, such as Break-even point, the sensitivity analysis of the project, the method of Scenarios, the method for assessing the sustainability of the project, Expert evaluation method, Analogy method, and others. We can identify two aims of research: 1) to study the stages of investment risk management, developed by foreign and domestic scientists, and, on their basis, to propose the stages of risk management, developed by the author; 2) to study various methods of risk assessment, which are a key part of investment risk management, and develop proposals for their application in Uzbekistan. To achieve the objectives of the study, the following tasks were identified:  explain the content of the economic categories “risk” and “investment risk”;  explain the content of investment risk management;  study of the process (stages) of investment risk management, developed by foreign and domestic economists;  development by the author of the stages of the investment risk management process;  study and outline methods for assessing the risks of investment projects;  development of recommendations on the application of risk assessment methods in Uzbekistan.

In order to manage environmental problems and match ecosystem supply and social demand, these urban agglomerations promoted regional socio-ecological integration but ignored differential city management during the process of integration. Therefore, it is necessary to design a general framework linking ecosystem supply and social demand to differential city management. In addition, in previous studies, ecosystem services supply–demand amount (mis)match assessment was emphasized, but ecosystem services supply–demand type (mis)match assessment was ignored, which may lead to biased decisions. To deal with these problems, this study presented a general ecosystem services framework with six core steps for differential city management and developed a double-indices (amount and type) method to identify ecosystem services supply–demand (mis)matches in an urban agglomeration. This framework and the double-indices method were applied in the case study of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration. Ecosystem supply–demand amount and type (mis)match levels and spatial pattern of twenty-six cities were identified. Twenty-six cities in the YRDUA were classified into five kinds of cities with different levels of ES supply–demand (mis)matches for RS, three kinds of cities for PS, and four kinds of cities for CS. Differential city management strategies were designed. Despite its limitations, this study can be a reference to giving insights into ES supply–demand (mis)match assessment and management.</jats:p>"

Prediction of effluent turbidity of the sedimentation tank can effectively solve the aforementioned problem. Given that it is difficult for the ordinary random forest (RF) model to accurately predict the effluent turbidity of a sedimentation tank for complicated changes of raw water quality, an improved random forest (IRF) model composed of long-term and short-term parts is proposed, which can capture the periodicity and time-varying characteristics of influent water quality data. The experimental results show that the root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error of IRF model in Baiyangwan waterworks are improved 67.52% and 67.91% respectively, compared with those of the ordinary RF model. The proposed effluent turbidity predictions are also successfully developed in Xujiang waterworks and Xiangcheng waterworks of Suzhou, China. This research provides an effective method for real-time prediction of the effluent turbidity of sedimentation tank according to the influent water quality data.</jats:p>",

The smallholder farmer sells agricultural products through the intermediary platform but lacks financial resources for planting. In addition to traditional bank financing (provided by a bank), the creditworthy intermediary platform can provide loans directly to the farmer (known as direct financing) or serve as a guarantor if the farmer's creditworthiness is insufficient to access bank loans (known as guarantor financing). We show that under guarantor and direct financing, the smallholder farmer's production level can be even higher than that in a centralized system. The farmer prefers direct financing when the production cost is low but the unit commission fee is sufficiently high. Otherwise, he prefers guarantor financing. The intermediary platform will encourage the farmer to resort to bank financing when the farmer's production cost is sufficiently high and the commission fee is low. Otherwise, it will provide direct financing. Guarantor financing makes the platform weakly worse off than direct financing and will be adopted only when the platform is also capital‐constrained. The involvement of the intermediary platform significantly improves the welfare of the farmer and the total profit of the supply chain. Moreover, the increased concern for social responsibility of the intermediary platform can lead to a win‐win‐win outcome for the farmer, the platform, and the whole supply chain. </jats:p>",

However, its implementation in the SSCM (Sustainable Supply Chain Management) strategy is sophisticated, and the challenges are not explored very well, especially in the Moroccan context. To this end, the chief objective of the current endeavor is to investigate the barriers that hinder the adoption of blockchain technology in SSCM from the Moroccan industry and service sectors’ perspective. Based on a comprehensive literature search and the use of experts’ viewpoints, the barriers affecting the successful implementation of blockchain are classified into three categories called TEO: technological and system, environmental, and intra-organizational dimensions. In this context, a fuzzy group decision-making framework is organized by combining DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and IFAHP (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process). The IFAHP technique helps to determine the importance/priorities of barriers affecting blockchain adoption, while the DEMATEL technique forms the cause–effect interconnections between these barriers and classifies them concerning the degree of importance and relationships. The results reveal that ‘government policy and support’ and ‘challenges in integrating sustainable practices and blockchain technology through SCM’ are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Moroccan SSCM. The proposed solution can support industrial decision makers to form flexible short- and long-term decision-making strategies to efficiently manage a sustainable supply chain.</jats:p>"

Based on theoretical analysis and practical investigation, we define the five stakeholders, namely collective economic organizations, farmers, local government, banks and land users, as the respondents of our questionnaire survey. Through in-depth interviews and literature review, we obtained the categories of risks with stakeholders. Data were obtained through questionnaire survey, a total of 307 surveys were conducted to analyze the probability of risk occurrence and the severity of consequences. Frequency analysis, risk matrix method, and Borda count method were used to analyze the survey results in order to determine the risk level and key risk. The research finds that the information asymmetry risk perceived by farmers and the market risk perceived by banks are key risks. In terms of stakeholders, famers and banks perceived the highest overall risks. It implies that the information-disadvantaged stakeholder is usually the one with a strong sense of risk.</jats:p>"

In this study, a simulation framework of the occurrence probability of drought events based on a nested copula function and Gibbs sampling is proposed to effectively compensate for the high-dimensional problems and lack of initial data in traditional methods. Precipitation data of 718 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2018 in China was analyzed. The results showed that the occurrence location of drought events was mainly concentrated from 35° to 42° north latitude and 105° to 120° east longitude, with the occurrence time mainly concentrated from September to November. The Archimedean-copula function, constructed based on latitude, longitude, and occurrence time, could precisely determine the spatiotemporal joint probability distribution of drought events (RMSE: 0.01). The optimal time-varying nested Archimedean-copula functions were obtained from February to May (spring), June to September (summer) and October to January (autumn and winter). Compared with the nested Archimedean-copula function, the accuracy of Gibbs sampling and simulation based on the time-varying nested Archimedean-copula function was increased by 84.05% latitude and 69.76% longitude.

Hence, the process of business management has to provide for interaction among the company, the management and utilisation of its resources, its financial management, and the stakeholders of the buying and selling process – businesses, consumers and public authorities. In light of the above, business management can not only contribute to a sustainable product consumption but also make a positive impact upon public action and thinking. The author's research fields conclusions regarding the key factors for running a sustainable business in Latvia. Based on expert interviews, it was analysed what promotes / hampers the development of sustainable entrepreneurship in Latvia, looking into the prospects of sustainable entrepreneurship in Latvia. During the research it was found, that the development of sustainable entrepreneurship in Latvia is promoted by the regulatory pressure created by the European Union, as well as the growing public interest in sustainability issues created by the available information space. The development of sustainable entrepreneurship in Latvia is hindered by the lack of interaction between public education and the regulatory system in terms of sustainability, reducing the effectiveness of motivating sustainable choices.</jats:p>",

There is an urgent demand to develop technologies that can detect and localize the leakage in a timely and efficient manner. The monitoring data of the WDS is a typical time series, and there is a certain spatiotemporal correlation between the data provided by the devices distributed at different locations of the WDS. This paper proposes a novel model-based method for WDS leakage localization. The method is characterized by (1) developing the dominant sensor sequence for each candidate leakage node to improve the localization accuracy based on the spatial correlation analysis; (2) utilizing multiple time steps of the measurements which are temporal varying correlated; (3) ranking leakage regions and nodes by their possibility to contain the true leakage. A realistic WDS is used to evaluate the performance of the method. Results show that the method can accurately and efficiently localize the leakage.</jats:p>",

We describe our center’s experience with pediatric liver transplantation using anonymous nondirected living liver donors (ND‐LLD). First‐time pediatric liver transplant candidates listed at our center between January 2012 and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and categorized by donor graft type, and recipients of ND‐LLD grafts were described. A total of 13 ND‐LLD pediatric liver transplantations were performed, including 8 left lateral segments, 4 left lobes, and 1 right lobe. Of the ND‐LLD recipients, 5 had no directed living donor evaluated, whereas the remaining 8 (62%) had all potential directed donors ruled out during the evaluation process. Recipient and graft survival were 100% during a median follow‐up time of 445 (range, 70‐986) days. Of ND‐LLDs, 69% were previous living kidney donors, and 1 ND‐LLD went on to donate a kidney after liver donation. Of the ND‐LLDs, 46% were approved prior to the recipient being listed. Over time, the proportion of living donor transplants performed, specifically from ND‐LLDs, increased, and the number of children on the waiting list decreased. The introduction of ND‐LLDs to a pediatric liver transplant program can expand the benefit of living donor liver transplantation to children without a suitable directed living donor while achieving excellent outcomes for both the recipients and donors.</jats:p>",

A short version of the burnout measure developed by Ayala Malach-Pines was used to estimate the burnout level among social services sector employees. The survey results indicate that about one third of the surveyed employees are exposed to a high risk of burnout. Contrary to other studies, burnout has no relationship with the number of clients (a proxy variable for workload) served in a given institution. Burnout is more likely associated with factors related to the methodological, technical support and overall working conditions in one’s organization.</jats:p>",

Here we show how community-based organizations have co-developed native seed supply strategies for landscape restoration from the bottom-up. We draw on the interconnections over two decades of seed networks in Brazil and the emerging Indigenous participation in native seed production in Australia. From an environmental justice perspective, we provide a participatory seed supply approach for local engagement, noting local geographical, social and cultural contexts. Meeting large-scale restoration goals requires the connection between local seed production and collaborative platforms to negotiate roles, rights and responsibilities between stakeholders. An enduring native seed supply must include a diversity of voices and autonomy of community groups that builds equitable participation in social, economic, and environmental benefits.</jats:p>",

A data acquisition and signal processing vibration test system is used to obtain vibration signals and verify simulation results including pipeline fluid velocity, fluid pressure, and transient stress. Based on the flow's vibration excitation characteristics, we consider structural vibration reduction technology and propose an optimized design scheme. As an example, we apply this approach to a pressure pipeline at the Ningxia Yanhuanding Pumping Station Project. Results show strong vibrations at the water inlet, the junction between the branch and main pipes, and the water outlet, with even stronger vibration at the inlet than at the outlet. In the optimized design scheme, adjusting the distance between the branch pipes only weakly reduces flow-generated pipeline vibration; increasing the pipe diameter and changing the main pipe's relative orientation show stronger effects. Vibration reduction is optimized for a main pipe dip angle of 2–5° relative to the branch pipes, simultaneously decreasing pumping station energy loss. These results provide a theoretical and practical basis for optimal design of pressure pipelines at high-lift pumping stations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the long history of the feudal society of China, Kaifeng played a vital role. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Kaifeng became a worldwide metropolis. The important reason was that the Grand Canal, which was excavated during the Sui Dynasty, became the main transportation artery for the political and military center of the north and the economic center of the south. Furthermore, Kaifeng was located at the center of the Grand Canal, which made it the capital of the later Northern Song Dynasty. The Northern Song Dynasty was called “the canal-centered era.” The development of the canal caused a series of major changes in the society of the Northern Song Dynasty that were different from the previous ones, which directly led to the transportation revolution, and in turn, promoted the commercial revolution and the urbanization of Kaifeng. The development of commerce contributed to the agricultural and money revolutions. After the Northern Song Dynasty, the political center moved to the south. During the Yuan Dynasty, the excavation of the Grand Canal made it so that water transport did not have to pass through the Central Plains. The relocation of the political center and the change in the canal route made Kaifeng lose the value of connecting the north and south, resulting in the long-time fall of the Bianhe River. Kaifeng, which had prospered for more than 100 years, declined gradually, and by the end of the Qing Dynasty, it became a common town in the Central Plains. In ancient China, the rise and fall of cities and regions were closely related to the canal, and the relationship between Kaifeng and the Grand Canal was typical. The history may provide some inspiration for the increasingly severe urban and regional sustainable development issues in contemporary times.</jats:p>"

The research was initially developed within the Marie Curie Innovative Training Network SUSPLACE and is further advanced by the Latvian Council of Science funded project ‘Ready for change? Sustainable management of common natural resources (RFC)’. By using this approach, the researchers aim to, firstly, synthesise natural, climate science and economic systems evidence of the immense transformations required towards regeneration and, secondly, engage in active knowledge brokerage and societal change advancement. Authors encourage to limit the application of the abused term ‘sustainable’ as it has rather meant to ‘sustain the unsustainable’ across the last decades and to follow the logic of ‘regeneration’ instead. The bridging of practices with the permaculture movement can be summarised in three broad groups of regenerative transformations to develop resilience against environmental breakdown – firstly, organic growing or gardening, secondly, ecological building, and thirdly, ecological lifestyle practices. These examples are arising both from particular collaborations with the selected permaculture homesteads as well as from the general environmental and social activism in Latvia. A common expression claims that ‘everything new is well forgotten old’. It resonates very well with the permaculture ethics and movement emphasising not forgetting yet critically assessing the long-developed skills and practices. This paper demonstrates that in addition to the challenging global aims, on the local level the success of permaculture depends on its ability to be deeply embedded in localities and revive cultural, local practices that people feel a connection to.</jats:p>",

Since the plant growth correlates with both microbial infection and nutrient stoichiometry, this study was performed to investigate whether the function of Epichloë bromicola endophyte to improve host growth depend upon the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) fertilization. Epichloë-infected (E+) and Epichloë-free (E−) wild barley plants were subjected to nine types of mixed N (0.2 mM, 3 mM, 15 mM) and P (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1.5 mM) levels treatments for 90 d to collect plant samples and determine multiple related indexes. We found that E. bromicola and N, P additions positively affected seed germination. Further, E. bromicola significantly enhanced chlorophyll content and root metabolic activity under N-deficiency, and meanwhile, might alter allocation of photosynthate under different conditions. The contents of N, P and stoichiometry of C:N:P of E+ plants were significantly higher than that of E− under nutrient deficiency, but contrary results were observed under adequate nutrients. Therefore, we propose that the growth-promoting ability of E. bromicola is closely correlated with N and P additional levels. Under low N, P additions, positive roles of endophyte are significant as opposed to negative roles under high N, P additions.</jats:p>"

In this article, the author tests the argument that the increase in the sheer number of polling stations and the expansion of territorial coverage is an election parameter in foreign countries with the potential to raise the election turnout. In sharp contrast to a popular argument and the academic debate, the results of the Latvian data analysis show that opening of new polling stations did not meet the intended goal and cannot be regarded as an effective method for raising the diaspora voter turnout; the means must be sought in other factors of election organisation and voter behaviour. To compare data of voter behaviour in foreign countries in four separate parliamentary elections and to determine tendencies in diaspora voting patterns, the deviation of the elections outcome in foreign countries from the general national results are analysed by the help of calculation model that uses the Voting Outcome Coefficient. The article outlines that the third and fourth wave of emigration have introduced a new tendency of extreme stratification in the results between the Latvian Association of Regions (2014), KPV LV (2018) and the rest of the political parties. The article also analyses the deviation of the elections outcome in the new polling stations from the vote share in particular foreign countries by the help of Polling Station Coefficient, and concludes that in the 13th Saeima election, all newly opened polling stations were beneficial for KPV LV as results in all of them were proportionally even better than the list’s overall results in a particular country.</jats:p>",

The channel response to these pulses included (a) large bedload transport rates, (b) bed aggradation, (c) fining of the bed surface, and (d) continuous formation and collapse of steps. In between pulses, the bed surface coarsened, and bedload transport rates dropped by several orders of magnitude. Steps continuously formed and collapsed during and shortly after the pulses, but their stability increased when the sediment feed was turned off. High pulse magnitude enhanced step formation, while low pulse frequency (i.e., long interpulse period) enhanced step stability. We back‐calculated the threshold for motion based on measured bedload transport rates and bed shear stress. Changes in the threshold for motion were much larger than changes in bed surface slope. By accounting for energy dissipation through the effective slope based on flow resistance partitioning, a better prediction was obtained. The threshold for motion decreased following sediment pulses then increased immediately after and fluctuated until the next sediment pulse. Our results indicate that longitudinal width variations and episodic sediment supply are primary controls on the evolution of step‐pool channels. Sediment feed magnitude affects mostly morphological changes, while sediment feed frequency controls channel stability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, we can observe various changes in family structure, which lead to the need to change the traditional understanding of the family. These changes can be explained by the prevalence of the globalization process in society, which have affected almost all spheres of life, including the family institute. Within the article, based on the analysis of statistical data and literature, the current trends of changes in family structure and related challenges will be described. When analysing changes in family structure, it is necessary to focus on both - structural and qualitative changes, which were reflected in the composition of families, trends in marriage registration, as well as in relationships between family members. The most characteristic changes show increase of such families with children where cohabiting partners are living together without registering the marriage as well as decreasing amount of nuclear families and increasing amount of single-parent families. This trend leads to other qualitative changes in family structure - several challenges of social policy because single-parent families often face different problems related to effective functioning of the family. For example, single-parent families with children are more often at risk of poverty than nuclear families, as well as face various types of problems in meeting the needs of the family. Social policy planners, when designing support for families with children, should take into account the specifics of single-parent families and provide them support according to the needs of these families, without waiting when families will fall into the social risk category.</jats:p>",

The single factor water quality assessment results showed that the common parameters exceeding the standard in both the wet and dry seasons included dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen, which were inferior to the target water quality grade III by 1–6 grades. The comprehensive water quality order reaching the target grade III was Hutang River (87.5%), Changling River (50.0%), Yaojiang River (43.8%), and Linzhou River (37.5%). The comprehensive water quality in the dry season (90.0% standard-achieving rate) was better than that in the wet season (25.0% standard-achieving rate). These results suggested that the surface runoff might considerably impact water quality. The factor analysis results showed that the basin surveyed in 2018 was mainly polluted by urban sewage and agricultural sources, while the primary pollution source in 2019 was agricultural pollution. Integrated with comprehensive water quality assessment results, in this study, we demonstrated that the series of water treatment projects carried out in Yuyao City positively impacted municipal sewage treatment.</jats:p>",

Lithuania shows an overall competitive position in blockchain adoption in fintech area. In contrast, Latvia significantly lags behind Estonia and Lithuania in terms of regional competitiveness and adoption of blockchain technology, which is weakened by the regulatory unclarity for virtual asset service providers and the lack of supportive actions from the government for blockchain innovation and its further adoption within and beyond crypto-space.</jats:p>",

Respondent survey (n = 383), using a paper-and-pencil self-administered approach and telephone interviews, was conducted based the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47). In order to ensure internal consistency and reliability, the authors used Cronbach’s α test (α = 0.965). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) allowed to determine that factor results differentiate between genders and there is a strong positive correlation (r = 0.945), that impacts results. Factors Access, Appraise and Apply explained each 30 % of the variance, and factors Understand explained 31 %. HL index division by gender indicated that 47.4 % of female respondents and 46.6 % of male respondents have “limited health literacy” (“inadequate” + “problematic”). The largest age group among respondents are 18-39-year old where there is lower level of education and lower income. However, cases have been observed when respondents even with higher education have “limited health literacy,” which indicates towards a need for further HL research in Latvia, because compared to HL of other member states, LV008 HL index is by 38.9 % larger than the EU average (47.6 %).</jats:p>",

We look at the number, land, labour and production of ten specialization types of farming in each of the EU-10 countries using EUROSTAT data, and compare these with the EU-15/27 averages. We conclude that the number of specialized farms in EU-10 declined to a lesser than in the EU-15 but doubled the production against 30 per cent growth in EU-15. The growth of production shows strong regional differences from 50 per cent to 200 in EU-10 and, offering more jobs in three countries in 2016 than in 2005. Cereal farms more than tripled production closing the gap to EU-15 average from two third to 50 per cent. In 2016, already over 75 per cent of the production of specialized farms in CEECs came from TOP 3 specializations (dairy, cereal and pig), well above EU-15 average (55 per cent). From 2005 until 2016 growth of area, labour and total productivity of specialized farms in EU-10 well exceeded that of EU-15. Their levels, however, were still only around 43 per cent, 25 per cent and 20 per cent of that of EU-15 in 2016. The ratio between the highest and lowest productivity levels within EU-10 is 3.8 with respect to area, 5.2 with respect to labour, and 35.4 with respect to total productivity in 2016 and shows clearly the extent of scattering in the productivity of specialized farms in EU-10 countries.</jats:p>",

The research purpose of this paper is to examine the presale discount, inventory, and service level decisions in an e-commerce supply chain, where the first period is the presale period and the second is the selling period for the new product. First, consumers were divided into two types—those who are risk averse and those who are not. Then, considering different presale discounts applied for new products, three presale strategy models were discussed: no-presale strategy, presale strategy with a moderate discount, and complete presale strategy, and the optimal decisions of e-commerce supply chain members were obtained under different valuations of the new product by consumers. Finally, the effects of the correlation coefficient between the numbers of the two types of consumers, the loss aversion degree of consumers, and the marginal profit in the sales period on the optimal discounted price and the maximum expected profit were analyzed. The conclusions of this article show that the presale strategy is not always optimal but depends on the parameters of the market and the type of consumers. For example, when the correlation coefficient between the two types of consumers is high, it is more profitable for the suppliers if they choose the presale strategy with a moderate discount, while e-commerce platforms tend to adopt the no-presale strategy. The optimal discounted price in the complete presale case is not necessarily lower than that in the moderately discounted presale case. If the marginal profit is high in the normal sales period or consumers are less averse to losses, suppliers are more likely to adopt the complete presale strategy. The research conclusions provide some theoretical reference for companies in the development of new product presale strategies in the e-commerce supply chain.</jats:p>",

Characterized by SEM, XRD, Zeta potential and FTIR, it was found that the ternary metal oxides were successfully loaded on the surface of biochar in amorphous form, resulting in the formation of hydroxyl active adsorption sites and positive charges, which played a synergistic role in fluoride removal. Through batch adsorption tests, key factors including contact time, initial fluoride concentration, initial pH and co-existing anions effects were investigated. Results showed that the tri-metallic modified biochar (La/Fe/Al-RSBC) had excellent fluoride removal performance with an adsorption capacity of 111.11 mg/g. Solution pH had little impact on the removal of fluoride, the adsorbent retained excellent fluoride removal capacity in a wide pH range of 3.0–11.0. The co-existing anions had almost no effect on the fluoride removal by La/Fe/Al-RSBC. In addition, La/Fe/Al-RSBC could be regenerated and reused. Electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange were responsible for this adsorption behavior. These findings suggested the broad application prospect of a prepared biochar adsorbent based on rare earth and aluminum impregnation for the fluoride removal from drinking water.</jats:p>",

According to EU Water framework directive, there are four river basin management systems established in Latvia, having related water and risk management documents in place, as well as, in the past decade, there have been both national and regional level planning guidelines developed for lake and river waterbodies management, but all mentioned has been not yet utilized in local practice, having some legal responsibilities’ and admin capacities’ deficiencies. Despite this, there has been seen slow improvement of the water quality and socio-economic usage of lakes, but more in the lake management practice is to be done, accounting also for climate change. The goal of this research was to study the municipal level lake management practice developments, applying general research-and-development (R&amp;D) framework approach and researching particularly the status and development trends of the three governance’s dimensions’ employment – governance content by socio-ecological system (SES) approach, governance segments as for main stakeholders’ involvement and participation, as well as, the set of governance instruments, especially, institutional/administrative ones. There were chosen pilot municipalities, having diverse and successful lake management approaches utilised, and, for the first study stage, document analysis and semi-structured interviews with related municipal specialists were done, using case study research (CSR) methodology application. There were recognized five lake management approaches, even in most municipalities in Latvia, particularly in rural ones, lake management is traditionally done by the scarce municipal territory administrative units and Utilities departments/services, and, only limited number of municipalities, also particularly studied, have developed and are employing for lake management also nature resource/environmental departments, while only in few municipalities there are established special municipal lake management agencies. Promising looks NGO sector management approach used by some municipalities, both top-down either bottom-up establishment chosen to apply, but as most perspective could be recognised complex approach (cross-sector) management practice, where most or all above mentioned approaches are combined and complementary supporting each other, within particular municipality. All studied municipalities possess certain lake management success stories, to be studied further in very detail, however, in general, there is to be seen still limited understanding and utilisation of the SES approach, also still potential of various stakeholder’s involvement and pro-active development of all complementary governance instruments, even many of instruments are available in studied municipalities, but lake communication instruments (information, education/training, participation and lake-friendly behaviour) are mostly underdeveloped.</jats:p>",

A literature review was conducted that helped to collect information regarding application of multiple-criteria decision-making for selection of logistics service providers and extract proposed selection criteria. Analysis of procurement documentation by logistics service providers was done to extract and group data that will be used to develop decision-making framework in further research. Authors created unique groups of logistics service providers selection criteria, requirements towards logistics service providers, selection goals and key performance indicators.

In this time of crisis, a suitable response requires novel ways to enable interaction between adult learners, adult learners and teachers, adult learners and content using online tools so that no one is left behind. In the context of regional development, online adult learning provides economic active inhabitants with wide opportunities since employees are able to attend high-quality trainings regardless the place of residence. In context of COVID-19, during the emergency situation Latvia has fully moved to remote learning, including adult learning. Educational institutions as well as enterprises that organise trainings for adults have to implement remote learning using several online tools. The aim of the paper is to analyse the main challenges of the adult learning sector in Latvia in context of COVID-19 taking into consideration the regional development issues. In order to achieve the aim, following research methods have been used: scientific literature studies, statistical data analysis, interviews. Main results of the survey: in case of Latvia, the Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Latvia has launched several initiatives towards enabling the shift to online learning, providing recommendations, digital tools as well as good practice sharing. At the same time, there is no methodology and detailed step-by-step recommendations, how to develop the online education learning for educational institutions in Latvia.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The administrative territorial reform of 2021 in Latvia has changed the shape and structure of local municipalities. Previous studies have shown that disparities and challenges in terms of demographic development will be even more evident between the newly formed municipalities than they were prior to the reform, creating greater demographic risks for the rural areas. By using the available statistical information and geographically weighted regression models, this study aims to evaluate the demographic challenges in Latvia’s rural areas and to determine main socio economic factors linked to the rural depopulation processes. Key indicators linked to the depopulation process are evaluated and discussed by the authors in the context of gender balance, development centre accessibility and other socio economic factors. Authors conclude that supporting and developing local industries, public services and infrastructure facilitating diverse employment options and equal opportunities for working age females is a paramount condition for slowing or reversing rural depopulation in in the long term. Regional development centres in general and particularly those located in remote areas show little or no immediate effect on the population dynamics. However, these centres offer more diverse employment opportunities and essential social services, making them more attractive to working age females and households with children. Digitalization and focus on location-independent employment and services is another important route to explore in the new rural development setting.</jats:p>",

Focus on optimally functioning transport should be considered as an important factor in sustainable economic development, and deviations from optimal values as an indicator of additional reserves for growth. Defining national economic interests is one of the main tasks of Ukraine's development. In order to develop independently, and at the same time on the basis of partnership and cooperation, it is necessary to develop transport provision for the regions and interregional integration to form a whole transport space. The author's approach in considering this problem using general scientific and special methods of scientific research made it possible to investigate these processes. The article describes a methodological approach to the study of the transportation in the regions of Ukraine on the basis of intermodality and multimodality using forms of scientific - technical and static analysis, which will contribute to the implementation of the state policy of interregional integration, taking into account freight transportation using various types of transport. A scientific and applied approach has been proposed for determining the interdependence of the gross regional product per person on the freight turnover by kind of transport by using the methodological tools of the system analysis theory in order to identify transport regions and efficiently locate multimodal terminals (transport hubs), which will contribute to the implementation of effective instruments to promote interregional integration and regional economic integration, information, education spaces into a single transport space, overcoming interregional alienation and the introduction of effective instruments of state support for interregional integration, will contribute to the implementation of interregional programs and projects.</jats:p>",

To accurately evaluate the water and soil environmental vulnerability and its evolution in the Jingtaichuan Pumping Irrigation District in China, this paper, taking 1994, 2006, and 2018 as typical years, selects 13 index factors that directly or indirectly drive the water and soil environmental evolution in this area, and adopts the cloud theory and analytic hierarchy process to determine the weight of each index factor. Spatial analysis technique and supervised classification were used to obtain and standardize the spatial distribution raster maps of each index factor. The multi-source data fusion was performed according to the index weight to analyze the evolution characteristics of soil and water environmental vulnerability. The results showed that soil salinity, vegetation coverage, and land use type have a significant impact on the water and soil environmental vulnerability in this irrigation area, and most of the area is at mild risk. High risk mainly occurs in closed hydrological units in the eastern part of the irrigation area. From 1994 to 2018, the evolution process can be divided into two stages, namely the ‘environmental deterioration stage’ and the ‘environmental restoration stage’. The results showed that the water and soil environment of the irrigation area is developing in a healthy way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, remote work, driven by mobile technology, the availability of the Internet and the spread of COVID-19 limiting work to be done at the workplace, has become increasingly popular. Although it is very easy nowadays to do many kinds of work remotely, many companies still do not want to introduce such practices on a permanent basis. Therefore, the research aims to examine the experience of companies in remote work to identify the economic benefits of remote work as well as develop scenarios for remote work. The research methodology is based on case study analysis, comparative analysis, economic analysis and the scenario method. The results of the research revealed that potential financial savings from applying remote work practices in companies varied, depending on the specifics of the industry and jobs, as well as the funds that the company was initially willing to invest in its employees. For companies, the largest economic savings from applying remote work practices came from maintenance of premises, as well as electricity and Internet bills, while the provision of equipment to their employees accounted for the smallest proportion of preliminary cost savings. However, the main disadvantages of remote work were the difficulty of controlling employees, communicating effectively with each other and ensuring successful teamwork. Companies could introduce part-time work practices if a large proportion of the tasks could be performed remotely, yet only the companies with a high level of automation of tasks might fully switch to remote work.</jats:p>",

However, any scientist points to changes in rural areas that are associated with the outflow of people to cities and land abandonment in some regions. The multifunctionality of rural areas determines their importance in the development of any country. In the European Union (EU), 28.0 % of the EU-28 population lived in a rural area in 2015, while in Latvia – 32.3 % of its total population. Therefore, support instruments of the second pillar of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) (rural development) contribute to a sufficient standard of living for the rural population and include both economic and social objectives. The research aims to analyse the EU support instruments for rural development that promote economic and social development in rural areas in Latvia. The research analyses the definition of the concept of rural territory given in national and EU policy documents and the results of project-type measures of the EU CAP second pillar (rural development) support instruments implemented during the planning period 2014-2020 for national rural development policy. It was found that in Latvia total available public funding for the RDP 2014-2020 was EUR 1.541 million, there were 6 main priorities and 88 % projects were funded at the end of February 2021.

Taking the hospitality and tourism industries as typical examples, this paper considers a platform service supply chain, where a leading hotel is responsible for offline service, and a following platform is in charge of pricing, online service, and advertising investment. Three decision modes (i.e., decentralized, cost-sharing, and integrated) for the platform service supply chain are investigated. We derive the optimal service levels for the hotel and the platform, advertising investment, and retail price in each mode. Our analyses indicate that perceived service quality and brand image vary over time, and they gradually converge to a steady-state. The cost-sharing mode can be achieved if the hotel can obtain enough profit per unit. Once the cost-sharing mode is achieved, it can help improve perceived service quality and brand image, which further increases both the hotel and the platform’s profits. However, the integrated mode generates the best-perceived service quality, brand image, supply chain performance, and the lowest price. </jats:p>",

The development of the economy of Latvia is significantly affected by the forest area reaching 52 % of the country’s total area. Assessing the services of the ecosystem of Latvia and valuing them in monetary terms could significantly change the structure of the economy of Latvia. Therefore, the value of ecosystem services consumed domestically and the possibility to export the services should be taken into account when drawing up policy documents for the forest and related industries of Latvia. The research aims to make a theoretical observation and experience collection of ecosystem service valuation methods and indicators that determine the value of ecosystem services and suggest the main methods for valuing the services of the ecosystem of Latvia. It should be acknowledged that no extensive research on the potential monetary contribution of ecosystem services to the national economy has been conducted in Latvia. Several research studies that focused only on certain areas have been carried out in Latvia. It should be emphasized that valuation practice employs a wide range of methods. Therefore, it is necessary to examine and select the most appropriate methods for identifying the value of ecosystem services under Latvian conditions, supplementing the range of the methods and adapting them to local conditions so that they help to more accurately value ecosystem services in the national and international context. Determining the value of ecosystem services would help to redirect the flow of national investment from traditional industries to efficient forest land management. Otherwise, private forest properties are increasingly sold to foreign businesses, which might lead to a lower value of the national capital of Latvia in the future.</jats:p>",

The aims of this study were to (i) investigate N application on forage cover crops or cover crop residues as a substitute for N sidedressing (conventional method) for maize and (ii) investigate the supply of mineral N in the soil and the rates of biomass decomposition and N release. The treatments comprised two species, i.e., palisade grass [<jats:italic>Urochloa brizantha</jats:italic> (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D.

The maximum rates of biomass decomposition and N release were in palisade grass. The biomass of palisade grass and ruzigrass were 81 and 47% higher in N application at 35 DBS compared with control in ruzigrass (7 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and N release followed the pattern observed of biomass in palisade and ruzigrass receiving N 35 DBS (249 and 189 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Mineral N in the soil increased with N application regardless of cover crop species. Maize grain yields and AE were not affected when N was applied on palisade grass 35 DBS or 1 DBS (average 13 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 54 kg N kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> maize grain yield) compared to conventional method. However, N applied on ruzigrass 35 DBS decreased maize grain yields.

In Latvia, social enterprises have been operating for a long time, but only recently the Social Enterprise Law was adopted, which regulates the tasks of social entrepreneurship and the support possibilities. This study highlights the level of entrepreneurship activity in the country as a whole (the number of enterprises and the number of newly established enterprises) and within individual statistical regions in the period from 2018 till 2020, analysing the structure of enterprises and indicators representative of entrepreneurship in Latvia and its regions: the dynamics of the number of enterprises per 100 000 inhabitants. The following hypothesis was made: Social entrepreneurship in the regions of Latvia has a disproportionate impact on socio-economic problems. It was found that social enterprises operate twice as much in Riga region as in any other region of Latvia, which has the lowest poverty index. However, the highest poverty index is found in Latgale region, where proportionally the lowest number of social enterprises operates. Social entrepreneurship can be a successful tool for addressing socio-economic problems in the regions and for regional development. For this development to take place, it would be necessary to develop instruments to support social entrepreneurship with the aim of improving the well-being of all regions, not only the region where the social enterprise operates.</jats:p>",

Aim of this study is to analyse activities set in the municipal planning documents to promote the development of creative industries and to assess the impact of creative industries entrepreneurship on regional development. The research is based on the analysis of the regional policy planning documents and on interviews with representatives of creative industries and with regional development planners. Research results showed that, while national policy planning documents stress that creative industries have an important role in the regional development, only a small number of local development plans highlight this role. Moreover, these documents are not always properly and effectively implemented. On the other hand, case studies showed that appropriate initiatives foster entrepreneurship in creative industries and they can play a key role in regional development.</jats:p>",

However, there are a few empirical research studies on digitalization in the public sector, particularly in public administration institutions. Therefore, the present research aims to identify and compare the level of digitalization in four national public administration institutions: the State Revenue Service, the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, the State Social Insurance Agency and the State Employment Agency. In Latvia, very good technical solutions and a broadband mobile Internet network are available, the number of Internet users increases all over the world every year, but are they widely used by public administration institutions to provide consumers with appropriate digital services? The State Revenue Service has reached the highest level of maturity in digitalization, and the institution has also allocated the most funds from its budget to information technologies and the maintenance of their systems. The level of digitalization is low in the State Employment Agency and the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs. The public requires public administration services to be available digitally on a 24-hour/7day basis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the adoption of the Green Deal in the European Union (EU), the role of biodiversity, basic principles of the circular economy, climate change mitigation, forest protection and renewable energy increased. Since 2007, biogas production in Latvia has increased significantly, as it was possible to receive co-funding from the EU Funds for the construction of biogas plants. In 2021, inputs of agricultural origin are used by 40 biogas plants with an average installed capacity of 1 MW. The emergence of biogas plants on livestock farms is facilitated by the development of a circular economy producing waste from the production process – manure and feed waste. Anaerobic fermentation results in digestate – a nutrient-rich plant fertilizer that reduces the application of chemical fertilizers. Rational use of biogas can reduce the need for fossil fuels. Energy production from biogas should be encouraged, as waste is used efficiently, thereby generating energy and reducing the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In Latvia, livestock production is one of the key industries of the national economy, which produces manure and feed waste. The present research calculated the amounts of cattle, pig and poultry manure and feed waste in Latvia. The research analysed livestock farms by number of cattle, pigs and poultry, the potential amounts of manure and waste produced and theoretical biogas output. Theoretically, 309 farms analysed can produce 93.5 mln. m3 of biogas from agricultural waste and construct 269 new biogas plants. A policy for supporting the construction of new biogas plants would contribute to the country’s independence from fossil energy sources, as well as increase the proportion of renewable energy sources to 50-70 % in final energy consumption by 2030. Farmers on whose farms a biogas plant could be built need to carefully consider the uses of the biogas produced. The uses could be thermal energy generation for heat supply, cogeneration (thermal and electrical energy) or biomethane production.</jats:p>",

The effects of K supply on plant growth, nutritional status, leaf gas exchange parameters, leaf water potential (Ψw), leaf area (LA), stomatal density (SD), leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopic compositions (δ13C and δ15N ‰) and leaf C/N ratio under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water deficit were measured. Under both control (non-PEG) and osmotic stress (+PEG) conditions, K supply increased plant growth, boosting dry matter yield with decreased C/N leaf ratio and δ15N ‰ values. The +PEG significantly reduced LA, plant growth, dry matter yield, Ψw, number of stomata per plant and leaf gas exchange, relative to non-PEG condition. Potassium supply alleviated osmotic-induced alterations in Eucalyptus seedlings by better regulating leaf development as well as SD, thus improving the rate of leaf gas exchange parameters, mesophyll conductance to CO2 (lower δ13C ‰ values) and water use efficiency (WUE). Consequently, K-supplied plants under drought better acclimated to osmotic stress than K-deficient plants, which in turn induced lower CO2 assimilation and dry matter yield, as well as higher leaf δ13C ‰ and δ15N ‰ values. In conclusion, management practices should seek to optimize K-nutrition to improve WUE, photosynthesis-related parameters and plant growth under water deficit conditions.</jats:p>",

In turn, the growth and competitiveness of companies is based on the ability to create and sell demanded, knowledge-intensive products and services on the basis of science, integrating into increasingly higher value-added global chains. Many companies are facing economic difficulties during the COVID- 19 crisis and have to suspend or significantly reduce their operations and staff. However, for some companies, the crisis has also given them the opportunity to reorient their operations to the digital environment, both in serving customers and in organizing the company's operations. The data obtained during the study show that the majority of entrepreneurs predict a decline in customer solvency and the emergence of new digital technologies in the market. Entrepreneurs think they should make more use of the latest technologies (forms of digital sales and communication with customers), new forms of cooperation in company communication (forms of digital communication with employees) and plan to introduce remote and / or semi-remote work. Entrepreneurs expect that the biggest challenges after the crisis caused by the pandemic will be the acquisition of new leadership skills and the acquisition of new digital technologies, as well as attracting investment. Unfortunately, the data of the study show that the majority of entrepreneurs did not use the support programs of state and local government institutions, but assessed the support measures developed by the government as very fragmented.

Questions examined how people aged 50 years and older coped with socioeconomic and health-related impact of COVID-19. During the last decade, participation of older age groups in labour market is gradually growing with the increase of the statutory retirement age and life expectancy. Employment rates in the pre-retirement and post-retirement age groups are comparatively high in Latvia and other Baltic States as contrasted to the EU averages, especially among women. Despite of relatively worse health status, people in the Baltic countries also demonstrate the highest share of respondents with willingness to work even upon reaching pension age.

However, over recent years diversification of tourist products and appealing new market segments have become one of the main priorities of the tourism development strategy of Ajara Autonomous Republic. As a result, the government is creating an appropriate tourist infrastructure, especially in rural areas to support developing such tourist products as adventure and eco-tourism. Adventure tourism can deliver significant benefits at the local level and it is a developing segment in Ajara. Creating adventure tourism products requires integration of various interdependent services. A tourism value chain is defined as a system that describes the cooperation of private and state sectors in providing resources, which creates costs and adds value through various processes and delivers final products to visitors. The purpose of the research was to determine weak links in the value chain and creating a comprehensive value chain model to form the competitive adventure tourism product. The research involved all actors, which operate in the tourism sector. Based on the results of the survey, in the value chain, the food link turned out to be the weakest, whereas the accommodation with the highest share was distinguished in the visitor spending structure. Overall, the cost of the adventure tour will be affordable for both international and domestic tourists. At this stage, government support and participation are crucial in the formation of adventure tourism infrastructure. Through using the case study and qualitative research methods, we tried to identify challenges to the growth of adventure tourism in Ajara and developed recommendations to overcome these challenges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prefabricated construction as a preferred construction approach instigated significant technological advancements in construction supply chains in Hong Kong (HK). The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) was a milestone prefabricated construction project which was successfully constructed using these industrial advancements. However, the project itself was a great challenge as it was highly vulnerable to disruptions due to complex supply chain processes. In this regard, increased resilience could be the key to boosting project performance through enhanced Supply Chain Capabilities (SCCs), where identifying SCC dynamics becomes essential. Therefore, this study employed the Topic Over Time Modeling approach to detect critical SCCs using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018, which spans the period from project design to handover. The popularity trend analysis of texts enabled identifying the six most critical capabilities associated with each construction phase of planning, construction and handover. Thereafter, an ex-post capability evaluation map was developed by considering the popularity trend of capabilities and their relevance to different project phases. Industry practitioners would benefit from prior knowledge of SCCs and their dynamic impact on each project phase to prioritize initiating them adequately and appropriately, targeting value-enhanced-resilient supply chains in ex-ante decision-making of future prefabricated infrastructure development projects. Further, the text-mining research approach unveils to academia, an effective and novel mechanism to extract dynamic empirical clues from a large unstructured set of documents in construction SCC analysis research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Latvia, the global business services sector accounts for 2.3 % of GDP, and its share in total service exports is 8 %, while the turnover of the sector in 2019 was estimated at EUR 400 mln., which indicates that the global business services sector in Latvia is an important component of the national economy. The global business services sector in Latvia has developed relatively recently, so it has not yet been sufficiently assessed and researched. The aim of the research is to describe the factors affecting the development of the global business services sector in Latvia. The research concluded that the global business services sector in Latvia was promoted by such factors as the availability of labour and low labour costs, as well as a relatively favourable business environment. The potential of the global business services sector in Latvia is also characterized by its advantageous geographical location, especially from the perspective of Scandinavian investors (including in terms of cultural similarities), as well as the foreign language skills of potential employees. The establishment of the Association of Business Service Leaders in Latvia (ABSL Latvia) (the only such an association in the Baltic States that defends the interests of this sector) is also an important driver for the development of the sector.</jats:p>",

At the onset of the emergency, Latvia, like many parts of the world, experienced uncoordinated collective behavior that could potentially lead to significant changes in food supply chains. Therefore, one of the research directions of The National Research Program project “Towards the Post-pandemic Recovery: Economic, Political and Legal Framework for the Preservation of Latvia's Growth Potential and Increasing Competitiveness” (recovery-LV) (2020) was to find out how the Covid-19 crisis Restrictions have changed buyers' habits towards buying and consuming food. The article summarizes and analyses the research results of the content analysis, semi-structured interviews and survey conducted within the project. An analysis of the results shows that, as a result of the crisis, consumers are less likely to visit outlets, cook more often at home and choose more locally sourced food. It was concluded that the consumer agitation regarding the purchase of food products in 2020 was short-lived, which later returned to the usual limits of the habits of various socio-demographic groups of the population.</jats:p>",

Innovating or anticipating disability-related social innovations can contribute to product and services for disabled people, but also to eliminate social barrier and to integrate them into society. The aim is to analyse the ways for implementation of social innovation which is bringing maximum value of life for people with disabilities. We expect that factor values affecting people with disabilities may vary since we have different regional infrastructure, social support and services. This literature review study sheds researches social inclusion among people with disabilities. Results: We investigated main domains and factors representing main values for people with disabilities. Findings from this study indicate that people with disabilities may feel deep depression and anxiety in response to social isolation. This study may contribute to values of perceived isolation and promote social barrier elimination. Conclusion: The social tasks associated with regional disability-oriented infrastructure as support require attention in literature. Offering social innovation and assessing current level of needs in regions to people with disabilities will significantly increase social value.</jats:p>",

The present research employed mostly SWOT analysis in combination with expert judgement. The research concluded that the overall trend in the following strengths of the bioeconomy: Research infrastructure and modern technical equipment for the development of the bioeconomic knowledge base (3S) and Vast regional coverage of and cooperation among leading research institutions in the field of bioeconomics (1S) was negative, as the total impact of the threats exceeded the total impact of the opportunities. However, the overall trend in the strength Extensive initial activities and the knowledge base for bioeconomic research (2S) was positive, as the total impact of the opportunities exceeded the total impact of the threats. The total impact of exogenous factors on the weaknesses in the development of the bioeconomy was positive; therefore, the total impact of exogenous factors tended to weaken the weaknesses. Since the largest positive impacts on endogenous factors were made by the following opportunities: Effective support for independent innovation projects implemented by large companies (3O) and Stimulation of innovation in the small and medium enterprise sector in active synergy with national research priorities and available funding (2IO), it is necessary to increase government and private sector funding for R&amp;D in order to contribute to the development of the bioeconomy in Latvia. The availability of funding should be balanced and predictable in the long term to reduce the impact of the threat Public policies and insufficient and unpredictable funding for research and development hinder the development of bioeconomy industries and steady growth opportunities (2T).

It is important to provide the highest possible quality of education during the state-of-emergency, despite the increased risks of COVID-19 what teachers face while work in a classroom. The workload of teachers has increased and for many of them working conditions have deteriorated. Multiple factors pose a risk to the quality of work-life in general. The aim of the paper is to find out the teachers’ opinions on the factors influencing their quality of work-life, comparing the situation in the regions of Latvia, and to develop proposals for strengthening social dialogue to improve teachers’ quality of work-life. In February 2021, the Latvian Trade Union of Education and Science Employees conducted a survey “Teachers’ Salaries, Principles of Workload Formation and Risks of Professional Burnout”, in which 10 077 teachers were surveyed to study various aspects of their quality of work-life. The results revealed differences between regions in the teachers’ assessment of their quality of work-life and the factors influencing it. The quality of work-life of teachers has decreased, comparing to the situation a year and five years ago. Significantly that 9 out of 10 respondents did not feel cared for at the national level. The authors conclude that it is crucial to improve the social dialogue between the state institutions, employers and employees in order to increase the quality of teachers’ work-life.</jats:p>",

Overall, a business intelligence system makes core and support operations and processes faster, as well as reduces costs and requires less human resources. However, problems were identified concerning a lack of motivation in employees to learn new technologies. The scenario analysis concluded that large companies should perform as many administrative and technological processes related to the mentioned technologies as possible themselves rather than outsource them, which allows them to save funds on the development of such technologies and improve the company’s data culture.</jats:p>",

However, the development of the biofuel industry is still struggling. The high degree of uncertainty makes the development of the industry face huge challenges. Kitchen waste, as a biodiesel raw material with a large yield, has good development prospects. Reuse of kitchen waste can solve public health and safety problems. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic programming model under supply disturbance to optimize the supply chain from the perspective of contract. Then current three main flow directions of kitchen waste are analysed and the reasonable price for biodiesel operators to purchase is determined. By signing contracts with the biodiesel operators, restaurant is guaranteed and encouraged to provide a certain percentage of kitchen waste to meet the demand for biodiesel production. Using actual case in the Yangtze River Delta region, the performance of the stochastic programming model under disturbance was compared. Through the sensitivity analysis of different parameters, this paper determines the influence of its supply chain network design and expected total system cost. Through the optimization of the waste cooking oil (WCO) for biodiesel supply chain, this paper can effectively improve the efficiency of the supply chain, reduce system costs, increase the profits of biofuel operators, and promote the sustainable development of the biofuel industry.</jats:p>",

The development of information and communication technologies in the 21st century has transformed everyday work and life, and it was expected that, over time, teleworking would become a common practice in most companies. However, it was slower than initially expected due to various social and organizational factors. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to forced remote work, creating problems and challenges for both employers and employees. This proves that new approaches and solutions are not only possible, but also useful and necessary. In order to find out what challenges employers have faced in the transition to remote work and what experience they have gained in order to solve them, two focus group discussions were organized with employers of Vidzeme region from different sectors. In order to compare the experience of employers and employees, a survey of 495 remote-working respondents was conducted between September and October 2020. The research data were collected in the framework of the National Research Programme project “Life with COVID-19\", during the first wave of the pandemic.

Family estates form entire settlements, functioning on the principles of preserving family values, master's motivation, cooperation, and environmental friendliness. Coronavirus crisis has exacerbated the desire of residents of large urban agglomerations to move to live in rural areas. The authors investigate the features of the current state of management of the settlements of family estates and their prospects in the post-COVID period. The aim of the work is to assess the potential of family homesteads in the formation of conditions for sustainable development of rural areas. The paper assesses the current state and forms of economic activity of settlements of family estates based on the results of the survey authors (structured interviews). The authors analyse the current and potential impact of family homesteads on sustainable rural development. The conclusion is made that under certain conditions, family estates can serve as one of the significant elements of the model of the future society in the post-COVID era.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the environmental, economic, social and political problems that have given rise to the global crisis continue to grow negatively and rapidly. It is with this situation that the world community has faced, feeling the consequences of earlier decisions. It is natural to raise the question: why, despite enormous efforts, it is not possible to reverse the negative trends and ensure the transition to sustainable development of the world community. In order for the criteria of sustainable development to meet these requirements, it is necessary to determine the main governing laws and find a way to measure different quality social, natural processes and resource flows in stable and universal units of measurement (measures). The article presents the basic definitions for the development of a formalized description of the tasks of monitoring sustainable development that meets the principles and requirements of sustainable development. It provides examples of calculating the parameters of sustainable development of Latvia and their primary interpretation. To formalize the tasks of sustainable development, the authors considered the methodology of systems analysis, methods of managing sustainable development projects using the concept of flows of full and useful power in open non-equilibrium stable systems, flows model of interactions in the system ‘man - society – nature’, as well as the theory of a unified system of space-time measurements. The main conclusions are: the system of four universal indicators of sustainable development shows that by 2019 the system of Latvia had a trend towards non-sustainable development. A decrease in consumption indicates an extensive development and is the result of a decrease in population, and is not associated with improving the structure of resource consumption and their efficient use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the specific features of the land factor, under market conditions, there is a tendency towards income deprivation of farms in relation to their surroundings. One way to improve this situation is to create a system of market institutions for farmer-recipient transactions. The issue of the position of the agricultural producer in the food supply chain is widely described in the literature on the subject. Nevertheless, practical analyses showing the real impact of the marketing position on economic results of farm are still rare. Therefore, the aim of this article is to assess the relationship between market integration and agricultural selling prices and, as a consequence, the level of global output and household income. The analysis is based on primary data from surveys of over 700 small-scale family farms in Poland. The choice of small-scale farms was deliberate, as these entities are the most discriminated against in the food supply chain. Explaining this process is key to improving the economic situation of small-scale farming and constitutes a premise for the objectives of agricultural policy and creating business strategy. The results of the research indicate that there is a positive correlation between the level of integration of an agricultural holding and sales prices for selected groups of agricultural products. This, in turn, leads to the improvement of economic condition of farms more closely integrated with the market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper examines the working capital indicators to find out the differences between larger and smaller Estonian agricultural companies. In the task of working capital management, a balance between profitability and liquidity is under investigation. A higher level of current assets ensures higher liquidity, but reduces the profitability. The share of inventories in current assets is relatively high in agricultural companies, and can lead to liquidity problems in adverse circumstances. Low levels of current assets can lead to business interruptions, as insufficient stocks lead to delays in the production process, which in turn is amplified in yields or other outputs. The number of employees is used to distinguish the size of the company. The results show that the smallest agricultural companies have higher liquidity and relatively larger share of highly liquid current assets. Larger agricultural companies maintain a higher level of inventory and have a longer inventory turnover period. Smaller companies have a slightly higher share of loans in current liabilities, so they have to maintain a larger financial buffer. The cash conversion cycle is longer for the smallest and the largest agricultural companies while medium-sized companies have a shorter cash conversion cycle. Smaller companies have the longest receivables turnover, showing that they enable longer payment periods for buyers or may have difficulties collecting receivables from the production sold. Having low market power and long receivables turnover, they have relatively higher need for working capital.</jats:p>",

The study used quantitative research methods through an extensive online survey. The questionnaire identified the following factors influencing teachers' performance: financial remuneration, non-financial remuneration, organizational culture and politics. The opinion of teachers was analysed in depth by regions of Latvia. The results show that in all regions of Latvia the performance of teachers is most significantly influenced by financial remuneration, non-financial remuneration and organizational culture are also important, but political presence plays an insignificant role. The results also revealed that in all regions (least in Riga and Pieriga) the increase of the minimum monthly wage rate of teachers or the wage is not the determining factor that would increase the performance of teachers.

One of the defining conditions of fiscal decentralization is the provision of the local government with financial resources in an amount sufficient to perform their tasks for development of rural areas. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to study the peculiarities of rural development of Ukraine in terms of fiscal decentralization, identify the main problems, and present an argument for the directions towards enhancing the positive impact of fiscal decentralization on the social and economic development of rural areas. The methodological basis of the article is general scientific and special methods of research, in particular: economic and statistical; analysis and synthesis; tabular and graphical. The conducted research has made it possible to establish that the implementation of fiscal decentralization has resulted in greater interest of village council in increasing revenues to local budgets by transferring the right to receive more tax revenues and non-tax revenues, finding contingency local budgets, improving the efficiency of tax administration and fees. The study gives grounds for proposing approaches to increase the effectiveness of fiscal decentralization in the context of rural development, including expanding of the list of taxes and fees in budget revenues of united territorial community (e.g. corporate income tax, personal income tax, environmental tax); improving the mechanism for providing local budgets with inter-budget transfers from the State Budget of Ukraine; optimization of budget expenditures under the condition that a guaranteed and affordable level of public services is provided; increasing the accountability of local governments in order to prevent corruption; involvement of the population in active participation in development policy of rural areas.</jats:p>",

Latvia has been receiving critical remarks from entrepreneurs in regard to high level of refuse for financing from the financing institution ALTUM which is the principal intermediary of EU funds and provides resources to support entrepreneurship in Latvia. Statistical data indicate that there are significant reductions of micro-enterprises during recent years. The survey data showed that ALTUM rejected 39 % of the surveyed micro-enterprises from those who had submitted applications within three years. In turn, only 6 % of micro-enterprises have received full financing from banks or leasing companies. Funders rejected applications from 9 % of micro-enterprises while another 5 % themselves withdrew funding due to unacceptable conditions. Latvia has to address serious challenges in entrepreneurship development in regions in particular with a lower economic activity. The aim of the paper is to analyse situation of micro-enterprises for receiving funding. Research methods: analysis of scientific publications and results of previous conducted research, analysis of data obtained in survey of enterprises on questions of financing refuse and on evaluations related to financing conditions in recent years. For a more thorough data analysis (used evaluation scale 1-5) indicators of descriptive statistics are applied: indicators of central tendency or location – arithmetic means, mode, median; indicators of variability or dispersion – range, standard deviation, standard error of mean; cross – tabulations; testing of statistical hypotheses using t-test and analysis of variance – ANOVA; correlation analysis. Research results indicate that the use of more precise requirements of financing for micro-enterprises by finance institution ALTUM could benefit in better development of entrepreneurship in regions of Latvia.</jats:p>",

In this study, the function of the neoxanthin synthase gene (BoaNXS) in Chinese kale was investigated. BoaNXS, which had a 699-bp coding sequence, was cloned from the white flower cultivar of Chinese kale and was expressed in all developmental stages and organs of Chinese kale; its expression was highest in young seeds. The subcellular localization indicated that BoaNXS was localized in the chloroplast. BoaNXS-overexpressed plants were obtained via Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression methodology, and the gene overexpression efficiencies ranged from 2.10- to 4.24-fold. The color in the leaves of BoaNXS-overexpressed plants changed from green to yellow-green; the content of total and individual carotenoids, such as neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and lutein, was significantly increased, and the expression levels of most carotenoid biosynthetic genes were notably increased. These findings indicated that BoaNXS is of vital importance in carotenoid biosynthesis in Chinese kale and could be used as a candidate gene for enriching the carotenoid accumulation and color of Chinese kale and other Brassica vegetables.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to the Actor Network Theory, the local food system is a set of interconnected processes and social agents including municipalities as a business environment. In the context of rural studies, support for local food producers is important for local communities. By content analysis of the information available on the websites of Zemgale region’s municipalities and the opinions of municipal specialists on local support measures for entrepreneurs, the aim of the paper was to identify the activities of municipalities in local food systems. Within a context of local food systems, the authors revealed that municipalities in Zemgale region provide support activities in two main directions: food businesses and tourism activities. The analysis of business support measures showed that local food producers in municipalities are promoted and supported in a number of ways through branding, special events and trade facilitation, seminars and annual awards. Activities in the field of tourism revealed cooperation, involving local food producers in the tourism system and ensuring the recognition of local food products to a wider group of consumers. Integrating local food businesses into tourism routes and thematic activities, in other words making locally produced food an integral part of the tourism product, develops small and medium-sized enterprises that contribute to the socio-economic resilience and environmental sustainability of rural communities, local innovations and creativity. In Zemgale, municipal activities for support of local food producers in the context of COVID-19 crisis are strengthening rural communities thus supporting and helping entrepreneurs to adapt to changes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural production is currently at a crossroads due to the need to balance the requirements of climate, biodiversity, air quality, and access to food health, farmers' incomes and economic conditions. These demands are often controversial, and the goals of policy makers are contradictory. Sustainability in agriculture needs to be put into practice. The concept of sustainable agriculture is based on agro-ecology and a system approach and aims to promote sustainable, resilient, cost-effective and stable farming systems. Based on the analysis of the scientific literature and the current situation, the paper authors have concluded that a logical path to sustainability is integrated agriculture. It is a whole farm management system that allows farmers to identify opportunities and threats and act accordingly, while also taking into account the interests of consumers in their business. The paper aims to outline the role of integrated agriculture in the development of sustainable agriculture based on the analysis of the relevant scientific literature and the current situation. Integrated management is the knowledge-based management of all available resources integrated farms are able to provide climate benefits, provide more diverse (especially pasture) land management, farm animals have a higher quality of life and survival.</jats:p>",

However, the involvement of the public itself in improving the immediate surroundings and in solving the problems of its fellows is not always sufficient. The research aims to determine whether there are differences in public involvement in addressing municipal problems across various population groups within a municipality. The paper presents the results of an extensive survey. The research considered problems within one municipality in Latvia – Jelgava municipality – and analysed the rural territories located in the immediate vicinity of the centre of the municipality as well as those being the furthest from the centre. The results of the research revealed that young people were most satisfied with their lives in their municipality if their places of residence were closer to the centre of the municipality. The ability to influence the decisions of one’s own local government was highly valued by residents in the age group from 26 to 44 years in the rural territories that were in the immediate vicinity of the centre the municipality, yet this possibility was most often rated as weak among the youth living in the most remote rural territories from the centre of the municipality. Population involvement in solving a problem relevant to the society was the most frequently used way when the population requested a municipal employee to solve this problem. A large segment of the society in rural areas admitted that they did nothing, and this passivity was also evident in the group of young people who lived further away from the centre of the municipality. The involvement of the population in national-level public activities across all age groups and territories was quite equal, as the active population were involved in Saeima elections, campaigns for collecting signatures and donating various thing</jats:p>",

Although several vaccines have received emergency use authorization, demand has created enormous logistical challenges—including supply, access, and distribution—that justify research for alternative strategies. Phage are viruses that only infect bacteria and can be safely administered to humans. Here, as a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that aerosol vaccination with lung-targeted phage particles displaying short SARS-CoV-2 S protein epitopes and subcutaneous vaccination with targeted AAVP particles carrying the entire S protein gene both elicit systemic and specific immune responses in immunocompetent mice. Given their unique attributes, including sturdiness, simple-to-engineer platform, cost-effectiveness for rapid large-scale production, and stability at room temperature, these phage-based approaches may become attractive tools for COVID-19 vaccine development.</jats:p>",
