A remote area is one which is undeveloped or lacks adequate port and dock facilities and local infrastructure to provide a shore base. It is generally more than 150 nautical miles (278 km) distance from suitable port facilities. In these circumstances there are basically three alternative supply systems available to the operator:operate from the far distant port;build his own shore base;use a wareship.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper will examine each of these alternatives in detail and compare the overall costs for each. Amoco Production Company has used up to two wareships to support remote area operations in various regions of the world since 1974. Amoco's experience with their use is discussed later in the paper. Wareships provide advantages other than lower cost which will paper.

Rapid developments in electronic publishing and optical disc technology are likely to change this, although cost will be a barrier for the immediate future. Telefacsimile transmission has become a quicker and more reliable means of document delivery. Optical discs can not only store information but can be indexed and searched, and would achieve rapid document delivery, with the production of hard copy for users. It is doubtful, however, whether most users want fast supply, and whether it is worth the extra cost. The concept of copyright may need reviewing in the light of electronic media. Payment will be required for every use, and libraries could be bypassed. Optical discs and associated equipment may themselves be shared among libraries. ILL departments as such may no longer be needed, because the operations will be absorbed in line functions such as reference, acquisitions and circulation, but ILL knowledge and skills will be needed more than ever.</jats:p>",

Improvements in bibliographic control in the last 10 years have led both to fuller coverage of documents and to better and faster access to references. Document access relies more and more on interlibrary access because the great growth in number and cost of publications is making libraries increasingly unable to provide their readers with all the publications they need. Alternative models of interlibrary provision, according to centralization or decentralization of collections form a useful framework for considering the best solutions for Brazil. In practice, models must always be mixed, and the most important element in planning is to find the optimum balance of centralization and decentralization appropriate to each country. In Brazil, the best solution would almost certainly be the creation of a core collection of scientific and technical journals (excluding medicine and agriculture), a decentralized system for monographs, except Brazilian monographs, and the creation of a single supply centre for report literature. No special provision would be made for conference proceedings, or foreign official publications. Dissertations would be made available by the relevant universities. Trade literature should be collected in major industrial centres for consultation purposes.</jats:p>",

The proportions of yolk and albunmen do not change with egg mass, and hatchling mass is proportional to egg mass. Hatching is asynchronous, and laterhatced chicks often starve or die from exposure. These breeding characteristics are proposed to be related to the exploitation of a food supply showing both long— and short—term unpredictability in abundance. The higher mass of the later chicks within a brood may allow them to survive long enough to exploit any sudden increases in food abundance at little parental cost. Experimental manipulation of food supply during the prelaying period shows that this systematic variation in mass within a clutch may be due to a facultative response in females; individuals fed upon an extremely constant daily food supply laid less variable clutches than females exposed to the natural food supply. The function and mechanism of this response are discussed.</jats:p>",

Formulations of these coatings were tested in the Ames mutagenesis and the mouse skin carcinogenesis bioassays. To test the mutagenicity of the paints, six doses ranging from 0.005 to 10 μl per plate were assayed. In the mouse skin bioassay, doses of the coal tar paints ranging from 0.2 to 200 μl were administered topically to 30 SENCAR mice per group. These initiating doses were followed by applications of 1.0 μg of 12‐o‐tetradecanoyl‐phorbol‐13‐acetate (TPA) in 0.2 ml acetone topically, three times weekly for 20 weeks. Petroleum asphalt paints were tested in groups of 40 animals at 200 and 600 μl doses. All coal tar paints showed mutagenic activity after metabolic activation with S‐9, with the highest response being in strains TA 98 and TA 100. None of the petroleum asphalt paints gave mutagenic responses. Both types of coatings resulted in positive responses in the initiation/promotion study. The coal tar paints gave rise to 1000–1800 times the tumor response observed with petroleum asphalt products. One coal tar product was positive when tested as a complete carcinogen in the mouse at 2 μl per application once weekly for 30 weeks, whereas the asphalt paint was negative at 100 times the dose. The biological responses to the products were greater than expected from their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. These findings suggest that the hazard posed by these coatings may not be fully explained by their PAH contents.</jats:p>",

The calculated rate of root uptake (mmol/g day) of the locally supplied nutrient was higher in the supplied root of the treatment than in those of the supplied control plant. The negative relationship between shoot nutrient conc.

The possible nature of the controlling signal is discussed. Increase in content of locally supplied nutrient in non-supplied roots indicates a net flux of nutrients from shoot to root. This flux concurs in non-supplied plants with decreasing shoot:root ratio and in treated plants with restored growth rate of the non-supplied roots. Total cation conc. (K + Na + Ca + Mg) was independent of treatment and type of tissue, but at K deficiency Na and Mg contributed more in the root and Mg more in the shoot.
