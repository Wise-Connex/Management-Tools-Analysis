Applications of micronutrients, as well as the macronutrients phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen and sulfur, have been essential for crop and pasture production on these soils. Duplex soils are characterised by heterogeneity in the distribution of mineral nutrients with depth. Additionally, there is heterogeneity both vertically and horizontally in suitability of soil conditions for root growth. There are at least 2 consequences of this heterogeneity for the mineral nutrition of plants on duplex soils. First, there are important effects of localised nutrient supply on root growth and nutrient uptake. Second, identification of nutrient deficiencies by soil and plant analysis is complicated by variation in nutrient supply through time and with depth. These 2 consequences are examined.</jats:p>"

People who chose a\nminerals career in the prosperous days of the late 1980's are now entering a labour market in recession.\nThe cyclical nature of enrollments is illustrated in a series of figures showing the trends since the CIM survey was begun in 1956 (and even earlier for mining engineering).\nIn the survey, the respondents were asked to provide comments on their perceptions of the problems specific to minerals education in Canada. The large number of responses have led the author to the conclusions and recommendations given in the final part of the paper.</jats:p>"

On the negative side, although the demand equation and the two reduced form equations satisfy nominal homogeneity restrictions, the supply equation does not. One possible explanation for this is that foreign suppliers do not believe that exchange rate shocks have the same permanence as price or wage shocks. Overall, however, the findings reported in this paper show that a classical simultaneous equations model can explain the behavior of non-oil import prices and quantities fairly successfully.</jats:p>"

Two principal types of fishing are practiced. In the traditional mostly subsistence type, small crews of one to three fishermen in dugout canoes use a variety of hook-and-line techniques to exploit a broad range of marine species and habitats. In the more recently evolved, capital-intensive, market-oriented type crews of ten to twelve in what are locally referred to as “Ghana boats,” with outboard motors, use commercially manufactured nylon ring nets to catch two main species. The two types of fishing are associated with different ethnic groups. Ghana boat fishing has brought with it larger households and dietary changes. The shift toward commodity production of fish parallels shifts toward commercial cashcropping in agriculture. In many agrarian societies this shift has been accompanied by long-term declining food security and deterioration of local diets. This has not been the case in the maritime economy of the Sherbro Coast.\n\t</jats:p>"

The effect of rotation, tillage and stubble management on the supply of soil nitrogen, and amounts leached were studied by in situ sequential soil sampling during the wheat phase of the rotation in years 10 and 11. Of the rotations, grazed subterranean clover-wheat accumulated higher mineral nitrogen levels during the wheat phase than a lupin-wheat rotation, which in turn produced higher levels than wheat-wheat. The mean seasonal total of net soil nitrogen mineralized (0-15 cm) was 239 kg N ha-1 for subterranean clover-wheat, 165 kg N ha-1 for lupin-wheat and 99.5 kg N ha-1 for wheat-wheat. In a lupin-wheat rotation, retention of stubble increased the net amount of nitrogen mineralized in both seasons. Direct drilling also increased net mineralization in 1990 but the results were inconsistent in 1989. Losses from the surface 15 cm were closely related to the amounts mineralized, with the highest recorded in subterranean clover-wheat rotations. Percent recovery of soil mineralized nitrogen by the above-ground wheat crop following lupin ranged from 57% to 83%, with both direct drilling and stubble retention reducing recovery. While total plant uptake of nitrogen in a wheat-wheat rotation was low, percent recovery was high (77%), compared with that in a subterranean clover-wheat rotation (60%).</jats:p>"

Consequently, in the power system, the harmonics become more increased for larger capacity of such a converter, thus it is important to improve their harmonic characteristics. Among such converters, the double three‐phase bridge converter with transformer of star and delta windings is well known. By application of such techniques, Miyairi and his group proposed a thyristor converter which has excellent harmonic characteristics. On the other hand, the multiple‐connected inverter circuit without output transformer had been already proposed. However, it contains the lower‐order harmonics.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper proposes a converter which can reduce the harmonics similarly to the forementioned double‐bridge converter. This circuit has the center‐tapped reactor that can control the dc current like the current control of Miyairi's interphase reactor. This novel converter need not use the input three‐phase transformers that usually make the cost higher. The proposed circuit has a commutation one with capacitor that is analogous to the series diode‐type thyristor inverter. This circuit maintains the commutation to operate successfully with constant reverse bias time. The entire circuit operation and the commutation circuit operation are discussed and confirmed experimentally and theoretically.</jats:p>",

Some typical examples of this treatment are as follows: “The original abstinence theory of interest for which Senior is famous has long been recognized as the most complete of the classical theories, and under various names has become incorporated in the general corpus of economic theory” (Bowley 1937, p. 137). “Nassau Senior…introduced the ‘abstinence theory’ of interest, and he is criticized both for its one-sidedness and for using it to imply that the ‘pain’ of the capitalist is in some sense proportional to the ‘reward’ he ‘earns’ by abstaining. On page 189 of<jats:italic>Political Economy</jats:italic>, Senior describes abstinence as the cause of interest in terms which would readily explain this general interpretation, and in his public-policy pronouncements he further supports it” (Conard 1959, p. 26). “Senior's contribution to capital theory was to identify this reward for ‘abstinence’ as interest, or the cost of waiting, during which time capital could be accumulated. Senior's description of interest as a return to abstinence was his most original contribution to economics, and it soon became assimilated into the mainstream of economic theory. In it he surpassed Smith, Malthus and Ricardo and his analysis of capital and interest stood as the most complete in British economics until the time of Jevons” (Ekelund and Hébert 1975, p. 103).</jats:p>"

The present paper aims to shed light on the conditions of onset and maintenance of prey-supply tendency. The experimental procedure consisted in confronting females, either sub-adult or at various stages of their reproductive life cycle, with a group of spiderlings constant in number and age, and in recording the behavioural interactions following the capture of a prey item. Females which did not yet have post-emergence offspring did not supply prey to the spiderlings and exhibited aggressive reactions towards them. In contrast, females which had had post-emergence offspring, even though their dispersal could have taken place many weeks before, provided prey to the experimental spiderlings, and behaved towards them as their real mothers would have done. When exposure to the experimental situation was prolonged for one week, the tendency to supply the young clearly appeared in previously unresponsive adult females (inseminated or incubating), but no change was observed in sub-adults. The results show that, in Coelotes terrestris, the maternal tendency to supply prey requires a particular internal state, which seems to develop at the time of the offspring's emergence but which does not become extinct after their dispersal. The results also suggest that the development of this internal state can somehow be influenced by stimuli from the young.</jats:p>\n\t\t\t\t</jats:sec>"

One third of the farm is in newer ryegrass/clover, the remaining mainly browntop. Grass grown and grazed is recorded, so paddock performance can be monitored. The major result is variation in growth, 1 l- 3 tonnes/DM. A grazing round of approximately 26 days suits all pastures for best performance. A balance is created between under- andovergrazing. Pasture is grazed to a base level of 1400 kg/ha/DM, to ensure quick regrowth but no loss of quality. Regrassing is the major emphasis -- approximately lo-20 hectares are done a season. Ryegrasses and clover are used at 23 kg/ha. Pasture is sprayed and direct drilled with care taken in grazing for first season. Fertiliser complements regrassing. Over the last two years 400 kg/ha 15% potassic super was applied, this season 600 kg/ha were applied. Nitrogen is used strategically from.late winter to autumn according to soil temperature over the whole farm. There are flow on effects through winter and early spring. Limiting factors to conversion are management, fertility and grasses. Planning is needed to utilise resources for best returns.

Nine nutritional treatments, providing three levels of protein (53, 99 and 145 g/day) to the intestines at three levels of energy (5.2, 7.5 and 9.7 MJ/day), were given to 12 Merino sheep during three consecutive periods of 3 weeks in a balanced lattice design. Abomasal nutrients consisted of varying proportions of casein, whole milk, glucose and glycerol. There was a large effect of protein supply on all components of wool growth, but there was no significant effect of energy. There was a significant interaction between the effects of protein and energy supply on diameter, length growth rate and volume of wool, but it was small relative to the main effect of protein. Extra energy appeared to enhance wool growth at the highest level of protein but reduce it at the lowest level of protein. The concentration of urea, cystine, methionine and other essential amino acids in plasma increased with protein level. Increasing energy supply reduced the concentration of urea and essential amino acids in plasma but not that of cystine or methionine. The experiment confirmed the major role of amino acid supply in controlling wool growth but indicated that there may be a small interaction with energy supply.</jats:p>"

Fractures of the tuberosity often heal well with nonoperative treatment, whereas fractures occurring in the proximal diaphysis (up to 1.5 cm distal to the tuberosity) have significantly increased risk for delayed union or nonunion. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the intraosseous vascular anatomy of the fifth metatarsal, and the clinical implications for basilar fracture healing. </jats:p><jats:p> Ten fresh-frozen amputation or cadaver specimens were studied following arterial injection with India ink or barium sulfate suspension. The intraosseous blood supply to the fifth metatarsal tuberosity arose from numerous metaphyseal vessels penetrating the nonarticular surfaces of the tuberosity in a random, radiate pattern. The blood supply to the proximal diaphysis was derived primarily from the nutrient artery, which gave rise to longitudinal intramedullary branches. The arterial supply to the tuberosity joined the supply of the proximal diaphysis in the area just distal to the tuberosity, corresponding to the region of poor prognosis for fracture healing. This suggests that a relative lack of blood supply following a proximal diaphyseal fracture may contribute to delayed union and nonunion. </jats:p>",

These effects depend strongly on the relative magnitude of each country output and supply elasticity, the smaller producer (Spain) being in a riskier position.

Nine anatomical specimens with collateral arteries were studied by blunt dissection to determine the arterial supply to each pulmonary segment. The precise supply varied from case to case but, overall, nearly two-thirds of the pulmonary segments were connected to the central pulmonary arteries. A quarter were supplied exclusively by systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries, with the remainder having a dual supply. Coexistence of ductal connections and systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries was seen in one case. Anastomoses between vessels of different origins were observed up to the segmental level in eight of the nine cases. In four cases, the anastomoses formed arterial rings. The extent of pulmonary parenchyma supplied by arteries from different sources and the presence of arterial anastomoses in these malformations have implications on the planning of surgical repair.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over successive five‐year development plans, Indonesia has channeled large sums of foreign loans and domestic funds into water supply projects with the aim of providing clean water for a majority of households. Most projects have been planned and financed through the central government's public works ministry, though a growing share of rural water projects are being funded through earmarked grants provided to local governments. This paper examines how these central government transfers, in the aggregate, have responded to various indicators of expenditure needs. Overall, past allocations have matched existing demand and supply levels closely–funding has generally favored provinces with large populations, large numbers of water enterprises, extensive distribution networks in place, and high production capacity. They have not, however, worked in favor of either equalization or economic productivity objectives, as reflected by per capita income or GRDP growth rates. This analysis suggests that equity would be promoted either by including income‐related factors in future block grant allocation formulas or by shifting funding emphasis in the water supply sector from grants‐in‐kind controlled by the central government to sectoral grants controlled mainly at the local level. Such policy reforms would also further promote the nation's professed goal of decentralizing infrastructure development.</jats:p>",

The study included both macroscopic observation of the lobular vascular irrigation and the histological assessment of the periacinar capillary network. The topographical distribution of the main prostate branches was found to be different among the rat prostate lobes. The ventral lobe seems to be better irrigated than the dorsal one. The former being supplied by two parallel vascular systems, one irrigating the median two‐thirds of the ventral lobe, whereas the remaining external one‐third was found to be conjointly irrigated from the pericapsular branches of the fat pads. The blood vessels of the dorsal and lateral lobes emerged radially from a periurethral circle, with the dorsal branches ending blindly in the connective tissue of the pelvic cavity, whereas the lateral prostate was also conjointly irrigated by a dual vascularization from the pericapsular fat pad and the periurethral circle branch. The histological study revealed quantitative differences between the periacinar capillaries of both ventral and dorsal lobes. The capillary density was found to be age dependent and directly proportional to the acinar size. Small acini were less well irrigated by capillaries than were the larger ones.</jats:p><jats:p>The number of capillaries per acinar area increased progressively toward the maturation (day 90); thereafter, their number remained constant.

Increased potassium supply increased juice pH significantly in only 1 variety, but malate and potassium concentrations in 2. Magnesium was the only fertiliser whose application led, at least in 1 variety, to a significant reduction of grape juice pH.

The objective of this study was to compare the growth and ion relations of the commercial cultivar Harrington with foxtail barley under saline conditions, to determine whether a differential response to salinity stress exists between these species. Seedling performance was evaluated as a function of increasing concentrations of Na<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, MgSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, and CaCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (within the electrolyte conductivity range of 0.26 to 1.38 S m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and the Ca mole fraction (Ca<jats:sub>mf</jats:sub>) of salt treatments in solution culture experiments. The Ca<jats:sub>mf</jats:sub> of the salt treatments, defined as the molar ratio of Ca/(Ca + Na + Mg), was maintained at 0.02 or 0.09. Salt treatments at a Ca<jats:sub>mf</jats:sub>r of 0.02 significantly reduced leaf area, shoot growth, root growth, and the root‐to‐shoot ratio (R/S) of Harrington seedlings relative to foxtail barley. Growth of Harrington seedlings improved substantially when the Ca<jats:sub>mf</jats:sub> was increased from 0.02 to 0.09. The two genotypes differed significantly in root weight and R/S under saline conditions; these differences were independent of the Ca<jats:sub>mf</jats:sub>. Evaluation of root and shoot tissue ion contents revealed that <jats:italic>H. jubatum</jats:italic> seedlings accumulated less Na from the medium than Harrington and preferentially compartmentalized Na in root rather than shoot tissue. The wild species maintained higher levels of Ca, had more favorable K/Na ratios, and maintained higher R/S levels of SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> than Harrington. Differences between <jats:italic>H. jubatum</jats:italic> and Harrington in root and shoot ion accumulation suggest that membrane permeability and selectivity properties are controlled by both genotype and Ca supply.</jats:p>",

Nine chronically catheterized pregnant ewes were monitored before, during and after 1 week in which fetal urine was drained continuously, to determine whether they could compensate for the resulting loss of salt and water and increase net supply across the placenta to the fetus. 2. Fetal growth and urine and lung liquid production were not affected by loss of all fetal fluids. 3. When fetal urine was drained, the increase (P less than 0.05) in maternal drinking was greater than the extra amount of fluid lost. Thus, maternal plasma osmolality fell (P less than 0.01). When fetal urine again flowed into the amniotic and allantoic cavities, maternal drinking did not fall significantly and plasma osmolality remained low. Maternal urine flow rate increased (P less than 0.05) and its osmolality fell (P less than 0.02). 4. Maternal food intake increased (P less than 0.005) during fetal urine drainage. 5. Maternal plasma renin activity increased (P less than 0.05), her urinary sodium excretion fell (P less than 0.005) and the Na(+)‐K+ ratio in both her urine and faeces decreased (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05 respectively) when fetal urine was drained. Maternal urinary and faecal sodium conservation continued after drainage ceased because of continued loss of sodium in lung liquid. 6. It is concluded that the ewe can compensate for inappropriate loss of salt and water from the conceptus.</jats:p>",

For 3‐year‐old ‘Golden Delicious’ trees, cropping significantly increased total biomass, although leaf and root biomass were reduced. For 3‐year‐old‘Golden Delicious', ‘Coxs Orange’ and ‘Gloster’ trees, cropping only in the third year reduced root biomass by 39 to 45%. Cropping did not affect water use by trees of any cultivar early in the season, but increased water use later in the season for ‘Gloster’ trees. For trees with fruit, total non‐structural carbohydrate (TNC) contents at the end of the season were highest in fruit (up to 1 400 g plant<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). For trees without fruit, TNC contents were generally highest in the roots (up to 110 g planr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Supplying trees with nutrient solution diluted to 10% of the standard composition increased the root biomass for ‘Golden Delicious’ trees only, but decreased biomass of above‐ground tissues for all cultivars. Reducing the nutrient supply decreased water and nutrient uptake, and reduced nutrient contents within vegetative parts of the tree more than within roots. For ‘Golden Delicious’ trees, restricting the water supply to 50% or 25% of that consumed by control trees significantly reduced above‐ground biomass, but root biomass was not significantly affected. The N, P and K. contents for the trees were also reduced by water stress, due to reduced contents within above‐ground organs. Water stress reduced the TNC and starch contents of all tissues, except the roots. These results are discussed in relation to the efficiency of root systems for water and nutrient uptake.</jats:p>",

It was found that there was no difference between the two methods in the values for the capillary-to-fibre ratio. Values for mean fibre area, on the other hand, were significantly higher in the histochemically treated samples (16%, p = 0.001) and hence capillary density values lower (12%, p = 0.002). It was concluded that the two methods are comparable in their capacity to visualize capillaries, but preparation of samples for electron microscopy produces an average shrinkage of 16% of muscle fibres. As a consequence capillary density is overestimated accordingly. Discrepancies were larger for steer than horse muscles.</jats:p>"

Using three widespread savanna species (Themeda triandra, Heteropogon contortus and Panicum maximum), this hypothesis was tested experimentally and the mechanisms controlling this response examined and quantified. In T. triandra drought during the dry season led to major mortality in defoliated plants in the next growing season. This mortality was caused by a synchrony of tillering at the commencement of the wet season, leaving few buds for replacement once parent tillers were killed by defoliation. T. triandra was also the most sensitive species to defoliation. This sensitivity was due to the poor ability of the plant to maintain positive carbon gain after defoliation. Several factors contributed to this poor ability, including: low total photosynthetic rate, low specific leaf area, and a large proportion of sheath material with poor photosynthetic capacity remaining after cutting. Both H. contortus and P. maximum growing under irrigated and fertilized conditions did not display any effects of previous moisture treatments when defoliated during the next wet season and were much less sensitive to defoliation than T. triandra.</jats:p>"

LN from all of the three groups of nodes studied (tracheobronchial, paratracheal and popliteal) showed an extensive network of arterial vessels encircling the capsule of the organ. We found that branches of these capsular arteries penetrated deeply into the cortical domain of LN. The capsule-originating vessels appeared to have a significant participation in the blood supply of the LN parenchyma at the cortical domains of the organs. Our findings are in contrast with current views on the angiology of the LN that consider that virtually all of the arterial capillaries of the LN parenchyma come from hilar arteries. We propose, therefore, that important segments of the LN cortex receive their blood supply from capsular arteries rather than from hilar vessels.</jats:p>"

The sesamoid arteries branch off from the digital plantar arteries of the hallux, which, in turn, are derived from the medial plantar artery and the plantar arch (type A), the plantar arch (type B), or the medial plantar artery (type C). The respective frequencies of types A, B, and C were 52%, 24%, and 24%. The number of sesamoid arteries varied from one (55%) to three (10%) and the number increased with the size of the sesamoid bones. Anatomical knowledge of the course and distribution of these vessels may be of great help to the orthopedist in the understanding of the pathogenesis of avascular necrosis and may provide insight into several technical aspects regarding surgery of the hallux. </jats:p>",

Under appropriate conditions, it usually results in higher overall productivity as compared with pure stands. Appraisal of agronomic practices is of particular importance, since component crops sometimes differ considerably in their structure and fertilization needs. An experiment was conducted under the subtropical conditions of Southern Nepal, in the Terai belt, in 1988 and 1989. Maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) received 0, 35 or 70 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when grown either in pure stands or when intercropped in two spatial arrangements differing in spatial intimacy. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in similar grain yield increases for maize either in pure stands or in intercropping with soybean, indicating that the availability of nitrogen for the cereal was comparable in both cropping systems. Soybean yields were 22% lower in the presence of maize, as compared with a pure stand. The overall productivity of intercropping, as assessed by ATER (area-time equivalent ratio), was significantly higher than that of pure stands in 1988 and 1989. Land-use efficiency was higher when maize was intercropped with nodulating soybean, as compared to non-nodulating soybean, but only at 0 and 35 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.Key words: ATER, land-use efficiency, non-nodulating soybean isoline, nitrogen fertilization, spatial arrangement, interactions </jats:p>",
