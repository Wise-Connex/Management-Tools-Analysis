      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The South African automotive industry includes complete supply chains. The South African automotive supply chain stakeholders operating within the global arena are faced with opportunities as well as challenges. The South African government supports the automotive industry and encourages the vision to drastically expand the industry by the year 2020. However, having to adhere to strict prescriptions from customers regarding product quality and logistics, automotive component suppliers have only the actual relationship with customers through which value can be added. Literature acknowledges the importance of relationship value and agrees that it results in business retention. However, literature fails to prove whether relationship value can result in business expansion where more business is generated.Objectives: The objective of this article was to provide a better understanding of how to optimise relationship value within the South African automotive supply chains between Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Furthermore, the correlation between relationship value and business expansion was tested through a linear regression model. It was also important to determine whether supply chain stakeholders from different countries of origin and cultural backgrounds attach the same importance to relationship value.Method: This article reports on research which followed a positivistic paradigm, through a quantitative study undertaken in the South African automotive supply chains. Members of the National Association for Automobile Component and Allied Manufacturers of South Africa (NAACAM), defined as Tier 1 suppliers, were approached to describe their best Tier 2 suppliers. Questions relating to relationship value and business expansion were asked via a closed-ended questionnaire. The aim was to obtain the perceptions of Tier 1 suppliers of their best Tier 2 suppliers in terms of relationship value and business expansion. The data were analysed through a linear regression model.Results: It was found that relationship value directly correlates with business expansion and is therefore highly regarded as important by Tier 1 suppliers in terms of their Tier 2 suppliers in the South African automotive supply chains. Notwithstanding the different countries of origin, respondents are in agreement regarding the importance of relationship value.Conclusion: As the South African automotive industry plays an important role in the South African economy, all efforts should be made to retain and expand the industry. The industry is characterised by a difficult economy, and supply chain role players should constantly investigate new strategies to gain a competitive advantage. It was found that there was a high regard for relationship value which could result in business expansion. Automotive component suppliers are encouraged to invest in a relationship value governance strategy to actively pursue added benefits for all stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: South Africa has a high rate of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) failure, especially in the manufacturing sector. The operational challenges confronting manufacturing SMEs are acknowledged by the Global Competitiveness Index that ranked South African SMEs as one of the lowest in emerging economies.Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the association between green supply chain management (GSCM) practices, environmental collaboration and financial performance in SMEs.Method: The study is quantitative in nature and involves a convenient sample of 312 SMEs based in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Data analyses follow a two-step process involving a confirmatory factor analysis to test the psychometric properties of the measurement scale and Structural Equation Modelling to test the proposed hypotheses.Results: The study shows that three GSCM practices, namely, green procurement, green logistics and green manufacturing in SMEs exert a positive effect on environmental collaboration, with green manufacturing exerting a higher effect than the other two constructs. In turn, higher levels of environmental collaboration inspired higher levels of SME financial performance.Conclusion: The study advances that SMEs can succeed financially through the influence of enhanced environmental collaboration, which emanates, in part, from the adoption and implementation of GSCM practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Freight transport infrastructure is an indispensable requirement for economic growth, development and prosperity. Public–private partnerships (PPPs), as a mechanism to fund and construct freight transport infrastructure, have been suggested by many in private and public sectors.Objectives: The concept of PPPs is dealt with, and the relevance of this mechanism is expanded upon. It is clear that PPPs in the rail environment present huge challenges and complexities. The objective was to determine whether PPPs are a viable mechanism to fund freight transport infrastructure in South Africa.Method: Experiences with rail PPPs worldwide have shown that many failures occurred implementing these. The challenges and complexities of PPPs, in the freight rail environment, are highlighted together with the benefits, risks and best practices of PPPs. It is shown that suitable policies, legislation and regulations concerning PPPs are in place in South Africa.Results: A proper framework and methodology to proceed should be in place. PPPs take time and are complex. Government involvement remains essential. Firm contractual agreements between parties are essential. Risk handling, risk sharing and the magnitude of risks should be clarified with agreement on where the risks reside. Financial viability, with value for money (VfM) and financial benefits for private sector role players are non-negotiable.Conclusion: Appropriate legislation for implementing PPPs must be in place while two further important elements are economic circumstances and proper project execution. Taking all these factors into consideration, the freight transport sector can only benefit from successfully negotiated and implemented PPPs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper deals with climate change mitigation and addresses waste heat reuse as a measure which is until now considered only to a limited extent. The City of Vienna serves as a case study to explore potentials to improve the urban heat supply using waste heat as an additional energy source. As no observation data about waste heat and detailed heating demand is available, this data is derived from proxy data for estimating waste heat reuse potential and residential heating demand patterns. Heat requirements for manufacturing and service provision is explored and, based on the distribution of the companies within the city, mapped as waste heat sources. Employees per company serves as proxy data to allocate the heat volume. Waste heat share and temperature ranges is reviewed from literature. Heating demand is mapped based on floor space of the buildings by age class and building type. Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential heating demand coverage through local waste heat in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by waste heat supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide waste heat. In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna’s outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential heating demand near the sources can be covered by waste heat within a 250 m distance. Within a 500 m distance, around half of the residential heating demand can be covered only in low density housing areas near the waste heat sources.</jats:p>"

Problems in the Zimbabwean public procurement sector that detract from service delivery are key contemporary issues. This is evident from the numerous complaints of poor service delivery received by the public that can be attributed to public procurement.Objective: The purpose of this article was to report on a study that investigated problems in the different stages of the operational procurement process in the Zimbabwean public sector that detract from service delivery, the extent of these problems and how the public procurement process can be improved to enhance service delivery.Method: This descriptive and exploratory study followed a quantitative approach. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire administered to all public entities in Zimbabwe. Data were analysed using SPSS. Results: The majority of the identified problems in the public procurement sector that detract from service delivery are found in the advertising, bid evaluation and contract stages.Conclusion: As only a few studies on this topic have been conducted in Zimbabwe, the findings of this research add a significant perspective to the existing body of knowledge and can assist stakeholders with regard to how the public procurement process can be improved in order to enhance service delivery through public procurement process reform and restructuring.</jats:p>"

Strategic orientation is an important factor affecting its implementation. No reliable and valid strategic orientation construct has been developed for greening a supply chain. This study proposes closed-loop orientation (CLO) as the appropriate strategic orientation to implement GSCM practices successfully and develops a valid measurement of CLO. Data collected from 296 Chinese manufacturers were analyzed using the structural equation modeling method to examine the relationships among CLO, GSCM practice and environmental and economic performance. The results show that both CLO and GSCM have positive effects on the environmental performance and economic performance and that CLO positively impacts the level of implementation of GSCM. The results also show that GSCM completely mediates the relationships between CLO and environmental and economic performance.</jats:p>"

In this article, a model is proposed to address the long-term planning problem of the shale gas supply chain under uncertain conditions. A two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to describe and optimize the shale gas supply chain network. Inherent uncertainty in final products’ prices, such as natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL), is treated through the utilization of a scenario-based method. A binomial option pricing model is utilized to approximate the stochastic process through the generation of scenario trees. The aim of the proposed model is to generate an appropriate and realistic supply chain network configuration as well as scheduling of different operations throughout the planning horizon of a shale gas development project.</jats:p>"

The WSP Index model was developed using a nine-step process and was tested in 25 WSPs to determine the robustness of its weights and benchmark. Approximately 21 WSPs received a passing mark when the 60% benchmark was used but only nine WSPs passed when the benchmark was raised to 74%. This Philippine model may be utilized by countries in evaluating the WSPs, and further adapted to their local context and considerations.</jats:p>",

By using total sampling procedure, 137 firms were selected as a sample and questionnaires were sent to finance,production or marketing manager through corporate secretary. From 137 set questionnaires were sent, 64 sets were returned and due to missing data/incomplete answer so only 59 sets were analyzed. Data was analyzed by using SPSS program version 20.0. This study found that supply chain management positively effect firm performance. The findings showed that supply chain management positively effect the firm’s competitive advantage. Further, analyzed found that competitive advantage positively effect firm performance. Meanwhile, the results proved that ß value of relationship between the supply chain management and firm performance after entered by competitive advantage was decreased from 0.825 to 0,412. This research conclude that competitive advantage has a role as partial mediation variable.</jats:p>"

Released to the atmosphere or disposed to sewage, ENPs quickly penetrate to surface and ground water sources. An absence of a dedicated ENP-retaining water treatment strategy imposes a potential health threat on drinking water consumers. The threat is met by gearing up an upgrade of treatment systems towards membrane filtration that provides a better barrier to ENP penetration at higher energy costs. The current study compares the energy demand of granular and membrane filtrations, with the retention efficiency of inorganic and organic ENPs. Dedicated experiments with gold and silver nanoparticles, dyed viruses, proteins, polysaccharides, and plasmid DNA showed that the energy demand increases from slow to river bank to rapid sand filtration, and to membrane ultrafiltration (UF). The UF alone consumes on average two times more energy than the entire coagulation–flocculation–sedimentation–sand filtration tray. The differences in retention efficiency however are much less pronounced. The traditional retention tray requires 0.4–0.45 kWh per m3 of effluent (kWh/m3) to provide between 90% and 99% (1 and 2 logs) ENP retention; 1 kWh/m3 on average is needed to secure the retention of 99.9% (3 log) ENPs by UF.</jats:p>",

The berries market in Europe represents a good example of a consumer driven supply chain, due to the capacity to answer all the sequences of the system. To explore the process developed by fruit growers’ associated groups in Italy, the research is organized into four stages. The first stage provides a review of the organization of the fresh fruit supply chain (FFSC) and the need to innovate it in light of the driven demand. The second section focuses on the innovation displayed towards storing, managing and maintaining the quality of fruit during the supply. The third section considers the case study. The manuscript concludes by summarising the main results and discussing the implications for future research. The use of a modified active packaging system (MAP) with “green” films has enabled the maintenance of the quality of the fruits for two months, as well as the presence of the company blueberries market for longer periods, and has finally led to improving the exports, thus reaching new European countries, increasing the turnover of the associated group and better remuneration for the fruit growers as a consequence.</jats:p>"

According to the exogenous view, central banks have the full control over money supply via policy actions including the adjustments of interest rates and reserve ratios, both of which alter commercial banks’ lending decisions. However, the theory of endogenous money supply emphasizes the role of demand for bank loans in money creation. More specifically, banks create money by meeting the demand of economic agents. In this study, we investigate which of the money supply theories holds in Turkish economy for the period 2006-2015 by employing cointegration and causality tests. Our findings show that the causality runs from bank loans to money supply both in the short and long terms, which supports the endogenous view in a sense that central bank and the banks fully meet the total demand for money in Turkish economy.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The wide-spectrum of structural diversity of the terpenoids were largely due to the variable skeletons generated by terpene synthases. The number of terpene skeletons found in nature, however, were so much more than those conceivably generated from known terpene synthases and the limited characterized terpene synthases also make no chance for some useful terpenoids overproduction in microbe. Here, we first demonstrated that the promiscuous synthases<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>can produce more variable terpenoid products by converting precursors of different lengths (C<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>, C<jats:sub>15</jats:sub>, C<jats:sub>20</jats:sub>, C<jats:sub>25</jats:sub>). This discovery was prompted by the development of an efficient<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>platform by combining the two promiscuous terpene synthases and three prenyltransferases to generate 50 terpenoids, at least 3 ring systems of which were completely new. Furthermore, protein engineering was further integrated to enhance product diversity. Clearly, the work is expected to dramatically reshape the terpenoid research by widening the flexibility of the terpene synthases for the fresh discovery or creation of the new terpenoid compounds by skeleton reframing.</jats:p>"

In this regard, supply chain resilience (SCR) has received attention recently to cope with disruptions and improve competitiveness. This paper presents a novel methodology to measure resilience between different configurations of a supply chain network (SCN), based on a number of influential factors. For this reason, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed to identify the best-practice and less-performing SCN configurations among a group of alternatives. On this basis, the extent to which a current configuration can improve its resiliency is also measured. The methodology is applied to the case of E1, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company in Korea. Topological and operational measures were used as variables to assess resilience. The results suggest that the LPG supply chain in the case study requires an addition in the number and capacity of supply nodes in its network.</jats:p>"

As economies grow there is an increasing demand for water. The application of water to agricultural lands for irrigation is one of the essential uses of this natural resource in many areas. There is competition among agriculture, industry, and human consumption for the limited supplies of water. Efficiency studies are necessary, especially in areas where there is a shortage of factors of production such as water. Panel data for viticulture products, citrus products and olive oil for the time period 2002–2012, in the area of Iraklio, Crete, were used for the estimation of production models. The results indicate that the production process for the three crops cannot be represented by a single production function having a single set of coefficients. Different methods yield different efficiency measures. The stochastic frontier yields higher efficiency measures. Farmers are less efficient in the use of irrigation water than in the use of water and fertilizer together. The value of water is found to be equal to 0.73 euros/m3.</jats:p>",

The model is extended to a setting in which producers are taxed on the benefits accruing to them from a transmission line expansion (a beneficiaries-pay transmission charge). In this setting, we show how this tax may lead to lower prices in equilibrium. </jats:p>",

Polystyrene sulfonate sodium salt polymers were used as standards. Colloidal material was characterised in surface water, road runoff from a residential area and the effluent from a recirculating aquaculture system. All samples contained organic or inorganic colloids associated with organic carbon to various degrees and with various sizes. The OCD clearly added another layer of information, allowing for detection of organic colloids independent of their ability to scatter light or absorb UV-light.

Therefore, this research elaborates sustainable supply chain performance assessment and also the improvement framework applied in Batik industry with MTO-MTS typology. For fulfilling the provisions of sustainability, the economic, environmental, and social is strictly important to be involved in. Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) is a reference model of assessment considering five attributes to be measured and implemented as the perspective of economic assessment. Employee’s welfare and liquid waste assessment are then becoming the method to measure the social and environmental aspect. This resulted score as: Reliability is 89.24%, Responsiveness for MTS is 96% for MTO is 62%, Cost is 83.32%, Agility is 100%, and the Assets Management is 79.63%. For the social aspect, the score of parameter Health Insurance is 100%, Safety Tools is 100%, Basic Allowance is 70%, Annual Allowance is 100%, Appropriate Work Hours is 67%, and the Reward is 70%. For the environmental aspect, the temperature is 100%, pH 62.0%, BOD 100%, COD 64.7%, and TSS 7.4%.

By determining the appropriate parameters for the incentives with scenario analysis, balanced profit distribution between buyers and a supplier in VMI is established. Simulation outputs of the traditional model, VMI only and VMI with incentives models are compared based on profits with paired comparisons. In VMI with incentives, both buyers, and the supplier experience higher benefits than the traditional system. This study provides a new method which eliminates the unbalanced benefit distribution due to VMI and offers almost equal benefits to the participating firms.

Primary data was collected via self-administered questionnaires with both open ended and closed questions that were designed to elicit specific responses for qualitative and quantitative analysis respectively. The data was analyzed by use of descriptive statistics.Results: The results indicated that the important reasons of outsourcing were satisfactory in explaining the decision by manufacturing companies to outsource. The reasons of outsourcing are a key determinant in deciding to outsource import logistics. The extent of challenges the importers face when importing services also determined the decision to outsource in the firms.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the manufacturing firms should put more focus on core business functions and ensure reduction of overhead costs. They should take advantage of external expertise and experience and put measures to improve internal capabilities and expertise. The firms should reduce the total overall costs and where third party logistics providers provide a better service contract them. They should also emphasize on improved customer focus put measures to enable them compete effectively in the market.</jats:p>"

In order to gain a larger market share, the retailers often take the sales as a decision-making variable in the competition game. We devote ourselves to analyze the bullwhip effect in the supply chain with sales game and consumer returns via the theory of entropy and complexity and take the delayed feedback control method to control the system’s chaotic state. The impact of a statutory 7-day no reason for return policy for online retailers is also investigated. The bounded rational expectation is adopt to forecast the future demand in the sales game system with weak noise. Our results show that high return rates will hurt the profits of both the retailers and the adjustment speed of the bounded rational sales expectation has an important impact on the bullwhip effect. There is a stable area for retailers where the bullwhip effect doesn’t appear. The supply chain system suffers a great bullwhip effect in the quasi-periodic state and the quasi-chaotic state. The purpose of chaos control on the sales game can be achieved and the bullwhip effect would be effectively mitigated by using the delayed feedback control method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. The study analyzed the possibility and conditions for the effective operation of heating systems during the transition of the heat-generating capacity to biofuels energy. The straw of cereal crops, which are prevailing in Dnipro region, is used for this. The main purpose is scientific calculation of opportunities and cost of specific measures for such a transition. As an example it was taken the boiler-room of campus at Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Academician V. Lazaryan (DNURT) that consumes natural gas. Methodology. The work analyses the legislative base of Ukraine, which promotes the using of renewable energy sources as fuel, as well as the incentive mechanisms for the development of this trend. The paper identifies opportunities of   Prydniprovsk region to ensure straw supply for the boiler-room. Cost parameters of cargo transportation on the territory of Ukraine in 2016, which depend on the distance and the size of the trucks, are analysed. These indicators, as well as indicators related to its purchase, are considered together with energy potential of using the straw as fuel. Findings. With existing in Ukraine (as of 2016) the grain yielding capacity in the agriculture and cost indicators in the field of transportations, the transition of capacity share to biofuel is sufficiently profitable. The thermal power unit cost can be reduced fourfold. Originality. For the first time it is proposed to use the new integrated approaches to assess the cost of thermal power unit boiler with its transition to the use of renewable energy sources. The authors also proposed a new logistics delivery of these sources to the place of their application. From a technical and cost points of view it was determined the optimal order of capacity transfer for new renewable sources of energy in a given region depending on the structure of areas under crops and their productivity. Originality. The introduction of the proposed solutions and approaches to capacity boiler renewable energy sources can be realized with a relatively small investment and can provide significant economic benefits.</jats:p>"

This deficiency cannot be remedied with the productivity status quo in the construction industry. One opportunity to significantly increase the productivity of the construction industry is the industrial modular construction. In order to achieve increased productivity, the value chain must act across the entire organization. A supply chain management is required to exploit the potential of the prefabricated construction. In order to develop a specific supply chain management, the corresponding complexity factors along the value chain must be known. The aim of the study is to quantify the essential factors which influence the value chain for prefabricated houses and form a basis for the future development of a supply chain management. The results of this scientific work clearly show that although an industrial modular production is carried out, the highest complexity drivers are still found on the construction site as well as in the logistics from the module production to the construction site. In addition, it is also apparent that special requirements as well as the size of the modules are decisive factors and as such need to be considered during the future development of the supply chain management concept.</jats:p>"

The total population of the companies in the manufacturing industry in Nairobi was 455 manufacturing firms. Primary data was collected via self-administered questionnaires with both open ended and closed questions that were designed to elicit specific responses for qualitative and quantitative analysis respectively. The data was analyzed by use of descriptive statistics.Results: The results indicated that the important reasons of outsourcing were satisfactory in explaining the decision by manufacturing companies to outsource. The reasons of outsourcing are a key determinant in deciding to outsource import logistics. The extent of challenges the importers face when importing services also determined the decision to outsource in the firms.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the manufacturing firms should put more focus on core business functions and ensure reduction of overhead costs. They should take advantage of external expertise and experience and put measures to improve internal capabilities and expertise. The firms should reduce the total overall costs and where third party logistics providers provide a better service contract them. They should also emphasize on improved customer focus put measures to enable them compete effectively in the market.</jats:p>"

The reasons are related to disconnected approaches and a lack of focus on the subject as a main search aim. Hence, there is a need for a retrospective synthesis on what could be figured out from the different studies on the question in order to suggest a new search perspective. An overview of the sources shows an ascending development through reporting, critical and interpretative approaches. The comparative study figures out some synthetic aspects which feebly suggest a local invention process even with some preliminary arguments. The origin of the foggara often seems of secondary interest. The origin is checked, at least, through apparent foggara characteristics so that the studies seem less systematic. Additionally, an interest in the intangible aspects and comparative studies is missing. The study concludes that there is a need to conduct multidisciplinary fieldwork investigation in the regions surrounding the Tademaït plateau. This has to be conducted on the most ancient foggaras, checking systematically the characteristics of both tangible and intangible aspects. An additional comparative study should eventually check the similarities with the recent findings in the ancient Garamantian Fezzan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The restoration of watershed health can be influenced by ecological, technical and socio-economic factors. The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems. Biophysical and statistical models are being used to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices. A probabilistic fuzzy hybrid model to assess river water quality is proposed. The method and process of ecological risk assessment are provided based on adaptive management principles.

This study focused on a nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater site located in Jilin City, China. The actual nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater was taken from Jilin City to simulate in-situ groundwater bioremediation in the laboratory. The feasibility of in-situ bioremediation for nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater was studied according to actual site conditions and characteristics of nitrobenzene-degrading microorganisms in groundwater. The results showed that nitrobenzene-degrading bacterium strain NB1 was the dominant species that could effectively and rapidly degrade nitrobenzene by a partial reductive pathway. No negative factors on the growth or degrading function of this strain in groundwater could be detected. During a laboratory simulation experiment, combined in-situ bioremediation technologies, namely air sparging and bioaugmentation, could readily remove approximately 89.56% of nitrobenzene from groundwater without adding nutrients; oxygen was found to be the important growth factor for strain NB1. As the substrate of nitroreductase, encoded by the nitrobenzene nitroreductase (nbzA) gene, nitrobenzene was likely to significantly affect the expression of this gene. In conclusion, in-situ bioremediation is a feasible way to solve the problem of nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater in Jilin City as long as sufficient oxygen and biomass of strain NB1 is ensured.</jats:p>",

The impact of BIEX pre-treatment on fouling in subsequent ultrafiltration was also investigated. Biological operation enhanced NOM removal by approximately 50% due to an additional degradation of smaller humic substances, building blocks and low molecular weight acids. Promotion of biological activity significantly increased the time to breakthrough of the filters and, therefore, is expected to lower the regeneration frequency as well as the amount of regenerate of which to dispose. Pre-treatment using BIEX filters resulted in a significant decrease in total and irreversible fouling during subsequent ultrafiltration. The decrease was attributed to the effective removal of medium and low molecular weight NOM fractions. The results indicate that BIEX filtration is a robust, affordable and easy-to-operate pre-treatment approach to minimize fouling in ultrafiltration systems and enhance the quality of the produced permeate.</jats:p>",

Ia bukan hanya digunakan untuk menjamin ketersediaan produk, tapi juga untuk kepentingan lainnya seperti sebagai media pembangun merek. Semakin strategisnya peran saluran membuat banyak perusahaan semakin serius menangani saluran distribusinya. Perusahaan - perusahaan bahkan berupaya agar saluran distribusinya menjadi kunci keunggulan bersaing.Salah satu produsen minuman ringan di Indonesia menyediakan produk-produknya dimanapun agar mudah dijangkau. Artinya produsen minuman ringan ini harus mendistribusikan produknya secara merata hingga ke tingkat pengecer paling bawah. Hal ini menuntut tingkat pengelolaan yang strategis pada sistem distribusinya. Untuk itu perlu dilakukan perancangan jaringan distribusi.Tujuan utama dari perancangan jaringan distribusi adalah untuk mengetahui prioritas wilayah distribusi dan prioritas outlet yang harus dilakukan agar perusahaan dapat menggali potensi suatu wilayah secara maksimal.

Initial Teacher Education (ITE) in Australia is no exception to this, and this article explores this growth with a particular focus on its implications for workforce planning for teachers. In this planning in Australia, ITE students are usually considered part of the ‘supply pipeline’ for the state in which their university is located. However, with online delivery, students could potentially be enrolled on the other side of the country (or the world) from the physical location of their institution. The data presented here show that of the growing cohort of external ITE graduates, a small but significant group resides outside of the state in which their institution of enrolment is located. This exploration of data highlights some new evidence which has consequences for teacher supply planning and offers insight to inform future teacher workforce projections. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This exploratory study analyzes the careers of 307 supply chain executives (SCEs). Motivated by career theory, our findings create new knowledge about the educational backgrounds and career paths that lead to SCE positions. Based on an optimal matching analysis, we are able to distinguish among six career patterns for SCEs. They differ in terms of the individuals’ previous professional experience, educational background, and the time they needed to arrive in an executive position. By characterizing the backgrounds and career paths of SCEs, we show that supply chain management (SCM) is truly a cross‐functional profession. Our findings suggest that previous staff responsibility appears to be a more important hiring criterion than extensive SCM experience. While 56% of the executives had prior staff responsibility, only 12% of the cumulated careers were actually spent inside the SCM function.</jats:p>",

Many of these events are related to the supply chain because food production is now a global process of commoditized goods, made by large corporations that purchase inputs from producers in many countries. Given the linkage between supply chain and food safety issues, we investigated how studies in the supply chain management area have examined food safety issues, exploring some of their important characteristics. To do so, we conducted a systematic literature review of 46 papers, published in 23 journals, indexed in the Web of Science database. As a result, we pointed out some main characteristics of these papers, including journal attributes, authorship data, citation network, methodological characteristics, and theoretical approaches. Results serve as a reference to scholars and allow us to discuss some potential opportunities for future research in the field of food safety in the supply chain management area.</jats:p>",

I find that public sector workers, one of the largest government special interests, capture a share of these rents through increased compensation when collective bargaining is legal or through corruption when collective bargaining is outlawed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> What motivates the geographic footprint of the supply chains that multinational firms (MNFs) deploy? Traditional research in the operations and supply chain management literature tends to recommend locations primarily based on differentials in production costs and the ramifications of physical distance ignoring the role of taxation. MNFs that strategically position parts of their supply chains in low‐tax locations can allocate the profits across the divisions to improve post‐tax profits. For the profit allocation to be defensible to tax authorities, the divisional operations must possess real decision authority and bear meaningful risks. Generally speaking, the greater the transfer of risk and control, the larger the allowable allocation of profit. These transfers may also create inefficiencies due to misalignment of business goals and attitudes toward risk. We model these trade‐offs in the context of placing in a low‐tax region a subsidiary that oversees product distribution (as a limited risk distributor commissionnaire, limited risk distributor, or fully fledged distributor). Our analysis demonstrates that the MNF's preferences regarding the operating structures are not necessarily an obvious ordering based on the amount of risk and decision authority transferred to the division in the low‐tax jurisdiction. We derive and analyze threshold values of the performance parameters that describe the main trade‐offs involved in selecting an operating structure. We find some of the optimal decisions to exhibit interesting non‐monotone behavior. For instance, profits can increase when the tax rate in the low‐tax jurisdiction increases. Numerical analysis shows that the Limited‐Risk Distributor structure is rarely optimal and quantifies when each alternative dominates it. </jats:p>",

Since the professionals’ assessments are influenced by their experiences from the transitional economies, which are faced with limited abilities to invest in expensive business information systems, the main hypothesis is that moving the logistics into the cloud may resolve or at least alleviate the considered problems. On the basis of the available secondary literature resources on pros and cons of RFID implementation into supply chains, and the statistical analysis of the consciously completed questionnaires in the survey, the model for adopting cloud services for providing RFID-enabled goods and related activities in the considered economies is proposed at a logical level.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between physiological characteristics and storage root yield of three cassava genotypes under three rates of N fertilizer. The experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 at farm fields in Thailand. A split-plot randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Three different rates of N fertilizer, i.e., 46·9, 90·0 and 133·2 kg N/ha and three cassava genotypes, Rayong 9, Rayong 11 and Kasetsart 50, were used. Kasetsart 50 had the highest mean performance for most crop traits. Growth rate of stem (SGR), storage root (SRGR) and crop (CGR) during 180–210 days after planting (DAP) and leaf area index (LAI) at 120 DAP were related to storage root dry weight for all three rates of N fertilizer. Storage root growth during 90–120 DAP, CGR during 180–210 DAP and specific leaf area (SLA) at 210 DAP contributed most to storage root dry weight of the three genotypes grown at 46·9 kg N/ha, while the combination of SRGR during 90–120 DAP, SRGR during 180–210 DAP, LAI at 210 DAP and SLA at 210 DAP was best for N fertilizer at 90·0 kg N/ha and the combination of leaf growth rate (LGR) during 180–210 DAP and LAI at 210 DAP was best for N fertilizer at 133·2 kg N/ha.</jats:p>",

In the context of the guidelines of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) as well as of the competitiveness in the international market, we develop a spatial equilibrium model in the form of a mixed complementarity problem. The competitiveness of Brazilian maize and soybeans on the international market is compromised by the inefficient logistics and slow responses to the demands of the CPB.

We argue that the distribution of cannabis in Australia is best understood with reference to the concept of social supply, where a supplier, not considered to be a ‘drug dealer proper’, brokers, facilitates or sells drugs, for little or no financial gain to friends and acquaintances. The article draws on data from surveys and interviews with 200 young Australian cannabis users, almost all of whom had also supplied cannabis at some point in their lifetime. We further theorise the concept of social supply with reference to social capital. We argue that a sociological understanding of drug distribution should focus on drug communities, as opposed to markets, describing the features of social organisation that exist between people within social networks and related implications that such features might have in terms of social harm and well-being. </jats:p>",

The main aim in applying the hybrid method was to improve the quantitative information basis of strategy planning processes. The paper was started by listing the various factors of the four different groups of SWOT with reference to the PDS. After further shortlisting, pairwise comparisons were carried out using a software (Super Decisions) to arrive at prioritised factors for each group.

We explore reasons behind pork supply chains’ predominant focus on mass production combined with traceability and food safety, while only little attention has been given to potentially lucrative niche markets focused on intrinsic quality cues. Using established analytical frameworks of hedonic pricing and transactions costs economics we discuss alternative strategies for the segregation and promotion of intrinsic sensory differentiated pork. Growing empirical evidence in the literature underpins the importance of eating experience in delivering utility to consumers and in stabilizing declining demand trends in major markets. Building on current consumer behavioral literature and organizational developments in meat supply chains in Europe and Australia, we critically discuss opportunities to overcome this supposedly suboptimal situation.</jats:p>",

The whole filament is composed of two opposite-direction streams, implying that longitudinal oscillations are not the only cause of the counterstreamings, and unidirectional siphon flows with alternative directions are another possibility.</jats:p>",

Recent industry surveys report that the abuse of channel incentives is a primary reason for the growth of gray market activities. Therefore, it is crucial that companies take the presence of gray markets into consideration when they design contracts to distribute products through authorized retailers. This issue has received little attention in the extensive literature on contracting and supply chain coordination. In this study, we analyze the impacts of gray markets on two classic contracts, wholesale price and quantity discount, in a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer when the retailer has the opportunity to sell to a domestic gray market. Our analysis provides interesting and counterintuitive results. First, a classic quantity‐discount contract that normally coordinates the supply chain can perform so poorly in the presence of a gray market that the supply chain would be better off using a wholesale price contract instead. Second, the presence of gray market can also degrade the performance of the wholesale price contract; therefore, a more sophisticated contract is needed for coordinating the supply chain. We show that contracts that solely depend on retailer's order quantity cannot coordinate the supply chain, and provide the conditions for coordinating the supply chain with price‐dependent quantity discount contracts. We also provide comparative statics and show that when there is a gray market, coordinating the supply chain enhances total consumer welfare. </jats:p>",

The denitrification performance of a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)–ceramsite-based reactive barrier system was evaluated in continuous upflow bioreactors. Artificial groundwater spiked with nitrate (44.75–57.25 mg NO3−-N/L) was tested under different hydraulic retention times (HRT; 5.2 h and 2.6 h). The continuous experiment for 35 days showed that more than 95% NO3−-N was removed. The maximum denitrification rate was determined to be 241 mg NO3−-N/(L· d), and NO2−-N concentration was below 0.1 mg/L in the effluent at the substrate:ceramsite mass ratio of 1:40. Rapid biodegradation of PHBV granules caused an initial excess release of dissolved organic compound (DOC), and shortening HRT from 5.2 h to 2.6 h can result in a sharp decrease of DOC. The minimum DOC concentrations were determined to be 20–33 mg/L in the effluent when the HRT was set at 2.6 h. So the PHBV granules may be a suitable solid-phase carbon source for enhancing denitrification in nitrate-contaminated groundwater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The stakeholders’ perceptual evaluations of the supply structure of destination tourism play an important role in promoting the sustainable development of regional tourism. However, the research on the structural perceptions of destination tourism supply is relatively insufficient in current research on the perceptions of tourism stakeholders. This paper analyzes the perceptual differences among inbound tourists, community residents and tourism practitioners from the core and auxiliary tourism supply dimensions. After having applied the structural equation model in this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of the tourism supply of Xi’an, a famous tourist city in China, were identified. In addition, the findings of this paper are: the inbound tourists have high perceptual sensitivity over the factors of the urban core tourism supply; the community residents have high perceptual sensitivity over the auxiliary tourist supply factors; the tourism practitioners have similar perceptual sensitivity over the factors of urban core and auxiliary tourism supply. The advantageous factors involve tourist attractions, tourist shopping, tourist entertainment, hospitality environment and tourist information. Furthermore, the moderately stable supply factors of Xi’an include tourist transportation, tourist catering, tourist accommodation, marketing as well as safety and security, while the natural environment is the limiting factor. The results support sustainable development and the coordination of different stakeholders in the destinations.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a qualitative case study of a beef co-operative integrated to a VBSC. We use an analytical framework of viability, sustainability and resilience to analyse impacts at farm-level. Our analysis highlights a number of positive effects on farm-level viability, sustainability and resilience. These benefits stemmed largely from improvements to market orientation, price stability, and members’ capacities in responding to problems. However, the autonomy of the co-operative was challenged by VBSC chain members, which impacted negatively on the stability of the co-operative.</jats:p>"

In addition, a wide variety of packaging, composed by different materials, is employed. As material, size and shape of items to which the tag should be attached strongly influence the minimum power requested for tag functioning, performance improvements can be achieved only selecting suitable radio frequency (RF) identifiers for the specific combination of food product and packaging. When dealing with logistics units, the dynamic reading of a vast number of tags could originate simultaneous broadcasting of signals (tag-to-tag collisions) that could affect reading rates and the overall reliability of the identification procedure. This paper reports the results of an analysis of the reading performance of ultra high frequency radio frequency identification systems for multiple static and dynamic electronic identification of food packed products in controlled conditions. Products were considered when arranged on a logistics pallet. The effects on reading rate of different factors, among which the product type, the gate configuration, the field polarisation, the power output of the RF reader, the interrogation protocol configuration as well as the transit speed, the number of tags and their interactions were statistically analysed and compared.</jats:p>"

The optimum conditions were identified as a contact time of 30 minutes, pH 6, biosorbent dose of 1 g L−1, and initial arsenic concentration of 250 ppb. A fluidized bed column was used to study the removal of arsenic in the column. The results showed that biosorption of arsenic gave promising results in batch and continuous system, lowering the arsenic concentration down to WHO standards (10 ppb) for drinking water. The Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were major active sites for biosorption, while the results of scanning electron microscopy showed obvious changes in surface morphology of OW after the biosorption process. With 90% removal efficiency, results indicated that OW is a cost-effective and eco-friendly biosorbent and comparable to current drinking water treatment technologies. Further research is needed to get the optimum conditions for pilot-scale testing of the biosorption process by OW as well as evaluation of treated water for food quality parameters in order to commercialize the process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a water supply system safe yield is the average annual volume that can be supplied to the system subject to an adopted set of operational rules and a typical demand pattern without violating a given level of service standard. It is dependent upon storage and hydrologic (rainfall/runoff/evaporation) characteristics of the sources, the source facilities, upstream and downstream permitted withdrawals and minimum in-stream flow requirements.For effective operation and management of a water supply system, it is important to have knowledge of water balance of the reservoirs and estimate their safe yield at a certain level of reliability. In this study, to assess water resources potential of existing surface water sources and new catchments and estimate the water balance of the water supply system, the hydrologic simulation model, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was utilized. The model was calibrated and validated successfully. The safe yield and corresponding reliability of reservoirs were estimated using a deterministic water balance model. The results of the water balance analysis and projected water demand were used to assess existing water supply situation and challenges in future. The assessment indicated that the gap between demand and supply at high population growth rate scenario is wide and very critical.To close the gap between the available water supply and the increasing water demand in the study area, utmost attention is needed by the decision making authorities and the management of the water utility to improve performance efficiency of the water supply system by instituting effective water governance and reducing leakage losses.</jats:p>"

The study targeted all the senior managers at Director Levels at the GSC and the RSC and all the senior operational staff from supply chain and service delivery pillars in three (03) large Field Missions. These field missions are namely United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (MONUSCO); United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); and the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA). This study used purposive sampling technique. The researcher purposively sampled fifteen (15) personnel; with three (03) participants each from the GSC, RSC, and three (03) participants each from the three (03) Field Mission. Primary data was obtained from the original sources using questionnaires and interview.Findings: The respondents indicated that the logical consistencies observed needed an understanding, through measurement, a reordering model that included lead time, reorder point, and safety stock.  The respondents also indicated that the consistencies observed mainly relates to the overall approach of being more customer oriented while trying to optimize business processes and workflows. However, the respondents indicated that there were limitations in how the various organizations diversely applied lean concepts. There was no clear guidance provided on areas requiring higher prioritization; consistency throughout the departments, divisions and, missions when changes are applied (i.e. in structures, and functional organizational units). Additionally, lean analyzes were conducted mainly by internal resources that may not have been completely objective on areas being investigated, therefore bringing bias and subjectivity. Internal resources using lean techniques may not have been complete. Finally, the respondents indicated that there is no clear guidance yet. Policies and training have to be provided to staff prior implementing lean techniques.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that there is need to establish formal strategic plans to direct and align the work of the organization and supported by objectives and data-driven performance monitoring, analysis, and reporting. The study also recommends that there is a need for more efficient monitoring and evaluation of all GA resolutions and audit recommendations. The organization needs to monitor the manner of compliance with the provisions of the memorandums of understanding.</jats:p>"

Big data technologies and analytics provide more accurate forecast information and give an opportunity to transform business models. In this paper, a comprehensive review on forecast information sharing for managing supply chain in the big data era is conducted. The value and obstacles of sharing forecast information are discussed. Given the sufficient data, the appropriate approaches of analyzing and sharing forecast information are highlighted.

The treatment scheme was: (1) As(III) in contaminated water is oxidized by arsenite-oxidizing bacteria fixed in the sponges in the reactor; (2) Fe(II) naturally existing in the water is oxidized by dissolved oxygen; (3) Fe(III) is precipitated as iron hydroxide and As(V) is co-precipitated with the iron hydroxide; and finally (4) the co-precipitates are fixed in the sponges. This system could remove As from As-contaminated water on a small scale and at low cost. The results showed that, after using the DHS reactor, As and Fe concentrations in the treated water were lower than water quality standards for drinking water when Fe(II) concentration in the influent was lower than 10 mg/L and the Fe/As ratio was higher than 6.67–8.42, with dependence on the Fe concentration. Additionally, even if Fe concentration is higher than 10 mg/L, the treatment system is still applicable if the pH of the influent is higher than 7 or the retention time is longer than 2 h.</jats:p>",

However, little information is available regarding the photosynthetic characteristics of microalgae and nutrient removal from wastewater at different CO2 concentrations. It was found that elevated CO2 aeration provided sustained growth at CO2 concentrations ranging from 5% to 15% and performed best with 5% CO2 aeration in primary piggery wastewater for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth. Photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were stimulated in response to CO2 enrichment, thus increasing nutrient uptake in primary piggery wastewater, particularly total nitrogen and total phosphorus. A study of carbon-concentrating mechanism-related gene expression revealed that the levels of mRNAs, such as CAH1, LCIB and HLA3, were significantly downregulated. This represents a possible method for the reconciliation of CO2-stimulated growth with mixotrophic cultivation of C. reinhardtii in diluted primary piggery wastewater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We report a case of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with a severe intracranial hemorrhage occurring after Onyx embolization. A 40-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic tentorial DAVF on angiography. Transarterial embolization with Onyx was performed via the middle meningeal artery, and the cast filled the fistula itself and its proximal draining vein. Postoperative angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the DAVF. A computed tomography scan performed immediately after the procedure demonstrated an acute subdural hematoma with the temporal hemorrhage. Emergency craniotomy revealed continuous arterial bleeding from a viable glomus-like vascular structure around the proximal part of the embolized draining vein, fed by a pial artery arising from the posterior cerebral artery. Pathologic findings suggested diagnosis of vascular malformation extending into the subdural space. Tentorial DAVFs can extend to the subdural space along their drainage route, and may be involved in severe hemorrhagic complications of curative endovascular treatment using Onyx, particularly those with pial arterial supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The academic discussion of power in supply chains has changed from a discussion of the use of coercive power to one which emphasizes the role of trust in embedding co-operation and disincentivizing opportunism. Whilst a number of empirical studies have suggested the former is alive and well, this paper argues that power relations may also be constituted by the self-perceptions of weaker actors as much as by the explicit actions of more powerful ones. This study explores the role of power through the perceptions of subjugated actors, which set the ‘rules of the game’. Our case centres on perceptions of Northern Irish beef farmers and their reflections on their ‘powerlessness’ in relation to the larger, more consolidated processors that they sell to. We find that the way farmers make sense of the power relations they encounter is influenced by the individuating character of the power relations exercised by the processors, which debilitates their ability to collaborate and resist collectively. What emerges is a story about the process of accommodation whereby farmers pragmatically resign themselves to play by ‘the rules of the game’ to remain ‘part of the game’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we study the economic lot and delivery scheduling problem for a four-stage supply chain that includes suppliers, fabricators, assemblers, and retailers. All of the parameters such as demand rate are deterministic and production setup times are sequence-dependent. The common cycle time and integer multipliers policies are adapted as replenishment policies for synchronization throughout the supply chain. A new mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed for both policies, the objective of which is the minimization of inventory, transportation, and production setup costs. We propose a new hybrid algorithm including a modified imperialist competitive algorithm which is purposed to the assimilation policy of imperialist competitive algorithm and teaching learning–based optimization which is added to improve local search. A hybrid modified imperialist competitive algorithm and teaching learning–based optimization is applied to find a near-optimum solution of mixed integer nonlinear programming in large-sized problems. The results denoted that our proposed algorithm can solve different size of problem in reasonable time. This procedure showed its efficiency in medium- and large-sized problems as compared to imperialist competitive algorithm, modified imperialist competitive algorithm, and other methods reported in the literature. </jats:p>",

The study targeted all the senior managers at Director Levels at the GSC and the RSC and all the senior operational staff from supply chain and service delivery pillars in three (03) large Field Missions. These field missions are namely United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (MONUSCO); United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); and the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA).

The researcher purposively sampled fifteen (15) personnel; with three (03) participants each from the GSC, RSC, and three (03) participants each from the three (03) Field Mission. Primary data was obtained from the original sources using questionnaires and interview.Findings: The respondents indicated that the logical consistencies observed needed an understanding, through measurement, a reordering model that included lead time, reorder point, and safety stock.  The respondents also indicated that the consistencies observed mainly relates to the overall approach of being more customer oriented while trying to optimize business processes and workflows. However, the respondents indicated that there were limitations in how the various organizations diversely applied lean concepts. There was no clear guidance provided on areas requiring higher prioritization; consistency throughout the departments, divisions and, missions when changes are applied (i.e. in structures, and functional organizational units). Additionally, lean analyzes were conducted mainly by internal resources that may not have been completely objective on areas being investigated, therefore bringing bias and subjectivity. Internal resources using lean techniques may not have been complete. Finally, the respondents indicated that there is no clear guidance yet. Policies and training have to be provided to staff prior implementing lean techniques.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that there is need to establish formal strategic plans to direct and align the work of the organization and supported by objectives and data-driven performance monitoring, analysis, and reporting. The study also recommends that there is a need for more efficient monitoring and evaluation of all GA resolutions and audit recommendations. The organization needs to monitor the manner of compliance with the provisions of the memorandums of understanding.</jats:p>"

Results also revealed that the use of lean strategies assisted the DFS gained economy of scale, centralization, standardization and higher global visibility on resources across Field Missions. Furthermore, results also showed that with the use of lean strategies, the DFS was able to transfer core supply chain functions from LSD to GSC. For instance, Global Asset Management is one example, and it allowed for better global visibility of resources across the organization. Results showed that UN Service Centers and Field Mission did not understand the needs of the end customer. Hence, the DFS ought to make changes on its operations in a bid to achieve customer satisfaction. Results showed that UN Service Centers and Field Mission did not understand the needs of the end customer. Hence, the DFS ought to make changes on its operations in a bid to achieve customer satisfaction. The results revealed that GSC and RSC-E as tools are quite useful, but there is still room for improvement. The results also revealed that GSC and RSC-E as tools have strengthened the Department's capacity as well as the asset management.  Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends the incorporation of balanced performance knowledge in the integration of people, processes, technology and customer service level to ensure customer satisfaction while proving economy and effectiveness in dedicated resources. Shared and remote services help optimize resources, minimize the number of support staff in danger zones, balance workload and ensure business continuity. The study also recommends that DFS should foster a continuous performance improvement mindset among staff through planning, doing, checking and taking corrective actions on a balanced scorecard that integrates and aligns staff motivation and interest to the objectives of the organization. Also, objective and fair work plan and performance management are an ingredient to foster continuous improvement.</jats:p>"

To examine this assumption, we provide evidence from the collapse of the Rana Plaza building on April 24, 2013, which with its 1133 fatalities and 2438 injuries is seen as one of the worst industrial accidents in history. Do markets reactive negatively enough to such events to motivate firms to shift their sourcing strategy? We analyze the stock market reaction to the Rana Plaza disaster in the Bangladeshi ready‐made garment industry to address this question. Our analysis is based on a sample of 39 publicly traded global apparel retailers with significant garment sourcing in Bangladesh. Stock market reaction to retailers on the day of the Rana Plaza disaster is negative, but its magnitude and significance dissipate by the following day. We find no evidence of significant stock market reaction during the 11 trading days (approximately two weeks in calendar time) following the disaster. Retailers responded to the disaster by developing two different agreements to improve factory and worker safety in Bangladesh – the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (AFBSB), and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (ABWS). We find no evidence of significant stock market reaction to the announcements of the AFBSB and the ABWS. The insignificant negative economic impact from the Rana Plaza disaster suggests that retailers have little economic incentive to move sourcing out of Bangladesh or other low‐cost countries so as to reduce the risk of being involved in such events. We discuss the implications of our results for retailers, non‐governmental organizations (NGOs), garment factory owners in Bangladesh, the Bangladeshi government, and academic researchers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article addresses the optimal design of a non‐cooperative shale gas supply chain based on a game theory approach. Instead of assuming a single stakeholder as in centralized models, we consider different stakeholders, including the upstream shale gas producer and the midstream shale gas processor. Following the Stackelberg game, the shale gas producer is identified as the leader, whose objectives include maximizing its net present value (NPV) and minimizing the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The shale gas processor is identified as the follower that takes actions after the leader to maximize its own NPV. The resulting problem is a multiobjective mixed‐integer bilevel linear programming problem, which cannot be solved directly using any off‐the‐shelf optimization solvers. Therefore, an efficient projection‐based reformulation and decomposition algorithm is further presented. Based on a case study of the Marcellus shale play, the non‐cooperative model not only captures the interactions between stakeholders but also provides more realistic solutions. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 63: 2671–2693, 2017</jats:p>",

The study targeted all the senior managers at Director Levels at the GSC and the RSC and all the senior operational staff from supply chain and service delivery pillars in three (03) large Field Missions. These field missions are namely United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (MONUSCO); United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); and the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA). This study used purposive sampling technique. The researcher purposively sampled fifteen (15) personnel; with three (03) participants each from the GSC, RSC, and three (03) participants each from the three (03) Field Mission. Primary data was obtained from the original sources using questionnaires and interview.Findings: Results revealed that the use of lean strategies had not produced any noticeable result because of its infancy. Results also revealed that the use of lean strategies assisted the DFS gained economy of scale, centralization, standardization and higher global visibility on resources across Field Missions. Furthermore, results also showed that with the use of lean strategies, the DFS was able to transfer core supply chain functions from LSD to GSC. For instance, Global Asset Management is one example, and it allowed for better global visibility of resources across the organization. Results showed that UN Service Centers and Field Mission did not understand the needs of the end customer. Hence, the DFS ought to make changes on its operations in a bid to achieve customer satisfaction. Results showed that UN Service Centers and Field Mission did not understand the needs of the end customer. Hence, the DFS ought to make changes on its operations in a bid to achieve customer satisfaction. The results revealed that GSC and RSC-E as tools are quite useful, but there is still room for improvement. The results also revealed that GSC and RSC-E as tools have strengthened the Department's capacity as well as the asset management.  Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends the incorporation of balanced performance knowledge in the integration of people, processes, technology and customer service level to ensure customer satisfaction while proving economy and effectiveness in dedicated resources. Shared and remote services help optimize resources, minimize the number of support staff in danger zones, balance workload and ensure business continuity. The study also recommends that DFS should foster a continuous performance improvement mindset among staff through planning, doing, checking and taking corrective actions on a balanced scorecard that integrates and aligns staff motivation and interest to the objectives of the organization. Also, objective and fair work plan and performance management are an ingredient to foster continuous improvement.</jats:p>"

The results show that, compared to the wholesale price contract, the consignment contract is always more desirable from the perspectives of the retailer and the entire channel and brings more consumer surplus. When the dominant retailer's advertising effort is very effective or channel members have enough patience, the dominant retailer and the manufacturer can achieve a Pareto improvement under the consignment contract; otherwise the manufacturer prefers the wholesale price contract.</jats:p>",

The present work aims to gain a better understanding of the effect of iron supply on anthocyanins concentration in grape berries. To this end, own-rooted four-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines (Vitis vinifera) were fertigated every three days with 0, 23, 46, 92, and 184 μM iron (Fe) from ferric ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (Fe-EDDHA) in a complete nutrient solution. Fe deficiency or excess generally led to higher concentrations of titratable acidity and skin/berry ratio, and to lower reducing sugar content, sugar/acid ratio, pH, berry weight, and concentration of anthocyanins. Most of the individual anthocyanins detected in this study, except cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaryl)-glucoside, in moderate Fe treatment (46 μM) grapes were significantly higher than those of other treatments. Genes encoding chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT) exhibited higher transcript levels in berries from plants cultivated with 46 μM Fe compared to the ones cultivated with other Fe concentrations. We suggest that grape sugar content, anthocyanins content, and transcriptions of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were correlated with Fe supply concentrations.</jats:p>"

The resilience capability of a supplier is of significance in supplier selection; a supplier selected in the context of a resilient construction supply chain (RCSC) is referred to in this research as a “resilient construction supplier”. This paper proposes a supplier selection framework tailored to effective information integration for supply chain management. The proposed framework works by integrating building information modeling (BIM) and a geographic information system (GIS) in a RCSC. BIM and GIS together provide highly transparent construction material information, enhanced supply chain status visualization, and workable access information for supplier selection. Supplier performance is evaluated via seventeen resilient criteria under a combined methodology consisting of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relational analysis (GRA); AHP and GRA weigh the criteria and rank the suppliers respectively. By varying the weightings given to each criterion, sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the criteria of resilience which impact the selection priorities of suppliers. An illustrative example is also provided to show the overall process of the proposed framework.</jats:p>"

Although some companies have shown their success in implementing SSCM practices, many are still hesitant – that is, certain challenges to SSCM operation still exist. The focus of this study was to identify the influential factors of SSCM practices from both the conceptual and practical perspectives. A verified SSCM questionnaire was conducted to investigate the differences of the influential factors between Taiwan and Vietnam, and to explore the regional phenomenon of SSCM implementation. The result could be used to support the argument of related literature that pressure, strategy, uncertainty, internal management and external management could be the influential factors of the success/failure of the SSCM adoption. Local practices of sustainability in Taiwan and Vietnam were addressed and discussed in this study. Future study might survey other Asian countries to examine the international difference.

We describe how perceptions of risk are shaped and how households seek to reduce possible health impacts and potential economic losses through aversion behaviours. To this end, households’ activities relating to water storage, treatment and usage, together with water source preference, were analysed using a qualitative approach. We developed a framework that describes actual risk, risk perceptions and aversion behaviours. Risk perceptions and the adoption of aversion behaviours of varying frequency and intensity are based on a complex interaction between personal and shared experiences that relate to water supply dimensions, socioeconomic characteristics, and social networking. Moreover, we discuss household risk management strategies and provide some recommendations aimed at improving future approaches to the study of aversion behaviours. </jats:p>",

Despite the widespread investigation of relationships between fish habitat use and environmental variables, there is a paucity of knowledge on how abiotic and biotic factors jointly influence stream fish habitat use. Three New Zealand South Island streams were selected to investigate the habitat preference of a stream‐dwelling galaxiid, banded kokopu (<jats:italic>Galaxias fasciatus</jats:italic>). Fish abundance in several permanent pools was determined by spotlighting at night once a month from June 2008 to May 2009. Drifting invertebrates and key physical features of each pool were measured at the time of fish sampling. An information‐theoretic approach (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AIC</jats:styled-content>) indicated that the most parsimonious candidate model to predict banded kokopu biomass was the one that included pool area, undercut banks, water velocity, overhanging vegetation, invertebrate drift density and an interaction term between invertebrate drift density and water velocity. Banded kokopu biomass was positively related to pool area, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation and invertebrate drift density. Our study suggests that fish resource use patterns need to be understood in the context of multiple interacting ecological factors, including prey abundance.</jats:p>",

On this basis, a theory and method for constructing a dynamic programming management model for groundwater with covariates was proposed which used the state transition equation method. The model was solved using the differential dynamic programming (DDP) method. Thereafter, the groundwater system of the Songyuan area in western Jilin Province was treated as an area of interest to study the major problem of the relationships governing mutual-feed joint-variation. Based on the numerical simulation model, the research paid more attention to Qianguo County and Fuyu County and established a dynamic programming management model of the groundwater with covariates for these areas. Then the optimised amount of pumping, the groundwater level, and the covariates were solved simultaneously. To sum up, this research enriched the theory and method for dealing with mutual-feed joint-variations in the groundwater management model. Thereby, it established a theoretical foundation and provided technical support for the solution of various practical problems.</jats:p>",

Farming marine ornamental fishes, especially the threatened ones, can be one of the measures to minimize the pressure on the natural stocks. Among the priority issues for their production is the determination of the most appropriate feeding management. The feeding protocol commonly used in the larviculture of barber goby, when the start of Artemia sp. offer occurred at the 18th DAH (days after hatching) (treatment T18), was modified, by anticipating brine shrimp supply in 6 days (treatment T12). Alkaline proteases activity, growth and metamorphosis of larvae were evaluated in both protocols. Juveniles at T12 showed higher weight (0.04 ± 0.001 g) and lower activity of total alkaline proteases (1.3 ± 0.2 mU mg-1 protein) compared to T18 (0.02 ± 0.001 g; 2.8 ± 0.4 mU mg-1 protein, respectively). With anticipation of brine shrimp, the commencing and end of larval transformation was observed earlier (at 24 and 34 DAH, respectively) in comparison to those with the supply of Artemia sp. at 18 DAH (27 and 41 DAH, respectively). Thus, the Artemia sp. anticipation was beneficial during the larviculture of the barber goby, considering that larvae reached metamorphosis earlier.</jats:p>"

U concentrations and isotope ratios were consistent with conservative behavior and can safely be described using published U‐salinity relationships and global average seawater isotopic composition. Near Barbados, waters affected by the Amazon outflow contained elevated <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th. This signals one region where the thorium‐dust method is inaccurate because of a confounding continental input. Dissolved <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th fluxes in this region suggest that Amazonian Fe supply to the adjacent open ocean is much larger than local atmospheric deposition. The colloidal content of dissolved Th south of Bermuda was found to be quite small (2–6%), similar to that found north of Hawaii, despite the order of magnitude higher dust deposition in the Atlantic. This finding supports the assumption that dissolved <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th and <jats:sup>230</jats:sup>Th are scavenged at the same rate despite their different sources and also sheds light on the increase of dissolved <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th fluxes with integrated depth. Outside the region influenced by Amazon River waters, dissolved <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th fluxes are compared with Bermudan aerosol Fe deposition to estimate that fractional Th solubility is around 20% in this region. Finally, new dissolved and soluble Fe, Mn, and Cr data from the subtropical North Pacific support the idea that Fe concentrations in the remote ocean are highly buffered, whereas <jats:sup>232</jats:sup>Th has a larger dynamic range between high‐ and low‐dust regions.</jats:p>",

Identification of salmonella was carried out by conventional methods, plasmid specter - by Kado C.I. and Liu S.T. (1981) method. Results. 98.4% of strains contained virulence plasmid p38, and 80.1% of strains also had small plasmids. Sakhalin strains were divided into 16 plasmid types (D=0.794), and strains from Jewish AO - 10 (D=0.834). Uniformity of strains in patients during infection outbreaks and in transmission factors was detected. Conclusion. Features of salmonellosis in the studied subjects of Russian Federation are determined by higher risk of import of products containing salmonella.

На основе данных численного моделирования обсуждается качественная картина газодинамических и тепловых процессов в сопле при нестационарном подводе энергии. Устанавливается зависимость расходных характеристик сопла, а также смещение соплового скачка уплотнения при перерасширенном истечении газа из сопла от интенсивности и\nцикличности энергоподвода в дозвуковой части сопла.\n</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Gas flows are simulated in technical devices where processes associated with unsteady localized energy supply are proceeded. The finite volume method and the vectorized approach to the calculation of numerical fluxes are applied to the simulation of unsteady nozzle flows with intense energy supply. An approximate model of equilibrium thermodynamics of air is used to simulate thermodynamic processes in high-temperature air flows. The numerical results obtained for\none-dimensional and two-dimensional nozzle flows with moving zones of energy supply are analyzed. A qualitative picture of gasdynamic and thermal processes in a nozzle with unsteady energy supply is discussed on the basis of the results\nof numerical simulation. A dependence of the nozzle flow rate and the displacement of nozzle shock wave on the intensity and cyclicity of energy supply is considered for overexpanded nozzle flow.\n</jats:p>",

In order to hedge against the risks of price and demand caused by inflation, portfolio contracts with put options, namely, a combination of wholesale price contracts and put option contracts, are adopted by the retailer to obtain the products from the supplier. We characterize the optimal ordering and production policies for the retailer and the supplier in the presence of put option contracts under inflation. By comparing with the case without put option contracts, we discuss the effect of put option contracts on the supply chain and prove that the usage of put option contracts benefits these two members under inflation. Through several numerical examples, we illustrate the effect of inflation on the supply chain with and without put option contracts. On this basis, we design a feasible supply chain coordination strategy based on put option contracts under inflation.</jats:p>",

However, customers are inconvenienced by individually returning the product or refunding the service after they have purchased a bundle. This paper presents a return and refund policy under two‐stage demand uncertainty (uncertainty at time 0 and inherent uncertainty), for products bundled with core services in the dual‐channel supply chain. Consumers can use the direct channel to return the default product–service bundle. In contrast, consumers in the retail channel can unsubscribe from the retailer's diverse core service by first receiving an unused service refund; the retailer then returns the product to the manufacturer. We use an approximate algorithm to solve for the optimal product quantity in the retail channel, demonstrating that the proportional marginal profit has a greater positive influence on the retailer's profit, and especially for the demand with a higher mean and lower variance.</jats:p>",

Considering the subsistent developments of optimized allocation of energy resources and efficient utilization, the urgent need to solve environmental pollution, and the continuously promoted power market-oriented reform, further study of China’s power structure clean development has certain theoretical value. Based on the data analysis, this paper analyzes the key factors that influence the evolution process of the structure with the help of system dynamics theory and carries out comprehensive assessments after the construction of the structure evaluation system. Additionally, a forecasting model of the power supply structure development based on the Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) has been put forward to forecast the future structure. Through the research of policy review and scenario analysis, the paths and directions of structure optimization are proposed. In this paper, the system dynamics, vector autoregressive model (VAR), policy mining, and scenario analysis methods are combined to systematically demonstrate the evolution of China’s power structure, and predict the future direction of development. This research may provide a methodological and practical reference for the analysis of China’s power supply structure optimization development and for theoretical studies.</jats:p>"

We use detailed survey data from a large sample of Australian General Practitioners (GPs) to estimate a structural, discrete choice model of labour supply and AHC. This allows us to jointly model GPs' decisions on the number of daytime‐weekday working hours and the probability of providing AHC. We simulate GPs' labour supply responses to an increase in hourly earnings, both in a daytime‐weekday setting and for AHC. GPs increase their daytime‐weekday working hours if their hourly earnings in this setting increase, but only to a very small extent. GPs are somewhat more likely to provide AHC if their hourly earnings in that setting increase, but again, the effect is very small and only evident in some subgroups. Moreover, higher earnings in weekday‐daytime practice reduce the probability of providing AHC, particularly for men. Increasing GPs' earnings appears to be at best relatively ineffective in encouraging increased provision of AHC and may even prove harmful if incentives are not well targeted.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Mo rates on the growth and biological nitrogen fixation by two Brazilian common bean cultivars using the 15N isotope dilution technique. The experiment was performed in 2014 in a completely randomized design arranged in a 5 x 3 factorial scheme, corresponding to 5 rates of Mo (control, 40, 80, 120 and 240 g ha-1), the common bean cultivars Aporé, Ouro Negro and NORH-54 (a non-nodulating common bean cultivar), and three replicates. The application of Mo and the inoculation with rhizobia strains contributed to improving nitrogen fixation and grain weight. The cultivar Ouro Negro showed a higher number and weight of nodules and a higher amount of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere than the cultivar Aporé. The biological nitrogen fixation of Aporé was more dependent on the application of Mo. These results indicated that inoculation with Rhizobium strains and Mo supply effectively contributed to biological nitrogen fixation and improving grain production.</jats:p>",

In this paper, liquid hydrogen with SMES (LIQHYSMES) is proposed to play a role in the future energy internet in terms of its combination of the SMES and the liquid hydrogen storage unit, which can help to overcome the capacity limit and high investment cost disadvantages of SMES. The generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm is presented to be appreciatively used to eliminate the frequency deviations of the isolated micro energy grid including the LIQHYSMES and RESs. A benchmark micro energy grid with distributed generators (DGs), electrical vehicle (EV) stations, smart loads and a LIQHYSMES unit is modeled in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results show that the proposed GPC strategy can reschedule the active power output of each component to maintain the stability of the grid. In addition, in order to improve the performance of the SMES, a detailed optimization design of the superconducting coil is conducted, and the optimized SMES unit can offer better technical advantages in damping the frequency fluctuations.</jats:p>"

This deteriorates the grid current. Therefore, a strategy based on the variable duty ratio feed‐forward and quasi‐proportional‐resonant (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QPR</jats:styled-content>) combined control is put forward, by introducing the needed duty ratio to the original output of current inner loop, whereby the pressure of the inner loop is effectively reduced.

The transfer functions of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CCM</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DCM</jats:styled-content> between duty ratio and grid current are then built. At the same time, the parallel multi‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">QPR</jats:styled-content> harmonic compensators are adopted in the current inner loop to effectively eliminate the specific harmonic pollution. To verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a 5.3‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">kW</jats:styled-content> prototype under digital control is established. The simulation and experimental results show that both the steady and transient performance of the proposed strategy are better under the fixed current inner loop parameters, the current zero crossing distortion can be eliminated, and the current quality acquired under the transformation between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CCM</jats:styled-content> to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DCM</jats:styled-content> can be further improved.</jats:p>",

Morphometric analysis of mitochondrial shape and spatial organization within transverse sections of cardiomyocytes from control and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that mitochondria are 20% smaller in size while their spatial density increases by 53% in diabetic cells relative to control myocytes. Diabetic cells formed larger clusters of mitochondria (60% more mitochondria per cluster) and the effective surface-to-volume ratio of these clusters increased by 22.5%. Using a biophysical computational model we found that this increase can have a moderate compensatory effect by increasing the availability of ATP in the cytosol when ATP synthesis within the mitochondrial matrix is compromised. </jats:p>",

A multidisciplinary approach, combining analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired during the summer months of 2008–2011, together with high‐frequency samplings carried out in the Ría de Vigo in August 2013 during spring (CHAOS1) and neap tides (CHAOS2), was used to characterize: (1) the internal wave activity, (2) its influence on mixing and nutrient supply, and (3) its role on phytoplankton community. SAR images revealed that internal waves were more energetic during spring tides. Turbulent mixing was higher during CHAOS1‐springs (Kz =1.3 [1.0–2.0, 95% confidence interval] × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) compared to CHAOS2‐neaps (Kz = 0.7 [0.5–1.0] × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and as a result nitrate diffusive fluxes were approximately fourfold higher (35 [17–73] mmol m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) during CHAOS1‐springs. The sampling covered a transition from relaxation‐stratification (CHAOS1‐springs) to intensifying upwelling (CHAOS2‐neaps) conditions, resulting in nitrate supply (including both diffusive and advective fluxes) being about 50% higher during CHAOS2‐neaps. The phytoplankton community, which was overwhelmingly dominated by diatoms in both cruises, exhibited a shift in species composition, with an increase in the abundance of large <jats:italic>Chaetoceros</jats:italic> spp. during CHAOS2‐neaps. About 50% of the primary production in the ecosystem during periods of upwelling relaxation‐stratification could be sustained by enhanced nitrate diffusive fluxes during spring tides. Therefore, even in coastal upwelling regions, turbulent mixing driven by internal waves could play an important role in controlling phytoplankton productivity and community structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework represents a significant advance in specifying the ecological constraints on human development. However, to enable decision-makers in business and public policy to respect these constraints in strategic planning, the PB framework needs to be developed to generate practical tools. With this objective in mind, we analyse the recent literature and highlight three major scientific and technical challenges in operationalizing the PB approach in decision-making: first, identification of thresholds or boundaries with associated metrics for different geographical scales; second, the need to frame approaches to allocate fair shares in the ‘safe operating space’ bounded by the PBs across the value chain and; third, the need for international bodies to co-ordinate the implementation of the measures needed to respect the Planetary Boundaries. For the first two of these challenges, we consider how they might be addressed for four PBs: climate change, freshwater use, biosphere integrity and chemical pollution and other novel entities. Four key opportunities are identified: (1) development of a common system of metrics that can be applied consistently at and across different scales; (2) setting ‘distance from boundary’ measures that can be applied at different scales; (3) development of global, preferably open-source, databases and models; and (4) advancing understanding of the interactions between the different PBs. Addressing the scientific and technical challenges in operationalizing the planetary boundaries needs be complemented with progress in addressing the equity and ethical issues in allocating the safe operating space between companies and sectors.</jats:p>"

        "The effect of changes in opportunity costs and prices of some agricultural products such as sugar beet, corn,wheat etc. used for bioethanol production on the cost of bioethanol production is not adequately known in Turkey.. Therefore, it was aimed to determine the bioethanol production cost items and unit production costs and also to put forth the effects of variations in raw material prices on cost of bioethanol.. The research data were collected via personal interviews from active bioethanol plants in Turkey. The results of previous studies and documents of related institutions and organizations were also used. The study followed classical cost analysis approach to calculate production cost. Scenario analysis was performed when exploring the effect of raw material prices on bioethanol production cost. Research findings showed that production cost per litre bioethanol produced from sugar beet molasses, corn, wheat and corn-wheat mixture were 2.50 TL, 2.84 TL, 2.95 and 2.84 TL, respectively. The share of raw material expenses in bioethanol cost per liter varied associated with the crops used in the process, it was 28.55% for bioethanol produced from sugar beet molasses, 44.81% for bioethanol produced from corn-wheat mixture and 44.87% bioethanol produced from corn. The research results also showed that the changes that occur in raw material prices significantly affected the bioethanol production cost and opportunity cost of crops created difficulties in biomass supply. Implementing the suitable policies and strategies and making the necessary arrangements in legislation would enhance the economic sustainability of bioethanol production in Turkey."
