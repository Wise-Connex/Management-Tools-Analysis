      "abstract": "<p>Chapter 3 reviewed the literature regarding the influence of the built environment on travel behavior, and chapter 4 then described one way the issue might be usefully studied. The empirical work in chapter 5 provided intriguing results while illuminating some complex issues that remain unresolved in the analysis of urban design and travel behavior. Overall, our analysis thus far suggests that the link between the built environment and travel is intimately tied to the how urban form influences the cost of travel, and that the effect of design is complex in ways not adequately appreciated in most policy discussions. Neighborhood design in particular might affect automobile travel, but we still have much to learn about the nature, generality, and policy role of any such link. That said, our analysis so far has been conventional in that it has focused on travel behavior. Yet that is only half of the story. It is also important to understand whether and how alternative land-use strategies might be more broadly implemented. Having sketched out the role of the demand for travel in understanding the impacts of urban form on trip making, we now examine the supply of urban form. Put another way, how do communities shape cities toward transportation ends? As discussed in chapter 3, a major difficulty in empirical work on travel behavior and urban design is that persons might choose residential locations based in part on how they wish to travel. Those who prefer walking are more likely to choose to live in pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. People who prefer to commute by rail are more likely to live in transit-oriented developments. If so, then simply looking at differences in travel patterns across different neighborhoods does not give insight into how urban design causes persons to travel differently. It is possible that urban design might not lead persons to travel differently at all, at least not in the sense of changing the way they desire to travel. If there are an adequate number of communities providing less auto-dependent environments, then building more might have no influence on travel behavior.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>México está listado dentro de los países con problemas de falta de agua para el año 2020. La sequía de los 1990’s ha reducido la disponibilidad del agua para satisfacer los usos tradicionales en el norte de México. Los conflictos internos entre usos, entre usuarios y entre entidades políticas por las aguas no se han hecho esperar en varias cuencas. La cuenca del río San Juan es un ejemplo clásico de esta problemática, donde los recuersos hidrológicos son de importancia fundamental para el desarrollo sustentable regional. El objetivo de este estudio fue predecir el suministro y demanda futura de agua sobre el cauce principal del río San Juan desde el embalse El Cuchillo hasta su confluencia con el Río Bravo. Las suposiciones fueron que la demanda de agua por el sector municipal (doméstico, industrial, comercial) incrementa paulatinamente con el crecimiento de la población del área metropolitana de Monterrey; que el suministro del agua es dependiente de las condiciones hidroclimáticas caracterizadas por las variaciones del pasado y que el suministro de agua para uso agrícola es dependiente de estas variaciones y del incremento en la demanda para el uso municipal. Los resultados mostraron que la disponibilidad de agua para irrigación se reduce dramáticamente en condiciones de hidrología normal o de sequía histórica. Por consiguiente, se espera que las áreas agrícolas del Distrito de Riego 026 se compriman en el mediano plazo en un 56 a un 65% bajo las condiciones hidroclimáticas supuestas y el incremento en la demanda de agua para uso municipal. Se recomiendan alternativas para implementar el manejo sustentable de los recursos hidrológicos como herramienta que puede potencialmente reducir el impacto de las variaciones en el suministro de agua para la agricultura y para el uso ambiental de la cuenca baja del río San Juan.</jats:p>"

According to the 1999 National Petroleum Council study Meeting the Challenges of the Nation's Growing Natural Gas Demand1, the Gulf of Mexico will be one of the primary areas providing future supply to the Nation. Walt Rosenbush, former MMS director under the Clinton Administration has stated \"Continued growth in OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) deepwater oil and gas exploration and development is vital for our nation's long-term energy supply. Further expansion of Gulf gas production is necessary if we are going to meet the projected demand for 29 Tcf of gas in the nation by 2010.\"2</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The 1995 Deepwater Royalty Relief Act was designed to encourage exploration and development in the deepwater portions (greater than 200 m) of the Gulf of Mexico and seems to have accomplished that goal. During the time period of the Act (1995 through 2000), GOM activity has increased markedly compared to the pre-1995 time period. Oil production totaled an estimated 1000 million barrels last year, up from about 300 million barrels per year earlier in the decade of the 90s. Deepwater gas production increased at rates of 47%, 51% and an estimated 40% in the years 1998 to 2000. Former acting director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Carolita Kallaur has stated3 \"Deepwater royalty relief for new leases has contributed to the record-breaking lease sales....a clear signal that the Gulf of Mexico is one of the world's leading oil and natural gas plays.\"</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In the fall of 2000, Advanced Resources International conducted a study using its model of the resource base, discovery, development, infrastructure and economics to examine the potential benefits to the Nation of continuance of the terms of the Royalty Relief Act relative to the absence of the royalty relief. This paper presents the results of that study.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Model Overview.</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Advanced Resources developed the Natural Gas &amp; Crude Oil Capacity and Production Model to assess discovered and undiscovered natural gas and oil resources and production for the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (Central and Western Planning areas, Fig. 1) and as a useful tool for examining oil and gas supply issues.

The empirical research involved a series of semi‐structured interviews with UK, European and US based manufacturers, retailers, government bodies, and service organisations. Respondents ranged from experienced users of e‐procurement to organisations just starting out on their pilot investigations of the contribution of Internet trading to their purchasing efficiency. The impact on supply chain configuration of greater information transparency may be posited to be one which will lead to increased outsourcing, improved procurement processes and more strategic management of MRO purchases.</jats:p>",

These results are discussed in view of the dyadic relationship with buyers, leading to the identification of elements that help to formulate an explanation for the recent path of buyer‐supplier relations in the Brazilian automotive industry.</jats:p>",

This article surveys that literature in the years 1987 through 1997 from published research in all English‐speaking countries. There is general agreement that fill rate, turnaround time, cost and user satisfaction are the four primary criteria for evaluating ILL and document supply. Although there has been increased emphasis on quantifying the performance of ILL and document supply in recent years, this research has been hindered by the lack of standardisation of measurement devices and definitions of terms. Following a discussion of theoretical considerations, recent studies in each of the four main criteria will be examined in separate sections. A supplement to this article, covering the years 1998 through 2000, is in preparation and will be published in the near future.</jats:p>",

The necessary “assets” for effective performance of these roles are identified, in particular those relating to team competence. The findings enrich and significantly develop previous work on network management roles and activities, and their influencing factors.

For a decentralized supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a retailer, we derive the members’ optimal inventory policies under different information sharing scenarios. We show that increasing information sharing among the members in a decentralized supply chain will lead to Pareto improvement in the performance of the entire chain.

This has led to a continuing increase in the usage of this product such that, currently, it is considered to be the driving force for plasma procurement. In recent years, difficulties have been experienced in the supply of this product in various markets.</jats:p><jats:p>While intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have undoubted clinical superiority over intramuscular products for the majority of indications, their use should be tempered with caution. Early clinical studies revealed that the risk of viral transmission from these products was higher than that of the traditional intramuscular presentation. This has had a profound impact on blood transfusion science as it has provided a major impetus for nucleic acid testing (NAT) for viral agents in blood donations. Perhaps less widely appreciated are the pressures which may be felt in blood services as the traditional drivers for plasma procurement – factor VIII and albumin – become secondary to IVIG.

Recently, since about 1960, intensively managed forest plantations have become increasingly common in a number of regions, including North America, Latin America, Oceania and parts of Asia. This paper explores some of the forces driving plantation forestry and some of the impacts. The experience of the U.S. is given as a type of \"case study\" of the types of changes that have occurred, and then a broader global discussion is undertaken.

We show in this paper, analytically and through simulation, that the manufacturer's benefit is insignificant when the parameters of the AR(1) process are known to both parties, as in Lee, So, and Tang (LST). The key reason for the difference between our results and those of LST is that LST assume that the manufacturer also uses an AR(1) process to forecast the retailer order quantity. However, the manufacturer can reduce the variance of its forecast further by using the entire order history to which it has access. Thus, when intelligent use of already available internal information (order history) suffices, there is no need to invest in interorganizational systems for information sharing. </jats:p>",

This analysis shows that all the energies which take part in the system operation are more dependent on the wind turbine size than on the battery storage capacity. A storage of 2 or 3 days is sufficient, because an increase in storage beyond these values does not have a notable impact on the performance of the wind hybrid system. Finally, a cost study is performed to determine the optimal configuration of the system conducive to the lowest cost of electricity production. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The chain studied consists of the North American Appliance Division of the Whirlpool Corporation, the Stanley Engineered Components (SEC) division of Stanley Works, Inc. and SEC’s suppliers. Specifically the paper examines the two related questions: first, are there differences in quality definitions between levels of a supply chain? Second, does the higher level entity in the supply chain understand the quality requirements imposed on their suppliers? Examined and written from the point of view of SEC (the middle of the chain), the paper concludes that the definitions and implementation of these definitions differ markedly at each level. Lack of understanding about the effects of quality requirements between levels also prevails. The case also examines why these results occurred.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of carriers that deliver items to geographically dispersed destinations quickly and at a reasonable cost, combined with the low cost of sharing information through networked databases, has opened up new opportunities to better manage inventory. We investigate these benefits in the context of a supply chain in which a manufacturer supplies expensive, low-demand items to vertically integrated or autonomous retailers via one central depot. The manufacturer's lead time is assumed to be due to the geographical distance from the market or a combination of low volumes, high variety, and inflexible production processes. We formulate and solve an appropriate mathematical model based on one-for-one inventory policies in which a replenishment order is placed as soon as the customer withdraws an item. We find that sharing and transshipment of items often, but not always, reduces the overall costs of holding, shipping, and waiting for inventory. Unexpectedly, these cost reductions are sometimes achieved through increasing overall inventory levels in the supply chain. Finally, while sharing of inventory typically benefits all the participants in decentralized supply chains, this is not necessarily the case—sharing can hurt the distributor or individual retailers, regardless of their relative power in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

This claim, however, has undergone limited theoretical development, as well as subsequent systematic empirical testing. As a result, we still have incomplete understanding of the “why” (i.e. the rationale) and the “how” (i.e. the mechanisms by which) of such interaction’s impact on time performances. This study addresses these issues through both model development and empirical analyses of 164 plants. Our analyses suggest two findings. First, when an organization interacts with suppliers and with customers on quality management issues, the organization would improve its time performances indirectly as a result of complete mediation by internal practices for: quality management; low management; inter‐unit coordination; and vertical coordination. On the other hand, when an organization interacts with suppliers and with customers on materials flow management issues, the impact on time‐related performances can either be completely or partially mediated by internal practices.</jats:p>",

The results of this research include a management tool called “ecological supply chain analysis” (EcoSCAn) that is presented here for the first time. Its structure bears a passing resemblance to that used in some streamlined life‐cycle assessments, but its operation and purpose are quite different. The EcoSCAn tool frames a comparative environmental analysis of products capable of performing broadly equivalent functions. The analysis occurs over complete extended supply chains and within defined supply chain stages at a product level and, to some extent, at a site level. The results are mapped with data confidence indicators. A range of tactical and, where data quality is sufficient, strategic supply chain actions are prompted. Actions to mitigate environmental stress are possible in the absence of good quality data across entire product life cycles, although the extent to which management actions are limited is made plain.</jats:p>",

Overall, more than 140,000 and more than 3,000 unique combinations of pesticides with VOCs were detected in two or more samples from the supply and monitoring wells, respectively. More than 400 of these combinations were detected in 20% or more of the samples from the supply wells, whereas only 17 were detected in 20% or more of the samples from the monitoring wells. Although many constituent combinations detected in water from the supply and monitoring wells are similar, differences in constituent combinations also were found and can be attributed, in part, to differences in the characteristics of these two well types. The monitoring wells sampled during this study yield water that typically was recharged beneath a single land-use setting during a recent, discrete time interval and that flowed along relatively short paths to the wells. Public supply wells, in contrast, yield large volumes of water and typically have contributing areas that are orders of magnitude larger than those of the monitoring wells. These large contributing areas generally encompass multiple land uses; moreover, because flow paths that originate in these areas vary in length, these wells typically yield water that was recharged over a large temporal interval. Water withdrawn from public supply wells, therefore, contains a mixture of waters of different ages that were recharged beneath various land-use settings. Because public supply wells intercept water flowing along longer paths with longer residence times and integrate waters from a larger source area than those associated with monitoring wells, they are more likely to yield water that contains constituents that were used in greater quantities in the past, that were introduced from point sources, and/or that are derived from the degradation of parent compounds along extended flow paths.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An 8‐yr time‐series study of the trophic coupling between a pelagic food supply and its utilization by the sediment community was conducted at 4,100‐m depth in the eastern North Pacific between 1989 and 1998. Supply of sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate total nitrogen (PTN) was estimated from collections made with sediment traps moored at 3,500‐ and 4,050‐m depth (600 and 50 m above bottom). Sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC), an estimate of aerobic utilization of organic matter, was measured in situ. POC and PTN fluxes at both depths declined significantly from October 1989 through 1996 then increased in 1998. Organic carbon : total nitrogen (C : N) of the sinking particulate matter fluctuated ~10 throughout the study, except for a major peak (84.8) at 50 m above bottom in summer 1995, indicating lateral advection of organic material of terrestrial origin. POC: SCOC declined progressively over the first 7 yr, from a high of 0.99 in 1989–1990 to 0.22 in 1995–1996. In 1998, there was an increase in POC: SCOC to 0.43, suggesting that the food deficit was reduced by an increase in sinking flux. A continuing deficit in food supply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting the structural and functional characteristics of the sediment community. The importance of undersampling by sediment traps, lateral advection of marine and terrestrial organic matter from the continental slope and shelf, and dissolved organic matter is evaluated. These other sources of nutrients for benthic organisms may be important in explaining some of the observed discrepancy between supply and demand in the abyssal Pacific. Decadal‐scale climate variations that influence marine primary production and terrestrial discharges into the ocean may be extremely important in understanding biogeochemical processes in the deep sea.</jats:p>",
