These are unique theories that inform what level of a concept must be present to achieve a desired level of the outcome. Necessity theories consist of concepts that are necessary but not sufficient conditions for an outcome, where the absence of a single causal concept ensures the absence of the outcome. The theoretical features of necessary conditions have important implications for understanding supply chain management phenomena and providing practical applications. In 2016, Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) became available for building and testing necessity theories with empirical data. However, NCA has not yet been used for the development of supply chain management theories. Therefore, we explain how necessity theories can be built and tested in a supply chain management context using necessity logic and the empirical methodology of NCA. We intend to inspire scholars to develop novel necessity theories that deepen or renew our understanding of supply chain management phenomena.</jats:p>",

Jabil's customers expect a rapid and accurate response to their demand within hours. Previously, Jabil used a series of legacy disconnected planning tools, unsynchronized data required time-consuming manipulation with Excel. Processes were conducted in siloes leading to a “load and chase” approach, which resulted in excess inventory, component shortages and inadequate capacity. The case focuses on one of the Jabil executives, Lizet Tymon (she). Struggling with the issues caused by the disconnected planning tools, Lizet champions implementing a fully integrated suite of services (built on top of the Kinaxis' RapidResponse software platform). The technology solution proposed by Lizet was ultimately implemented across the company, and the project received high marks, and it opened up career opportunities for her. However, it was not a smooth ride at the very beginning.

      "abstract": "<p>The era of modern warfare introduced in World War II presented the Allied Powers with one of the more complicated logistical challenges of the century: how to develop an extensive support network that could supply and maintain a vast military force comprised of multiple services and many different nations thousands of miles away from their home ports. The need to keep tanks rolling, airplanes flying, and food and aid in continuous supply was paramount to defeating the Nazi regime. In this extensively researched book, David Dworak takes readers behind the scenes and breaks down the nuances of strategic operations for each of the great Mediterranean military campaigns between 1942 and the conclusion of World War II on May 8, 1945. Dworak gives readers a glimpse behind the curtain, to show how the vast administrative bureaucracy developed by the Allies waged a literal “war of matériel” that gave them a distinct, strategic advantage over the Axis powers. From North Africa to Southern France, their continued efforts and innovation developed the framework that helped create and maintain the theater of war and, ultimately, paved the path to victory.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the green supply chain, due to factors such as technical level and capital investment, quality uncertainty often occurs. At the same time, manufacturers often know more about the uncertainty than the retailers they serve. To address the concerns raised above, we apply the informed principal model and consider a two-echelon green supply chain consisting of one unreliable manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer, as the principal, has private information about the green degree, while the retailer only knows its prior probability. We first study the underlying model under symmetric information. Then, under the information asymmetry, we construct a low-information-density model and an interim-efficient model. Finally, the numerical comparison results show that our propositions are valid. The results show that the low-information-density model can eliminate the information asymmetry, but it imposes high signaling cost on the high-quality manufacturer. The interim-efficient model can indeed reduce the cost and the distortion of the wholesale quantity. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that there is a specific threshold for the retailer's prior probability. When the prior probability is greater than this threshold, the interim-efficient model is better than the low–information-density model; otherwise, they are equivalent. Simultaneously, the higher the prior probability, the higher the manufacturer’s revenue. If the manufacturer wants to obtain more benefits, he must increase the retailer's trust by operating with integrity and building a brand effect.</jats:p>"

The researcher prefers this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. There are twenty-eight (28) gas manufacturing firms in Kenya according to the Petroleum Institute of East Africa (PIEA) directory in 2021. The unit of analysis was the individual gas manufacturing firms. The unit of observation was five (5) procurement officers from each of the twenty-eight (28) gas manufacturing firms in Kenya. The total number of respondents was one hundred and forty (140). The study in its data collection used questionnaires. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies, and percentages. Inferential analyses were used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable. Results were presented using tables, graphs, and charts&#x0D;\nResults and conclusion: The response rate of the study was 85%. The independent variables reported-value of .775 indicating that there isa perfect relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.6   means that 60% of the corresponding variation in performance of gas manufacturing firms can be explained or predicted by green product design, green distribution, green warehousing and reverse logistics, which indicated that the model fitted the study data.&#x0D;\nThe findings of the study indicated that green product design, green distribution, green warehousing,g, and reverse logistics have a positive relationship with performance in gas manufacturing firms&#x0D;\nPolicy recommendation: The study recommended that gas manufacturing firms should embrace green supply chain management practices so as to improve performance and furtherresearchs should be carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

This provided shorter lines of communication to front lines and greater flexibility to Allied commanders.

While a return to domestic smallholder agriculture may not always be the solution to this problem, there are convincing arguments for a shortening of very long agricultural supply chains and a reduction of hyper-specialization in agricultural production, moving back a lot of food production to peasant agriculture and peasant markets in post-coronavirus capitalism. A reduced degree of specialization in global agricultural production would also help with the second major problem raised by the pandemic, namely the potential spread of zoonotic diseases. Specialized production with large monocultures is more prone to the latter than production for local community support, which often is focused on a variety of products and ecology-friendly inter-cropping.</p>",

This industry has been suffering governmental pressure to achieve sustainability in all industrial processes. The solution is to reorganize the supply chain and rethink the product from the beginning (closed-loop supply chain evolving to cradle-to-cradle supply chain); however, the literature about this process is scarce. This paper presents exploratory research into the automotive supply chain in order to study the processes developed to achieve more sustainable supply chains. A strategic business net is used as theoretical sample to collect data. The results show that climate change concerns and governmental guidelines lead to sustainable organizational culture. It was found that sustainability is integrated in all processes, which affects business interaction with partners. The business interaction is difficulted by total product recycling. To overcome this barrier, innovation strategies, strategic alliances and governmental politics are presented as enhancers to return supply chain policies development. Organizational and cultural elements were presented as difficulties, but could be easily mitigated with the enhancers, alongside commitment and proactivity of companies. The research shows that when the challenges are overcome, the companies can integrate cradle-to-cradle design frameworks into their supply chains. This reorganization is necessary to achieve sustainability and accomplish governmental guidelines.</jats:p>"

Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) established three base sections under the command of BG Arthur Wilson, MG Tom Larkin, and BG Arthur Pence. MG Everett Hughes served as Deputy Theater Commander. The Services of Supply was critically short of manpower, a situation exasperated be the inclusion of free French forces. The rearming of ~300,000 Free French forces was a major undertaking with political ramifications. The chapter concludes with a description of British and German logistics in North Africa.

In the last 5 years, this emerging research field has developed at a rapid pace and, as a result, has attracted great interest from researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners. As there are few studies on the theoretical conceptualization of the circular supply chain (CSC), especially on its definition, this paper aims to fill this gap and to provide conceptual transparency for the CSC framework.

To illustrate this the chapter describes the direct impact each Mediterranean campaign had on SHAEF planning and the conduct of the Normandy (Operation Overlord) landings.

Therefore, the present study investigates the resilience of the Iranian medicine supply chain using the system dynamics simulation method in increasing the level of access to Remdesivir.\r\nMethods: This is a development-applied study to provide a model using the system dynamics approach, which first presents a rich image that is based on the model, and then cause-effect models appropriate to the observations made. It was structured on the behavior of the system and also inspired by valid theories. The effect of key factors affecting the supply chain resilience of the country’s pharmaceutical industry was designed and analyzed using a system dynamics approach using decision support system (DSS) Vensim software. The time horizon considered for this research was 5 years, from 2019 to 2023. To predict and simulate the system dynamics model, the data collected from the questionnaires and the interviews with experts in this field were used.\r\nResults: Based on the result of this study, it can be expected that by reducing the schedule pressure by 1 and 3 % during the time of the study, the resilience of the supply chain of remedesvir in the country upgraded to about 32% and 47%.\r\nConclusions: According to the complexity of health care systems, it is difficult to recognize the interaction of different variables, therefore, the effect of interventions is not immediately recognizable and requires the passage of time. In addition, the majority of the factors influencing health care outcomes are nonlinear. Therefore, the use of simulation models can help to clarify the indirect behavior of complex health care problems.</jats:p>"

The seizure of the ports of Marseilles and Toulon provided the needed capacity. The landings were successful; evidence of preceding Allied experience in the Mediterranean. The landings enabled the Allies to quickly move up the Rhone River Valley, with the 6th Army Group becoming the first Allied formation poised to cross the Rhine. The landings also provided the means to use the French First Army is its homeland. The chapter describes modifications to sustainment command and control, including establishment of the Continental Advance Section and Delta Base Section. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the importance of having a southern line of communication.</p>",

US II Corps operations focus on Tunisia, with the goal of seizing Tunis and capturing or driving Axis forces out of North Africa. Rommel has the early advantage, seen in the battle of Kasserine Pass. However, the Allies are quick to regain the initiative, enabled by an ever-growing logistics system largely supplied by the Eastern Base Section. Rommel and German forces have only limited mobility and firepower due to the lack of fuel and ammunition, leading to an eventual surrender in May 1943. The Allies have secured North Africa, but now must begin looking toward Sicily to continue to the goal of controlling the Mediterranean.</p>",

This research provides a glimpse into the organizational structures that develop supply chain resilience and market performance amid continuous supply chain disruptions. Utilizing psychosomatic variables and empirical modeling, a model was constructed through a review of extant literature and tested with PLS-SEM analysis. Uniquely, this research model is framed with the stimulus–organism–response model; thus, placing a firm within the context of a tumultuous environment where stimuli elicit responses from an organization that behaves as an organism. Results demonstrate that organizational culture plays a critical role in developing supply chain resilience amid supply chain dynamism. Market performance was also developed but only through supply chain resilience; supply chain disruption orientation alone did not improve market performance. Mediation effects highlight the importance of supply chain disruption orientation, a strategic orientation that cements an organization’s ability to develop supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

If this situation eventuates, lack of gas production will impact the competitiveness of WA’s energy-consuming industries. This paper demonstrates that the Perth Basin has the potential to meet this supply–demand gap and augment existing sources of gas over the next 20+ years. A subsurface-led assessment of the Perth Basin’s Reserves, Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources incorporating all recent exploration well results shows that the unrisked resource potential of the Perth Basin is 7052 bcfe (7.475 PJ) 1  with production potential up to 1100 TJ/day. The basis for these estimates will be illustrated with examples, alongside a discussion of the variables that affect the resource assessment, the impact of capacity constraints on the timing of development of Perth Basin gas, and the dynamics of the WA gas market.</jats:p>"

As empirically evidenced in this study, it can be depicted as a latent construct consisting of three distinct dimensions of information custody, information ownership and right to data access. Likewise, the study also indicates that supply chain self-organization, as a second-order construct, consists of three interactive self-organization actions undertaken by specific firms participating in the triadic arrangement. Supply chain self-organization is thus produced by firms that are reciprocally interrelated and interacting, having effects on one another. Furthermore, the study also highlights that information governance creates an environment for applying decentralized information technologies, which then positively affects supply chain self-organization. Finally, the research also empirically operationalizes the construct of network performance within the transitive service triads.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Although the results provide several major contributions to theory and implications for practitioners, the study still demonstrates some methodological constraints.

The primary objective of the control is to keep the inventory levels (state variables) steady at their predetermined values and reduce any deviations to zero in the shortest possible time. The disturbances are induced by demand deviations from the planned/anticipated levels. The replenishment flows are the control variables. Thus, the control action is very similar to a “Linear Regulator with zero set-point”. A novel development in this chapter is the use of direct Operator methods to solve the system Difference Equations, thereby obviating the need for Z-Transforms, block diagrams and transfer functions of classical control theory. This chapter provides a novel application of control theory as well as an easier method of solution.</jats:p>"

The company's strategy must be carried out well, this is very dependent on the company's ability, especially on the supply chain capability. Small and medium enterprises should be able to implement and improve their business supply chains well to have sustainability. Small and medium enterprises have a very limited structure where the level of application of the supply chain form is simple but complex. Measurement of supply chain capabilities is very helpful in carrying out its business processes. The purpose of this research is to ensure the value of the ability and achievement of each company's indicators. In measuring performance, assisted by the Supply Chain Operation Process (SCOR) type 12.0, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to develop the performance appraisal process in decision analysis and the Objective Matrix (OMAX) method for the assessment system. With KPI (Key Performance Indicator) that has been verified, there are 31 matrix indicators. Based on the results of the study, it was proven that the supply chain performance value in the small and medium industries got a value of 7.44 as the productivity index value, which was included in the yellow category. By carrying out improvements to indicators that have a small value, it is expected to help improve supply chain performance in the company</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under fictitious pretexts, Russia has unleashed an unprovoked war against Ukraine that is spreading beyond our country. One of the most tragic consequences of this war is the intensification of the global problem of hunger.  Ukraine and Russia are among the leading suppliers of food to the global market – they account for 25.4% of world wheat exports and 17.6% of coarse grain. Forecasts of declining exports of their grain products have provoked an unprecedented rise in global food prices.  The critical dependence of the global food market on Ukrainian agri-food exports has formed in the segment of sunflower oil – Ukraine accounts for almost 50% of the relevant market. As Ukraine’s share in the structure of global sunflower oil production is 30.6%, it is impossible to find a replacement in the short term. Together with the risks of sanctions restrictions on Russian exports, this led to an increase in world prices for sunflower oil from 1,700 to 2,250 dollars for 1 t.  Many poor countries that are currently facing a catastrophic food shortage are buyers of Ukrainian grain products – until recently, Ukraine was the main supplier of wheat grain to Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan.  Ukraine has been a major supplier of corn grain to China – in 2021 it accounted for 78.3% of Chinese imports of these products. Blocking the export of Ukrainian corn threatens to reduce the number of pigs in China and reduce the production of relevant products.  The resumption of Ukrainian agri-food exports in the previous volumes is possible only if the cessation of hostilities, the return of control over all ports and the unblocking of Azov and Black Sea civilian shipping. Because the possibilities of logistics of transport communications on land do not exceed 1 million tons of grain per month.  There are grounds for restrained optimism about Ukraine’s domestic food security on the following basis:  – the country has stocks of wheat, corn, sunflower oil, basic products for 3-5 years;  – according to various forecasts in Ukraine this year is expected to produce cereals and legumes, technical and other crops in sufficient quantities for domestic food supply;  – the forced sharp reduction in exports of Ukrainian grain products may lead to its redirection to the feeding of farm animals and increase meat production in areas where there is no fighting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current business environment, firms are eager to adopt new technology as they witness and perceive more and more successful business applications of new technologies, e.g., Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), Cloud Computing, etc. As one of the disruptive technologies, Blockchain technology (BCT) is now drawing public attention owing to the cryptocurrency phenomenon (e.g., Bitcoin), for which Blockchain serves as the backbone technology. Given certain innovative features of BCT, especially its transparency, traceability, security, efficiency, confidentiality, and immutability, BCT holds out the promise of impacting supply chain operational and financial efficiencies. Recently, the burgeoning of Metaverse and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) has boosted the BCT as state-of-the-art technology to another notch. Motivated by the proliferating adoption of BCT, we conduct a holistic literature review with a focus on the status of research on BCT in the context of Supply Chain Management (SCM). In particular, this Blockchain-centered research reviews the research up to date on the Blockchain application in SCM. It provides holistic review in terms of (1) the functionality of BCT and its salient features; (2) the prevailing and potential applications of BCT; (3) and the business benefits and impact of BCT in SCM. Finally, we substantiate and highlight a variety of research directions.</jats:p>"

The results show that using the proposed approach significantly improves the solution robustness so that the standard deviation of profit, income, and cost is reduced by about 28%, 34%, and 36% on average. However, a more conservative DM, compared to an optimistic DM, faces more income cuts to achieve greater robustness. As far as the managerial implications are concerned, this research can assist the DM in identifying essential trade-offs among risk, cost, profit, income, robustness, and leanness regarding its attitude toward risk. Because a similar change in the level of risk-taking of the DM does not necessarily have the same economic consequences for pessimistic and optimistic DMs. In addition, the proposed decentralized structure dramatically improves the leanness of the network, especially for a pessimistic DM.</jats:p>"

However, in Experiment 2, 3-year-olds were insensitive to supply and demand when comparing situations where demand exceeded supply to a greater or lesser degree. Finally, Experiment 3 revealed a developmental lag in 3-7-year-olds’ understanding of how supply and demand affects goal completion: Children succeeded when contrasting a surplus and a shortage of supply relative to demand at 4;2.

The under voltage has severe impacts on the consumer loads working conditions causing overloading and high transmission losses. The under-voltage limit has been set for voltage below 0.9p.u. The measurement was conducted in the control room for the duration of one week for logging interval of 1-min using Fluke VR1710 that monitors single-phase voltage quality of power network. Long duration variations are considered to be present when the limits are exceeded for greater than 1 minute time lapse. In this paper, the lowest interruption duration recorded was 20 minutes while the number of under-voltage was 41 occurrences. A simple mathematical analysis of power flow deviation was determined for correlation with the frequency disturbances recorded by the equipment. Both measurements and simulation results show that frequency rapidly changes in the network. The lowest and highest frequency vary between (48.7665 Hz to 51.196 Hz) and (48.843 Hz to 51.263 Hz) respectively. Thus, voltage and frequency disturbance statistics vindicate the voltage variation in the site to be within the ±10% limits but the overall performance of frequency monitored in the site violated the operational limits of ± 0.2 Hz (i.e. 49.8 Hz to 50.2 Hz) and ± 0.5 Hz (i.e. 49.5 Hz to 50.5 Hz) for the statutory regulatory. The paper would provide repository data as point of reference for Electric power sector reform act No.6 2005.</jats:p>"

The curves are derived to solve the allocation problem of joint demand. There are three steps in the proposed methodology: Firstly, the optimal release schedule using dynamic programming to solve a long-term operation model is established, from which the suitable forms of target storage curves are identified. Secondly, a simulation and optimization model is built to identify the key points of the curves with the hedging rule based on aggregated reservoir using improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). Finally, synthetic inflow series is used to test and verify the efficiency of the proposed rule. The water-supply multi-reservoir system located in the Liaoning province of China is employed as a case study to verify the effect of the proposed operating policy and the efficiency of target storage curves. The results indicate that the proposed operating policy is suitable to handle the multi-reservoir operation problem, especially for periods of drought. The target storage curves also show improved performance for distribution of system storages.</jats:p>",

Although existing studies examine the diverse antecedents of supply chain agility, most of them primarily focus on the firm’s internal capabilities as antecedents of supply chain agility, and the scope of research is limited to a single country. Based on the relational view of a firm, in this study, we illustrate that the external capability of the firm created by cooperation with supply chain partners can be an important antecedent of supply chain agility. We hypothesize that relational norms (i.e., trust) and cooperative behaviors between supply chain partners (i.e., two-way information sharing with supplier/buyer firms, supply chain coordination) are the sources of supply chain agility. To test the hypotheses, we employ survey data collected from 219 manufacturing firms in the electronics, transportation, and machinery industries in 15 countries. The structural equation modeling indicates that trust has a significant effect on both two-way information sharing and supply chain coordination, which, in turn, positively impacts supply chain agility indirectly. In addition, supply chain coordination directly affects supply chain agility, whereas two-way information sharing indirectly leads to supply chain agility via supply chain coordination.\r\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Why do housing developers voluntarily slow their rate of new housing production when they make money from selling new homes? This question lies at the heart of current academic and political debates about the effect of planning and zoning on housing markets. Any answer must consider the market absorption rate—the rate of new sales that maximises economic gains to property ownership over time. How this rate varies with market conditions, outside of any potential planning constraints, is hard to observe.We propose four new absorption rate metrics; 1) the development rate ratio (DRR), 2) development rate variability (DRV), 3) the delay premium ratio (DPR) and 4) delay premium variability (DPV). We calculate these metrics for a sample of nine approved major Australian housing subdivisions (&amp;gt;3,000 dwellings), showing the enormous variation in the pace of new housing lot supply and gains from delay.The average rate of new housing production is 34% of the maximum rate (DRR) and the minimum rate is just 7% of the maximum (DRV). Total revenue in these sample projects was 82% higher than the counterfactual of setting the price at the start and selling all new lots at that minimum price (the DPR metric). A 204% difference in total revenue was available if all new dwellings were sold at the highest observed price rather than the lowest price over the project life (the DPV metric).</p>"

The exponentiation conversion circuit multiplies the logarithmically converted input signal by a power exponent value to perform exponential conversion. As a result, we can obtain the power function characteristic of a power exponent value. This circuit is a small-scale circuit that utilizes the exponential characteristics of the MOSFET subthreshold region. In a conventional circuit, expansion of the signal dynamic range and reduction of the power supply voltage have been an issue. In this paper, it was confirmed by simulation that the signal dynamic range has expanded by optimizing the current density of MOSFETs. In addition, the linearity of the multiplying circuit was improved by feedback produced by the operational amplifier circuits. We proposed reducing its power supply voltage from 6.0 V to 3.3 V by a new multiplying circuit that can eliminate the restriction of maximum voltage gain. Our circuit expands its signal dynamic range from 17.5 dB to 42.7 dB in condition of the power exponent value from 0.50 to 2.0.</jats:p>"

How to promote blockchain technology to improve the efficiency of port customs clearance and logistics transparency has become a hot research question. In this paper, we investigate the value of blockchain-based vertical cooperation led by a port or a shipping company in a one-to-two shipping service competition model. Meanwhile, we discuss consumer surplus and social welfare under different cooperation frameworks. We find that i) investment in blockchain technology can significantly increase the profits of port and shipping supply chain participants. ii) From the point of view of profit, when the investment efficiency of ports and shipping companies satisfies a certain relationship, there is a balanced strategy for both parties to invest in blockchain technology. iii) The more intense the competition for the services of shipping companies on the blockchain nodes, the lower the level of blockchain technology to improve the logistics capabilities of the port and shipping supply chain node companies. iv) From the perspective of maximizing consumer surplus and social welfare, the port’s investment in blockchain technology brings more consumer surplus and social welfare. The abovementioned findings can provide a reference for the daily operations of ports and shipping companies and present decision support for the government to formulate blockchain technology promotion policies.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>India today is racing towards the goal of Net Zero emissions by 2070. To achieve this goal, we need to reduce the use of air-polluting fossil fuels like coal. India today has increased its infrastructure of solar panels substantially. However, the efforts of the public can be a huge factor in this sector. Solar Panels have to be adopted by the people to reduce dependence on energy distributors providing fossil energy. The people who use solar panels for energy need to either connect their supply to a local power grid or maintain huge battery rooms to ensure a stable supply. Battery rooms are not a feasible option hence people choose to connect to the local grid. Solar Energy generated by people sometimes is in excess of their usage. These extra units can be carried forward to the next bill but people are never rewarded for their contribution. With this new system, we would be able to promote the use of solar panels by rewarding users for their contribution to the local energy supply. Energy distributors would reward users with in-app currency for the number of units they generate, these credits then can be used by users to pay their electricity bills or sell the in-app currency to other users for Fiat money. Using the latest blockchain Ethereum Smart contracts technology we can ensure the safety and security of our in-app currency and transactions made between users. A whole new source of passive income can be generated using this system. Keywords: Blockchain, Mining, Solar Power, Renewable Energy, Crypto Wallet, Electricity, Clean Energy</jats:p>"

To improve the economic and green benefits of enterprises, the BPNN algorithm is applied to the green supply chain assisted by intelligent logistics robots. The BPNN algorithm can be used to output the characteristics of different information and optimize the green supply chain according to the input parameters and the influencing factors in the network. Firstly, an evaluation index system is established for selecting suppliers, which includes 4 first-level indicators: operational indicators, economic indicators, green indicators, social indicators, and 14 corresponding secondary indicators. Secondly, the evaluation indicator system is modeled through the BPNN. Finally, using the BPNN model, a supply chain enterprise's selection of cooperative enterprises in Xi'an is taken as the research object and simulation. Finally, the output results of the five alternative enterprises are 0.77, 0.75, 0.68, 0.72, and 0.65, respectively. The enterprise with the highest output results is selected as the cooperative enterprise and the enterprise with the second highest output results as an alternate. The green supply chain model based on the proposed BPNN is scientific and effective through specific simulation experiments. It has certain reference significance for the relevant issues related to subsequent optimization of the green supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kazakhstan is a country in transition experiencing a rapid urbanization process with the highest rate in Almaty, the former capital of the country and the largest metropolis in the whole region. Over the past ten years, the city area has doubled its size. Being a concentration of economic and political power, Almaty attracts people from rural areas and neighboring states. Uncontrolled migration of the population leads to disproportional development of the city with inequality between the center and the periphery of the city. Rapid economic development and city growth led to increased per-capita water use and overall water demand and put pressure on water infrastructure. Such the foothill areas of Almaty, the southern part of the Nauryzbay, Bostandyk, and Medeu districts are experiencing a shortage of water supply due to low productivity, deterioration, or absence of networks and facilities. The city is located at the foothills of the northern Tien Shan Mountains in the valley of 4 rivers: Big and Small Almatinka, Esentay, and Kargaly. Climate change led to severe changes in Central Asia at high altitudes, including two times higher than the global average temperature rise and rapid glacier retreat. Shrinking glaciers supply ample quantities of water in the form of increased glacial runoff, and reduced glacier volume will ultimately result in a decrease in both glacier-fed and total runoff. There is no reduction in streamflow in any catchment or season in the northern Tien Shan. Instead, there is a positive trend in surface water availability.&amp;amp;#160; At the same time, climate change poses the risk of more prolonged recharge of reservoirs and aquifers and may cause exhaustion of this water source that currently provides 70% of water for the city. Therefore, envisioning a long-term sustainable development perspective for a city, water resource efficiency, and climate change adaptation should be addressed together. Thus, our study suggests for the short term to limit the use of strategic groundwater reserves and diversify the water supply sources with a bigger share of surface water to benefit from the melting glacials. If the water allocation from groundwater reservoirs will be reduced and the aquifers will be recharged the water deficit for the city may be postponed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The emerging evidence on the effect of trade policies in global value chains suggests that, in response to such laws, firms may reorganise their supply chains away from countries that commit human rights violations. The German law, by contrast, wants firms to “Stay and Behave”, i. e. to work to improve human rights. The article discusses measures that give a “Stay and Behave” outcome its best chance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Should monetary policy offset the effects of labor supply shocks on inflation and the output gap? Canonical New Keynesian models answer yes. Motivated by weak labor force participation during the pandemic, we reexamine the question by introducing labor force entry and exit in an otherwise canonical model with sticky prices and wages. The entry decision generates an employment channel of monetary policy, and a labor supply shock to the value of nonparticipation in the labor market induces a policy trade-off between stabilization of the employment gap and wage growth. For an adverse labor supply shock, optimal policy dampens the decline in employment to rein in wage growth, which entails a period of higher inflation and a positive output gap. A welfare analysis of policy rules shows that monetary policy should not lean against the employment gap.</jats:p>"

Traceability has the potential to be a game-changer in the industry since it is inextricably linked to product safety and quality. Integrating the semantic web into the food supply chain enhances planning, forecasting, productivity, and competitiveness. Most of the research papers concentrate on conveying knowledge about one food type while neglecting the other food categories. Furthermore, these articles did not represent knowledge about all stages of the food supply chain. This paper proposes and implements a food supply chain ontology.

Twenty-one runners died, and eight were injured in the China Baiyin marathon on May 22, 2021. It’s a typical human life test. The energy equations are combined with the maximum energy supply of Chinese male athletes to study this accident. We analyze the human body’s route slope, travel speed, and heat dissipation under low temperatures in this marathon. The study shows that the large slope and long-distance of CP2 to CP3 section and the low temperature during the competition are the main reasons for the accident. The method of quantifying the slope and temperature and calculating the percentage of athletes’ physical consumption proposed in this paper can evaluate the route design of field marathons. We suggest that the physical energy consumption ratio of 90%, i.e. 315 cal/min/kg, should be taken as the maximum energy supply for Chinese male marathon runners. Dangerous risk zones for wind speed and temperature on dangerous path sections are also formulated for athletes to make their assessments. This paper’s theories and methods can effectively help design the marathon route and determine the race time.</jats:p>"

To solve this question, we asked whether neuronal fueling by glucose or lactate scales differently upon increasing neural computation and cognitive loads. Here, using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, cognitive tasks and mathematical modeling, we show that both glucose and lactate are involved in engram formation, with lactate supporting long-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high stimulation load activity patterns and high attentional load in cognitive tasks, and glucose being sufficient for less demanding neural computation and learning tasks. Overall, these results demonstrate that glucose and lactate metabolisms are differentially engaged in neuronal fueling depending on the complexity of the activity-dependent plasticity and behavior.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>One sentence summary</jats:title><jats:p>Neuronal fueling by lactate versus glucose scales differently according to engram level and memory load.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is being used in many applications, including supply chain management. The primary goal of using a blockchain for supply chain management is to reduce the overall production cost while providing comprehensive security to the system. However, current blockchain-based supply-chain workflow(s) (BSW) are still susceptible to various cyber threats due to evolving business processes of different stakeholders involved in the process. In fact, current BSW protects the supply chain process based on the rules that have been implemented in the corresponding smart contracts. However, in practice, the requirements for the process keep evolving due to several organizational policies and directives of the involved stakeholders; therefore, current blockchain-based solutions fail to protect the supply chain process against attacks that exploit the process-related information that is not protected by smart contracts. Therefore, the goal of this work was to develop a methodology that enhances the protection of BSW against various internal (e.g., Stuxnet) and external (e.g., local data breach of a stakeholder) cyber threats through monitoring the stakeholder business process. Our methodology complements the blockchain-based solution because it protects the stakeholder’s local process against the attacks that exploit the process information that is not protected in the smart contracts. We implemented a prototype and demonstrated its application to a typical supply chain workflow example application by successfully detecting internal and external attacks to the application.</jats:p>"

In this paper, an experimental study is executed to interpret the turbulence flow structure in a mining pit. This research mainly focuses on the fractal dimension of velocity fluctuations and Reynolds shear stress (RSS) of flow in the longitudinal and vertical plane for a mining pit region. The results show that the magnitude of fractal dimension for velocity fluctuation and RSS is smaller in the mining pit than the upstream and downstream of the pit. The large values of fractal dimensions at the pit downstream show an increase in flow roughness. It is found that the Taylor microscale decreases towards the channel bed, and this is because of increasing turbulence dissipation near the bed region. We have observed a significantly lower value of Taylor microscale in the mining pit. The higher value of the Taylor microscale is found far downstream of the pit. Nondimensional turbulence mixing length shows a decrease in the traversing length of an eddy at the far downstream of the pit.</jats:p>",

The daily water consumption graph was used as an indicator of the operation mode of water supply facilities. The procedure of analysis of actual water consumption graphs is the methodological basis of the proposed information technology. It involves the search for hidden regularities in the formation of water consumption and is based on the description of irregularities and the form of daily water consumption graphs. The design of the information technology prototype is performed using a unified modeling language. The functionality and behavior of information monitoring technology is described using a use case diagram. A structured database is the information basis of information technology. It contains a structured set of initial data on daily water consumption graphs, the results of the description of their irregularities and shapes, the results of the classification of daily water consumption graphs and a formalized description of the analysis results. A relational data model was used to construct the database. The developed database contains twelve tables. Relationship between tables is defined as «one to many». Implementation of monitoring on a regular basis will ensure the accumulation of new data. The integration of the developed prototype database and information technology into the information system for monitoring the functioning of the water supply system will help to identify new knowledge about the peculiarities of the formation of the water consumption mode.

Companies use many Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that also include SCM functionalities. As a result, the selection of the right system to be used in the enterprise is a complex problem. The use of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods provides the possibility of system ordering in a ranking, based on an asymmetric preference relation, symmetric indifference and incomparability relations. The aim of the article is to evaluate ERP systems in terms of their support for SCM. The scientific contribution of the article is the study of the impact of various degrees of uncertainty of the decision-maker’s preferences on the evaluation results and the analysis of the impact of various approaches to the preferences of alternatives on the final ranking. An approach based on MCDA Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) was used for the study. The decision model uses 12 criteria, three different preference functions and two variants of the PROMETHEE method (I and II). In this way, a total of six rankings were built, and each of them includes seven systems, supporting the management of the supply chain. As a result of the study, it was found that the highest functionality in logistics is characterized by the Oracle E-Business Suite system, which is more functional than SAP ERP and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. The remaining analysed systems offer much less functionality. The applied approach, which was possible with the use of various preference functions, allowed three different levels of uncertainty in the preferences of decision-makers to be taken into account in the study. Moreover, the application of two different variants of the PROMETHEE method made it possible for the obtained solution to take into account the uncertainty of positions taken by individual ERP systems in the final rankings.</jats:p>"

Various research approaches emerge from different scholarly backgrounds, but the interrelation of research areas and current trends has not been adequately considered in a systematic review. We employ a data-driven content analysis approach to examine previous research on blockchain technology in operations management and supply chain management. We investigate the extent to which blockchain technology was considered in scholarly works, structure the research efforts, and identify trends, interrelated themes, and promising research opportunities. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis is conducted on an extensive literature sample of 410 articles. Results indicate an optimistic attitude due to potentials such as tracking and tracing abilities, efficiency increases, and trust-building. Conceptual studies dominate the literature set, with increasing qualitative research efforts. Grand theories are seldomly addressed in the studies. Blockchain technology is outlined as particularly useful when combined with other technologies like IoT. We also identified sustainability implications of the technology, such as enabling transparency for SC stakeholders. Cryptocurrencies can facilitate further efficiency gains if legal uncertainties are reduced. The study is concluded with managerial and theoretical implications and future research opportunities.</jats:p>"

The analysis based on the results of the fieldwork conducted in 2018–2020 comprises both the spatial dimension of the supply chain as well as the number of actors along the products’ route. It is argued here that despite the fact that operating in a shortened supply chain is considered a typical feature of urban agriculture, its benefits depend on local economic, social and spatial conditions, the organization and structure of the supply chain itself, as well as the distance between particular actors and the role they perform. The results of the analysis of diverse cases located in different regions of the world show that the positive effects of bringing food production closer to the place of consumption are indeed not arbitrary and further research regarding the structure of the supply and also value chain is needed.</jats:p>"

Also, it identifies and maps the actors involved in the seed value chain. The paper was based on primary data collected from randomly selected 168 farmers. The result revealed that the adoption rate of improved faba bean seed in the study area at the household level was 23%. It was low mainly due to a lack of access to improved seeds (59.5%) and a lack of awareness about the availability of improved varieties (23%). The average yield of adopters was 13% higher than non-adopters thus reducing the yield gap relative to research fields to 56.6% from 61.6% for non-adopters. They also received an 11% price premium for better seed quality, uniform appearance, and bigger beans of their produce. Farmers’ most important source of planting material was their own saved seed. The formal seed sector supplies only about 2.2% of the seed requirement of faba beans. Hence, own saved seed, community-based seed production, scaling up activities, seed producer and marketing cooperatives and farmer to farmer seed exchange were found to be the main source of a faba bean seed. The study recommends the promotion of improved faba bean varieties, improving access to extension service, strengthening and improving the informal seed system, and linking and integrating all the actors in the chain. The institutional linkage and intensive communication between all stakeholders is also pertinent for technology scaling up and farmers’ easy access to improved seed.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

This type of spillway is attractive for water resource management because it dissipates energy that is within the flow. When energy is dissipated by the steps, it reduces the energy reduction that otherwise must occur at the toe of the spillway. In the present study, nine physical stepped spillway models with slopes of 15, 25, 45° and with a number of steps varying from 5 to 50 have been constructed. The crest of the spillways have standard Ogee profiles and a constant slope extends from the crest to the spillway toe. Two different-sized flumes were used in the experiments (25 and 50 cm wide). Several physical models have been constructed in order to measure the energy dissipation. The purpose of this research is to investigate energy dissipation rate in spillways with different slopes. It was found that the two most important dimensionless factors influencing energy dissipation are the Froude number and q2/(gHdam3). The spillway slope and step number have less impact on the rate of energy dissipation. However, for a constant discharge over a stepped spillway, increasing spillway slope, and increasing the number of steps will increase the energy dissipation. Using multiple regressions, some useful relations for determination energy dissipating are obtained.</jats:p>",

The comparison refers to five different locations based on the Köppen–Geiger classification of climatic zones with the data for energy demand being taken from another publication. It is shown that in locations up to mid-latitudes, the supply container is not only able to power all types of modules all year round but also to provide up to 15 m3 of desalinated water per day for drinking, domestic use and irrigation purposes. This proves and quantifies the possibility of combining basic supply with efficient transport and self-sufficiency by using suitably equipped shipping containers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change is influencing the hydrological cycle on a global scale, and enhancing communities' ability to adapt to these changes is critical for long-term growth and survival. Climate change is expected to have a negative influence on water resources and supply. Other water stresses, such as population expansion, land-use change, growing per capita water demand, and regulatory changes, frequently exacerbate the consequences of climate change. Mitigation will not be enough to minimise the significant repercussions on the water industry, especially in poor nations. The study adopted a cross-sectional survey design. Three counties were randomly selected from Nzoia River Basin for study with Busia representing the lower catchment, Kakamega middle catchment and Trans Nzoia upper catchment. The study was carried out from May, 2017 to September, 2017.A carefully selected team of water and climate change experts consisting of decision makers, practitioners, managers, scientists, technology adopters and other stakeholders were used to identify the five main climate change challenges affecting water supply management in Nzoia River Basin (water scarcity and drought, flooding, water quality effects, unknown climate change risks and disaster preparedness) and the accompanying strategies and technologies for adapting water supply management to climate change through questionnaires, in-depth expert-interviews, brainstorming sessions, field observations and literature review. The adaptation strategies and technologies identification exercise drew from multiple sources of information including the national context where national development plans were used; adaptation technologies proposed in previous documents; technologies currently in use and supported by national water policy; initiatives in the pipeline under the larger water sector; appropriateness of technologies in the local context and the social acceptability among other sources. Stakeholder engagement helps to foster local ownership and buy-in, which is often necessary for long-term project viability. The study has also assessed the level of implementation for the adaptation strategies and the agencies involved. The adaptation strategies were identified and ranked using the total weighted scores as follows: Water storage, Water efficiency and demand management, Water augmentation, Alternative water sources, Water allocation, Urban storm water management, Riverine flood protection, Hazard and risk assessment, Vulnerability assessment, Disaster response, and Early warning. The Total weighted scores under ranking are very close to each other, implying that all the strategies/technologies listed for adapting water supply management to climate change are good. The results of this study provide valuable information that can be used by national and county governments in adapting water supplies to climate change.</jats:p>"

A potential risk is undervoltage for a safety-relevant consumer, which leads to its fault. Therefore, a novel approach is presented in this study, which can predict the minimum terminal voltage for consumers. This consists of diagnostics of the wiring harness and of the lead-acid battery as well as predefined consumer currents. Using simulation, first the beginning of a drive cycle is simulated to determine the state of the powernet, and afterwards a critical driving maneuver is simulated to validate the predicted minimum terminal voltage. It demonstrates that the novel approach is able to predict a fault due to undervoltage. In addition to fulfilling safety requirements, the novel approach could be used to achieve additional availability and miniaturization of powernet components compared to the state of the art.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. For many years, two-component polyurethane coatings have been used as suitable systems for the protection and reconstruction of pipes in the practice of domestic drinking water supply. However, polyurethane can be a source of pollutants entering drinking water. Special attention in the hygienic assessment is paid to the main components of plastic, the released solvents and film-forming agents used in the formulation of the material. However, the definition of only priority components (taking into account Uniform sanitary requirements) does not provide complete information about the chemical stability of polymer materials during the hygienic assessment. Materials and methods. Eight different two-component polyurethane coatings of various manufacturers and manufacturers offered for use in drinking water supply are investigated in the work. The evaluation of these samples was carried out taking into account Uniform requirements (2010). Indicators that are not mandatory for the evaluation of polymer materials used in drinking water supply were also investigated. Results. Conducting a hygienic assessment of two-component polyurethane coatings shows fundamentally different chemicals to migrate into the model environment even from materials with the same type of components. When analyzing water extracts, from 9 to 40 organic compounds were identified at different temperatures. Most of them do not have the maximum permissible levels of their content in drinking water and there are no fully conducted toxicological studies of these chemicals to assess their safety for humans. There also were found three samples, from which inorganic components of cadmium and nickel migrated into distilled water above their maximum permissible values. Limitations. This study was conducted on the example of polyurethane coatings, as a particular example of the use of polymer materials in drinking water supply. It is necessary to conduct similar studies on other groups of polymers. Conclusion. At the moment, there are certain contradictions in the methodology and approaches to assessing the migration of chemicals from polymer coatings to drinking water. Therefore, their refinement and standardization is relevant, taking into account the increasing share of the use of polymer materials in human life.</jats:p>",

Due to the homogeneity of macroeconomic variables, it adopted a vector error correction mechanism (VECM) which shows the existence of long run relationship between money supply and indicators of financing budget deficit. The general findings revealed that external source of financing budget deficit; internal source of financing budget deficit as well as debt servicing has a significant effect on money supply for the period under review in the Nigerian context. Base on these findings, the study recommended that external and internal source of financing budget deficit should be encouraged for effective and increased economic stability in Nigeria and not for political reasons. It should be properly channeled to productive sector of the economy that enhances economic stability.</jats:p>"

The factors affecting supplier selection are obtained through the questionnaire survey of some enterprises. Second, the mutual feedback relationship between the influencing factors of logistics service demand is analysed, and a fuzzy cognitive graph model of the selection process of enterprise logistics service providers is established. Finally, the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) model is used to conduct an empirical study on the choice of logistics service providers. The results show that the ranking results of the three candidate logistics service companies based on FCM are WL1 (0.7233) &gt; WL3 (0.6823) &gt; WL2 (0.6764). When each node of the concept does not affect each other, the ranking result of the three candidate logistics service companies based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is WL1 (0.7265) &gt; WL2 (0.6949) &gt; WL3 (0.6920). The final evaluation result will be affected by the mutual influence relationship between the concept nodes. Overall, the lowest evaluation score is WL2, and the highest is WL1. The most suitable logistics service provider for the enterprise is WL1. The FCM model selected by the manufacturing enterprise logistics service provider is reasonable and feasible. The mutual feedback between evaluation factors affects the selection of logistics service providers in a company. The FCM can get a more accurate evaluation weight value and can realize the optimal choice of logistics suppliers. It provides reference and decision support for other enterprises.</jats:p>",

I test the model using individual panel data from the Survey on Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe. These data allow accounting for expectations about inheritances and retirement in the analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to severe biodiversity and climate crises, there is now a need for sustainable supply chains. Food supply chains contribute to biodiversity loss, especially through land use and agriculture. In addition, energy-intensive storage for refrigeration and intercontinental transportation lead to high emission along chains due to seasonality. Selecting and prioritizing decarbonization actions is a key task for decision makers along food supply chains this decade. Often, modernizing supply chains by integrating information and digital technologies is seen as beneficial for environmental goals. The aim of this work is to develop a new systematization of sustainability measures based on archetypal sustainability strategies (sufficiency, consistency, and efficiency) that support the prioritization and thus the selection of decarbonization measures. Existing measures will be researched through a structured literature review. At the same time, it is recorded how they are categorized or systematized. Forty-eight different systematizations are analyzed. The majority relate to specific sectors and are not generally transferable. Sustainability is often addressed using the triple bottom line. In particular, efficiency and consistency measures are often included in the categories found but are rarely used for systematization. A new systematization of sustainability measures is proposed and applied to a set of digitalization and logistics 4.0 measures using the example of a fresh apple supply chain. The advantages of the proposed systematization are discussed, and further research directions are given. The presented method has not been examined in the literature so far; this concerns both the width and depth of the consideration of supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated the critical success factors for the community management of rural water supplies in the Ohangwena Region, Namibia. Rural communities in Namibia receive water through the Community Based Management (CBM) strategy, which necessitates water governance decentralization, thereby enabling local communities to participate in the management of their water resources. In pursuance of this policy and philosophy, a large number of water point committees have been created nationally. At least half of the existing water points in rural areas in Namibia are faulty and dysfunctional, however, and the majority of people are still struggling to access clean water. The study endeavoured to examine key considerations that have a positive impact on the success of the management of the rural water supply in Namibia, using the Ohangwena Region as a case study. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the study. The findings from the study affirmed that governance, leadership attributes of the committee members, training and capacity building, level of community involvement, coordination and support are critical success factors for effective management of rural water supplies. Finally, a rural water management model was developed, which is anticipated to contribute towards improved management of rural water provision in the study area.</jats:p>"

Though microplastics are primarily found in abundance in oceans, freshwater sources and drinking water are not unaffected. Nevertheless, it is not only the microplastics that are harmful; rather their ability to transport contaminants is another serious issue of concern. The contaminant transport ability is affected by various environmental and physico-chemical parameters of microplastics. Lack of effective and targeted water treatment technologies have led intake of microplastics by humans resulting in a variety of health issues. Even though a few regulatory attempts have been made in the direction of curtailing the production and use of microplastics, there is still a long way to go. This paper focuses on various aspects of microplastics’ presence in drinking water, focusing on their contaminant transport ability, human health risks, removal technologies, and the global scenario of concern.</jats:p>",

Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has increased concerns about the ability to secure the availability of food at stable prices. This article presents a food system resilience framework to promote a national foresight system to better prepare for shocks and disruptions. Our study identified four key elements of resilience: system thinking through science and communication; redundancy of activities and networks; diversity of production and partners; and buffering strategies. Three national means to enhance resilience in the Finnish food system included domestic protein crop production, renewable energy production, and job creation measures. Primary production was perceived as the cornerstone for food system resilience, and the shocks and disruptions that it confronts therefore call for a sufficient and diverse domestic production volume, supported by the available domestic renewable energy. A dialogue between different actors in the food system was highlighted to format a situational picture and enable a rapid response. Our study suggests that to a certain point, concentration and interdependence in the food system increase dialogue and cooperation. For critical resources, sufficient reserve stocks buffer disruptions over a short period in the event of unexpected production or market disruptions. Introducing and strengthening the identified resilience elements and means to the food system call for the preparation of a more holistic and coherent food system policy that acknowledges and emphasises resilience alongside efficiency.</jats:p>"

While plenty of contributions have addressed RMSs from a technological and system-specific perspective since the mid-1990s, the research interest for the strategic potentialities of RMSs at the supply chain level is recent and mainly related to building supply chains’ resilience and sustainability. Despite the interest, methods to support supply chains to strategically exploit RMSs are still missing, while being highly needed. In this paper, a method—consisting of an index to assess machines reusability and a mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm—is provided to support the identification of reusable and reconfigurable machine candidates at the early stage of the strategic network design. The overall method allows machines to be compared based on their reusability and geographical locations. The application of the method, as well as an example referring to the production of emergency devices during the COVID-19 pandemic are reported. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are also discussed, and, among others, strategic parameters related to machines have been identified and elaborated as enablers of supply chain reconfigurability; the proposed method supports practitioners in improving supply chain resilience and sustainability. The method also encourages practitioners towards the development and adoption of reconfigurable machines. Finally, this study also has social impacts for local communities and stimulates customer-centric collaboration among companies belonging to similar industries and sectors.</jats:p>"

Pada suatu kegiatan supply chain mempunyai masing-masing risiko yang dapat memberikan dampak terganggunya aktivitas supply chain sehingga tidak dapat berjalan sesuai target. Hal itu juga yang dihadapi PG X dimana belum ada identifikasi dan mitigasi risiko yang terstruktur dan komprehensif mengenai supply chain sehingga menyebabkan kapasitas giling dari tahun ke tahun belum pernah mencapai target yang telah ditetapkan. Maka dari itu, perlu adanya suatu manajemen risiko yang tepat pada supply chain atau yang sering dikenal dengan Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM).  Adapun tujuan penelitian ini adalah mengetahui faktor yang paling berisiko dan dapat memberikan solusi/usulan strategi mitigasi dalam menangani risiko tersebut. Pada penelitian ini menggunakan metode House of Risk (HoR) yang digunakan untuk mengidentifikasi risiko disepanjang rantai pasok. Pengolahan dengan HOR ini dibagi menjadi 2 fase, yakni fase pertama bertujuan untuk memperoleh urutan prioritas dari sumber risiko yang akan diberi tindakan penanganan dan fase kedua yaitu mendapatkan prioritas aksi mitigasi risiko. Proses pengambilan data dilakukan dengan cara wawancara dan menggunakan metode logika fuzzy dalam pengolahannya. Hal ini karena logika fuzzy mempunyai tingkat toleransi terhadap suatu informasi yang bersifat samar, tidak akurat dan ambigu. Dengan kata lain dapat merepresentasikan hal yang mengandung ketidakpastian. Dari hasil penelitian tedapat 42 kejadian risiko (risk agent) dan 16 penyebab risiko (risk event) yang berhasil teridentifikasi. Terdapat 11 strategi mitigasi sebagai usulan yang dapat dilakukan dalam menangani 9 risk agent prioritas. Dari hasil yang didapat dari penelitian ini tentunya diharapkan dapat menjadi rekomendasi solusi ataupun perbaikan untuk kegiatan supply chain PG X kedepannya.</jats:p>"

In practice, the impact of quality on goodwill does not show an immediate effect, and there is a dynamic delayed effect. Therefore, we developed a dynamic model that considers the delayed effect of quality on goodwill. Firstly, we constructed a delayed differential equation for the effect of quality on goodwill based on the Nerlove–Arrow model for a two-channel supply chain in a competitive environment and studied the dynamic quality decision problem of manufacturers and retailers under the delay effect. Secondly, we constructed the manufacturer and retailer Hamilton functions based on the principles of being of great value, solving and comparing the optimal product quality level, having an optimal service quality level, product goodwill, and overall profit of the supply chain under both decentralized and centralized decision modes, and investigated the effect of delay time on the profit and quality decisions of supply chain members. The conclusions show that: (i) delay time is an important reference for supply chain members when choosing the decision mode, and the overall profit size of the supply chain has different relationships with the different values of delay time taken into account with the two decision scenarios. (ii) Adopting a centralized decision mode can motivate manufacturers and retailers to improve the quality level, which in turn promotes the sales of products and the accumulation of brand goodwill.</jats:p>"

Given the multitude of performance criteria, real-world constraints, and external influences acting upon such a system, even formulating an appropriate research question to address this topic is non-trivial. Here we present an abstraction of a supply and distribution system leading to a minimal model, which only retains stylized facts of the systemic function and, in this way, allows us to investigate the generic properties of robust supply networks. On this level of abstraction, a supply and distribution system is the strategic use of transportation to eliminate mismatches between production patterns (i.e., the amounts of goods produced at each production site of a company) and demand patterns (i.e., the amount of goods consumed at each location). When creating networks based on this paradigm and furthermore requiring the robustness of the system with respect to the loss of transportation routes (edge of the network) we see that robust networks are built from specific sets of subgraphs, while vulnerable networks display a markedly different subgraph composition. Our findings confirm a long-standing hypothesis in the field of network science, namely, that network <jats:italic>motifs</jats:italic>—statistically over-represented small subgraphs—are informative about the robust functioning of a network. Also, our findings offer a blueprint for enhancing the robustness of real-world supply and distribution systems.</jats:p>",

The methodology contains reviewing previous research with a performance evaluation, network analysis, and science mapping to identify the applications, trends, and future research topics. Scientific mapping examines the periods and volumes of publications, authors, journals, countries, regions, organizations, subject areas, and citation analyses. The dataset was obtained with the Scopus database and analyzed using MS Excel and VOSviewer. The search equation identified 335 research papers, which resulted in 131 significant manuscripts on the subject after being screened and filtered. The most notable countries in developing research were Iran, India, China, the United States, Canada, Taiwan, France, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Denmark. Saha, S., Ajay, S.Y., and Baboli, A. were the most cited authors. The journals that publish the most research were Sustainability, the Journal of Cleaner Production, and the International Journal of Production Economics. Some research focuses on reducing carbon emissions and polluting agents applied in different industries in China, Brazil, India, and others. The main findings were the number of industry sectors researching this topic, increasing the number of publications, and promoting the proper use of resources within a sustainable supply chain. There are many investigations of theoretical models that have applications in real-life cases. There is also evidence of the high importance of promoting sustainable development. The emissions regulations in a green supply chain applied to agricultural products have allowed for more actions to achieve responsible production and consumption, as seen in applied research in the pulp and paper industry.</jats:p>"

The World Health Organization estimates that household air pollution from inefficient stoves causes more premature deaths than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS). Increasing demand for energy has led to dramatic increases in carbon emissions. The need for reliable electricity and limiting carbon emissions drives research on Resil-ient Hybrid Energy Systems (RHES) that provide low-carbon energy through combined wind, so-lar, and biomass energy with traditional fossil energy, increasing production efficiency and relia-bility, and reducing generating costs and carbon emissions. Microgrids have been shown as an ef-ficient means of implementing RHES, with some focused mainly on reducing the environmental impact of electric power generation. The technical challenges of designing, implementing and ap-plying microgrids involve conducting a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate these systems' environmental and economic performance under diverse operating conditions to evaluate resiliency. A sample RHES has been developed and used to demonstrate implementation in rural applications. This system can provide reliable electricity for heating, cooling, lighting, and pumping clean water. This paper's primary focus is the challenges of using resilient energy sys-tems in the Middle East.</jats:p>"

Based on a unique value added tax dataset, we construct the firm-level production network of an entire country at an unprecedented granularity and present a novel approach for computing the economic systemic risk (ESR) of all firms within the network. We demonstrate that 0.035% of companies have extraordinarily high ESR, impacting about 23% of the national economic production should any of them default. Firm size cannot explain the ESR of individual companies; their position in the production networks matters substantially. A reliable assessment of ESR seems impossible with aggregated data traditionally used in Input-Output Economics. Our findings indicate that ESR of some extremely risky companies can be reduced by introducing supply chain redundancies and changes in the network topology.</jats:p>"

Global warming and greenhouse effect causes droughts, hunger and starvation among many other health problems. In this research the effect of energy use, economic, growth and renewable energy on carbon emissions in the European Union region from 1990–2019 is examined. The current study differs from previous researches done in this region, in that it specifies in the model “effective capital”, which is the interaction between energy and capital (a product of energy and capital). Effective capital is inevitable in the production process, because physical capital such as machinery, without power or energy to fuel it, is dysfunctional. The current research employs the Generalized Method of Moments which is strong over endogeneity and overcomes heteroskedasticity, serial and autocorrelation problems for robust results. The findings of this research support past studies that renewable energy reduces carbon emissions and Gross Domestic Product exacerbates carbon emissions. Effective capital and energy use are observed to promote carbon emissions, whereas capital and population size reduces carbon emissions in the European Union.</jats:p>"

Thus, timely and powerful planning for reliable oxygensupply and delivery is needed to protect and save lives of people who are in need. Due to the unavailability of a proper channel of acquiring Oxygen during the pandemic, forced people to search for the supply of oxygen through phone calls and various social media platforms. But only few people got reliable suppliers and many could not get their demand satisfied at the right time. Evenhospitals faced the same situation. To combat such problems,in this project we propose a unique system for Oxygen Supply Management to people and hospitals which can meet the crisisin an effective way. In order to overcome the shortage of oxygen in the coming times, this proposed system will be launched as a digital platform to fast-pace the supply chain to both people and hospitals.

Increased incidences of natural disasters and unprecedented COVID-19 have highlighted the significance of improving supply chain resilience (SCR) by divulging its susceptibility to the external events. Additive manufacturing (AM) is envisioned as the disruptive technology that allows layer-wised fabrication and has been claimed to be an important contributor to the improved SCR as it could bring new opportunities through expanded design freedom, improved material efficiency, shortened supply chains, and decentralized manufacturing. Nonetheless, rare research has quantitatively measured the impacts of AM on SCR. To fill this research gap, the indices for assessing SCR of AM-enabled supply chains (AM-SCs) are first proposed, and then, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to derive a quantifiable SCR score that can be used to measure the performance of different SCs. A case study of a gas pedal assembly is presented with three different SC configurations: the original assembly with conventional manufacturing, original assembly with AM, and redesigned assembly with AM. The exploratory study shows that the redesigned assembly with AM considerations could improve the SCR by 200%. Sensitivity analysis also revealed that part count and reaction time of suppliers are influential factors of improving SCR. Last, challenges and limitations of the proposed framework are also deliberated upon alongside future research scope.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we study the role of supply chain process integration in developing analytics capability, and we further examine the role of analytics capability and employees’ analytics skills in improving firm performance. Survey data collected from 240 supply chain top- and middle-level managers show that supply chain process integration enhances firms’ analytics capability. However, analytics capability alone is not sufficient in improving firm performance; it must be complemented with employees’ analytics skills. These findings extend the current literature on supply chain analytics and provide guidance and insights to supply chain managers for their analytics capability investments.</jats:p>"

Fashion is an industry that is highly vulnerable to sustainability disruptions and, at the same time, as a fertile ground for SOIs. As a result of increasing pressures from the market, several fashion brands have started to recognize the potential of SOIs to induce a positive transformation for the whole supply chain. The present paper discusses the case of a SOI in the leather industry by analyzing the perception of different actors in the leather‐accessories supply chain with three theoretical lenses. Findings suggest that focal companies should pay attention to how to manage their business relationships with supply chain actors and leverage positive and collaborative relationships rather than using coercive methods to extend sustainability along the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Through a comparative study of the actors that make up the so-called “management fashion arena” around HRT in the Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden, and Denmark), the study provides insight into how the national actors influence and shape the diffusion of popular management concepts. The study shows that there are both similarities and differences between how the supply side is configured in the three countries. For example, large consulting firms have played an influential role in all three countries, while the influence of actors such as business schools and professional organizations varies considerably between the countries. The findings also suggest that there are powerful alliances between actors involved in the diffusion of HRT.

The fundamental goal of mobility in distribution network management is to increase the total value of each shipment, as evaluated by user satisfaction. This indicates that human resources reduction and efficiency must be coupled in order to maintain a state of customer satisfaction. The main Objective of this research paper is to understand and study the Scenario of logistics before pandemic and after pandemic, before pandemic majority of the transport was dependent upon major suppliers in the market and now the companies are looking for alternatives and make transportation of goods simpler. The other objective is to see how people around the world realised the importance of logistics in their life, as if transportation is not done via proper channels the supply of goods will get affected which will directly affect the consumers.\nPost Pandemic we saw how important is logistics in our life, if we don’t have proper logistics system the supply chain of products around the world gets affected, industries such as pharma, chip manufactures suffered a lot as ships and planes were not available to ship out the products on time, which led to disruption of the market place, and we still can see its after effects as when the transportation was not available factories stopped manufacturing goods and laid if 1000s of people which later led to shortage of goods worldwide. Based on the study the covid 19 examination of the supply chain ecosystem provides a foundation for further research employing a transformative lens. Earlier people were not aware of the supply chain and its management but during pandemic due to disruption caused in the supply chain leads the unavailability of the products at the market and also the drastic rise in the demand post pandemic realized everyone that supply chain and logistics is very much important for the availability of the products and smooth flow of goods in the market place.\nKEYWORDS: COVID-19, Supply Chain, Logistics, Pandemic, E-Commerce, Sustainable Logistics, supply chain disruptions, supply chain recovery.</jats:p>"

Based on previous studies, this paper considered a supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer in an uncertain demand market. The effects of demand randomness and different carbon policies on carbon emission reduction level and optimal decision in supply chain were studied by constructing mean-variance utility function and Stackelberg game. Due to the difficulty of data acquisition, this paper verified the equalization results by numerical simulation. The results show that: (1) cap-and-trade policy, government subsidy policy and carbon tax policy can promote the carbon emission reduction investment of supply chain, while carbon tax policy will lead to the decline of the overall profit of supply chain; (2) For the manufacturer and the retailer, adopting a strategy with a low degree of risk avoidance will increase its own profits; (3) For the supply chain as a whole, it is more advantageous for manufacturers to adopt higher risk avoidance strategies, while retailers to adopt lower risk avoidance strategies. In addition, in the conclusion, this paper puts forward management implications related to stakeholders, thus providing help for the development of sustainable supply chain.</jats:p>"

The study employed a descriptive research design, targeting heads and deputy heads of procurement in parastatals. The researcher prefers this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analyzed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. A multiple regression model was used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 to generate information which will be presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.&#x0D;\nResults and conclusion: The response rate of the study was 91% .The independent variables reported R value of 0.846 indicating that there was perfect relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.715 means that 71.5% of the corresponding variation in performance of parastatals in Kenya can be explained or predicted by (triangle approach, twenty/eighty approach, spend categorization method and competency staircase method) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β=0.715), p=0.000 &lt;0.05).The findings of the study indicated that triangle approach, twenty/eighty approach, spend categorization method and competency staircase method have a positive relationship with performance of parastatals in Kenya.&#x0D;\nPolicy recommendation: The study recommended that parastatals should embrace vendor base optimization and rationalization so as to improve performance and further researches should te carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

For this reason, much effort in the last year has been devoted to the development of integrated and innovative Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chains management systems, which should be responsible, in addition to track and store orders and deliveries, to guarantee transparency and traceability of the food production and transformation process. In this paper, differently from traditional supply chains which are based on centralized systems, we propose a fully distributed approach, based on blockchain technology, to define a supply chain management system able to provide quality, integrity and traceability of the entire supply chain process. The proposed framework is based on the Hyperledger Fabric technology, which is a permissioned blockchain system: a prototype has been developed and, by using some use cases, we show the effectiveness of the approach.</jats:p>"

Such information is changing dynamically, so it is unrealistic to expect such information to be readily available, especially in channels with production capacity limits. In “Conveying Demand Information in Serial Supply Chains with Capacity Limits,” Kapuscinski and Parker show that local information alone is sufficient to effectively manage inventory in capacity-limited supply chains. In supply chains with capacity limits, the retailer does not faithfully pass the demand information to her supplier but sends censored information in her order. Despite censoring, these orders contain sufficient information for the modified echelon base-stock policy, a full-information policy, to be mimicked. They provide evidence using numerical experiments and analytical bounds that the modified echelon base-stock policy performs superbly. Also, they describe information requirements used in supply chain literature and demonstrate that with an incentive-compatible mechanism, similar to Lee and Whang (2000), local managers will follow the centralized inventory policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply and demand are the most discussed issue in the world including in Indonesia. Java with the largest population and center for industrial and agricultural activities in Indonesia faces problems in water availability and water demand. This condition illustrates the potential of Java to experience water scarcity. This study analyzes water status in Java using the water balance approach and Water Scarcity Index. The analysis was carried out to evaluate changes in the annual water balance during a period of the 10-year average (1981-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2010). The rainfall data from CHIRPS and air temperature from CRU were used to calculate water availability. Water demand is calculated for the domestic, industrial, agricultural, and environmental sectors based on Indonesia water use standards. The results indicate that the average water availability in Java varies in each period. The highest water availability occurred in 1981-1990 (160 billion m3/year), while the lowest was in 1991-2000 (149 billion m3/year}. The water availability decreased from 1981 to 2010, on a per capita basis. The water scarcity index also changes every period. The area experiencing a water deficit as described by their water scarcity index as a very critical class. Moreover, DKI Jakarta and East Java Provinces are in very critical condition with more than 50% area. Based on the study results, evaluation of water balance and water scarcity index can be used to describe the water status in a certain area as the reference for decision-makers in determining programs in water resources management.Keyword: Water status, water balance, water resources management, water scarcity, spatial analysisAbstrakKetersediaan dan kebutuhan air merupakan isu yang paling banyak dibahas di dunia termasuk di Indonesia. Pulau Jawa merupakan salah satu pulau dengan jumlah penduduk terbesar di Indonesia, sekaligus sebagai pusat kegiatan industri dan pertanian juga menghadapi masalah tidak hanya pada ketersediaan air tetapi juga dalam kebutuhan air. Kondisi ini menggambarkan potensi Pulau Jawa mengalami kelangkaan air. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengevaluasi status air di Pulau Jawa menggunakan pendekatan neraca air dan water scarcity index (WSI). Analisis dilakukanÂ  untuk mengevaluasi perubahan neraca air tahunan Pulau Jawa dalam setiap periode rata-rata 10 tahunan (1981-1990, 1991-2000, dan 2001-2010). Penelitian ini menggunakan data curah hujan dari CHIRPS dan suhu udara dari CRU untuk menghitung ketersediaan air. Kebutuhan air dihitung untuk sektor domestik, industri, pertanian, dan lingkungan dari standar penggunaan air Indonesia. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan ketersediaan air rata-rata Pulau Jawa jumlahnya berbeda-beda setiap periodenya. Ketersediaan air tertinggi terjadi pada periode 1981-1990 (160 miliar m3/tahun), sedangkan terendah pada periode 1991-2000 (149 miliar m3/tahun). Dilihat secara perkapita, ketersediaan air Pulau Jawa mengalami penurunan (1981-2010). Selain kondisi defisit air yang mengalami perubahan setiap periodenya, kondisi tingkat kekritisan air wilayah juga ikut berubah setiap periodenya. Kabupaten/kota yang mengalami defisit air menggambarkan tingkat kekritisannya berada dalam kelas sangat kritis. Sebagian besar (&gt; 50%) wilayah Provinsi DKI Jakarta dan Jawa Timur berada dalam kondisi sangat kritis. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, evaluasi neraca air dan indeks kekritisan air dapat digunakan untuk menggambarkan status air di suatu wilayah yang mampu menjadi referensi pengambil kebijakan dalam menentukan prioritas program dalam pengelolaan sumberdaya air.Kata Kunci: Status air, neraca air, pengelolaan sumber daya air, tingkat kritis air, analisis spasial</jats:p>"

This paper aims to generate groundwater vulnerability map using two models: DRASTIC and Susceptibility Index (SI) associated with the geographic information system (GIS) of El Asnam plain aquifer. The validation of these models to pollution was performed by comparing the nitrate distribution across the area with the classes of vulnerability and has proved that the SI model is the more valid one with 50% of the study area. Considering these results, the SI model may serve as an effective means to help the protection of groundwater and can eventually be used by decision makers and groundwater managers.</jats:p>",

The main objective of the article is to explore and explain the role of staff exchange activities as a factor integrating the SC as well as projections of directions for development. In the research process 1232 enterprises from Poland, EU were included; 500 of them declared the occurrence of staff exchange activi-ties in the SC; 732 enterprises denied such situation. The considerations in our study on the role of such activities in the context of SCI indicate the need to recognize the fact that they are an important factor of SCI.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We study a supply chain in which a supplier sets the wholesale price and a retailer responds with an order quantity. Both of the two firms can be either risk-neutral—maximizing the expected profit—or target-oriented, which is to maximize her or his ability to reach a target profit. Academic/practical relevance: Our work not only sheds light on the benefit/loss of trading with target-oriented decision makers but also, adds new knowledge to the supply chain coordination literature. Methodology: We provide strong support for firms’ target-based preference and the linear target formation model through a survey as well as analyzing company data. With the firms’ target-oriented behavior evaluated by a CVaR-satisficing measure, we apply a game theoretical framework to investigate how the target-based preference affects supply chain performance. Results: A firm, be it a supplier or a retailer, is always hurt by its target-based preference but can benefit from its trading partner’s target-based preference. A risk-neutral supplier, for example, can sometimes reap the whole supply chain’s profit if the retailer is target-oriented, and a target-oriented supplier always performs better with a target-oriented retailer than a risk-neutral one. Furthermore, a target-oriented retailer and/or supplier can help alleviate the double-marginalization effect and with a specific target, can help the supply chain achieve the same efficiency level as in a risk-neutral centralized system, with just a wholesale price contract. Another important finding is that if both firms are target-oriented, then the supply chain can have a higher expected profit under a decentralized system than a centralized one. This contrasts with the case when both firms are risk-neutral. We also investigate the role of outside option and retailer-type misidentification and find that both can alleviate the retailer’s disadvantage of being target-oriented. Managerial implications: (i) The target-based preference can be exploited by the trading partner, and hence, a firm should adopt the target-oriented decision criterion with caution. (ii) A target-oriented retailer can explore strategies such as revealing his outside option or hiding his target-based preference in order to be less manipulated. (iii) Whether a firm (and the supply chain) can benefit from its trading partner’s target-based preference often depends on how ambitious the trading partner (and the firm itself if it is target-oriented) sets the target. (iv) Target-based preference of one or both firms can help the supply chain reach the first-best efficiency. (v) When both firms are target-oriented, decentralization can be preferred to centralization. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: With heightened global uncertainty, supply chain managers are under increasing pressure to craft strategies that accommodate both supply and demand risks. Although product flexibility is a well-understood strategy to accommodate risk, there is no clear guidance on the optimal flexibility configuration of a supply network that comprises both unreliable primary suppliers and reliable backup suppliers. Academic/practical relevance: Existing literature examines the value of flexibility with primary and backup suppliers independently. For a risk-neutral firm, research shows that (a) incorporating flexibility in a primary supplier by replacing two dedicated ones (in absence of backup supply) is always beneficial and that (b) adding flexibility to a reliable backup supplier (in absence of product flexibility in primary suppliers) is always valuable. It is unclear, however, how flexibility should be incorporated into a supply network with both unreliable primary suppliers and reliable backup suppliers. This research studies whether flexibility should be incorporated in a primary supplier, a backup supplier, or both. Methodology: We develop a normative model to analyze when flexibility benefits and when it hurts. Results: Compared with a base case of no flexibility, we prove that incorporating flexibility in either primary or backup suppliers is always beneficial. However, incorporating flexibility in both primary and backup suppliers can be counterproductive because the supply chain performance can decline with saturated flexibility, even if flexibility is costless. A key reason is that the risk-aggregation effect of consolidating flexibility in an unreliable supplier becomes more salient when flexibility is already embedded in a backup supplier. Managerial implications: This research refines the existing understanding of flexibility by illustrating that flexibility is not always beneficial. When there is a choice, a firm should prioritize incorporating flexibility in a reliable backup supplier. </jats:p>",

Amid this Mechanical Transformation, modern advances enormously amplified the efficiency of laborers, whereas fossil fills pushed fabricating and industrialization frameworks distant past the characteristic limits of human and creature control. As these progresses drove the fetched of Chemical and mechanical generation down, utilization of waste and merchandise skyrocketed around the world. Sustainability and natural concerns have been critical subjects of discourse in recent decades. Green supply chain administration guarantees the adequacy of open and company policies in greening their operations, expanding the advertise share, progressing the company picture and reputation, and expanding benefits. The objective of this article is to propose a conceptual framework that considers measurements, categories, and hones in green supply chain administration.&#x0D;\nMethodology: After an extensive survey of the writing, we distinguished models and a set of green measurements, categories, and practices utilized for green supply chain administration. This research will clarify the impact and necessity of green supply chain, the revolution of how industrialization transformation was and how it revolutionized people's lives. We'll at that point ponder steps and methods needed to control waste amidst the intention to expand industrialization. We will look at the 6R’s in waste Management. Will focus on the impact of 4.0 industrial revolutions and its impact on economic development.&#x0D;\nFindings: This study found that the impact of implementation of GSCM practices differs with respect to cost, profit, waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission.

We construct a bottom-up GHG inventory of China’s food system from farm to fork for the period 1990–2018. The decomposition method is used to assess regional differentiated drivers. GHG emissions reduced by 6.8% between 1990 and 2000 due to energy structure changes in East, Central and Southwest China. They then increased by 2.3% (2001–2010) because of rapid economic growth. Further large increases of 13.1% (2011–2018) were driven by growing consumption expenditure and GHG-intensive food consumption. In 2018 total emissions from China’s food system, including supply chains, was 1.55 Gt CO2e yr-1 (95%CI 1.07-2.03 Gt CO2e yr−1). Scenario simulation shows that demand- and supply-side synergies can offset emissions increases from high-quality protein food demands. Results demonstrate the importance of supply-side production spatial optimization and green source food importation for mitigating GHGs emissions.</jats:p>"

Crowdsourcing deliveries can provide the additional capacity needed to meet the growing demand in a cost-effective way. We introduce a setting where a crowd-shipping platform sells heterogeneous products of different sizes from a central depot. Items sold vary from groceries to electronics. Some items must be delivered within a time window, whereas others need a customer signature. Furthermore, customer presence is not guaranteed, and some deliveries may need to be returned to the depot. Delivery requests are fulfilled by a fleet of professional drivers and a pool of crowd drivers. We present a crowd-shipping platform that standardizes crowd drivers’ capacities and compensates them to return undelivered packages back to the depot. We formulate a two-stage stochastic model, and we propose a branch and price algorithm to solve the problem exactly and a column generation heuristic to solve larger problems quickly. We further develop an analytical method to calculate upper bounds on the supply of vehicles and an innovative cohesive pricing problem to generate columns for the pool of crowd drivers. Computational experiments are carried out on modified Solomon instances with a pool of 100 crowd vehicles. The branch and price algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 100 customers. We show that the value of the stochastic solution can be as high as 18% when compared with the solution obtained from a deterministic simplification of the model. Significant cost reductions of up to 28% are achieved by implementing crowd drivers with low compensations or higher capacities. Finally, we evaluate what happens when crowd drivers are given the autonomy to select routes based on rational and irrational behavior. There is no cost increase when crowd drivers are rational and select routes that have a higher compensation first. However, when crowd drivers are irrational and select routes randomly, the cost can increase up to 4.2% for some instances. </jats:p>",

Products counterfeiting can be detected in consumer goods such as clothing, food and beverages, accessories, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and luxury goods. The continuous violations in the supply chain have led to the need for mobilization of all involved stakeholders to overcome counterfeiting challenges. Effective traceability seems to be the only way to combat this phenomenon, ensuring safe and sustainable supply chain operations. This paper presents a structured literature review on traceability approaches for combatting the product supply chain counterfeiting phenomenon that led to forming a structured classification framework. The performed analysis aims to identify trends and good practices and can be used as a guideline for real-life projects against supply chain counterfeiting. The results show that traditional traceability methods are not effective as they can be easily falsified using today’s technological advancements. However, these same advancements also present valuable technologies such as blockchain and the internet of things to ensure safe and sustainable supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based virtual organization model for the coordination of the forward and backward supply chain. The results obtained through virtual organization model are also compared with the centralized supply chain and traditional cost-sharing contract.

To address the issue of food waste in AFSC, this study identified the sources of food waste and proposed corrective measures for the local farming industry.

Lack of cold storage and improper handling and packaging of products have been found to have a negative impact on the distribution process in developing countries. In this regard, a well-designed supply chain strategy, network design, and information system can alleviate these issues.

A major factor in achieving this goal is transitioning to renewable fuels. This implies a challenge, as not only ship-innovative solutions but also a complete low-carbon fuel supply chain must be implemented. This work provides a method enabling the exploration of the potential of low-carbon fuel technologies for specific shipping routes up to larger sea regions. Several aspects including vessel sizes, impact of weather and shipping routes, emissions savings and costs are considered. The local energy use is determined with proven bottom-up prediction methods based on ship positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in combination with weather and ship technical data. This methodology was extended by an approach to the generation of a basic low-carbon fuel system topology that enables the consideration of local demand profiles. The applicability of the proposed approach is discussed at hand via a case study on Roll-on/Roll-off passenger and cargo (RoPax) ferries transitioning from conventional fuels to a compressed hydrogen fuel system. The results indicate a potential reduction in emissions by up to 95% and possible system sizes and costs.</jats:p>"

Achieving a higher degree of SCEE can involve assimilating entrepreneurial practices by copying entrepreneurial firms’ behavior, allying with entrepreneurial firms to gain access to and learn from them, and acquiring entrepreneurial firms to bring their practices inside the firm. Because SCEE appears to be a pathway to enhanced firm performance, enhancing SCEE should be attractive. However, our thesis is that efforts to do so may be undermined by cognitive biases—heuristics used by the human mind to simplify complex situations that result in distorted thinking. We explore the possible problems arising due to 11 cognitive biases discussed by Schwenk (<jats:italic>Strategic Management Journal</jats:italic>, 1984, 5(2), 111). We offer two brief case examples of companies that are seeking to make their supply chains more entrepreneurial; each illustrates several of the biases in action. We also consider whether supply chain complexity and entrepreneurial orientation can mitigate or strengthen cognitive biases’ harmful effects on SCEE. In doing so, we construct an important interface across entrepreneurship and supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the hypothesis that potassium (K) supply, which is known to substantially affect plant development and function, affects the secondary metabolism of the cannabis plant. Two cultivars of medical cannabis were grown in controlled environment conditions, under five levels of K supply: 15, 60, 100, 175, and 240 mg L−1 K. The results revealed that the development and function of plants that received the low K supply of 15 mg L−1 K were impaired, as the plants suffered from visual chlorosis, and the inflorescence yield was reduced in both cultivars. Plants that received higher K inputs in the range of −175 mg L−1 K demonstrated optimal plant function and high yield, and one cultivar demonstrated over-supply symptoms under the high K level of 240 mg L−1. The concentrations of most cannabinoids and terpenoids declined with the elevation of K supply, thus supporting the hypothesis. As secondary metabolite concentrations decreased with the increase in K supply, and higher K levels had no positive effects, 60 mg L−1 K is the suggested application level to maintain high function and yield combined with high secondary metabolism.</jats:p>"

Problems in clean water services by Regional Public Water Supply Utility Makassar City continue to occur after these changes, so this research is directed to know responsiveness, responsibility, and accountability which are three important indicators in realizing quality clean water services. The qualitative research method was chosen by the author because it can make it easier to describe and express perceptions according to research data obtained from interviews, literature studies, and observations. The results of the study show that the lack of responsiveness by the Regional Public Water Supply Utility of Makassar City in clean water services is caused by the minimum number of employees. Responsibility by the Regional Public Water Supply Utility in providing services can be realized through the provision of communication facilities and easy service procedures, as well as responding to employee complaints. However, the inaccuracy of employees in carrying out their duties makes the accountability of clean water services have a bad assessment among the community.</jats:p>"

Historically, the uptake of OPS has been low, and research indicates that potential OPS adopters face multiple complex barriers. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper presents a framework for categorizing barriers and drivers to the implementation of OPS and identifies potential areas for future research. The review indicates that research on barriers to OPS was limited until 2019, when interest increased considerably, coinciding with mounting stakeholder concerns and regulatory pressure. The suggested framework divides barriers and drivers divided into four key categories: (i) technology and operations, (ii) institutional elements, (iii) economic elements, and (iv) stakeholder elements. The framework then superimposes those categories on three main areas of concern: port, transmission, and vessel. Research has identified potential solutions to specific barriers, but the complexity of OPS highlights the need for a collaborative approach to OPS. Additionally, as regulatory pressure is rising, more research is needed on the systemic implications of OPS as well as the potential use of incentives, pricing, and business models to tackle the high cost of implementation.</jats:p>"

Analysis of hydrographic features and ecological condition of water bodies of the Ternopil city, coverage of problems of pollution of the reservoir, quality of water in the Seret River and the main water intakes of the city\n\nMethods. Generalization and systematization, descriptive, SWOT-analysis, cartographic, geoinformation, geochemical assessment of the ecological status of water bodies of the city.\n\nResults. Generalization and systematization of data on the hydrographic network of the Ternopil city, allows us to state the fact that the main water bodies of the city is the Seret River – 242 km long (within the city 1.8 km) and the basin area 3900 km2; reservoir – an area of 300 hectares, nameless right tributary and canalized left tributary of the Seret River – the Rudka. The ecological condition of the Seret River within the city of Ternopil can be assessed as unsatisfactory. The main geoecological problems of the river are construction within the the coastal protection zone, water pollution by solid waste, exceeding the maximum allowable concentrations of suspended solids, sulfates, chlorides, nitrates and petroleum products. Environmental problems of the Ternopil reservoir are water pollution by chemical compounds of ammonium nitrogen, petroleum products, suspended solids and total iron; high siltation and pollution of the bottom sediments of the reservoir with heavy metals and mobile forms of biogenic elements. Water supply in the Ternopi cityl is carried out from two water intakes - Biletsky and Verkhnyo-Ivachivsky. Verkhno-Ivachivsky water intake is located at a distance of 3 km from the city landfill in the village of Malashivtsi. In the last few years, the process of drilling and using private artesian wells with a depth of more than 50 m has become widespread in the city. According to the results of the analysis, installed compliance with sanitary requirements of water samples in these wells, pH in all samples within normal limits (6,5-8,5).\n\nConclusions. Current trends in climate change and the growth of anthropogenic pressure on water bodies, increases the risks of degradation and changes in some components of the hydrographic network of the city. In Ternopil, it is necessary to modernize the centralized water supply system, reconstruct rainwater collectors and strengthen control over unauthorized discharges into surface water bodies. It is also worth designing another water intake for the city in environmentally secure conditions.</jats:p>",

In particular, elderly people have special demands on the UGS quality. It is essential to know these demands to create an equitable UGS supply. We present an approach to determining some qualitative aspects and the supply of cultural ecosystem services of diverse forms of UGS. This is realised by combining user demands with actual UGS features. In a concrete example, we assessed the UGS quality and supply for both the general population and the subset of elderly people. For the latter group, the activities of relaxing and observing nature, as well as the UGS feature of benches, were found to be significantly more important than for the general population. Nevertheless, this had only a minor impact on the assessed aspects of UGS quality and supply, with little differences detected between the two groups. In Dresden (Germany), we determined that almost half of the elderly population are not provided with high-quality UGS. In these areas, urban planning must increase the UGS quality while taking user demands into account to ensure just access to the positive benefits of UGS for the elderly.</jats:p>"

Several development concepts include integrating the ecological aspect into the supply chain to reduce environmental degradation. In implementing the idea, companies in the agriculture industry need to evaluate their performance in the environmental area. This measure­ment uses the Green Supply Chain Operations Reference (GSCOR) Model that provides its entire supply chain aspect. This study demonstrates that the enable parameter criterion, which shows the magnitude of employee management toward environmental requirements, significantly impacts supply chain performance. Other criteria are also critical, such as a plan that considers every entity's usage and a source that considers the supply of the entities. The performance measurement produces a 6.357 value in the yellow color category with an average condition in the company. It produces three key performance indicators (KPI), such as water usage, percentage hazardous materials in inventory, and percentage hazardous waste, with a red classification that should be improved.\n </jats:p>"

This paper compares the stabilization effects and welfare implications of five policies on China's housing and credit markets. Three policies directly target the housing and credit markets: bank capital requirements, loan‐to‐value regulation and a property tax rule. Two broader policies are also considered: the reduction of capital controls and of the nominal exchange rate peg. To quantify the analysis, three prominent features of the Chinese economy—a monopolistically competitive banking sector that is subject to direct government control, a nominal exchange rate peg and capital controls—are built into a new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The model is estimated with Bayesian methods. Results show that relaxing capital controls is the most effective policy for stabilizing the credit market and the overall economy, while improving welfare. The second most effective approach is bank capital requirements, followed by a property tax rule. In contrast, loan‐to‐value regulation and a relaxation of the nominal exchange rate peg result in welfare losses to the economy.</jats:p>",

Most previous research has focused on the application of RWH systems for individual urban households. This paper develops a yield-after-spillage water balance model (WBM) which can calculate the reliability, annual drinking water production (ADWP) and benefit–cost ratio (BCR) of a community-scale RWH system for rural drinking water supply. We consider multiple scenarios regarding community aspects, including 150–1000 users, 70–4800 kL rainwater storage, 20–50 L/capita/day (LCD) drinking water usage levels, local rainfall regimes and economic parameters of Australia (developed country) and Vietnam (developing country). The WBM analysis shows a strong correlation between water demand and water supply with 90% system reliability, which allows both Australian and Vietnamese systems to achieve the similar capability of ADWP and economic values of the produced drinking water. However, the cost of the Vietnamese system is higher due to the requirement of larger rainwater storage due to larger household size and lower rainfall in the dry season, which reduces the BCR compared to the Australian systems. It is found that the RWH systems can be feasibly implemented at the water price of 0.01 AUD/L for all the Vietnamese scenarios and for some Australian scenarios with drinking water demand over 6 kL/day.</jats:p>"

We use the model to understand how the COVID-19 crisis, an omnibus supply and demand shock, affects output, unemployment, and inflation, and leads to the coexistence of tight and slack labor markets. We show that negative sectoral supply shocks are stagflationary, whereas negative demand shocks are deflationary, even though both can cause Keynesian unemployment. Furthermore, complementarities in production amplify Keynesian spillovers from supply shocks but mitigate them for demand shocks. This means that complementarities reduce the effectiveness of aggregate demand stimulus. In a stylized quantitative model of the United States, we find supply and demand shocks each explain about one-half of the reduction in real GDP from February to May 2020. Although there was as much as 6 percent Keynesian unemployment, this was concentrated in certain markets. Hence, aggregate demand stimulus is one quarter as effective as in a typical recession where all labor markets are slack. (JEL E12, E23, E24, E31, E32, E62, I12) </jats:p>",

Concerning the results, we have seen that there is a marked reduction in labor supply at the level of the entire economy of Republika Srpska and a significant growth of wages. More importantly, the wage growth is very strongly influenced by labor supply reduction. By statistical regression analysis, we have determined the statistically significant, strong impact of the reduction of labor supply on wage growth (y = -0.004x + 2365.3; R=-0.91; R2=0.83; p0.01). There is a general trend of wage growth that the pandemic crisis has not stopped and which will certainly continue in the post-crisis period. However, the key question is whether this kind of growth is sustainable. Unfortunately, there is a decline in labor productivity. The decline in gross value added per worker or labor productivity has been more or less pronounced in the three observed years. Current wage growth, with declining productivity, is not sustainable in the long run. If things with productivity remain as they have been for the three observed years and if the wage growth continues, it will inevitably lead to reduced competitiveness of the economy. The RS economy can avoid this trap if productivity starts to rise again. Improving productivity requires large investments in knowledge and technology, and companies need public sector support in this area.</jats:p>"

Effects are felt in the neighborhood: when homeownership rises by 10 pp, neighborhood home prices rise 1.5–2 percent. Instrumenting for purchases using government discounts generates similar results. Results are relevant for policies using financial incentives to increase homeownership among low-income populations. (JEL H24, I38, J22, R21, R23, R31, R38) </jats:p>",

Blockchain has the potential to reshape the structure of all accessible networks in the future. Construction businesses are increasingly interested in embracing blockchain technology to improve supply chain sustainability performance and supply chain resilience in times of globally increasing risks and volatility. This study evaluates the readiness of actors involved in the producing of concrete goods to emphasize the necessity to bring blockchain into the construction industry, as it may be a solution for supply chain resilience and long-term sustainable growth. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in collecting and analyzing the data and testing the hypotheses. Data were collected using an online questionnaire distributed to 300 employees who work within the biggest concrete producing companies in Saudi Arabia. 120 respondents completed the questionnaires. Additionally, confirmatory semi-structured interviews with experts in supply chain financing, IT departments, and procurement departments have been conducted; the study’s findings revealed a low level of blockchain knowledge within Saudi Arabia’s construction industry, since (90%) of respondents have not worked with Blockchain technology. Several technologists barely understand it, and the level of readiness is very low. However, there is a lot of potential, and it is worth investing in it combined with other technologies such as BIM technology. In this study, the authors have sought to provide a measure of Saudi professionals’ attitudes and understanding of blockchain technology solutions within the construction industry in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the study’s novelty aimed to provide a grasp of the conceptual, theoretical, and fundamental features of blockchain technology in the construction industry, as blockchain solutions could benefit the global economy by increasing levels of monitoring, tracing, and confidence in international supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We use the guaranteed service (GS) framework to investigate how to coordinate a multiechelon supply chain when two self-interested parties control different parts of the supply chain. For purposes of supply chain planning, we assume that each stage in a supply chain operates with a local base-stock policy and can provide guaranteed service to its customers, as long as the customer demand falls within certain bounds. Academic/practical relevance: The GS framework for supply chain inventory optimization has been deployed successfully in multiple industrial contexts with centralized control. In this paper, we show how to apply this framework to achieve coordination in a decentralized setting in which two parties control different parts of the supply chain. Methodology: The primary methodology is the analysis of a multiechelon supply chain under the assumptions of the GS model. Results: We find that the GS framework is naturally well suited for this decentralized decision making, and we propose a specific contract structure that facilitates such relationships. This contract is incentive compatible and has several other desirable properties. Under assumptions of complete and incomplete information, a reasonable negotiation process should lead the parties to contract terms that coordinate the supply chain. The contract is simpler than contracts proposed for coordination in the stochastic service (SS) framework. We also highlight the role of markup on the holding costs and some of the difficulties that this might cause in coordinating a decentralized supply chain. Managerial implications: The value from the paper is to show that a simple contract coordinates the chain when both parties plan with a GS model and framework; hence, we provide more evidence for the utility of this model. Furthermore, the simple coordinating contract matches reasonably well with practice; we observe that the most common contract terms include a per-unit wholesale price (possibly with a minimum order quantity and/or quantity discounts), along with a service time from order placement until delivery or until ready to ship. We also observe that firms need to pay a higher price if they want better service. What may differ from practice is the contract provision of a demand bound; our contract specifies that the supplier will provide GS as long as the buyer’s order are within the agreed on demand bound. This provision is essential so that each party can apply the GS framework for planning their supply chain. Of course, contracts have many other provisions for handling exceptions. Nevertheless, our research provides some validation for the GS model and the contracting practices we observe in practice. </jats:p>",

This study investigates the effect of competition and cooperation on the corporate cash dividend policy under the influence of the supplier relationship strategy and its mediating mechanism based on Chinese data. The motivation of this study is to provide a basis for enterprises to grasp the dynamic evolution process of the economic consequences of supply chain relationships based on big data and adjust the relationship strategy in time to maximize the positive effects of supplier relationships. This study considers supplier concentration and supplier financing as two dimensions to measure the supplier relationship strategy and selects the balanced panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020 as samples by applying the Logit and Tobit model. The results demonstrate that the supplier relationship is negatively correlated with the cash dividends. The intermediary effect found that the competition effect of the supplier relationship aggravates the agency conflict of enterprises and intensifies the degree of financing constraints, and thus acts on the cash dividends of enterprises. This study expands the economic consequences of relational transactions and provides an explanation of dividend policies from the perspective of a supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In an increasingly interconnected global economy, supply chains are vulnerable to a myriad of disruptions, including geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, technological failures, and unforeseen crises. These disruptions can cause significant delays, increased costs, and loss of revenue. The resilience and continuity of supply chains are often determined by how effectively organizations manage these disturbances. To proactively address these challenges, this study examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into SAP Supply Chain Management, specifically SAP Transportation Management (SAP TM). By leveraging AI’s advanced capabilities—such as predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time data processing—SAP TM can enhance supply chain visibility, responsiveness, and decision-making processes, reducing risks and improving operational efficiency.\nThis paper explores the emerging role of AI in transforming supply chain management, with a focus on how its integration into SAP TM can provide actionable insights for better decision-making and optimized logistics. AI-driven systems offer significant advantages, including improved demand forecasting, reduced lead times, and enhanced on-time delivery performance. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, AI applications can reduce supply chain costs by up to 20% and improve inventory turnover by as much as 25%. These capabilities are especially critical in the face of recent global disruptions, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and geopolitical tensions, which have stressed the vulnerability of traditional supply chain models.\nThe use of AI to model and simulate real-world disruptions, both natural and human-made, has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management by providing organizations with more accurate and timely forecasts. In scenarios ranging from the collapse of critical infrastructure, like the Baltimore Bridge, to the impact of ongoing geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, AI's predictive power can allow companies to adapt more swiftly to changing conditions. By combining real-world data with synthetic models, AI systems can simulate a variety of disruption scenarios, offering unprecedented precision in supply chain planning and risk mitigation.\nThis paper investigates how AI technologies integrated into SAP TM can not only help companies anticipate and react to disruptions but also enable them to optimize supply chain operations and move from a reactive to a proactive, precision-driven approach.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management can formulate a reasonable production plan according to the comprehensive information data generated by the supply chain management system, such as market demand analysis, purchasing demand analysis, and supplier assessment and evaluation. Therefore, this paper proposes the coordinated development of urban intelligent transportation data system and supply chain management, so as to improve the overall efficiency of the logistics system and the level of customer service. This paper aims to study the importance and advantages of the coordinated development of urban intelligent transportation data system and supply chain management. As can be seen from the data in Table 2, the percentage of people using a car increased by 18.2% in 2015, and by 2020, the percentage of people using a car increased by 36.9%. As shown in Figure 10, the traditional urban traffic data management system has the disadvantages of large amount of data and various and complex data types. Among them, the percentage of large amount of data is between 70% and 75%, and the percentage of diverse and complex data is between 62% and 68%. It can be seen that the number of people using cars is increasing, resulting in an increasing workload for the transportation system. On this basis, the intelligent traffic data system should be used to solve this problem and the coordinated development of the intelligent traffic data system and supply chain management can achieve a win-win situation.</jats:p>",

How do decision‐makers incorporate inventory uncertainty when placing orders? We investigate ordering decisions under two forms of uncertainty regarding total inventory available to satisfy demand: supply uncertainty (SU; unreliability in incoming shipments) and inventory record inaccuracy (IRI; internal inefficiencies leading to a discrepancy between physical and recorded inventories). The experimental results reveal behavioral regularities in ordering decisions under both forms of total inventory uncertainty. We find that subjects overstock in settings with low profit margins, and overstocking is more pronounced under IRI than under SU. This overstocking under low profit margins is similar to observed ordering decisions under demand uncertainty. In these settings, subjects show a stronger shortage aversion under IRI (which is internal uncertainty) than under SU (which is external uncertainty). Furthermore, we find that subjects chase past realizations of supply/on‐hand inventory, although the effect depends on the uncertainty type. Although SU and IRI are, in practice, often simultaneously present, their causes are different. By providing insight into the relative effect of the types of uncertainty on the quality of inventory replenishment decisions, this study highlights the importance of reducing SU and IRI for products with low profit margins.</jats:p>",

Household storage tanks complicate the performance and the hydraulic modelling of these systems. Rationing is often not based on insights into system performance and fails to achieve equity and the operators struggle to explain the rationing tactics to the stakeholders. Understanding the behaviour of water networks rationed regularly is essential to resolve the supply inequalities. We present a contextual analytical framework for understanding and managing water rationing based on the duration of supply (cycle time), rationing fraction (duration of non-supply) and domestic storage to analyse the equity and performance in the water network. The framework was tested using a model of a distribution network in Kakkapalliya, Sri Lanka, under different rationing schemes. The results show that large household tanks create inequities, which can be reduced through a trade-off by increasing the cycle-time of the rationing with a minor reduction in performance. Very small or non-existent domestic storage also negatively impacts the performance and equity of stressed water networks. Resolution of supply inequalities can be achieved through the trade-off between equity and performance is possible through the operation of the water network and by the regulation of domestic storage in water rationing regimes.</jats:p>",

While block chain technologies were originally intended to support new forms of digital currency for easier and secure payments, they now hold great promise as a new foundation for all forms of transactions. Agribusiness stands to become a key beneficiary of this technology as a platform to execute ‘smart contracts’ for transactions, particularly for high-value produce. First it is important to distinguish between private digital currencies and the distributed ledger and block chain technologies that underlie them. The distributed and cross-border nature of digital currencies like Bitcoin means that regulation of the core protocols of these systems by central banks is unlikely to be effective. Monetary authorities are focused more on understanding ‘on-ramps’ and ‘off-ramps’ that constitute the links to the traditional payments system rather than being able to monitor and regulate the currency itself. In contrast to the digital currency feature of block chain, the distributed ledger feature has the potential for widespread use in agribusiness and trade financing, especially where workflows involve many different parties with no trusted central entity</jats:p>"

We conducted an online survey with U.S. caregivers of infants (&amp;lt;2 years) (N=319) to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted breastfeeding, formula-feeding, and household ability to obtain infant-feeding supplies and lactation support (68% mothers; 66% white; 8% living in poverty). Results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater negative impact on formula-feeding families, largely due to formula shortages and financial strain. We found 31% of formula-feeding families indicated they experienced various challenges to obtaining formula, citing the following top three reasons: formula was sold out (20%), had to travel to multiple stores (21%), or too expensive (8%). In response, 33% of formula-feeding families reported resorting to potentially harmful feeding practices such as diluting formula with extra water (12%) or cereal (10%), preparing smaller bottles (8%), or feeding left-over/expired formula (11%). Only 15% of breastfeeding families reported feeding difficulties directly as a result of the pandemic—15% were reluctant to obtain lactation support and 9% weaned early. In fact, 51% of breastfeeding families reported increased provision of human milk to infants due to perceived benefits for the infant’s immune system (37%), ability to work remotely/stay home (31%), or concerns about money (8%) or formula shortages (8%). To protect infants from malnutrition in future crises, our results underscore the need for policies to support breastfeeding families and ensure equitable access to infant formula.</p>"

Based on the available studies and administrative statistics from 2019 and 2020, illicit drug use and need for services remained the same despite the pandemic. Services quickly adopted new operating rules and became available for the target group. There is ample evidence that in some cases illicit drug use (e.g. cannabis) even gained in popularity as a coping method for anxiety and stress.

The Water Quality Index (WQI) parameter has been widely used in determining water quality globally. The study aims to provide the suitability of groundwater in the specified region using the polynomial approximation method for drinking and irrigation purposes along with the computation of WQI using the conventional method. Weierstrass's polynomial approximation theorem along with longitudinal and latitudinal values has been used to evaluate the polynomial regarding various physicochemical parameters. To validate the obtained results from the present approach, groundwater quality data collected and analyzed from the Pindrawan tank area in Raipur district, Chhattisgarh, India, have been used. The result is obtained, i.e., the intermediate value of the parameters obtained correctly from the mathematical modeling, with an average error of 7%. This polynomial approximation method can also be used as the substitute of inverse modeling to determine the location of the source in the two-dimensional system. The approach output can be beneficial to administrators in making decisions on groundwater quality and gaining insight into the tradeoff between system benefit and environmental requirement.</jats:p>",

Information-centric QA plays an important role in the RLSC, providing an excellent solution for inferior-quality reprocessed products. However, information deficiency creates epistemic uncertainties that lead to information-processing needs (IPNs) for QA, for which the internal stakeholders in the RLSC should respond by undertaking appropriate information-processing mechanisms (IPMs). Given this, the current study aims to explore how internal stakeholders process information for QA in RLSC of DW through the organizational information processing theory (OIPT) perspective. The study follows a qualitative approach encompassing 30 semi-structured interviews with internal and external stakeholders in the RLSC of DW. The study found eight uncertainties that stem from the internal organizational environment and two uncertainties caused by the interactions with stakeholders in the supply chain. In addition, 15 IPMs were identified, which the demolishers and waste processors could undertake in response to the epistemic uncertainties. The study developed an information-processing management framework that would serve practitioners and academics to understand how effectively process, people, policy and technology elements contribute to responding to the epistemic uncertainties for successful QA in RLSC of DW.</jats:p>"

They share the same switch through cascading which not only simplify the topology but also control strategy, reducing the cost of the control circuit. Eliminate the input current dead-time problem of the original quadratic buck topology by adopting two-stage cascade structure. The main circuit topology improves the power factor and ameliorates the input current THD as well. Meanwhile, making the duty cycle of the switch operates in a more plausible area. Finally, relevant experiments demonstrate that the theoretical analysis is correct.</jats:p>",

To do this, three datasets of field data including hydraulic and geometrical characteristics of different rivers, with various statistical characteristics, were applied to evaluate the performance of LS-SVM and 15 empirical equations. The LS-SVM was evaluated and compared with developed empirical equations using statistical indices of root mean square error (RMSE), standard error (SE), mean bias error (MBE), discrepancy ratio (DR), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The results demonstrated that LS-SVM method has a high capability to predict the DL in different datasets with RMSE = 58–82 m2 s−1, SE = 24–39 m2 s−1, MBE = −1.95–2.6 m2 s−1, DR = 0.08–0.13, R2 = 0.76–0.88, and NSE = 0.75–0.87 as compared with previous empirical equations. It can be concluded that the proposed LS-SVM model can be successfully applied to predict the DL for a wide range of river characteristics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food security (FS) is one of the most elusive and sought-after objectives worldwide. Securing a country’s self-sufficiency— in the current COVID-19 pandemic era, more than ever—has become a prioritized mission. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, FS is adversely affected by, among others, the scarcity of freshwater, harsh environment, regional conflicts, and rising temperatures. Following the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, exporters placed export restrictions on key food crops, affecting FS in import dependent regions, such as the MENA countries and, more specifically, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This paper presented a conceptual framework on the key enablers for the UAE agri-food supply chains to obtain the necessary resiliency to achieve FS, through improving policy-making capacity. The proposed approach started with the assessment of the main vulnerabilities of the food system in a global context; from there, the factors that influence vulnerability were investigated, identifying the main global drivers that affect the local food systems, focusing on the UAE. The proposed framework was applied for the design and implementation of an early warning system concerning FS-related incidents.</jats:p>"

Cows received prepartum diets from 28 days before expected parturition to day of parturition and then received a common lactation diet until 35 days postpartum. Blood was sampled weekly to day −7, daily to day 7, and weekly through day 35 relative to parturition for analysis of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), urea N, and total protein concentrations. Epinephrine challenges were conducted on day −10 before expected parturition and days 7 and 14 postpartum. Epinephrine [1.4 μg/kg body weight (BW)] was administered <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> jugular vein and blood was collected from the opposite jugular vein from −45 min to +120 min relative to epinephrine administration.

Cows fed HMP had higher plasma concentrations of urea N prepartum than cows fed LMP (14.0 vs. 7.9 ± 0.8 mg/dl). Cows fed HMP tended to have greater prepartum concentrations of total protein in plasma than those fed LMP (7.5 vs. 7.0 ± 0.2 g/dl). The area under the curve (AUC) for NEFA response to epinephrine did not differ between diets, but differed by day relative to parturition [8,284, 29,018, and 18,219 ± 2,302 min × (μeq/l) for days −10, 7, and 14, respectively]. Maximal response of NEFA concentration to epinephrine was greater for HMP than for LMP (744 vs. 438 ± 72 μeq/l). The glucose AUC did not differ between diets or among days. Lipolytic response, but not glucose response, to epinephrine was enhanced during the early postpartum period relative to the late dry period.

Full vertical integration would eliminate the informational inefficiency but can be strategically undesirable. Yet today’s supply chain partnerships exhibit a certain degree of partial vertical integration via equity ties between the firms. Such governance forms received limited attention in supply chain research. Management literature suggests that partial vertical integration may help the firms to ease contracting problems by aligning their incentives, and thus improve the total surplus. We address this proposition by studying a model of a partially integrated supply chain in which the buyer holds an equity stake in the supplier. We adopt an operational perspective and investigate contracting between the firms within the joint economic lot size framework. We demonstrate that in this classical setting, partial integration can in fact be sufficient for eliminating informational inefficiency and achieving coordination. However, contrary to what one may expect, a tighter integration may harm supply chain performance and defeat coordination. We explain the underlying mechanism and investigate it analytically and numerically. Our results characterize sensitivity of supply chain performance to the degree of integration and stress the importance of the operational planning perspective for strategic decision making.</jats:p>",

To protect the health of human beings, the chlorine concentration at consumers’ nodes should be kept at appropriate levels. However, these levels are difficult to determine due to the presence of fuzzy uncertainties. To deal with fuzziness at both sides of the constraints in the optimization model of booster chlorination, we propose a fuzzy credibility-constrained quadratic programming (FCCQP) model with a consideration of credibility levels and weight coefficients. The proposed model is applied to two WDSs to obtain the booster cost under uncertain conditions. The results indicate that the booster cost increases with the confidence level for lower chlorine concentration ζL. In addition, the booster cost decreases with the weight coefficient w. The booster cost function curves along with the variation of weight coefficients are concave and convex for scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively. These results can help managers to make informed decisions on disinfection injection under conditions of fuzzy uncertainties.</jats:p>",

A descriptive survey design was adopted by the study. A total of 289 commercial building projects registered by National Construction Authority in Nairobi City County was the target population, as shown in NCA (2020) directory. Using Kothari (2015) sample size formula, the study got 167 commercial building projects. This study used simple random sampling to get the firms. The study preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. To gather data, structured questionnaires were used to collect data.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the global business environment, sustainability has become a competitive priority of most enterprises. Sustainability as a differentiation approach enables organizations to compete in today's environment. However, despite the increasing adaptability to sustainability practices, pharmaceutical supply chain management is still facing challenges in preserving the global environment. The study contemplates the impact of sustainable supply chain strategy and sustainable competitive advantage while considering the mediating role of sustainable supply chain practice and moderating role of sustainability inhibitors. The data was collected from the 180 employees working in the pharmaceutical companies of Pakistan. The study applied a quantitative approach for testing a theoretical model, using discriminant validity analysis, assessment of measurement model, composite reliability &amp;amp; validity analysis to assess the dimensions and model's reliability and validity. The study results show a positive relationship between sustainable supply chain strategy and sustainable competitive advantage. Sustainable supply chain practice mediates the relationship between sustainable supply chain strategy and sustainable competitive advantage, while sustainability inhibitors strengthen the relationship between sustainable supply chain strategy and sustainable supply chain practice. This study will help managers develop impactful sustainable supply chain management practices that will lead to sustainable performance.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to examine the relationship between green supply chain management (GSCM) and corporate performance among listed firms in Pakistan, using the general panel method of moments (GMM) and ANOVA techniques. At the same time, the Granger causality technique provides robust results. The study focused on manufacturing firms, covering periods from 2009 to 2020. The study engaged a modified balanced scorecard framework to adopt five metrics of corporate performance, namely, gross profit ratio, net profit ratio, customer dimension, learning growth dimension, and efficiency dimension. The study incorporated the two measures of the GSCM initiative and two control variables. The findings from the panel GMM estimates reveal that GSCM positively and negatively impacted the five corporate performance metrics explored. ANOVA results indicate significant differences in customer satisfaction, profitability, and efficiency performance metrics among the top and low GSCM practicing corporations. On the other hand, Granger causality results specify a moderate causal association between GSCM implementation and firm performance in Pakistan. Implying that poor GSCM practice may not yield the expected benefits, instead, conscientious efforts should be put in place to ensure that practicing GSCM initiative should be effectively carried out.</jats:p>"

It has demonstrated that major companies underestimate the need for sustainable and resilient operations. The pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions especially in the automotive industry. The goal of the study is to determine impact of the COVID-19 on supply chain operations in a Turkish automotive manufacturer and to develop a framework for improving operational activities to survive in the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) environment. The study identifies how the case study company has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and what challenges the company faced during the pandemic. A diagnostic survey and semi-structured interviews were used as data sources with qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results showed that the pandemic led to significant disruptions through various factors explained by shortage of raw materials/spare parts, availability of transportation, availability of labors, demand fluctuations, increase in sick leaves, new health and safety regulations. Findings also show the necessity to re-design resilience supply chain management by providing recovery plans (forecasting, supplier selection, simulation, monitoring) which consider different measures in different stages. In addition, the best practices were recommended for the case study by considering internal, external, and technological challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the given targeted guidelines and improvement for the automotive company might be applicable in the industrial practices for other organizations. The article concludes with future research directions and managerial implications for successful applications.</jats:p>"

This research work presents a capacity–inventory management model via system dynamics for a dynamic supply SC, applying model-based optimal control techniques. In the context of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) that present low variability and predictable demand, for mathematical modeling purposes, a set of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations, with an analogy from the mixing problem, is presented, which relates capacity and inventory levels, taking into account a production rate at each node of interaction. The application of ordinary differential equations via the mixing problem (or compartmental analysis) is important based on the idea of a balance between the influx and outflux of raw material along the supply chain. A proper literature review on optimal control for supply chains is analyzed. The mathematical model introduced is presented in a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space formulation. Stability analysis for the dynamic serial SC is presented, and a sensitivity analysis is also conducted for the capacity and production rate parameters considering the effects of variations in parameters along the SC. An energy-based optimal control is also developed with proper simulations.</jats:p>"

This study deals with the returned-obsolete products and the fresh items in a closed-loop dual-channel supply chain, where the manufacturer operates the whole production department and sells a percentage of products directly through his online channel, and delivers the rest of them to the retailer at a wholesale price. Additionally, the retailer collects unused items from customers with an appropriate reward to determine whether the customers intend to return the items. Both players screen the condition of the collected materials and then transfer the qualified materials for further use. Our paper formulates a mathematical model to evaluate scenarios such as scenarios manufacturer Stackelberg, Retailer Stackelberg, vertical Nash under the decentralized system, and a centralized system. The study is primarily concerned with finding optimal pricing plans and rewarding the customer analytically under various scenarios. Numerical explorations signify that the manufacturer Stackelberg’s scenario is more economical than the retailer Stackelberg and vertical Nash frameworks. The findings illustrate that the higher acceptance ratios of the returned materials benefit all the members and increase the keenness to return. Also, it is important for members to control the price-sensitive parameters within the demand function in order to save their markets. Further, the study suggests that an increase in production cost forces us to collect more returned materials, regardless of whether the increased remanufacturing cost suppresses that collection.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the existing knowledge on risks of climate change and variability in water supply in smallholder irrigation farming in Zimbabwe. In addition, this paper highlights adaptation options to climate change in SISs. Data for this review were collected systematically from peer-reviewed and published literature. The literature used for this study showed that SISs in Zimbabwe are beset with water stress, competing water needs and the outbreak of pests and diseases, which have been related with climate change and variability. Climate change is making Zimbabwe more arid through decreasing precipitation and warming. Droughts and floods are increasing in frequency and severity. Damage by floods is increasing exponentially, impacting environments, ecological systems and national economies. Climate change affects SISs’ productivity and decimates the livelihoods of scheme farmers. The review suggests that there is a need for increased adsorptive, adoptive and transformational capacity for SISs to obtain a new state of resilience from adverse effects of increased climate variability and change. This review recommends understanding and prioritizing solutions to vulnerability to climate change in SISs.</jats:p>"

Chinese government has also considered encouraging the shipbuilder’s initiative of producing or introducing LNG-fuelled ships through subsidies. However, rare scholars have concerned the impact of government subsidy on the supply chain decision of LNG-fuelled ships in the existing studies. This study takes green degree and government subsidy into account in the LNG-fuelled ship supply chain of a manufacturer and an owner and studies the pricing, market demand, and supply chain benefits. Our main contributions are considering the correlation between the green degree of LNG ships and government subsidy factors and exploring the influence of government subsidy on supply chain decision-making under decentralized and centralized decision-making by ship manufacturers and owners. The results show that government subsidies are conducive to promoting the whole profit and the market demand in the ship supply chain. Centralized decision generates higher profits than decentralized decisions. In the centralized decision model, government subsidies and the green degree of LNG-fuelled ship are positively correlated with the market demand. In the decentralized decision model, the price of an LNG-fuelled ship charged by shipbuilder when providing subsidies for owners is greater than that when providing subsidies for shipbuilder. Manufacturers and owners should pay attention to the greenness of ships, and the government should adopt appropriate subsidy policies to encourage the production and application of LNG ships.</jats:p>",

Additionally, products are likely to be damaged if dropped from a certain height, which sometimes does not appear on the package. By continuously measuring package vibrations and detecting shocks in the supply chain, consumers can gain an insight into the state of the product upon delivery. This paper presents the Smart Sticker implementation for ultra-low-power shock detection in the supply chain. The overall energy consumption must be kept as low as possible while continuously sensing the presence of shock to ensure that the Smart Sticker’s battery lasts as long as possible. The Smart Sticker functions in three modes to meet the established constraints: low-power, active, and data transfer mode. While detecting the shock, the low-power mode uses the least amount of energy needed. If the shock exceeds the threshold, the Smart Sticker enters active mode, stores the detected g force value in memory, and then switches back to low-power mode. Finally, employing Near Field Communication (NFC) and energy harvesting, the data transfer mode allows the consumer to read the recorded data. The results show that the Smart Sticker for shock detection performs according to set requirements and successfully monitors and detects shock for packages in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

For certain intake design, due to the complex three-dimensional (3D) flow transition, hydraulic jump and shock waves may form. This paper presents an experimental and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the flow in a tangential vortex intake with a steep-slope (sloping angle = 45°) tapering section. Swirling velocity field was measured using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) for discharges with typical flow features. CFD predictions were most encouraging in the good agreement with measured head-discharge relationship, air core size and velocity. It was found that the flow regimes are determined by the hydraulic controls at different sections under different discharges, forming a complex flow transition with an inclined hydraulic jump at the tapering section. While the swirling flow in the dropshaft is highly asymmetrical, the local tangential velocity is similar to that of a stable tangential intake with Rankine vortex behaviour. Flow energy dissipation is caused by the hydraulic jump at the tapering section and the friction loss at the dropshaft. The present study offers comprehensive insights to the design of tangential vortex intake structures.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS Tangential vortex intake flow with steep-slope tapering section elucidated first time.

Since Italy is the world’s largest producer of durum wheat semolina, the proper functioning of the Italian durum wheat supply chain is central to this investigation. The study was conducted following two different paths of analysis: (1) the calculation of volatility indices using annual and monthly data of durum wheat prices, both organic and industrial, observed in the Bologna Commodity Exchange (AGER); (2) the analysis of two organic durum wheat supply chain contracts, defined by a cooperative involving hundreds of Italian farms mainly from the Marche region and by an agricultural consortium operating in the Adriatic regions. Despite the limited number of cases examined, the present study shows how supply chain contracts can be valid tools for building stable relationships between the various players, from production to processing and distribution, guaranteeing farms fairer and more remunerative raw material purchase prices and higher quality standards.</jats:p>",

Pond water is widely used for drinking in developing countries and it has higher turbidity during rainy seasons. This purpose requires a large number of chemical coagulants that lead to a high cost of treatment. Therefore there is a need to find an economical and natural coagulant to treat turbid water. Coagulation activity is an ability of a liquid, changing to a solid or semi-solid state after sometime period of time. This study focuses on the isolation of coagulant proteins from Brassica nigra seeds responsible for water clarification. The coagulant protein (napin) was purified, quantified and identified. Napin protein was precipitated with 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate solution combined with dialysis and size-exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed that isolated napin has a molecular weight of 16 kDa. Protein quantification was done by using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The coagulation activity of the napin protein was measured against synthetic clay solution and turbid pond water. The coagulation assay results showed that napin protein from Brassica nigra has 85% and Moringa seeds extract has 87% coagulation activity against the synthetic clay solution after 120 min. However, the coagulation activity of napin protein against the turbid pond water was higher 85% compared to Moringa seed extract of 80%. The active coagulant napin protein would be helpful in establishing cheaper methods in scaling up the coagulant protein from the Brassica nigra seeds acting as a potential agent for water treatment.</jats:p>",

However, the fact is often ignored that many companies are small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises. They do not have enough capital to make green decisions. This paper studies a green supply chain financing system, including a green manufacturer and a capital‐constrained retailer and analyzes the effect of credit insurance on financing and product's green level. We consider consumers have a green preference. The retailer can finance through two methods: bank credit financing and trade credit financing. We find the manufacturer's financing preference is closely related to unit production cost and green investment cost coefficient. When the unit production cost is low, and the green investment cost coefficient is high, or the unit production cost is high, and the green investment cost coefficient is in the middle threshold, the manufacturer prefers to actively provide trade credit financing for the capital‐constrained retailer. And, in the former case, trade credit financing can also enhance the green level of the supply chain. Finally, we also find that credit insurance can mitigate the default risk of the retailer and help the manufacturer improve profits but cannot improve the product's green level.</jats:p>",

Their participation in global agro-food chains assures a source of revenues and agricultural development. Nevertheless, their position is still marginal. Moreover, there is a lack of data about the participation of smallholder farmers in African supply chains. The paper aims to identify the power regime between farmers, processors, middlemen and exporters and analyse how collective actions and external players’ intervention may modify the bargaining power in the sesame value chain in Eastern Chad. The analysis is based on qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with 98 farmers and 41 stakeholders. The study applies a netchain perspective, analysing the vertical relationships along the food chain in terms of power regime and the horizontal relationships of farmers by observing the first impact of collective actions. The results reveal that the dyadic ties are characterised only by supplier and buyer dominance, and there are no relationships characterised by independence and interdependence along the food chain. Especially, farmers suffer from both buyer and supplier dominance. The analysis of the horizontal relationships reveals that only middlemen organise horizontal agreements to improve their benefit in the commercialisation. The introduction of collective actions for farmers improves their horizontal relationships with potential positive impact on the farmers’ vertical relationships along the supply chain. Thus, their bargaining power may be further developed. This study offers a diagnosis of the farmers’ participation in value chain and future perspectives on the collective actions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Atmospheric-pressure plasma treatments for industrial and biomedical applications are often performed using Dielectric Barrier Discharge reactors. Dedicated power supplies are needed to provide the high voltage frequency waveforms to operate these nonlinear and time-dependent loads. Moreover, there is a growing technical need for reliable and reproducible treatments, which require the discharge parameters to be actively controlled. In this work, we illustrate a low-cost power supply topology based on a push–pull converter. We perform experimental measurements on two different reactor topologies (surface and volumetric), showing that open loop operation of the power supply leads to a temperature and average power increase over time. The temperature increases by ΔTvol~120 °C and ΔTsup~70 °C, while the power increases by ΔPvol~78% and ΔPsup~60% for the volumetric (40 s) and superficial reactors (120 s), respectively. We discuss how these changes are often unwanted in practical applications. A simplified circuital model of the power supply–reactor system is used to infer the physical relation between the observed reactor thermal behavior and its electrical characteristics. We then show a control strategy for the power supply voltage to ensure constant average power operation of the device based on real-time power measurements on the high voltage side of the power supply and an empirical expression relating the delivered power to the power supply output voltage. These are performed with an Arduino Due microcontroller unit, also used to control the power supply. In a controlled operation the measured power stays within 5% of the reference value for both configurations, reducing the temperature increments to ΔTvol~80 °C and ΔTsup~44 °C, respectively. The obtained results show that the proposed novel control strategy is capable of following the transient temperature behavior, achieving a constant average power operation and subsequently limiting the reactor thermal stress.</jats:p>"

The policies related to COVID-19 restrictions, such as lockdowns, access to markets and social distancing, has caused a high reduction in the income of many households. Food purchasing from vendor markets and supermarkets has decreased rapidly due to its prices. Several individuals cannot afford to buy the food items, leading to lower food supply within and outside the country. In addition, several people have been moving to rural areas due to Unemployment. They have started to perform backyard gardening small-scale farming, which again results in lower production of commercial farmers and loss of food supply to consumers. Not only Fiji, but the whole world is experiencing the same situations, which have led to the Government making innovative actions against this deadly virus to protect the citizens from this pandemic. FNPF withdrawals, farming packages, and other initiatives indulged by the Government of Fiji and other Pacific Countries are being discussed in this review.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Block chains are now firmly established as a digital technology that combines cryptographic, data management, networking, and incentive mechanisms to support the verification, execution, and recording of transactions between parties. While block chain technologies were originally intended to support new forms of digital currency for easier and secure payments, they now hold great promise as a new foundation for all forms of transactions. Agribusiness stands to become a key beneficiary of this technology as a platform to execute ‘smart contracts’ for transactions, particularly for high-value produce. First it is important to distinguish between private digital currencies and the distributed ledger and block chain technologies that underlie them. The distributed and cross-border nature of digital currencies like Bitcoin means that regulation of the core protocols of these systems by central banks is unlikely to be effective. Monetary authorities are focused more on understanding ‘on-ramps’ and ‘off-ramps’ that constitute the links to the traditional payments system rather than being able to monitor and regulate the currency itself. In contrast to the digital currency feature of block chain, the distributed ledger feature has the potential for widespread use in agribusiness and trade financing, especially where workflows involve many different parties with no trusted central entity.</jats:p>"

The first objective relates to financial benefits, whereas the second represents the wider goal of guaranteeing cleaner air and hence a greener and healthier planet. The problem is first modelled as a mixed integer linear programming based-model. The aim is to determine the location of distribution centres and recycling centres, their respective numbers and the type of vehicles assigned to each facility. Vehicle type consideration, not commonly used in the literature, adds another dimension to this practical and challenging logistic problem. A matheuristic using compromise programming is put forward to tackle the problem. The proposed matheuristic is evaluated using a variety of newly generated datasets which produces compromise solutions that demonstrate the importance of an appropriate balance of both objective functions. The robustness analysis considering fluctuations in customer demand is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that if the standard deviation of the demand falls within 10% of its average, the unsatisfied demand is insignificant, thus demonstrating the stability of supply chain configuration. This invaluable information is key towards helping senior management make relevant operational and strategic decisions that could impact on both the sustainability and the resilience of their supply chain networks.</jats:p>",

The node function was applied to the node design environment, and simulation tests were performed, and execution was tested to confirm the feasibility and practicability of the design. Based on this, the article proposes the service construction process of the software and hardware platform of the smart supply chain system, and then clarifies the basic mathematical problem of the distribution plan in line with the service strategy, that is, “the logistics route optimization algorithm with capacity and time constraint optimization,” which aims to study statically design, define, and model, and test two precise solutions representing heuristic genetic algorithms and analyze their results. In addition, additional hardware such as smart supply chain and cabinet boards are tested and designed according to system requirements, and the interaction mechanism is adapted to the user interface and supporting structure design so as to ensure the completion of user-related business processes. Combining the existing theoretical knowledge, the first priority is to meet customer needs, build a smart supply chain model under the premise of on-time delivery, and solve the model in time. Based on this point, this article tries to use hybrid branch algorithm link and tabu search algorithm to increase the consideration of traffic conditions, collect accurate algorithms, and modern heuristic algorithms to solve the actual situation of the case. At the end, the article proposes some related issues for the above problems. Suggesting through the research of wireless sensor network, this paper applies it to the research of intelligent supply chain and logistics route optimization algorithm and promotes the development of more intelligent supply chain in the future.</jats:p>",

As a new financing model emerged in recent years, it has opened up new markets in finance and logistics industry and brought new ideas and vitality to all parties in the supply chain. Since the strengthening of supervision, the operation of the industry has gradually changed to the direction of normalization. The study of online loan interest rate fluctuation is helpful to understand the source and characteristics of online loan risk, which has important reference significance for China’s Internet lending market. The measurement of interest rate risk can help to monitor market risk in time and improve financial supervision. This paper takes the online loan interest rate under the background of supervision as the research object, combining theoretical analysis and empirical research to explore the characteristics of interest rate fluctuations and the reasons behind the P2P online loan, and discusses the online loan business model. Based on the influencing factors of interest rate fluctuation, this paper analyzes the main characteristics of network loan interest rate from the aspects of interest rate trend interval distribution, regional distribution, and background distribution. This paper adopts the daily closing price data of domestic R insurance company to establish the daily logarithmic return rate series of stock prices. The results show that (1) GARCH-VAR model can effectively reflect the stock price fluctuation and market risk degree of the insurance company; (2) the company’s VAR showed a trend of first rise and then slight decline, with the highest VAR in 2018; and (3) the interpretation of VAR value should be combined with financial indicators. The increase in net profit rate will also lead to the decline of VAR value in the next period. Based on this, countermeasures and suggestions for market risk management are proposed for insurance companies.</jats:p>",

These initiatives may be about the surplus renewable energies that the facility generates for its region, the renewable energy sources that are available in the area for the facility, or the ecological relationships between facilities and their surrounding regions in general. The implications of these ecological relationships for the supply chain redesign problem were considered in this study in order to minimize the negative outcomes while minimizing the process’s related expenses. Thus, to minimize the unwanted effects, an objective function is defined in addition to the cost objective, which results in a bi-objective problem. Although small cases can be solved by exact methods such as AUGMECON, for larger scales, a matheuristic algorithm needs to be developed. The efficiency of the developed algorithm was investigated through numerical instances as well as with different metrics including a Pareto analysis. The results at larger scales show a shorter runtime of the matheuristic compared to the AUGMECON algorithm. Additionally, the matheuristic method provides a wider range of decision areas for managers.</jats:p>"

The issues of social sustainability are very challenging in the textile and clothing supply chain especially in emerging economies. This article proposes a modified fuzzy interpretive structural modelling (fuzzy ISM) for analysing the contextual relationships among the barriers of social sustainability. Twenty barriers are shortlisted based on review of literature and experts' opinion. The contextual relationships among the barriers are captured in form of linguistic ratings given by the experts. Using the modified fuzzy ISM method, an eight‐level hierarchical model is developed. The lack of consumer awareness is found to be the most important driving barrier. The other important driving barriers are lack of strict implementation of government laws and regulation, and lack of financial support from the Government and trade bodies. This study shows that the issues of social sustainability in the textile and clothing supply chain can be addressed by increasing consumer awareness, coercive pressure from the regulatory bodies, and financial aids and incentives to supply chain partners. This study contributes to the methodology by developing an improved interpretive model of decision making. The hierarchical and contextual relationships among the social sustainability barriers have been deciphered. The study also utilises organisational change management theory to address the barriers of adoption of social sustainability. Outcome of this research will be useful to frame strategies to implement social sustainability in textile and clothing supply chain.</jats:p>",

An effective mixing of contaminated water with heavy metals and magnetic nanoparticles is crucial for water treatment applications. In the present work, electromagnetic and shear mixing are combined to explore optimization mixing strategies. Mixing is studied through simulations under various initial conditions for two streams that are loaded with nanoparticles and one contaminated water stream that lies between the nanoparticle streams. In the present work, magnetic mixing is superimposed with a time-modulated gradient external magnetic field. The results show that as the radius ratio between the nanoparticles and the heavy metals increases, the external magnetic field is more effective insofar as the mixing of the nanoparticles is concerned. Moreover, for simulations where the radius ratio is higher than or equal to 10, an effective mixing is achieved. By comparing the velocity ratios, a better mixing is achieved in the case of higher velocity ratios. Also, minor effects on mixing are observed by comparing the ratios Vp/Vc = 10 and Vp/Vc = 20.</jats:p>",

The research data are gathered using questionnaires and interviews with experts in the field of traffic and transportation. In this research the effective factors in vehicle accidents were classified into four groups of Motive, Traffic function, Incident details and accident Prevention. Infrastructure components were also categorized into four categories that can be called the four sub-components: Roadways, Base preparations, Yards and stations and Develop-ment. Also, the priority of each component and their influence to each other are determined. According to research findings, improving transport infrastructure could reduce urban accidents and improve urban traffic.</jats:p>"

Based on recent literature reviews, the paper assumes a selection of commonly used variables for selecting suppliers and using logistic regression algorithm technique to build a model of optimization that learns from customer requirements and supplier data and then makes predictions and recommendations for best suppliers. The supplier selection process can quickly at times turn into a complex task for decision-makers to deal with the growing number of suppliers. But logistics regression technique makes the process easier in the ability to efficiently fetch customer requirements with the entire supplier base list by predicting a list of potential suppliers meeting the actual requirements. The selected suppliers make up the recommendation list for the best suppliers for the requirements. And finally, graphical representations are given to showcase the framework analysis, variable selection, and other illustrations about the model analysis.</p>",

The proposed 9L topology comprises a single DC source, eight switches, and two capacitors, namely a switched-capacitor (SC) and a floating capacitor (FC). The topology consists of two converter units: the SC unit and the FC unit. Both units are cascaded to achieve nine voltage levels with a voltage gain of 2. The inherent voltage boosting capability of the proposed topology makes it suitable for low-scale voltage applications like photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EVs). A sensorless method is introduced to stabilize the requisite voltage across the FC for any undesirable changes in input voltage. The performance reveals that the voltage across the FC does not deviate with changes in the modulation index, power factor of load, pulse width modulation (PWM) methods, or the operating frequency. And, when the input voltage fluctuates, the voltage across the FC is naturally adjusted to the new desired value within 0.6 s. The topology operates over a wide range of modulation indices (0 to 1) and different types of loads. A generalized topology is also developed to get a high output voltage along with a higher number of intermediate voltage levels. A comprehensive analysis is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed topology over the recent topologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Short lifetime product retailers often face the challenge of cannibalization between new and old products, which can negatively impact their profitability. They attempt to influence consumers’ choices through price differentiation, resulting in internal competition regarding products’ age and price. The pricing decisions affect market demand, sales volume, and as a result, the whole supply chain (SC) profit. This paper coordinates inventory and pricing decisions in a short lifetime product supply chain (SLPSC), considering the cannibalization effect. The investigated SLPSC includes a supplier and a retailer operating in a segmented market. Firstly, the optimal decisions of the SLPSC members are obtained under decentralized and centralized decision-making structures. Then, a new coordination contract named wholesale price and double compensation (WPDC) is designed to motivate the SC members to shift from the decentralized structure to the centralized one. The findings indicate that the coordinated model creates more economic profitability for the whole SLPSC than the decentralized one. Furthermore, the proposed WPDC contract is more beneficial for the SLPSC from a social viewpoint, as it increases consumer surplus. The results also demonstrate that when consumers are more sensitive to the product’s freshness, a price differentiation policy is more profitable than the same pricing.</jats:p>",

Extended research is carried out to prove how applications based on the distributed ledger technology or blockchain address these requirements, yet limited research investigates their purchasing process and economic implications. This paper uses the phytosanitary certificate in an international supply chain flow as a case study where interaction between multiple stakeholders is fundamental and analyses the purchase scenarios of a blockchain-based tool. To do so, it uses a theoretical model that identifies and quantifies the costs and benefits incurred by MarSC stakeholders, formulates gain-sharing scenarios and presents the results of a sensitivity analysis to show the dependence between the data-use and the potential economic gains it generates.

In the situation of manufacturer, different transportation modes are tied more on location of its alternative suppliers. Earlier railway was not an option, but nowadays even distant Chinese suppliers are evaluated with this alternative. Within logistics service companies, different transportation modes are tied to/from where handled products (cars) are coming from and their destination. For example, Russian markets are served by railways, which creates delays due to larger transportation lot size as compared to trucks. </jats:p>",

This new trend brings new challenges and opportunities to supply chain management. In view of the current new trend, each node enterprise in the supply chain should have the dual compatibility of economy and environment. How to balance the profits of supply chain nodes is an important issue for traditional enterprises under the guarantee of environmental benefits and green supply chain management. This paper takes the green transformation of enterprises as the breakthrough point, combined with the comparison of three green supply chain models. Considering the different preferences of enterprises for environmentally friendly goals, a green supply chain model is constructed when manufacturers and retailers consider different goals. This paper discusses the impact of environmental preferences of manufacturers and retailers on the supply chain system. It is found that when the manufacturer’s environmental preference is 1, the supply chain profit of the biobjective model is up to 1901. The results show that the model can achieve the dual optimization of the profit target and environmental friendly target and achieve the effect of green supply chain optimization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Salinity causes a hostile environmental impact throughout the year in the coastal region of Bangladesh, and its severity increases day by day. Because of upstream freshwater flow reduction and massive groundwater extraction, salinity has increased substantially over the last three decades. Moreover, arsenic contamination in shallow groundwater makes the groundwater unsuitable for potable use. Consequently, the coastal area suffers from acute storage of safe water supply. Salinity also negatively impacts human activities, livelihood, agricultural production, and the aquatic ecosystem. Though the shallow aquifer contains high salinity and a small amount of Arsenic (As), the very shallow aquifer (within 3m to 8m) contains fresh water in many areas in the rainy season due to the direct recharge of rainwater. However, rainfall recharge varies significantly depending on the geological and hydrogeological settings. Specifically, up to 50% of annual rainfall is stored in shallow aquifers of Quaternary sands through direct infiltration. The research’s principal objective is to identify the safe and sustainable drinking water source in the arsenic and saline-prone coastal region. Groundwater samples were collected from the different locations of the study area during both dry and wet seasons and examined seasonal variations in groundwater table and salinity levels. The chemical analyses and Physico-chemical parameters indicate that the groundwater samples are suitable for drinking. Except for some groundwater samples from the wet season, the salinity of all samples was under the allowable limit for Bangladesh (&lt;2000 µS/cm), and the targeted aquifer was almost arsenic (50 µg/l) free. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis has been made to accomplish the study goals. Particularly, the groundwater’s electrical conductivity (EC) values of most samples were measured within the limit of fresh or brackish water (&lt;2000 μS/cm). Overall, the results indicate the prospect of a very shallow aquifer as a source of freshwater for drinking purposes throughout the year, considering both arsenic and salinity, which effectively solve the freshwater shortage, especially in the saline-arsenic prone area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Leakage occurs in rural water supply pipelines very often and its locating is quite demanding even for specialists, which could result in a poor operation efficiency of rural water supply projects and thus a low rural water supply guarantee rate. In view of this problem, the detection of leakage, as well as its prediction, is of great significance for the operation, maintenance, and administration of rural water supply projects. The traditional monitoring-warning systems for urban water distribution networks cannot be applied to rural water distribution networks, due to various limitations. Meanwhile, as with the traditional models, most new approaches based on machine learning such as the artificial neural network (ANN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and statistical learning theory (SLT) do not fit rural water distribution networks much better, being unable to converge and force high-accuracy results with small sample sizes, which is a crucial demand to meet when dealing with rural water supply pipelines. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a model that specializes in small sample sizes and has a high generalization ability, was applied to a rural water supply project in Ningxia, China. In this study, a monitoring-warning system featuring both leakage locating and quantity estimation was established based on XGBoost. The accuracy and F1-score of the leakage locating model were 95% and 93%, respectively, while those of the leakage quantity model reached 96% and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, the pressure of monitoring stations could be obtained through the feature importance analysis enabled by XGBoost, which is essential for leakage warning. These results indicate that this system based on XGBoost could be a promising solution to the leakage issue in rural water supply projects, as a great inspiration for future developments in intelligent monitoring-warning systems, thus providing reliable approaches for the sustainable development of rural drinking water supply projects.</jats:p>"

So, the main purpose of this article is to investigate the determinants of financial inclusion from both demand- and supply-side variables in Indian states during the post-liberalization periods (1993–2015). Furthermore, the study uses different econometric models such as fixed effect, random effect, panel-corrected standard errors, and feasible generalized least squares for analysis purpose. The empirical findings of this study suggest that among the demand-side factors, literacy and per capita state GDP have a positive impact on financial inclusion, whereas other two variables like rate of unemployment and percentage of rural population have a negative impact on financial inclusion. Likewise, from the supply-side factors, our empirical findings depict that all four variables (i.e., road length, electricity supply, social sector expenditure, and capital receipt) have a positive and significant effect on financial inclusion in the post-liberalized Indian states. </jats:p>",

This paper develops a supply chain system with one manufacturer and one retailer. In manufacturer’s end, an investment is considered to improve the system performance which is measured through a probabilistic value (“out-of-control” probability). A model is discussed in this paper regarding the dependency of production with the “out-of-control” probability with a negative exponential function of production rate. Besides that, the retailer also incurs an investment to reduce its setup cost.

Esse artigo apresenta uma revisão da literatura, buscando uma visão geral do uso da água no país. No Brasil o maior consumo é destinado a agricultura, seguido pela indústria e por último abastecimento doméstico, que equivale a 18%. O Brasil é um país bastante privilegiado em termos de recursos hídricos. Em termos de vazão fluvial, a média anual é de 180 mil m3/s (12% da disponibilidade mundial) e em termos de pluviometria em 90% do seu território recebe em torno de 3.000 mm/ano. No entanto os problemas de abastecimento e saneamento existem em todo o território nacional.  A maioria da população brasileira vive em áreas urbanas e é preocupante perceber que mais de 60% das empresas não coletam esgoto doméstico para tratamento e que existe um grande número – mais de 10 milhões – de pessoas sem acesso a água tratada. Avaliando as informações coletadas, sugere-se que para melhorar o abastecimento de água, minimizando os problemas de abastecimento atuais, e os riscos relacionados a água e reduzir os impactos ambientais é necessária uma gestão eficiente que apresente uma visão racional de aproveitamento e preservação dos recursos hídricos. Para tal deve ser aumentada a produtividade e reduzido o consumo, buscando garantir um uso da gota d’água que garanta saúde para o ambiente e para toda a população, hoje e futuramente.      </jats:p>"

Industrial logistics systems are responsible for the transport of tools and raw materials for production and processing. Therefore, industrial logistics plays an essential role in improving the production efficiency of products. The value of the supply chain comes from the synergy of the various processes between various companies. The development of industrial logistics has effectively solved the issue of the inability of logistics to synchronize product and service flows in the supply chain and is an important part of the overall supply chain for the relevant enterprises. Now, the logistics industry is an important support industry for China’s economic development, and how to achieve rapid and stable development of the logistics industry is a key issue facing China that needs to be resolved. In addition, with the globalization of the economic environment today, enterprises are facing increasingly fierce competition. In this context, most companies are taking logistics informatization as an important factor for their success. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of the information industry, new information technologies are emerging. The application of new information technologies can improve the competitiveness of enterprises to a certain extent. After all, an important feature of modern industry is the organic integration of industry and services to promote the modernization of industry. The logistics industry, as a leading service industry, has already penetrated all aspects of the industry. However, the industry has not yet developed a comprehensive approach to the integration of industrial logistics information. The selection of a model based on unilateral consideration of transport costs and other indicators is no longer appropriate to the current situation. Therefore, it is of practical significance to study the integration of logistics information in the supply chain environment. Based on supply chain management, this research explores and designs a relevant approach to the integration of industrial logistics information, thus providing some suggestions for the direction of industrial logistics.</jats:p>",

BP algorithms make use of factor graph representations, whose assignment to the problem of interest is not unique. It depends on the state variables and their mutual interdependencies. Many short loops in factor graphs may impede the accuracy of BP. We propose a systematic way to cluster loops of naively assigned factor graphs such that the resulting transformed factor graphs have no additional loops as compared to the original network. They guarantee an accurate performance of BP with only slightly increased computational effort, as we demonstrate by a concrete and realistic implementation for power grids. The method outperforms existing alternatives to handle the loops. We point to other applications to supply networks such as gas-pipeline or other flow networks that share the structure of constraints in the form of analogues to Kirchhoff’s laws. Whenever small and abundant loops in factor graphs are systematically generated by constraints between variables in the original network, our factor-graph assignment in BP complements other approaches. It provides a fast and reliable algorithm to perform marginalization in tasks like state determination, estimation, or optimization issues in supply networks.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Graphical abstract</jats:title></jats:sec>",

Considering the heterogeneous demand of consumers, this paper introduces the degree of agricultural product characteristics and establishes a dynamic pricing model for agricultural products under decentralized decision-making and centralized decision-making and designs a revenue sharing coordination contract. The results indicate that the overall profit of the supply chain obtained by pricing agricultural products through a decentralized decision-making model is lower than that created under centralized decision-making. Improving the degree of agricultural product’s characteristics and adopting the revenue sharing contract is conducive to the Pareto improvement of supply members. The relevant recommendations provide a reference for the product pricing strategy of this type of agricultural product supply chain.</jats:p>"

It is established that an additional decrease in the temperature of the return network water that occurs in this mode allows in most cases to carry out its primary heating in the lower heater of the condensing turbine without a concomitant increase in fuel consumption and thereby increase the coefficient of its use at the CHPP. The parameters of the main points of the thermodynamic Rankine cycle for the option under consideration are determined through the example of a T-100-130 turbine, a flow diagram of heat carriers is constructed, and calculations are carried out to determine the most important technical and economic indicators of the heat-generating plant of the CHPP in the climatic conditions of Moscow. It is proved that when all heat consumers are connected to the heat network according to the scheme under consideration, the maximum share of usefully used condensation heat under transition conditions for primary heating of supercooled return network water to the level corresponding to the temperature schedule can amount to almost a half, if the structure of the energy balance of consumers corresponds to the one characteristic for residential buildings. It is noted that the implementation of the proposed design of heat points allows to increase the efficiency of the CHPP and (or) the heat supply organization by obtaining additional revenue for the heat extracted from the network wastewater after the hot water heaters, without increasing fuel costs and with minimal capital costs for additional equipment (pump, regulator, frequency-controlled drive). </jats:p>"

Red light increased shoot dry weight in relation to both B and RB irrespective of nitrogen supply. Blue light favored root growth under low nitrogen. Allometric analysis showed lower allocation to leaf in response to blue light under low nitrogen and similar leaf allocation under high nitrogen. A difference in allometric slopes between low nitrogen and high nitrogen in treatments with blue light reflected a strong interaction effect on root-to-shoot biomass allocation. Shoot nitrate concentration increased with light exposure up to 14 h in both nitrogen treatments, was higher under blue light with high nitrogen, and varied little with light quality under low nitrogen. Shoot nitrogen concentration, nitrogen nutrition index, and shoot NR activity increased in response to blue light. We conclude that the interaction between blue light and nitrogen supply modulates dry mass and nitrogen allocation between the shoot and root.</jats:p>"

Wetlands are increasingly under pressure due to human activities. The most serious threats to wetlands are excessive agriculture and the diversion of water for irrigation. In recent years, due to water shortage and drought, wetland dryness in Iran has caused many problems, including the dust crisis. Therefore, planning at the basin scale is necessary to achieve sustainable development, which emphasizes the employment of mathematical models. In this study, using a reliability-based simulation–optimization approach, development planning in the Karkheh basin with the following two objectives is investigated: (1) total area under cultivation of agricultural development sectors and (2) supply reliability of the environmental flow requirement. The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model is used for the simulation of water resources and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is employed for optimization. The results show that in addition to significantly improving the supply reliability of the wetland requirement (from 55 to 79%), the design of agricultural development projects has been optimized. The reliability-based model has prevented unsustainable developments in the basin. Also, the average supply reliability of agricultural demands has increased from 51% (in previous studies) to 72%.</jats:p>",

The flow regime of the Malewa River is reducing due to the river fluctuation, increasing scarcity of water during dry periods. The purpose of this research was to assess spatial and temporal hydrological drought using Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) at Malewa River catchment. The data were based on hydro-meteorological data which included rainfall, level of water at Lake Naivasha, and streamflow of Malewa River for the years 1980-2018. They were obtained from Water Resources Authority (WRA) in Naivasha and Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) in Nairobi, Kenya. The field data were first normalized to have all input attributes temporary variables with their distribution having zero means and a standard deviation of 1. Later the normalized data were calculated using basin-calibrated algorithm of SWSI to determine the hydrological condition. In SWSI, the highest percentage of classification for the stations were near the average of -0.9 to 1.0, with 34% for the Malewa area and 30% for the Turasha area. In spatial distribution analyses, hydrological drought severity was highest along the southern part of the catchment and lowest along with Eastern and North-Eastern areas. Therefore, hydrological drought severity was experienced in the catchment in terms of temporal and spatial analyses and increased along the flow path of the river. Hydrological drought assessment shows a technical manner for a comprehensive understanding of drought offering proper mitigation strategies and plan to control this natural disaster. </jats:p>"

This was as a result of the rapid increase in population and failures of water scheme projects in Edem. Hydraulic properties used in characterizing the transmissibility magnitude were calculated from values of aquifer resistivity and thickness. Results from the field data showed that the aquifer resistivity ranged from 34.800 to 67,561.200 Ωm while thickness ranged from 24.800 to 147.600 m. Fractional porosity with an average value of 0.290 ranged from 0.256 to 0.326. Values of surface area per unit pore volume and permeability range from 460.250 to 13,038.710 m−1 and 1.680E-09 to 1.973E-06 μm2 respectively. Hydraulic capillary radius ranges from 7.67 × 10−5 to 0.00217 m, while transmissivity values range from 0.8607 to 458.0727 m2/day. From the contour map, hydrogeologic units across the western and eastern parts of the area were depicted as having high indices of transmissibility magnitude. The northwestern part was characterized with very low indices of transmissibility. Plots of permeability against these hydraulic properties revealed their various coefficient of determination. The results from this study will assist in characterizing the hydrogeologic units of the area for proper groundwater exploration and management.</jats:p>",

The design of DMA is very specific to individual networks’ hydraulic and often constitutes one area with pressure managed zones. This paper presents the division of a selected water supply network zone into DMA areas. Based on the spatial distribution of the flow rate and the geometrical structure of the network (routes, pipe diameters, existing gate valves) in the analyzed water supply zone, the main transmission trunks were separated (DN150 ÷ DN500 diameter range) and were excluded from the division into metering areas. DMA areas were separated from the remaining parts of the network, using the district metered areas module, supporting the division of water supply networks into metering zones, available in the WaterGEMS software by Bentley. The number of nodes in the area was 200 as the main criterion for separating DMAs. The separated areas were combined into 3 main DMA zones, in which the sum of the pipe lengths varied between 2500 ÷ 3800 m. For each of the DMAs, the water supply route was determined individually, seeking a one-sided inflow to the isolated area. In two out of three cases, this goal has been achieved. In the third case, it turned out necessary to provide two-sided water inflow. The analysis of the correct operation of DMAs was based on the hydraulic modeling of WDS.</jats:p>",

The authors collect detailed daily information on school closures at the school-district level, which they merge to individual-level data on labor supply and sociodemographic characteristics from the monthly Current Population Survey spanning from January 2019 through May 2020. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach, the authors find evidence of non-negligible labor supply reductions. Having a partner at home helped offset the negative effect of school closures, particularly for maternal employment, although respondents’ job traits played a more significant role in shaping labor supply responses to school closures. Overall, the labor supply impacts of school closures prove robust to identification checks and to controlling for other coexistent social distancing measures. In addition, these early school closures seem to have had a long-lasting negative impact on parental labor supply. </jats:p>",

In order to obtain a functional nutritional product with an increased content of these trace elements in the vegetative experiment, foliar biofortification of two chervil varieties with selenium (sodium selenate 10 mg/l) and iodine (potassium iodide 100 mg/l) was carried out without and against the background of the use of silicon-containing fertilizers Siliplant (3 ml/l). The combined and separate application of selenate, iodide and Siliplant increased plants’ biomass. Siliplant utilization increased the accumulation of iodine by 1.7-1.9 times, and selenium supply – by 2.2-3.1 times. A significant increase in ascorbic acid content was provided by the combined supplementation of iodine and selenium (1.25-1.27 times), iodine and silicon (1.46-1.87 times) and joint application of selenium, iodine, and silicon (1.31-1.73 times), while an increase in total antioxidant activity (1.3-1.4 times) was observed for (Se+I) and (Se+I+Si) treatments. High varietal differences in the responsiveness of plants to the selected treatments were manifested, particularly an increase of polyphenols accumulation under separate and joint treatments of chervil with iodine and selenium by 1.26 times in the cultivar 21-20, and the absence of a significant effect in the cultivar 24-20. Taking into account the adequate consumption levels (ACL) of iodine and selenium, 50 g of the resulting functional product can provide up to 79% of iodine ACL and up to 40% in selenium ACL.</jats:p>"

An ordered logit model was utilized for calculation with the data collected from semi-structure questionnaires with 1200 households using water from rural water supply systems managed by different sectors in Vietnam. The results indicate that the water-user satisfaction with rural water supply projects managed by the private sector is higher than that in other sectors (community, cooperative, commune people’s committee), whereas there is no significant difference in customer satisfaction between systems managed by the public sector and the private sector (enterprise, private management).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: This paper investigates the issue of sharing the private demand information of a manufacturer that sells a product to retailers competing on prices and service efforts. Academic/practical relevance: In the existing literature, which ignores service effort competition, it is known that demand signaling induces an informed manufacturer to distort the wholesale price downward, which benefits the retailers, and so, they do not have any incentive to receive the manufacturer’s private information. In practice, many manufacturers share demand information with their retailers that compete on prices and service efforts (e.g., demand-enhancing retail activities), a setting that has not received much attention from the literature. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model with one manufacturer selling to two competing retailers and solve for the equilibrium of the game. Results: We show how an informed manufacturer may distort the wholesale price upward or downward to signal demand information to the retailers, depending on the cost of service effort, the intensity of effort competition, and the number of uninformed retailers. We fully characterize the impact of such wholesale price distortion on the firms’ incentive to share information and derive the conditions under which the manufacturer shares information with none, one, or both of the retailers. We derive conditions under which a higher cost of service effort makes the retailers or the manufacturer better off. Managerial implications: Our results provide novel insights about how service effort competition impacts the incentives for firms in a supply chain to share a manufacturer’s private demand information. For instance, when the cost of effort is high or service effort competition is intense, a manufacturer should share information with none or some, but not all, of the retailers.</jats:p>",

Yet, much confusion has arisen over the precise requirements of this duty, given that it is thought to originate from two distinct sources: the common law, and s.13A of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap.219). It is suggested that the current common law position is based on a misunderstanding of s.13A, and that the current statutory position under s.13A is not aligned with the normative rationale of the duty. As such, it is necessary to amend s.13A. When considering the substance of the amendment, the Hong Kong Legislative Council (“LegCo”) ought to ensure that the scope of the duty is aligned with its normative rationale, that the law is sufficiently certain, and that vendors who have relied on the current position would not be retrospectively prejudiced. </jats:p>",

The results showed that in the range of 0–7,000 cm suction, the spatial variation coefficient (CV) of soil saturation of each bulk density increased with the increase of suction. Soil saturation showed weak spatial variability when suction &amp;lt;800 cm, and moderate spatial variability when suction ≥800 cm. Using a bulk density of 1.58 g/cm3 as an example, the SWCC determined by the symmetry of the bending point was compared with the measured data of 0–300, 0–500, 0–800 and 0–1,000 cm suction sections. It was found that the measured soil saturation of SWCC determined by the data for the 0–800 cm suction section was the most consistent with the predicted value. The measured and predicted saturation points of the SWCC were most consistent with suction segments of 0–800 cm. SWCC data of different textures and bulk density were used to verify the prediction method at low suction section and an inflection point of 0–800 cm. It was found that the average absolute error and root mean square error of statistical indicators were close to 0, and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.9915. The actual and predicted values of each soil parameter were linearly correlated. This method of predicting SWCCs with low suction and inflection points ensures both a high degree of curve fitting and the accuracy of characteristic soil parameters, providing a simple method for the prediction of SWCCs and guidance for managing soil water in loessial areas.</jats:p>",

The personnel data of the supply chain enterprise are loaded through the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm, and an automated management model of the cloud system is constructed according to the management system and the personnel organization structure of each department. Thus, the automated identification system of the personnel management of the supply chain enterprise is realized. Through the establishment of an automated management system by the cloud system, the accuracy of a cloud system to capture data pertinent to the personnel management of supply chain enterprises has increased by about 90% and the accuracies of both text recognition and image recognition for personnel management systems of supply chain enterprises reach about 92%. Hence, it enables supply chain enterprises to save time, money, and personnel and increases flexibility and brings convenience to personnel management, which is conducive to the personnel training, evaluation, and subsequent development of enterprises. Consequently, automated management gives enterprises an upper hand to use talents flexibly and comprehensively and establish an intact database of human resources (HR). It is found that the security enhancement algorithm of the cloud system can greatly reduce the risk of information leakage in the HR database and greatly improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain enterprise.</jats:p>",

A solution is proposed for redesigned layout of the oil system in the cell by introducing an oil supply module (station) into the structure of the steam turbine unit. As of now, there are no commercially available offers of an oil station with the required oil tank capacity. The oil station module is arranged at places free from equipment of the cell, for example, at the 0.000 elevation or under the upper operating mark near the generator and below the level of turbine unit bearings to enable oil drainage by gravity. The main differences are outlined between the proposed oil station and the existing oil system.</jats:p><jats:p>The oil system determines the reliable and trouble-free operation of the steam turbine unit. In order to be able to introduce an oil supply module into operation it is necessary to design the system based on the requirement of maximum reliability.

The influence is considered of the oil station components on individual reliability constituents: survivability, durability, fail-safety, maintainability, fire safety. </jats:p>"

Millions of people living there mainly depend on pond water and rainwater harvesting system and face severe difficulties to collect freshwater, particularly during the dry season. Therefore, various community water supply technologies, e.g., RO, SIDKO, RPWS, SkyHydrants etc. have been established to meet their daily needs, though the majority of these technologies fall short of the value of time and effort of water collection and sometimes fail to supply water of desired quality. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) technique, also a community water supply system, was designed to provide safe water by creating underground storage of freshwater where ambient groundwater salinity is reduced by infiltrating rooftop or pond water through wells. Understanding the need to sort out the best water supply option, a comparative study has been conducted between MAR and other water supply technologies, and among all of them the MAR has been demonstrated as a low cost, reliable, sustainable, and durable option for providing safe drinking water to the community round the year.\nThe Dhaka University Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Centennial Special Volume June 2022: 157-166</jats:p>"

In the previous two-tiered priority-based system, grafts not allocated through national high-urgency status were offered to transplant centres according to geographic criteria. Between 2013 and 2018, significant geographic disparities in transplant allocation were observed across transplant centres with a mean number of grafts offered per candidate ranging from 1.4 to 5.2. The new system redistricted the local allocation units according to supply/demand ratio, removed regional sharing and increased national sharing. The supply/demand ratio was defined as the ratio of lungs recovered within the local allocation unit to transplants performed in the centre. A driving time between the procurement and transplant centres of less than 2 h was retained for proximity. Using a brute-force algorithm, we designed new local allocation units that gave a supply/demand ratio of 0.5 for all the transplant centres. Under the new system, standard-deviation of graft offers per candidate decreased from 0.9 to 0.5 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.08) whereas the mean distance from procurement to transplant centre did not change.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Centella [Centella asiatica (L.) Urban], as a herb, is well known for its nutritional and pharmaceutical value. Nitrogen fertilizer plays a significant role in yield and quality of the herb. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of mineral nitrogen on the centella plant yield, total chlorophyll, total flavonoid content, antioxidant activities and C/N ratio. Methods: The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer ammonium nitrate (33% N) was applied with 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha-1, with no N (0 kg ha-1) as the control. The dosage was split into three times application at 7, 14 and 21 days after transplanting. All plants were watered 10-days intervals with the nutrient solution. Result: The results showed that the increasing doses of nitrogen improved growth rate and overall biomass of centella. Among nitrogen treatments, the 60 kg N ha-1 were found to yield maximum growth and the maximum values of leaf number, leaf area, rosette diameter and petiole length. The application of nitrogen (30-60 kg N ha-1) increased the total chlorophyll and reduced total flavonoid content, antioxidant activity and the C:N ratio. The application of 60 kg N ha-1 of nitrogen should be considered as the optimal amount for reconciling limited yield loss and maintaining the quality of centella.\n</jats:p>"

In Costa Rica, as in other countries, climate-change (CC) models and projections are essential to make decisions about the management of natural resources, mainly water. To understand climate change’s impact on hydraulic parameters such as velocity, depth, and river surface area, we studied the Pejibaye river basin, located in Jiménez in Cartago, Costa Rica. This watershed is characterized by having more than 90% of its surface area covered by forest. We used the precipitation and temperature data from meteorological stations (2000 to 2009) and climate-change scenarios (2000–2099) to predict the response of the basin in different periods. First, we calibrated (NSE = 0.77) and validated (NSE = 0.81) the HBV hydrological model using ten years of daily data from 2000 to 2009. The climate-change data (2000–2099) were incorporated into the calibrated HBV model. This allowed us to determine the impact of CC on the basin water regime for the periods 2040–2059 (CCS1) and 2080–2099 (CCS2). The IBER mathematical model was used to determine the changes in the hydraulic variables of the river flow. For the CCS1, we determined a 10.9% decrease in mean velocity and a 0.1-meter decrease in depth, while for CCS2, the effect will be an 11.3% reduction in mean velocity and a 0.14-meter decrease in depth. The largest decreases in river surface area per kilometer will occur in May (1710 m2) for CCS1 and April (2250 m2) for CCS2.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lake systems are of fundamental significance for the ecological environment and social development. Driven by climatic changes and human activities, the hydrological situation of rivers and lakes has been altered considerably, and it has directly affected the reliability of irrigation and water supply in lake areas. In the case of the Yangtze River–Dongting Lake area, the quasi-equilibrium of their hydrological states and water balance have been affected by the operation of the Three Gorges Project that has led to irrigation and water supply problems across the lake area. Ever since, the available water supply in the Dongting Lake area has decreased by 31.5% and 47.7% during the months of September and October, and the overall water level in the lake area has dropped by 0.8–2.0 m. The proportion of domestic and agricultural irrigation water demands to available water supply in the Dongting Lake area is very small, and the decline of water level is the main reason for the lack of water supply in Dongting Lake area, Although the total amount of water in the lake area is still above the water supply threshold, an obvious decreasing trend has been observed in the fulfillment of the demand for both irrigation and water supply in urban and rural regions. Additionally, the fulfillment of secured water supply and irrigation requirements has respectively dropped from 95% to 78% before the operation of the Three Gorges Project to 82% and 46% after it. Meanwhile, the total water shortage increased from 57.683 to 143.607 million cubic meters. By advancing or postponing impoundment schedules, the impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir on irrigation and water supply in the lake area during September and October can be alleviated, and the water supply capacity can be respectively increased by approximately 1.3% and 1.4%. The highlights of this study include the quantification of the impacts of the operation of large-scale water conservancy projects at the level at which the requirements on irrigation and water supply in the lake area are satisfied, and the prediction of the trends for future evolvement. In addition, corresponding strategies that provide a technical reference for the comprehensive regulation and control over water resources and the security of water supply in the river basin are discussed.</jats:p>"

However, it is not so popular in agricultural field, a vital reason is the scarcity of effective incentives. Government incentive as an important incentive measure is thought to be useful. To study the subsidy rules in the new background, we chose an agri-food supply chain with one producer and one retailer as research object and divided government incentive into direct incentive and indirect incentive. Then, considering the changes of consumer perceived safety on agri-food in the new environment, the demand function was revised. Furthermore, we proposed and analyzed three subsidy models and their benefit functions considering the information service inputs based on Big Data and blockchain (BBIS). Findings: (1) The subsidy models will not change the variation tendency of prices and benefits with the BBIS optimization coefficient, the BBIS investment costs from the producer and the retailer, the ascension of the unreliability coefficient of quality safety and the agri-food quality level. (2) When the subsidy coefficients about direct and indirect subsidies can meet a relationship, benefits of chain members in the indirect subsidy model are higher than them in the direct subsidy model. Findings offer a theoretical guidance for government departments to make and implement the subsidy strategies. In addition, for company, it can provide a theoretical guidance on setting pricing strategies in the new technology background.</jats:p>",

The country also aims to increase its renewable share of electricity to 10% by 2030. However, due to limited wind resources, solar energy seems to be most appropriate to deliver such a target. However, in a land-scarce country, this presents a major challenge, which this work aims to partially address. Being a globally leading producer of commodities, Bangladesh has a considerable number of large manufacturing plants with appropriate roofs that could be used for deploying solar energy conversion systems at scale. A methodology is presented which identified and assessed 6045 such plants, which have roof areas ranging from 100 m2 to 50,000 m2, and modelled the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology that can provide power through site available grid infrastructure. Such deployment takes advantage of net metering regulations to enhance the case for such power generation. A techno-economic assessment was also presented, addressing how such utilisation can support the 10% renewables target of Bangladesh without impacting scarce lands. The results showed that around 7.4 GWp of PV capacity can be achieved on such roofs with a corresponding annual electricity generation of 11 TWh. This represents more than 6% of Bangladesh’s current electricity consumption and more than half of the 2030 target. Furthermore, the deployment will save 13,000 acres of farmland, as well as providing power through site available grid infrastructure saving on investment if the systems are deployed on land. These results are likely to influence policy to support the presented proposition, not only in terms of increasing the renewable energy share in the country’s electricity supply mix but also in conserving much-needed land for agriculture.</jats:p>"

In order to improve the benign interaction between the source and the load of the system, the source side decouples the thermoelectric linkage through energy storage devices and improves the system multi-energy supply capacity by introducing various energy flow forms of energy devices. On the demand side, considering the elasticity of electric heating load and the diversity of heating mode, an integrated demand response (IDR) model is established, and a flexible IDR price compensation mechanism is introduced. On this basis, aiming at the optimal stability of supply and demand and the minimum operating cost of the system, a multi-objective optimal operation model of combined heat and power source–load interaction is constructed, taking into account the user satisfaction with energy consumption and the internal equipment load constraints of the system. Finally, an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to solve the model. The analysis of the algorithm shows that the source–load interaction multi-objective optimal scheduling of the cogeneration microgrid considering the stability of supply and demand can effectively improve the stability of supply and demand and the economy of the system.</jats:p>"

In 2017, the EU27’sa consumption of agricultural commodities was associated with close to 20% of global tropical deforestation (or 240,000 hectares), according to the newly released Commodity Footprints data (Croft et al., 2021) (see Box 1). Total tropical deforestation associated with the consumption of agricultural commodities in the EU and UK were only second to China, and ahead of India, the US and Japan in 2017 (Pendrill et al., 2020). Addressing this issue at the EU level can encourage other countries to follow, accelerating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and preventing further loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since 2018, several initiatives have been proposed acknowledging deforestation in supply chains (European Commission, Directorate General for the Environment., 2018; GRI Taskforce, 2020; MTES, 2018) and, in November 2021, the European Commission drafted a policy proposal to regulate forest-risk commodities (European Commission, 2021). Belgium and Spain joined the seven countries of the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership in 2021, and together with Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK, aspire to “achieve sustainable and deforestation-free agricultural commodity supplies” (ADP, 2021). At COP26, countries accounting for 90% of the world’s forests affirmed their commitment to “halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030” (UK COP26, 2021, p. 26), despite similar commitments in the New York Declaration on Forests (UN, 2014) having failed to meet their 2020 objectives. Efforts to move towards zero deforestation in the supply chains of agricultural commodities such as soy, maize, palm oil, cocoa, rubber and beef imply a rapid decrease of agricultural expansion in tropical frontiers and a transition towards more intensive production. Further agricultural intensification – increasing production by increasing yields – requires additional resources such as water and fertilizer, but to be more sustainable, also needs to observe other environmental and socio-economic aspects, such as soil, water and forest stewardship, while supporting livelihoods and promoting animal welfare. Water plays a key role in qualifying whether agricultural intensification can be considered environmentally sustainable. Since 2012, “water crises” have been consistently part of the top five global risks of concern, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2021).b The overexploitation or contamination of water resources can present a significant risk to countries, communities and industries, but also to ecosystems. About 40% of the water used by the EU economy is sourced from river basins located outside its borders, which experience varying levels of water scarcity throughout the year (Ercin et al., 2019). Droughts can considerably affect agricultural yields, particularly in regions where production is vulnerable to precipitation variability, as recently experienced in South America (Laje et al., 2021). The current push for greater scrutiny and due diligence on deforestation in supply chains, presents an opportunity to expand beyond a single deforestation metric and adopt a more comprehensive definition of environmentally sustainable supply chains for the EU. Overlooking water use for agricultural commodities may shift environmental burdens from regions with high deforestation rates to regions with high water scarcity. In this discussion brief, we explore tropical deforestation and water use in supply chains to highlight the connections between land and water use in agricultural commodity production and describe potential blind spots with respect to water use in supply chains.</jats:p>",

However, in reality, it is difficult to use count data model for data with autoregressive features. The main reason is that the time series features and autoregressive attributes cannot be controlled through the count regression model, which violates the assumptions set by the model. Therefore, there may be errors in the empirical analysis results. This letter firstly describes the characteristic of the count regression model and the problem, and then we refine the multiplicative autoregressive count model for dynamic count data. The model has desirable theoretical properties and is trivial to incorporate into existing models for the count data. In this study, the multiplicative autoregressive counting model for dynamic counting data is improved. The model has ideal theoretical properties and can be easily incorporated into existing economic models of counting data, especially for power supply policy analyses.</jats:p>",

A full-scale ultra-wide tunnel model was constructed based on the FDS and the fire parameters were analyzed, such as the longitudinal spread distance of smoke, the smoke layer height and the temperature at safe height. In addition, the smoke exhaust efficiency was calculated based on the mass flux of CO2, and the smoke control effect with different smoke exhaust patterns and air supply volumes was compared. Results show that the smoke exhaust patterns and air supply ratios have a great influence on smoke spread distance and exhaust efficiency. The smoke spread distance is shortened by increasing the longitudinal air supply volume, and when the ratio of air supply volume to smoke exhaust volume is less than 50%, the top exhaust pattern can control the spread of smoke better with a smaller smoke spread distance. In addition, the height of the smoke layer is controlled above the safe height of 2 m under the top smoke exhaust, and the temperature at both ends of the tunnel (25 °C) is lower than that under the sidewall exhaust pattern (35 °C). The smoke exhaust efficiency was calculated based on the mass flow rate of CO2, and the exhaust efficiency of the top exhaust pattern (~70%) is significantly higher than that of the sidewall exhaust pattern (~55%). However, as the air supply volume increases, there is a reduced increase in the exhaust efficiency. Therefore, taking the economic cost into account, the air supply ratios of 30% and 50% are the best for top and sidewall exhaust patterns, respectively. The results of this work provide important information about smoke distribution characteristics in an ultra-wide tunnel fire and may guide its design of smoke exhaust.</jats:p>"

A pricing-strategy model of an NGSC and a GSC was conducted by considering the cross-price effects. The equilibrium strategies (the optimal green-technology level, the pricing, and the profits) were achieved and were comparatively analyzed with backward induction. For more in-depth research, a robust sensitivity analysis was conducted, and the Taguchi method was used to identify the main factors that affect the revenues of NGSCs and GSCs. The results show that the vertical collaboration between manufacturers and retailers can help to improve the greenness of products and bring more benefits to consumers. The government interventions have an effect, and when the government sets a premeditated threshold for subsidies and taxation, GSC members can earn more, and the green products obtain more competitiveness. The green preferences of consumers are the primarily conducive factor to the sustainability and profit increases of GSCs. However, the green-technology-investment cost will not have a significant influence on the equilibrium strategies.</jats:p>"

The study designs a business process for the IoT architecture implementation and utilizes Goal Programming to evaluate and optimize the performance of the IoT architecture into the supply chain. The implementation design involves farmers, suppliers, and exporting firms to operate the measurement and monitoring devices and accessible information for stakeholders. A minimum set of IoT devices was determined for a particular minimum product flow and required minimum information flow to achieve the optimum postharvest loss reduction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In alignment with the ever-growing interest in adopting sustainable practices, this paper devises a cold supply chain (CSC) planning model that integrates the three pillars of sustainability into the decision-making process while accounting for the shift towards clean energy sources. Interrelated decisions pertaining to production-distribution strategy, backorder and inventory levels, choice of truck type, and selection of third-party logistics (3PLs) providers are jointly optimized. For global CSCs in specific, such decisions are particularly sensitive to the energy sources of the refrigerated facilities and the accompanying levels of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions generated. As such, a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed and then solved <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> the weighted-sum method. In essence, the model seeks to operationalize sustainability goals by considering the rapidly evolving transition in energy sources across different regions when deciding on which 3PLs to engage in a contractual agreement with while adjusting the production and distribution strategy accordingly. The practical relevance of the model is illustrated using a case study drawn from the North American frozen food industry. The conducted trade-off analysis indicates the possibility of obtaining a drastic improvement of 86% in jobs’ stability levels (social measure) with a maximum cost increase of around 9% as compared to the economic measure. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that it is possible to reduce 71% of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions while attaining 63% reduction in worker variations at the expense of only 4.47% cost increase once compared to solely optimizing the economic objective.</jats:p>",

Comprehensive examinations also suggest that SCF may speed up cash turnovers, lower financing costs, and improve firm values. In addition, the impact is more substantial on firms of smaller sizes, located in better-developed regions, those without bank–firm connections, and those with higher environmental dynamism. However, the impact seems similar on private firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), or across industries of various degrees of competition.

Integrated nutrient management, such as nitrogen rate × foliar zinc × sulphur fertilization combined with durum wheat varieties were investigated in order to examine the dynamics of yield and yield related physio-morphological traits under drought conditions. The four durum wheat varieties, three-level of nutrient supply (i.e. control, sulphur, and zinc), and two nitrogen regimes (i.e. zero and 60 kg ha−1) were arranged in split-split plot design with three replications. Zinc and sulphur were applied as foliar fertilisation during the flag leaf stage, both at a rate of 3 and 4 liters ha-1, respectively. Results showed existence of genetic variability for grain yield, plant height, NDVI, SPAD and spike density. Foliar based application of zinc and sulphur at the latter stage improved the plant height. Nitrogen fertilized varieties with lower spike numbers showed to better yield formation. Co-fertilization of nitrogen and zinc improved grain yield of responsive varieties like Duragold by about 21.3%. Spikes per m2 were statistically insignificant for grain yield improvement. It could be inferred that the observed positive effect of sulphur, nitrogen and zinc application on physio-morphology and yield formation substantiates the need to include these essential nutrients in the cultivation system of durum wheat.</jats:p>"

As a final product, a desktop application TankOPT was developed that is easy to run and use on a PC with a user-friendly interface for data entry (data on maximum daily consumption and the pattern of daily water consumption). A software solution was created based on a numerical model that simplifies the usual manual calculations using known spreadsheet software and solves this problem. The solution was determined with combinations of the start and duration of water pumping in the water tank, for which the minimum required volume of the tank is obtained.

Nevertheless, the literature related to carbon emission has focused on manufacturers and their potential for emission reduction. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the role of the retailing sector in reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, this study considers emission-sensitive demands which are faced by an r-store (brick and mortar retailer) and an e-store (online retailer) under different channel power structures. The competition between the channel members is modeled using game theory for the following channel structures, i.e., (i) r-store and e-store have commensurate channel power, (ii) r-store holds higher channel power, and (iii) e-store holds higher channel power. Equilibrium analysis was carried out to obtain the optimal pricing strategies and the r-store’s optimal profit and e-store. Further, the pricing strategies and resulting sales volumes were compared analytically and followed by a numerical validation. Three subcases were considered under numerical examples based on the parameter values with special reference to the base demand. It was found that competition between the r-store and the e-store having commensurate channel power will make them worse off. Therefore, the channel leadership is neither helping the r-store nor the e-store obtain more profit when the customer demand is emission sensitive.</jats:p>"

So this research aims to evaluate the factors that have the potential to cause the return process by using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) Methodology. This research case study was conducted on a textile company that serves orders for school uniforms, office uniforms, moslem clothes, etc. Nine factors were identified, that are: off-season, overstock, delivery error, incorrect size, incorrect color, quality issue, change mind, damaged item, and incorrect product, which are the reasons consumers carry out the return process. The results of the ISM-based model and MICMAC analysis mapping show that the quality issue factor is the key reason for consumers to make the return process. The strategy of handling presses return in connection with these factors is carried out by developing a system that supports customer support work to maintain consumer loyalty. Through the ISM methodology, companies can simplify complex problems, so they focus on the factors that are the root of the problem to be able to design strategies to deal with them.</jats:p>"

These features are expected to enhance availability, recoverability, promptness and robustness, thereby contributing to the resilience of power supply. Thanks to the peculiar design features of SMRs, they are likely to satisfy a number of Functional Requirements (FRs) for this objective, namely: (i) low vulnerability to external hazards; (ii) natural circulation of primary coolant; (iii) prompt, unlimited and independent core cooling under shutdown conditions; (iv) shutdown avoidance in response to variations of the offsite power supply quality and electrical load; (v) island mode operation; (vi) robust load-following; (vii) independent, self-cranking start. These make advanced Nuclear Power Plants (aNPPs) comprised of SMRs perfect candidates to withstand a broader range of natural disruptions and to recover faster from them, compared to conventional Nuclear Power Plants (cNPPs), thus rendering them a major potential asset for guaranteeing resilience and security of power supply. The review focuses on Natural Technological (NaTech) events that impact a typical Integrated Energy System (IESs) within which SMRs are embedded: IESs are, indeed, being developed to integrate different power generation plants with gas facilities, through gas and electricity infrastructures, because they are expected to bring increased security and resilience of power supply, as shown in the qualitative case study presented.</jats:p>"

Border restrictions forced countless businesses to close either permanently or temporarily. However, the food industry is an essential sector that needs to be operational during a pandemic. Although the food industry has proactively worked towards fulfilling human needs, the food supply chain (FSC) faced numerous challenges, forcing SC managers to rethink their business strategy to cater to consumer demands effectively. In a pandemic situation, manufacturing operations need to repurpose and adapt to produce different high-demand products. Resilience initiatives help fight disruption phases in an uncertain environment by building capacity to resist and recover to a better position. This study identifies 14 key enablers to develop a resilient FSC and reveals the most significant enablers in India. We used a hybrid Delphi-interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (Fuzzy-DEMATEL) methodology to achieve these goals. The Delphi technique identified essential enablers, while the ISM analyzed the interrelationship among enablers and level of importance in a hierarchical structural model. Finally, the Fuzzy-DEMATEL categorized the enablers into the cause-effect group. This study helps SC decision-makers recognize the enablers and the contextual and causal relationships to improve resilience initiatives. It also helps them repurpose their manufacturing operations and shift to other highly required and high-demand production.\n</jats:p>",

Access to safe water and sanitary means of waste disposal is universal needs and indeed basic human rights. Besides, they are essential elements of human development and poverty alleviation and constitute an obligatory component of primary health care. The main objective of this study is to assess issues, challenges and management of urban household water supply: in case of Durame city, Kambata Tembaro Zone, SNNP Region. The study is descriptive in its nature and both qualitative and quantitative research Approach with a sample size of 120 which selected through systematic random sampling method used. Interview questionnaires were employed for data collection. Lastly the data were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools like frequency and percentage. The study findings revealed that factors like, shortage of water at the sources; rapid population growth, electric power failure, and rapid urbanization were classified to be main causes of water supply shortage to the city communities. The gap between demand and output is increasing from year to year as a result of the aforementioned primary factors. Water source for the city entirely relying only on groundwater is not enough. The study therefore recommends that the groundwater source has to be enlarged by surface water through water conservation techniques. Therefore, as a long- run solution to water supply shortage in the city great attention should be given for surface water development. Furthermore, surface water might serve as a recharging source for groundwater sources in the surrounding area. Through water conservation techniques around the water potential areas (boreholes sites) groundwater have to be recharged so as to balance the recharging and discharging rates. On the other hand, bottom-up community engagement should be promoted, and existing women's groups such as religious, trade, and professional associations should be involved in order to debate how to utilize water responsibly.</jats:p>"

Despite government efforts to improve access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and the implementation of various harm reduction initiatives, overdose mortality remains unacceptably high. Although effective treatments exist for OUD (eg, opioid agonist therapies like buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone), many individuals do not achieve stabilization with these medications. Tablet injectable opioid agonist therapy (TiOAT) is an initiative being piloted in British Columbia to provide witnessed access to a safer opioid supply for individuals with treatment-refractory OUD. The program offers participants a safer opioid supply through physician-prescribed pharmaceutical-grade hydromorphone tablets. TiOAT is suitable for individuals with severe OUD who are actively injecting opioids and are refractory to conventional OUD treatment. As such, a scale-up of the TiOAT program may be a feasible alternative to address persistent opioid-related deaths in North America, while minimizing potential harms associated with unwitnessed safer supply opioid prescribing (eg, diversion and overdose). Although a comprehensive evaluation of TiOAT is of critical importance (including an assessment of the program’s adverse events), completion of the evaluation should not preclude scale-up of the program in the interim as a strategy to reduce opioid-related harms.</jats:p>",

Improvements in preoperative management, surgical technique, and postoperative care have allowed increasingly complicated and high-risk patients to be safely transplanted. As a result, many patients are safely transplanted in the modern era that would have been considered untransplantable in times gone by. Despite this, more gains are possible as the science behind transplantation is increasingly understood. Normothermic machine perfusion of liver grafts builds on these gains further by increasing the safe use of grafts with suboptimal features, through objective assessment of both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte function. This technology can minimize cold ischemia, but prolong total preservation time, with particular benefits for suboptimal grafts and surgically challenging recipients. In addition to more physiological and favorable preservation conditions for grafts with risk factors for poor outcome, the extended preservation time benefits operative logistics by allowing a careful explant and complicated vascular reconstruction when presented with challenging surgical scenarios. This technology represents a significant advancement in graft preservation techniques and the transplant community must continue to incorporate this technology to ensure the benefits of liver transplant are maximized.</jats:p>"

A lack of coordination between transportation and land-use planning has created an imbalanced provision of transportation infrastructure and land-use patterns; this is indicated by places where a high-density land-development pattern is supported by a low-capacity transport system or vice versa. With this, literature suggests that Mixed Land-Use (MLU) developments have the potential to provide relevant solutions for urban sustainability, smart growth, inclusive public transit use, and efficient land-use. Therefore, this study employed deep neural network models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—for forecasting the effect of transportation supply on the MLU pattern at the parcel level in the Jiang’an District, Wuhan, China. The findings revealed a strong relationship between the supply of public transportation and MLU. Moreover, the study results indicated that MLU is widely available in areas with high accessibility, high density, and proximity to the city center. The forecasting results from the MLP and LSTM models showed an average error of 5.55–7.36% and 3.62–4.28% for mixed use, respectively, while most of their 90th percentile errors were less than 13.73% and 10.46% for mixed use, respectively.

Based on the simulation data, influences of factors of “policy effect,” “recovery delay time,” “recovery strengthening,” and “recovery channel competitions” on the CLSC are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the order amplification and inventory amplification are all better than those of the traditional supply chain. Demands for remanufactured products and new products both reach the stable states in the later period. In addition, the variance analysis indicates that all the factors have a significant effect on the order and inventory amplifications in CLSC.

At the same time, information technologies such as the Internet and communication networks have become increasingly mature and widely used, making e-commerce transactions simpler and the roles of enterprises in the supply chain increasingly diversified. At this stage, supply chain finance has become an important way for small- and medium-sized enterprises to finance, and it is a key step in commercial trade. However, the risk control of this model is difficult to be effectively contained. How to control its financial risk to the lowest level is the research goal of this paper. This paper analyzes and calculates the supply chain financial risks of different enterprises through a questionnaire method, a case analysis method, and a comparison method and obtains relevant data. The data results show that the entropy value of the net interest rate is 0.97, which indicates that it has a larger market share and less risk. Through wireless multimedia communication technology and artificial intelligence algorithms, the system calculation of supply chain financial risk management is much simpler. In this regard, the research proposes a scientific system for building supply chain financial risk management.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a design scheme of original-auxiliary dual power supply for household energy storage inverters, so that the inverter uses a large-capacity power supply when it is loaded with medium or large loads, and uses a small-capacity power supply when it is loaded with light loads or no load, and avoids large losses caused by the two-stage inverter when using a large-capacity power supply with a small load with the purpose of energy saving. The solution adopts a peak detection circuit on the AC power supply side, which can accurately detect the tiny current when the 1∼3W-load is connected, so as to accurately judge the access and exit of the load, so that the power supply can enter or exit the power saving mode of the small-capacity power supply in a timely and flexible manner. In this paper, the feasibility and rationality of the scheme are tested by simulation, and it is proved that the power saving effect of the scheme is remarkable.</jats:p>",

Stakeholder analysis and social network analysis concepts are considered to scrutinize the WSUD approach's role in an urban multi-stakeholder area. Detecting the changing of the stakeholders' powers and interests in an urban area using stakeholder analysis and enlightening the conflicting relationships between the stakeholders using social network analysis, the role of the WSUD approach is emphasized as a dispute resolution method. The western part of Tehran city is considered a case study. WSUD tools are considered using a physical-behavioral simulation model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One way to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, is for society to move towards a biobased economy, where fossil resources are replaced by biobased ones. This replacement requires the development of biobased supply chains that differ significantly from the conventional supply chain. For example, seasonality and variability of the feedstocks create specific challenges for biobased systems and call for customized solutions for the design and operation of biobased chains. As a result, the modelling efforts to support decision-making processes for biobased logistics and supply chains have some different requirements. This paper presents a systematic literature review on logistics and supply chain modelling studies for the biobased economy published in a period of 2011–2020. The literature analysis shows that most modelling studies for the biobased economy are strategic optimization models aiming to minimize economic impact. As biomass source, forest and agricultural residues are mostly used, and fuel and energy are the most common biobased applications. Modelling strategies, biomass sources and applications are however diversifying, which is what we encourage for future research. Also, not only focusing on economic optimization but also optimizing social and environmental performance is an important future research direction, to deal with the sustainability challenges the world is facing.</jats:p>"

The expediency of application of self-organization methods of models of complex systems for modeling of power consumption based on the principles of inductive modeling was substantiated. Power consumption modeling was performed using neural networks based on iterative algorithms of the group method of data handling. The use of GMDH neural networks provided automatic structural-parametric identification of the model. The search for the optimal structure of the model was performed in three classes of support functions of neural networks. As a result of the algorithm of synthesis of models, the set of models-candidates having optimum structure in its class was formed. The obtained models have high modeling quality and low forecast error. Complicating the structure of the neural network does not significantly improve the quality of modeling results. The selection of the best structure of the model was made from the standpoint of multicriteria selection using a morphometric approach. Previously, all the criteria were reduced to one type according to the function of the goal and the procedure of their normalization was performed. The best structure of the model was chosen taking into account the area of the figure formed by the normalized values of the selection criteria. The polynomial GMDH neural network of the first order was chosen as the power consumption model. Deviations of actual and model values of power consumption do not exceed 1%. The usage of GMDH neural networks as an algorithm for model synthesis, supplemented by multi-criteria selection of the best model structure, allowed making an unambiguous choice of the structure of the power consumption model, suitable for determining the energy baseline.</jats:p>",

In this context, the present teaching case proposes the analysis of regulatory and corporate standards on the resources raised with this tariff, and the treatment of these resources in the light of the Accounting Theory and the Accounting Technical statements issued by  CPC. Built from the financial statements of CAESB, together with documents published by the concessionaire and the regulatory agency, it is pointed out that the company complies with the one established by the regulatory agency, but practices additional operations that are not clarified in explanatory notes. The purpose of this case is to discuss the recognition of the contingency tariff as other revenues. Upon considering that the regulations restrict access to and use of the resources derived from this tariff, recognition as a provision would provide preservation of the concessionaire's economic-financial health. In this teaching case, therefore, it is noteworthy that accounting practices regarding the contingency tariff may not be in compliance with the current accounting statements and the accounting theory, thus allowing discussion and application of key accounting concepts for students of undergraduate and graduate courses in the area.</jats:p>"

The data were obtained from 179 SMEs involving 537 respondents in nine districts of Bali, Indonesia. Furthermore, a partial least square modelling was used to evaluate the proposed supply chain performance model. The present study generated three important findings; 1) supply chain collaboration has a significant effect on supply chain capability, innovation performance and supply chain performance, 2) innovation performance has no significant effect on supply chain performance, and 3) knowledge sharing acts as a moderating variable of the relation-ship between supply chain collaboration and innovation performance.

Analysis of the supply–demand relationship of rural homesteads is an important prerequisite for the implementation of rural homestead withdrawal and transformation, which is important for improving rural residential quality and land-use efficiency, promoting sustainable development and the classified revitalization of rural areas. Based on high-resolution remote sensing images of typical villages in traditional agricultural areas, a participatory evaluation method was used to analyze the supply–demand balance of rural homesteads and to propose countermeasures for their withdrawal and transformation. The results showed that: 1) rural homesteads have gradually realized the separation of living space and production space, the living function has gradually been enhanced, the production function has gradually weakened, and the ecological aesthetic function has emerged. 2) Farmers’ demand for rural homesteads is driven by various factors, including social and economic development level, lifestyle and livelihood. 3) There are a large number of idle or abandoned rural homesteads in traditional agricultural areas, with great withdrawal potential. The difference between the supply and demand of rural homesteads in use is obvious. The supply of living space of adobe house and mud-brick houses is less than the demand for them, and there is mixed use of space. The supply of production space for brick houses is less than the demand; in general, the supply of buildings is greater than the demand. 4) For rural homesteads still in use, exit and transformation strategies should be formulated according to the relationship between supply and demand, construction quality, spatial independence, and the wishes of farmers. The withdrawal and transformation of rural homesteads based on the balance between supply and demand is in line with the reality of rural development and the Chinese government’s strategy of national rural revitalization.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the current investigation focused on enhancing both the evaporation rate in the absorber basin and the condensation rate over the top glass simultaneously. In this regard, the evaporation rate is enhanced by using a hollow-finned absorber basin with energy storage and novel pond fibres in the absorber basin. Likewise, the sisal fibre with a water dripping arrangement is utilized for enhancing the condensation over the top glass. The investigations on the CSS and the modified solar still (MSS) with hollow fins and energy storage, pond fibres, and sisal fibres are conducted to analyze the effect of energy storage and natural fibres on the distillate production. It is observed that the water temperatures of the MSS are increased by 12% and the glass temperatures of the MSS are reduced by 30% relative to the CSS. The outcomes reported that the productivity of the MSS is enhanced by 126%. Furthermore, the cost per litre (CPL) and the payback period (PP) of the MSS are 38.5 and 49.3% lesser than the CPL and the PP of the CSS, respectively.</jats:p>",

The selection of the transition phase of the reactive power vertical compensation device at the traction substation is determined by the need to symmetrize the traction load. It is recommended that reactive power vertical compensation devices be included in the phase lag phase at the traction substation. It should be noted that during the installation of the RGK, the voltage increase in the contact network of the traction power supply network should not exceed the maximum allowable value of 29 kV. In the case of resistance selection, it is necessary to take into account the minimum cost of cargo from other substations.

For doing so, we set our context to select the best big data practices amongst the available alternatives based on retail supply chain performance. We have applied TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-criteria Decision Making) for the selection of the best big data analytics tools among the identified nine practices (data science, neural networks, enterprise resource planning, cloud computing, machine learning, data mining, RFID, Blockchain and IoT and Business intelligence) based on seven supply chain performance criteria (supplier integration, customer integration, cost, capacity utilization, flexibility, demand management, and time and value). One of the intriguing understandings from this paper is that most of the retail firms are in a dilemma between customer loyalty and cost while implementing the big data practices in their organization. This study analyses the dominance of the big data practices at the retail supply chain level. This helps the newly emerging retail firms in evaluating the best big data practice based on the importance and dominance of supply chain performance measures.</jats:p>",

In order to meet the IPCC 2 °C target, 2800 - 4500 CCS plants of 1.7 Mtpa capacity need to be commissioned between 2030 and 2060. This study identifies the bottlenecks in the deployment of different CCS technologies by evaluating technology readiness level (TRL), commercial readiness index (CRI) and the supply chain readiness index (SCRI). Given the time required to establish supply chains, an under-developed supply chain will cause us to fall short of our climate change mitigation targets. Of the issues identified, we believe most process equipment related issues do not disqualify the deployment of a specific technology. Technologies with inefficiencies or low capacity can be addressed with multiple unit operations. However, reliance on specialised materials will limit deployment. Large-scale deployment of CCS is possible with currently available technology. We wish to highlight that increasing supply chain capacity should be a high priority, and advanced planning is required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) is gaining popularity as a practical method to supply chain sustainability among academics and practitioners. However, in addition to balancing economic, social, and environmental factors, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the selection of long-term suppliers to ensure sustainable supply chains, recover better from the pandemic and effectively respond to any future unprecedented crises. The purpose of this study is to assess and choose a possible supplier based on their capability to adapt to the COVID-19 epidemic in a sustainable manner. For this assessment, a framework based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is provided that integrates spherical fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (SF-AHP) and grey Complex Proportional Assessment (G-COPRAS), in which spherical fuzzy sets and grey numbers are used to express the ambiguous linguistic evaluation statements of experts. In the first stage, the evaluation criteria system is identified through a literature review and experts’ opinions. The SF-AHP is then used to determine the criteria weights. Finally, the G-COPRAS method is utilized to select sustainable suppliers. A case study in the automotive industry in Vietnam is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach’s effectiveness. From the SF-AHP findings, “quality”, “use of personal protective equipment”, “cost/price”, “safety and health practices and wellbeing of suppliers”, and “economic recovery programs” have been ranked as the five most important criteria. From G-COPRAS analysis, THACO Parts (Supplier 02) is the best supplier. A sensitivity study was also conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed model, in which the priority rankings of the best suppliers are very similar. For long-term development and increased competitiveness, industrial businesses must stress the integration of response mechanisms during SSS implementation in the COVID-19 epidemic, according to the findings. This will result in significant cost and resource savings, as well as reduced environmental consequences and a long-term supply chain, independent of the crisis.</jats:p>"

Global supply chains in maritime container transportation depend to the complex interaction of participants (from the supplier and carrier to the terminal operator), where many problems arise due to the lack of a clear work algorithm for each party. With supply chains distributed across global markets, container shipping is now an important element of the transport system having a significant advantage. The general characteristics of transport activity in container supply chains are listed. The imbalance in trade flows and limited capacity complicate the realization of all the advantages in this type of transportation. Insufficient knowledge of the chain interaction of maritime transport has been stated, a review of the main problems in global supply chains in the field of maritime container transportation was carried out, as well as an analysis of existing works on the proposed topic. For further research, it is recommended to pay attention to the problem of coordination of container transportation of the supply chain, to study the issue of pricing and risk management, competition in transportation by sea container ships, and also to consider performance management in the supply chain of this type of transport. Conclusions are drawn about the need for additional research and the application of methods and tools for managing operations to optimize work without financial losses for all participants in the container transportation chains.</jats:p>",

This paper analyzes the hydraulic transient process of the water supply system with air tanks, and proposes a joint protection method with an air tank behind the pump and air valves at the end of the pipeline. The function and coupling relationship of the air tank and air valves are clarified, the theoretical analysis system and numerical optimization framework of the joint protection layout scheme are constructed, and the potential hidden trouble conditions are discussed. A setting method of combined air valves is proposed to eliminate the possible water and gas problems in the pipeline. Combined with the actual project, the water hammer protection effects of different protection schemes are compared and analyzed. The results show that this joint protection scheme can effectively protect against water hammer damage, and greatly reduce the volume of the air tank compared to a single air tank protection.</jats:p>",

However, in designing clean power generation microgrids, the economic aspects of using renewable energy technologies should be considered. Furthermore, due to the unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources, the reliability of renewable energy microgrids should also be evaluated. Optimized hybrid microgrids based on wind and solar energy can provide cost-effective power generation systems with high reliability. These microgrids can meet the power demands of the consuming units, especially in remote areas. Various techniques have been used to optimize the size of power generation systems based on renewable energy to improve efficiency, maintain reliability, improve the power grid’s resilience, and reduce system costs. Each of these techniques has shown its advantages and disadvantages in optimizing the size of hybrid renewable energy systems. To increase the share of renewable energies in electricity supply in the future and develop these new technologies further, this paper reviews the latest and most efficient techniques used to optimize green microgrids from an economical and reliable perspective to achieve a clean, economical, and highly reliable microgrid.</jats:p>"

Using a mean-variance framework, we analyze the supply chain members financing and ordering decisions in two cases: symmetric and asymmetric retailer risk aversion threshold information. In the case of symmetric information, we characterize the conditions under which both the supplier and the retailer prefer BEF or TEF. In the case of asymmetric information, we demonstrate that the retailer has an incentive to pretend to be less risk averse. To prevent this distortion behavior, we design a minimum quantity contract for the supplier. Finally, we extend our model to a bank loan-trade credit-equity mixed financing mode (BTEF) in which the retailer can borrow from the bank and the supplier and seeks financial support from investors. The numerical simulations support our results.</jats:p>",

Promoting the stable collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain is an urgent problem. Considering the characteristic demand of consumers for agricultural products, this paper takes the supply chain mainly operating characteristic agricultural products and dominated by farmer cooperatives as the research object and constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of farmer cooperatives, manufacturers, and retailers. We study the supply chain collaboration mechanism from the main strategy choice and the specific factors affecting its strategy choice. The results show that farmer cooperatives implement a strict supervision strategy and increase the reward and punishment to promote the collaboration in the supply chain, but the increase in supervision cost is not conducive to the income of farmer cooperatives. In the case of loose supervision, the difference between the additional income and the collaboration input is higher than the “free-rider” income obtained when adopting a non-collaboration strategy, which is conducive to its evolution towards collaboration. In addition, increasing additional income, improving synergy coefficient, and reducing collaboration input and “free-rider” income will increase the probability of the system evolving to Pareto optimal, and accelerate the realization of comprehensive collaboration in the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives. The research results provide a certain supplement to the related research on agricultural product supply chains in theory, and provide a reference for the comprehensive collaboration of the agricultural product supply chain dominated by farmer cooperatives in practice.</jats:p>"

Since the specifications of joints are different in each country, evaluating joints are difficult to manage the functional maintenance of water network system. In this study, two metallic and three non-metallic pipe joints were selected through the joints commonly used in Korea. PGD simulation could be conducted through Four-point bending test which derives the result of deflection angle, moment, and strain value for damaged pipes. Each component showed above M-1 grade which resulted based on the grade of ISO 16134. To compare metallic pipe results, collar joint showed stronger binding force than the mechanical joint, but in deflection angle result mechanical showed higher value. In non-metallic pipe test, since its material contains large flexibility, strain value mainly affected its result. Based on this study, functional evaluation of water supply pipeline regarding the PGD was identified through comparing tendency of each joint characterization. Moreover, these data can be expected to be utilized as the basis of performance evaluation and critical component in piping design.</jats:p>"

Supply chain members improve the channel service level and increase the corresponding channel price. The supply chain can get the most advantages when manufacturers and retailers make centralized decisions.

The present work examines the environmental flow, channel metamorphosis, and fluvial functionality of the Damodar River in the context of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) dams and development. Structural (dams, barrages, weirs, etc.) and non-structural (urban–industrial and agricultural disposal with effluents, sand mining, etc.) interventions hinder the ecological functionality of the river. This study portrays that the eco-geomorphological behaviour and fluvial functionality of the river have changed due to flow alteration and diversion by dams and barrages and due to rapid urban–industrial and agricultural growth in the basin area. These changes have affected riverine ecological integrity. The ecological functionality level of this study area ranges from 85 to 181, i.e. from poor to good–fair. The ecological functionality level in the sample channel sections (i.e., the immediate upstream and downstream of the Durgapur Barrage) is poor, and the value ranges from 61 to 100 due to the hydrological impact of the barrage and the Durgapur urban–industrial belt. This assessment work will help to restore the fluvial environment for humans as well as riverine biota.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS Dams and barrages have altered the hydrological flow regimes, affecting the eco-geomorphological behaviour of alluvial channels.

It is suitable for meeting time-sensitive demands, such as the outbreak of disasters or epidemics/pandemics. Compared to traditional manufacturing, FiB poses a new challenge of frequently reconfiguring supply chain networks since the final production location changes as the vehicle carrying the factory travels. Supply chain network reconfiguration involves decisions regarding whether suppliers or manufacturers can be retained in the supply chain or replaced. Such a supply chain reconfiguration problem is coupled with manufacturing process planning, which assigns tasks to each manufacturer that impacts material flow in the supply chain network. Considering the supply chain reconfigurability, this article develops a new mathematical model based on nonlinear integer programming to optimize supply chain reconfiguration and assembly planning jointly. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is developed and customized to the joint optimization of process planning and supplier/manufacturer selection. The performance of EA is verified with a nonlinear solver for a relaxed version of the problem. A case study on producing a medical product demonstrates the methodology in guiding supply chain reconfiguration and process planning as the final production site relocates in response to local demands. The methodology can be potentially generalized to supply chain and service process planning for a mobile hospital offering on-site medical services.</jats:p>",

In an effort to develop its business operations, it is known that PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk implements its management strategy through ERP and Supply Chain Management systems. The ERP system at PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk functions as an information integration tool for all company stakeholders, while Supply Chain Management functions as a tool for monitoring the flow of goods to consumers and the amount of inventory. Thus, the two strategies are related to the certainty of the performance of Unilever employees. This paper aims to analyze the performance and the relationship between supply chain management, and the effect of the ERP system implemented by Unilever companies on operational performance through interaction and communication of information in order to be efficient in implementing supply chain management strategies and ERP systems. The research method uses a document study approach, as well as primary and secondary data collection techniques. The results of the study reveals that the Supply Chain Management strategy of PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk has four components, namely supply chain uncertainty, management of economies of scale, selection of transportation modes, and product inventory control; as well as the ERP and Supply Chain Management systems of PT Unilever Indonesia Tbk have a positive and significant impact on the company's performance so as to obtain profits and achieve company goals.</jats:p>"

More and more tourism product providers (TPPs) use online travel agencies (OTAs) and offline travel agencies (TA) to sell their tourism products. With increasing consumption, service quality has also become an important factor for consumers to choose tourism products. Analysing the effect of service quality on pricing, demand, and profits under centralised and decentralised decisions helps the tourism industry development more sustainably. The study found that the level of the TPP service quality has a positive effect on channel pricing and demand, while the effects of the OTA and TA service quality on channel pricing and profits are affected by the sensitivity of consumer testing to cross-channel prices and services. The results of a comparative analysis of centralised and decentralised decisions show that supply chain members cannot reach an optimal state under the decentralised decision method. Supply chain optimisation is achieved through wholesale price contracts coordinating the distribution of profits among supply chain members. This study used numerical examples to verify the validity of the relevant conclusions and to the coordination mechanism, and propose some managerial implications. This work is pioneering in that it develops a dual-channel tourism supply chain with OTA channel participation, taking into account the service quality of all the members in the tourism supply chain. It suggests further research direction in studying sustainable tourism supply chain development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Covid‐19 pandemic is triggering several supply chain disruptions that have a tremendous impact on firms’ activities. Consequently, firms have pushed suppliers to develop their disruption orientation through the exchange of information and collaboration with the aim to enhance their own performance. Although this is important from the industry perspective, relationships among the focal firm's disruption orientation, the suppliers’ disruption orientation, and the focal firm's performances have not been investigated in the literature. Hence, in order to fill this important gap, we investigate both (i) how the suppliers’ disruption orientation helps translate the focal firm's disruption orientation into environmental and economic performances and (ii) how the supplier ecocentricity (ability to learn from nontraditional stakeholders) is related to these relationships. In order to analyze these issues, we draw upon the dynamic capabilities, relational view, and stakeholder resource‐based view theories. Our results indicate that the focal firm's disruption orientation creates a positive association between its suppliers’ disruption orientation and its own environmental and economic performances. Further, our results reveal that the association between the firm's disruption orientation and environmental performance is not necessarily direct and occurs through the suppliers’ disruption orientation. Our study also reveals that the positive association between the focal firm's disruption orientation and environmental performance through suppliers’ disruption orientation is stronger under medium and high levels of suppliers’ ecocentricity. Our results provide useful managerial insights for supply chain stakeholders that could help in managing disruption orientation, especially during and after a pandemic. </jats:p>",

Rice quality and safety problems have occurred frequently, which seriously affect human health. The rice supply chain is characterized by complex links, discrete data, and numerous types of hazardous substances. Strengthening the information management and control capabilities of the rice supply chain is an important means to ensure the quality and safety of rice. Based on multi-chain collaboration, we have conducted research on information management and control of the rice supply chain. First, a multi-chain collaborative model of “blockchain + sub-chain” is designed. Based on this model, the following four mechanisms are designed: a trusted chain mechanism, a multi-level sub-chain encryption mechanism, a trusted supervision mechanism, and a hierarchical consensus mechanism. These mechanisms jointly serve the multi-chain collaborative management and control of the rice supply chain information. Secondly, smart contracts and operating procedures are designed, and a comparative analysis of them is executed. Finally, the design and implementation of the prototype system is carried out, and an example is verified and analyzed in a grain enterprise. Results show that this model serves the information supervision of the rice supply chain by studying the multi-chain collaboration. The study solves the real-time data interaction problem between each link of the rice supply chain. The credible management of information and control of the rice supply chain is accomplished. This study applies new information technology to the coordination and resource sharing of the food supply chain and provides ideas for the digital transformation of the food industry.</jats:p>"

Against this backdrop, this study employed various econometric techniques to study the nexus between clean energy supply in Nigeria and industrial development between 1990 and 2019. This study sets to establish the nature of the relationship in the long run, direction of causality and the stochastic dynamic interaction between clean energy supply and industrial development in Nigeria. Consequently, the following findings emerged from this study; clean energy supply and manufacturing value added had a significant negative relationship. This implies that the contribution of clean energy supply is negatively significant to the manufacturing value added in the Country. Therefore, the supply of electricity production from hydroelectric sources had not led to industrial development in Nigeria. Further evidence indicates that no feedback relationship exists between clean energy supply and industrial development. Also, the stochastic dynamic interaction between clean energy supply and industrial development shows a shock to manufacturing value added determines the behavior of clean energy supply to a larger extent in one hand, whereas, variance decomposition of clean energy supply shows the similar effect on the behavior of industrial development on the other hand. In the light of the findings from this study, the following recommendations are made for the policymakers in Nigeria; in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7), clean energy supply could be explored for future industrial development in Nigeria, thought it currently lacks the capacity to drive the manufacturing sector of the economy. And as such, the Nigerian policymakers and other stakeholders should work hard to achieve sustainable supply of adequate electricity production from hydroelectric sources in the country.</jats:p>"

Complexities are increasing in both predictor datasets (including climate‐science products) and in predictive models employed instead of linear regression within the PCR framework (including artificial intelligence), potentially complicating cross‐validation for model evaluation. We explored these issues with 300 modeling experiments on two high‐impact and hydroclimatically diverse basins in the western United States, the Truckee River (Sierra Nevada) and Rio Grande headwaters (southern Rockies), using five different PCR and PCR‐like machine learning models. The results suggest out‐of‐sample error is satisfactorily estimated by applying cross‐validation to only the final, supervised learning, step of PCR/PCR‐like procedures. The outcome facilitates streamlined algorithms and potentially reduced computational times for more complex emerging model architectures and datasets; provides reassurance around a possible inability to perform genuinely complete cross‐validation when predictors include certain complex and externally sourced data sources; and may reflect mitigation of overtraining by geophysical process‐informed model development protocols normally used during feature selection in operational water supply forecast (WSF). The results provide practical guidance helping support the design of next‐generation WSF models.</jats:p>",

Institutionalization risks were associated with the supply of beds and proximity to an asylum, but also dependent on families’ unmet demand for care of relatives.

With the progress of economic internationalization, economic and trade ties around the world have become closer and closer, and the level of international business exchanges has been improved. The rise of multinational e-commerce has also caused unprecedented difficulties to multinational logistics and supply chain management. The application of deep neural networks in various fields provides opportunities for cross-border e-commerce platforms to solve these problems. The existing logistics distribution model cannot keep up with the development of CBEC and has become a constraint and bottleneck for the development of CBEC. Therefore, this article introduces deep learning neural network to cross-border logistics and supply chain based on the analysis of the existing cross-border logistics model and supply chain model and the status quo of e-commerce development. It optimizes the existing cross-border logistics and supply chain network in order to break through the current bottleneck in the development of CBEC. This paper shows through research that introducing deep learning neural networks into CBEC logistics and supply chain can improve the efficiency of logistics and supply chain. Compared with the previous efficiency, the efficiency of network optimization can be increased to about 50%, reducing the cost of cross-border logistics and supply chain. The research in this article has great theoretical and guiding significance for the development of CBEC.</jats:p>",

In this study, Fe and Mn removal from biofilters was investigated in a converted plant from November 2011 until April 2021. The plant comprises an aeration unit followed by a modified up-flow roughing filter (URF) and by two rapid sand filters (RSF) in parallel. Data analysis was based on Fe and Mn concentrations collected from 222 water analysis reports. Results showed that 98% of Fe and 95% of Mn concentrations in treated water were below the local regulatory limits of Fe &amp;lt; 0.2 mg/L and Mn &amp;lt; 0.1 mg/L. Fe was mainly removed in the URF (68%), and Mn was removed nearly equally by the URF (46%) and the RSF (47%). The combination of the URF with RSF produced total Fe and Mn removal efficiencies of 95% and 88%, respectively. No significant differences between the seasonal variation of Fe and Mn concentrations in the URG and RSF were found. The effectiveness of biofiltration technology without the use of chemical reagents or nutrient substrate additions, was demonstrated over a long-term period of monitoring.</jats:p>",

The effects of PS, CA, and Fe(II) doses on FLT degradation were tested. With the molar ratio at 60/20/5/1 of PS/Fe(II)/CA/FLT, FLT removal reached 96.3% in 120 min, much higher than 62% removal without CA at the same PS and Fe(II) doses, indicating that the addition of CA could remarkably enhance the FLT degradation. The water quality conditions (pH, anions and humic acid) were also investigated for their effects on FLT degradation. The results of probe tests, electron paramagnetic resonance detection and scavenging experiments showed that and acted predominantly on FLT degradation. The influence of surfactants on FLT degradation was examined. Furthermore, the primary degradation intermediates of FLT were detected by GC-MS and the possible degradation pathways of FLT were proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the PS/Fe(II)/CA process for the FLT degradation in actual groundwater demonstrated that the process has a great prospect for the remediation of FLT-contaminated groundwater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global warming and environmental pollution are concepts that are more or less encountered in the news and newspapers today. Protecting the environment is crucial to the survival of humanity and the many plant and animal species that inhabit the planet. Lack of control of greenhouse gases can increase the average surface temperature and lead to floods and serious damage in the near future. On the other hand, overproduction of plastics by factories can lead to environmental pollution and the destruction of many food cycles on Earth. In this study, in order to sustainability integrate issues in supply chain network design decisions, a multiobjective optimization model is presented, which is a two-level routing location problem and optimizes economic and environmental goals. The first level is decisions related to the selection of operating facilities from a set of potential facilities (manufacturers and distribution centers), and the second level is related to determining the number of products from distribution centers to retailers and from manufacturers to distribution centers. The objective function is also of the minimization type, which is related to minimizing fixed and variable costs, and minimizing the environmental effects of the whole chain, which includes reducing the costs of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions.</jats:p>",

The three‐phase unbalance of grid voltage caused by the TPSS will seriously affect traditional wind farms’ operation control. Considering the TPSS and wind farms are connected to the power system's public point of common coupling (PCC), the wind farm's current control and voltage support strategy are studied. Firstly, aiming to suppress the influence of harmonics and the unbalanced power grid caused by the TPSS, the repetitive controller (RC) is introduced to the current control of the doubly‐fed induction generator (DFIG). The vector control strategy based on the combination of proportion integral (PI) and RC is adopted, where the PI controller is used to adjust the average value of DFIG output power and the RC regulator controls DFIG output sinusoidal stator current. Secondly, the wind farm's voltage support strategy is designed to reduce the voltage fluctuation caused by the TPSS's loads. By coordinating three measures of putting in reactive power compensation devices, DFIG working in voltage control mode, and limiting DFIG output active power, the voltage of wind farm and traction station is effectively supported. Finally, a simulation model with the TPSS and wind farm is built to verify the proposed control strategy's effectiveness.</jats:p>",

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimizing the total cost, the amount of pollutants, and the number of job opportunities created in the proposed supply chain network under the uncertainty of cost, supply, and demand. In addition, to deal with uncertainty, fuzzy logic is used. Moreover, four multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms are employed to solve the model, which include a novel multi-objective version of the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm known as Multi-Objective Reptile Search Optimizer (MORSO), Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Multi-Objective Grey Wolf (MOGWO). All the algorithms are evaluated using LP-metric in small sizes and their results and performance are compared based on criteria such as Max Spread (MS), Spread of Non-Dominance Solution (SNS), the number of Pareto solutions (NPS), Mean Ideal Distance (MID), and CPU time. In addition, to achieve better results, the parameters of all algorithms are tuned by the Taguchi method. The programmed model is implemented using a real case study in Iran to confirm its accuracy and efficiency. To further evaluate the current model, some key parameters are subject to sensitivity analysis. Empirical results indicate that MORSO performed very well and by constructing solar panel sites and producing energy out of rice waste up to 19% of electricity can be saved.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the present study was conducted in sheep to determine the optimum particle size for preparation of complete feed blocks. Methods: Twenty-one adult Deccani rams (19.45±0.80 kg) of 2-3 yrs age were used in a complete randomized design to assess the effect of particle size (PS) of sorghum stover (SS) on rumen fermentation characteristics and microbial nitrogen supply. Rams were divided into 3 groups consisting of 7 animals each and fed complete feed blocks containing 8 mm (SSCFB-8), 12 mm (SSCFB-12) and 16 mm (SSCFB-16) particle sizes of the stover. Rumen liquor was collected using stomach tube from each animal at 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after feeding to assess rumen fermentation pattern. Result: Mean rumen pH was increased (P less than 0.001) with increased PS of the SS in the CFBs and the rams fed SSCFB-12 and SSCFB-16 diets were shown highest (P less than 0.001) pH values. Average ammonia nitrogen concentrations were lower (P less than 0.01) in rams fed SSCFB-16 diet compared to those fed SSCFB-12 or SSCFB-8 diets. The average total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration was decreased with increase in PS of SS in the feed blocks. The rams fed SSCFB-8 diet had shown higher (P less than 0.05) TVFA mean values than those fed SSCFB-12 or SSCFB-16 diets. Microbialnitrogen (g/day, g/kg W0.75) and protein supply (g/day, g/kg W0.75 and g/kg DOMI) was not affected by the PS of sorghum stover in complete feed blocks.Based on the results of the current study the SS ground to 8 mm can be considered as optimum for sheep fed SS based diets.\n</jats:p>"

Due to lack of alternative sources, more than 1 million inhabitants living in the Pasur river basin area rely heavily on the river water for domestic, irrigation, and industrial purposes without proper and reliable information on the water qualities and contamination types. The study aimed at evaluating the suitability and sustainability for irrigation and consumption practices, and suitable hydrogeochemical techniques and quality of Pasur river water of Sundarbon region of Bangladesh were investigated. Water samples were collected from six locations during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons and assessed for suitability for drinking and irrigation application. The water quality index (WQI) was calculated to evaluate the suitability for drinking. WQI indicates that the river water samples during both the seasons are safe for drinking in the good category. Sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), residual sodium carbonate (RSC) were investigated to assess the feasibility for agricultural applications. Most of the indices, such as SAR, Na%, and RSC results recommend that the river water is safe for irrigation. A suggestion is made that MH in river water should be controlled for the use of water in irrigation. United States Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram and Wilcox diagram analysis also identified that river water as a usable category for irrigation purposes is feasible during both seasons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preterm birth is a risk factor for the development of a multitude of diseases later in life. Preterm infants are also at risk for growth failure following parturition, which further compounds the adverse effects of preterm birth. Previous studies have shown that prematurely born human infants’ kidneys are inefficient at retaining sodium, therefore putting these infants at high risk of sodium depletion. We have developed a “post‐wean” dietary manipulation to model early‐life sodium depletion. In this model, mice are fed variations of soy‐free 2920x diet (Teklad); low‐sodium (0.04% Na, n=6), or high/normal‐sodium (0.30% Na, n=8), from weaning at week three of life, until week six of life. At six weeks of age, all mice are switched back to the “standard” 2920x diet (0.15% Na). Food and water intake behaviors, physical activity, energy expenditure, and body composition of the mice were serially analyzed using a multiplexed phenotyping system (Promethion, Sable Systems International) and time‐domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; Bruker LF110). Mice supplied low‐Na between 3‐6 weeks of age exhibited delayed growth during weeks 3‐6, then rapid “catch‐up growth” following return to “normal” diet in week 6, and similar growth kinetics to the high‐Na group thereafter (diet x age interaction p&lt;0.01). The delay in body mass expansion in the low‐Na group was due to a decrease in fat‐free mass (diet x age interaction p&lt;0.01). Mice fed low‐Na diet exhibited reduced food intake (diet p&lt;0.01), due to slower eating speed (diet p&lt;0.01) and meal size (diet p=0.01). The reduced food intake relative to body composition was sustained through 18 weeks of age (diet x age interaction p=0.93). Water intake was also increased in mice treated with low‐Na diet both during diet intervention and through 18 weeks of age (diet p&lt;0.01), due to an increased number of drinking bouts (diet p&lt;0.01) of comparable size (diet p=0.46). Total aerobic energy expenditure was increased in mice fed the low‐Na diet, even after correction for body composition (diet p&lt;0.01). Mice treated with low‐Na diet in early life also exhibited an increase in energy expenditure that was maintained through 18 weeks of age (diet x age p&gt;0.99), even after correction for body composition and for differences in food intake. Finally, mice treated with low‐Na diet demonstrate a reduction in calories that are unaccounted for by these methods (diet p&lt;0.01, diet x age interaction p=0.68). In conclusion, post‐wean sodium depletion causes growth failure and changes in body composition that parallel premature human infant growth failure. Profoundly, this relatively simple 3‐week diet switch causes changes in intake behaviors and energy expenditure that are then “programmed” for at least another 12 weeks after switch back to a “normal” diet. These findings support our working hypothesis that early‐life sodium supply impacts energy homeostasis and growth kinetics and prompts reconsideration of current guidelines concerning sodium supplementation to prematurely born and low‐birthweight infants.</jats:p>",

The survey method used while data were collected from manufacturing firms was cross-sectional; a total of 151 responses were received and used in the analysis. For statistical analysis, “SmartPLS partial least square, structural equation modeling” PLS-SEM was used. From the findings, it was evident that in the measurement model, convergent and discriminant validities were established. In the second stage, a structural model was developed for hypotheses testing. It was found that sustainable performance was associated with proposed GSCM practices, excluding environmental management. OCBE being a moderator has significant impacts concerning GSCM operations and sustainability functions of firms. However, OCBE did not play the role of moderator between internal environmental management and EE and sustainable performance. The present study is significant for managers and policymakers for the attainment of competitive advantage, enhancement of OCBE, and sustainable performance. Furthermore, this research study is the first empirical study that has used OCBE as a moderator through the lens of NRBV.</jats:p>"

Owing to all those circumstances, current study focuses on an intelligent dual channel (online-to-offline) strategy in industry to arrange the optimal services for customers. The selling price of the product vary with different channel, which helps to determine the demand of product for entire supply chain. Two important factors, backorder and lead-time are examined precisely through marginal value which helps to arrange optimal service and calculate the exact profit. The profit for a centralized and decentralized case are computed for both the players. Some propositions are developed to prove the global optimality. Numerical results prove that a centralized case provides 7.77% better profit than a decentralized case due to bonding between the players.</jats:p>",

In this research, the effect of total flavonoids extracted by ethanol in Cirsium japonicum DC seeds on Microcystis aeruginosa cell density and morphological changes was assessed via six treatments (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/L). Chlorophyll a, carotenoid, phycocyanin (PC), and allophycocyanin (APC) content were analyzed. Also, adversity indicators variance including malondialdehyde (MDA), O2−., and antioxidant isozyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate oxidase (APX) were revealed. The results showed M. aeruginosa density was significantly influenced by C. japonicum DC total flavonoids in a negative dose-response. After 9 days of treatment, density decreased by 58.8%, and algal cells shrank severely under treatment of 50 mg/L total flavonoids. In addition, the chlorophyll a, carotenoid and PC content displayed a decreasing trend compared to the control, meanwhile contents of MDA, APC (except 50 mg/L treatment), activity of O2−., SOD and APX increased. This study shows the total flavonoids of C. japonicum DC has higher biological activities and can interfere with growth of M. aeruginosa. It was concluded that C. japonicum DC may be useful to control harmful water bloom.</jats:p>",

However, since UAVs rely on their on‐board batteries, which can be drained quickly, they typically need to land frequently for recharging or replacing them, limiting their endurance and the flying network availability. The problem is exacerbated when a single FCR UAV is used. The FCR UAV energy is used for two main tasks: Communications and propulsion. The literature has been focused on optimizing both the flying network performance and energy efficiency from the communications point of view, overlooking the energy spent for the UAV propulsion. Yet, the energy spent for communications is typically negligible when compared with the energy spent for the UAV propulsion. In this article, we propose energy‐aware relay positioning (EREP), an algorithm for positioning the FCR taking into account the energy spent for the UAV propulsion. Building upon the conclusion that hovering is not the most energy‐efficient state, EREP defines the trajectory and speed that minimize the energy spent by the FCR UAV on propulsion, without compromising in practice the quality of service offered by the flying network. The EREP algorithm is evaluated using simulations. The obtained results show gains up to 26% in the FCR UAV endurance for negligible throughput and delay degradation.</jats:p>",

This study calculates water production cost and evaluates social cost by applying the residual value method and calculating the shadow price for several water sources. The results indicate that desalination and industrial reuse incur similar costs, with the former being more competitive in terms of investment (US dollar (USD) 0.28/m3) and the latter in operation and maintenance (USD 0.57/m3). Cisterns and greywater reuse incur higher investment costs (USD 2.20/m3 and USD 2.60/m3, respectively), while well water has the lowest total cost (USD 0.08/m3). Desalination showed the lowest degree of distortion between shadow price and water cost and between shadow price and the average tariff; meanwhile, there was moderate distortion for industrial reuse and groundwater sources. The conclusions suggest that desalination and industrial reuse offer good flow at feasible costs and are, therefore, strategically sound sources. However, for these sources and for wells, tariff policy does not reflect a significant part of the social cost they incur.</jats:p>",

The impact of urbanization on the key elements of the hydrological process is worth studying in the context of rapid urbanization. This paper combines the soil-land use index grid and the GSSHA model to quantitatively study the impact of land use on urban hydrological processes under the background of the changing urbanization stage. The results show that with the increase in land development and utilization activities, the hydrological process will transform. When grassland and woodland are converted to construction land, the changes in runoff, infiltration, and evaporation are the largest. The runoff depth increased by 0.94 × 10−1 ∼ 2.42 × 10−1 mm/km2, infiltration depth decreased by 0.80 × 10−1 ∼ 2.18 × 10−1 mm/km2, and evaporation decreased by 0.14 × 10−1 ∼ 0.28 × 10−1 mm/km2. In the transition from forest land to grassland, from cultivated land to forest land, and from cultivated land to grassland, the increase of infiltration contributed over 80% to the decrease of runoff process. This provides a scientific basis for future urban planning and sponge city construction.</jats:p>",

We argue that blockchain technology has an innovation promoting role in supply chain finance solutions through reducing inefficiencies and increasing visibility between different parties, which have hitherto constituted the main challenges in this sphere. Based on a review of the academic literature as well as an analysis of the industrial solutions that have emerged, we identify and discuss the financial, operational and legal challenges encountered in supply chain financing and the promise of blockchain to address these limitations. We discuss the bottlenecks as well as the benefits of blockchain and identify some necessary conditions required for the emergence of blockchain-enabled trade and supply chain financing, such as the establishment of co-opetition among supply chain actors, integration with IoT systems for data quality, and reform of regulatory and legal frameworks. We conclude by identifying promising research directions about the implementation process, inviting further research into the transformation of business models toward a more collaborative nature.</jats:p>",

Most studies have focused on appropriate control of nutrients in an aquaponic set-up, but very little research has been conducted on commercial-scale applications. In our model, the input data were sourced on a weekly basis from three commercial aquaponic farms in Southeast Texas over the course of a year. Due to the limited number of data points, dimensionality reduction techniques such as pairwise correlation matrix were used to remove the highly correlated predictors. Feature selection techniques such as the XGBoost classifier and Recursive Feature Elimination with ExtraTreesClassifier were used to rank the features in order of their relative importance. Ammonium and calcium were found to be the top two nutrient predictors, and based on the months in which lettuce was cultivated, the median of these nutrient values from the historical dataset served as the optimal concentration to be maintained in the aquaponic solution to sustain healthy growth of tilapia fish and lettuce plants in a coupled set-up. To accomplish this, Vernier sensors were used to measure the nutrient values and actuator systems were built to dispense the appropriate nutrient into the ecosystem via a closed loop.</jats:p>"

There are significant advantages of using drip irrigation of TSE. However, it is still not known how TSE drip irrigation influences the soil environment. It is known that drip irrigation technical parameters determine the distribution of TSE in soil and have a substantive effect on the soil environment, while the magnitude of these impacts depends on the TSE quality. Since the application of conventional water resources is limited, TSE is expected to be used more frequently for agricultural irrigation. The growing concern of soil environmental risk due to TSE drip irrigation requires further study of the interaction and coupling of drip irrigation and TSE. This summary will help understand TSE drip irrigation in China, and guide the practice of reclaimed water utilization in the future.</jats:p>",

The experts provided their inputs based on their direct experience and expertise in this subject matter. The research findings highlight that sustainable supply chain cost (end to end) is a critical success factor. Mangers in the AS should prioritize and focus on sustainable supply chain costs (end to end) to pursue sustainable practices because such critical success factors can foster information sharing behavior. The firms could develop both hard and soft critical HBFs such as Information technology (IT) infrastructure and employee training to build up HBFs to integrate a supply chain.

While reshoring is triggered by aspects related to both the home (domestic) and the host (foreign) country, frequently more favourable aspects in the home country lead to the reshoring decision. To investigate these dynamics, we construct two large‐scale networks consisting of 2066 and 1283 firms, respectively, capturing the supply networks of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover. Both networks have been experiencing the reshoring of previously foreign suppliers to domestic locations. Our investigation captures the network dynamics created by this relocation of tier 1 suppliers for the overall supply chain network, that is, also for higher‐tier/sub‐tier suppliers. The results reveal, contrary to our expectations, that indirect (sub‐tier) foreign suppliers positively influence the network's resilience, with this impact, however, being negatively moderated by their degree centrality, that is, the number of ties a node possesses. In addition, existing indirect (sub‐tier) domestic suppliers do not have a significant influence on the resilience of the network. No evidence was found for the impact of reshoring on sustainability. Overall, our study contributes to the reshoring literature by delineating its influence on both the resilience and the sustainability of a focal firm's supply chain network.</jats:p>",

Within this study, shading systems were installed in classrooms of a middle school: common shading in two rooms, while two others were equipped with shading blades “Schlotterer RETROLux 80D” in an innovative design, reflecting more daylight indoors. The participating classes were divided between rooms with ordinary daylighting (n = 43) and advanced daylighting (n = 42). They spent, on average, 5 days weekly and 5–8 h daily in these classrooms. Saliva samples were collected during three semesters to detect hormonal changes. Questionnaires were collected to obtain more information about the mental alterations and, furthermore, to support the physiological results. A significant reduction in cortisol levels between 6:30 AM and 11:30 AM (p &lt; 0.001) was observed within the group that had advanced daylighting. Questionnaires show that both groups sleep less as study duration increases (p &lt; 0.001 time effect), but only the control group has a concurrent increase in daytime sleepiness according to relative treatment effects. The results show that increased daylight supply indoors leads to a significant greater reduction in cortisol levels of children and that those positive outcomes can be achieved by using innovative technologies for buildings.</jats:p>"

In the period of more than 30 years between the sets of research, the concentrations of lead in fir needles decreased threefold and those of sulfur decreased twofold. A significant increase in the concentrations of cadmium, copper, manganese, and zinc in the three-year-old needles showed that they are a good indicator of environmental pollution with trace elements and may be used in biomonitoring.</jats:p>"

Risk management throughout a worldwide crisis necessitates dissimilar techniques and procedures to the risk management perspective and approaches practiced for a steady market and stable situations, in order to overcome the supply chain vulnerabilities and disruptions towards the triggered issues of suppliers and demand. The main purpose of this paper, unlike the previous works, is to implement innovative tactics and means to make the supply chain of the automotive industry more resilient and flexible towards global crises to minimize the damages, taking the automotive industry's performance within the Coronavirus pandemic as a field of study and the juxtaposed complications presented in parallel from suppliers and customers to result in a robust technique to create strategic flexibility and balance for production units to manage the jeopardies within and post the global crises. This research, using the analytical hierarchical process for the assessment of the vertical collaboration alternatives, enables the supply chain actors to adopt the most adequate alternative for each category of risks and actors.

Knowing that the peripheral level in the health pyramid of Cameroon does not always benefit from oral services, this work proposed to present the offer of oral services in conventional medicine and traditional medicine in the Health District of Mbanga.\r\nMaterials and methods: A mixed descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Mbanga health district taking place from April 2021 to January 2022. All dentists and traditional therapists providing oral care were included in the study and having given their consent. To do this, a reading grid and an interview guide made it possible to obtain two types of variables. The qualitative variables were analyzed manually with the color code. While the quantitative variables were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 software.\r\nResults: Total 13 traditional healers were found and two dental surgeons working in the community of Mbanga were interacted for this study. The dentists were only women with less than a year of experience. The technical platform consisted of a portable dental chair and a dental case. The benefits were essentially curative. The traditional therapists worked in counters or in their vehicles. The majority of the products were decoctions. They treated oral ailments and would refer to the hospital in case of complications. Only a few used products to perform dental extractions.\r\nConclusion: The offer of services must be within the reach of every individual.

This is thought to promote faster growth when food is abundant and conserve energy reserves when food is scarce. The time it takes to express metabolic plasticity remain little studied. Here, we develop a conceptual model showing how rapid or slow metabolic plasticity alter growth trajectories in response to changes in food supply. We test predictions from the model in a food manipulation experiment with young-of-the-year northern pike,\n            <jats:italic>Esox lucius</jats:italic>\n            , a species that experience drastic changes in food supply in nature. We find that metabolic plasticity is expressed gradually over several weeks in this species. Rapid changes in food supply thus caused apparent trait-environment mismatches that persisted for at least five weeks. Contrary to predictions, pike grew faster at high food levels when they had previously experienced low food levels and downregulated their RMR. This was not owing to increases in food intake but probably reflected that low RMRs increased the energetic scope for growth when feeding conditions improved. This highlights the important but complex effects of metabolic plasticity on growth dynamics under variable resource levels on ecologically relevant time scales.\n          </jats:p>",

The complexity of interactions between thermal‐hydraulic components in these systems requires moving from a steady‐state analysis to a dynamic approach. Commercial dynamic process simulators provide a good platform to model and simulate the physics phenomena of these components. However, co‐simulation between software engines is often necessary to incorporate process control systems and regulate key system variables. This paper presents the co‐simulation of a real heating application from a civil building for health services integrating thermal energy storage (TES) units. A detailed dynamic model of the heating system under study is developed in Apros, a commercial dynamic process simulator. The process control system responsible for regulating the hydraulic pumps, valves, and heat sources is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The TES system is operated by the process control system based on a daily schedule, achieving a reduced utilisation of the heat generation units during peak‐demand hours.</jats:p>",

Based on blockchain technology, the data integrity of the dual-channel supply chain is studied. First, the data of the supply chain conduct coordinated management to achieve the integrity of the supply chain data. Then, under the background that both retailers and suppliers are risk-neutral individuals, the benchmark model of the dual-channel supply chain is constructed, and the online and offline sales prices of products under different decision-making modes are analyzed. Finally, taking fresh agricultural products as an example, the sales strategies of the online and offline sales channels of fresh agricultural products are studied, and a dual-channel supply chain model is constructed. The profit of each member in the supply chain system under this model is obtained by the inverse method. The simulation results demonstrate that the retailer’s revenue and the total revenue of the system increase obviously with the growth of the price discount coefficient after the price discount strategy is applied. When the compensation cost is between 1,000 and 3,000, the profit of retailers in the supply chain system is improved by using the price coordination mechanism, while the profit of suppliers decreases to some extent. When the value of compensation cost is 7,000–9,000, the application of the price coordination mechanism increases the profit of suppliers in the supply chain system, while the profit of retailers declines to a certain extent. The research content reported here effectively alleviates the profit conflict and the double marginal effect between the two channels and enriches the theoretical system knowledge of the coordination of the two channels’ supply chain of agricultural products.</jats:p>",

Then, the prior probability of UB + fault points are obtained according to the five-year fault dataset of FAW Volkswagen Reck system, and the relevant conditional probabilities are determined by fuzzy set theory due to the lack of data and the uncertainty in expert scoring.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Sediment supply is widely believed to be a key control on alluvial fan morphology and channel dynamics. Although the sediment supply to natural fans is rather episodic, experimental studies of alluvial fans often use constant sediment supply rates, making it difficult to relate fan dynamics to the magnitude and frequency of sediment supply in the field. This paper presents a series of experiments designed to test the impact of episodic sediment supply on fan evolution and dynamics. We compare four experiments, each with the same mean sediment supply but different durations of high- and low-supply periods. The experiments show that fan morphology and channel dynamics respond systematically to the temporal elongation of sediment supply oscillations: longer supply cycles generate flatter fans with more trenched channels. These results highlight how different basin conditions might generate different fan morphologies: supply limited basins with intermittent sediment supply might generate fans that are flatter than expected. Our results raise the question of whether a constant sediment supply in experimental models can adequately characterise the dynamics of natural fans in the field.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The University of Tennessee’s (UT) Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics models supply chains for both liquid and electricity generating technologies currently in use and/or forthcoming for the bio/renewable energy industry using the input–output model IMPLAN<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>. The approach for ethanol, biodiesel, and other liquid fuels includes the establishment and production of the feedstock, transportation of the feedstock to the plant gate, and the one-time investment as well as annual operating of the facility that converts the feedstock to a biofuel. This modeling approach may also include the preprocessing and storage of feedstocks at depots. Labor/salary requirements and renewable identification number (RIN) values and credits attributable to the conversion facility, along with land-use changes for growing the feedstock are also included in the supply chain analyses. The investment and annual operating of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation for wind, solar, and digesters are modeled as well. Recent modeling emphasis has centered on the supply chain for liquid fuels using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s 179 economic trading areas as modeling regions. These various data layers necessary to estimate the economic impact are contained in UT’s renewable energy economic analysis layers (REEAL) modeling system. This analysis provides an example scenario to demonstrate REEAL’s modeling capabilities. The conversion technology modeled is a gasification Fischer–Tropsch biorefinery with feedstock input of 495,000 metric tons per year of forest residue transported to a logging road that is less than one mile in distance. The biorefinery is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and naphtha. An estimated one million tons of forest residue are required at fifty percent moisture content. Based on a technical economic assessment (TEA) developed by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and the quantity of hardwood residues available in the Central Appalachian region, three biorefineries could be sited each utilizing 495,000 dry metric tons per year. Each biorefinery could produce 47.5 million liters of SAF, 40.3 million liters of diesel, and 23.6 million liters of naphtha. Annual gross revenues for fuel required for the biorefineries to break even are estimated at $193.7 million per biorefinery. Break-even plant gate fuel prices when assuming RINs and 12.2 percent return on investment are $1.12 per liter for SAF, $1.15 per liter for diesel, and $0.97 per liter for naphtha. Based on IMPLAN, an input–output model, and an investment of $1.7 billion, the estimated economic annual impact to the Central Appalachian region if the three biorefineries are sited is over a half a billion dollars. Leakages occur as investment dollars leaving the region based on the regions local purchase coefficients (i.e., LPPs), which totals $500 million. This results in an estimated $2.67 billion in economic activity with a multiplier of 1.7, or for every million dollars spent, an additional $0.7 million in economic activity is generated in the regional economy. Gross regional product is estimated at $1.28 billion and employment of nearly 1,200 jobs are created during the construction period of the biorefineries, which results in $700 million in labor income with multiplier effects. Economic activity for the feedstock operations (harvesting and chipping) is estimated at slightly more than $16.8 million resulting in an additional $30 million in the economic impact. The stumpage and additional profit occurring from the harvest of the forest residues result in $40 million directly into the pockets of the resource and logging operation owners. Their subsequent expenditures resulted in a total economic activity increase of $71.4 million. These operations result in creating an estimated 103 direct jobs for a total of 195 with multiplier effects. Direct feedstock transportation expenditures of more than $36.7 million provide an estimated increase in economic activity of almost $68 million accounting for the multiplier effects.</jats:p>"

The second objective was to investigate how HS and RPM may modulate the response of mammary gland explants to an inflammatory challenge using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thirty-two multiparous, lactating Holstein cows (184 ± 59 DIM) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 environmental treatment groups, and 1 of 2 dietary treatments [TMR with RPM (Smartamine M; Adisseo Inc.; 0.105% DM as top dress) or TMR without RPM (CON)] in a crossover design. There were two periods with two phases per period. In phase 1 (9 d), all cows were in thermoneutral conditions (TN) and fed ad libitum. During phase 2 (9 d), group 1 (n = 16) cows were exposed to HS using electric heat blankets, whereas group 2 cows (n = 16) remained in TN but were pair-fed to HS counterparts to control for DMI decreases associated with HS. After a washout period (14 d), the study was repeated (period 2). Environmental treatments were inverted in period 2 (sequence), whereas dietary treatments remained the same. Mammary tissue was harvested via biopsy at the end of both periods. Tissue was used for protein abundance analysis and also for incubation with 0 or 3 μg/mL of LPS for 2 h and subsequently used for mRNA abundance. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS. Analysis of protein abundance data included the effects of diet, environment and their interaction, and period and sequence to account for the crossover design. The explant data model also included the effect of LPS and its interaction with environment and diet. Abundance of phosphorylated mTOR and ratio of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (p-EEF2) to total EEF2 in non-challenged tissue was greater with RPM supplementation (P = 0.04 for both) and in both cases tended to be greater with HS (P = 0.08 for both). Regardless of RPM supplementation, incubation with LPS upregulated mRNA abundance of IL8, IL6, IL1B, CXCL2, TNF, NFKB1, and TLR2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05). An environment × LPS interaction was observed for NFKB1 (P = 0.03); abundance was greater in LPS-treated explants from non-HS compared with HS cows. Abundance of CXCL2, NFKB1, NOS2, NOS1, and SOD2 was lower with HS (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Although LPS did not alter mRNA abundance of the antioxidant transcription factor NFE2L2 (P = 0.59), explants from HS cows had lower abundance of NFE2L2 (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and CUL3 (P = 0.04). Overall, RPM supplementation may alter mTOR activation in mammary tissue. Additionally, although HS reduced explant immune and antioxidant responses, RPM did not attenuate the inflammatory response induced by LPS in vitro.</jats:p>",

We present the results of a study on the propagation laws of the DGS-explosion induced by a gas explosion in excavation roadways. A rectangular tube was established using ANSYS, similar to an excavation roadway in an underground coal mine. The gas, flame, and shock wave propagation laws were determined by analyzing the explosive gas as it exited the excavation roadway. The results show that the initial explosion caused the flame generated in the DGS-explosion to be significantly stretched. Moreover, the shock wave was reflected by the end of the tube, which resulted in the reverse migration of the local gas after the DGS-explosion. Meanwhile, with the increase in local gas concentrations, the pressure peak and the entire explosion system can increase after the DGS-explosion. The flame region, temperature peak, and flame irregularity in the tube positively correlate with the concentration. These results can provide theoretical support and an experimental basis for preventing and responding to accidents caused by gas explosion accidents.</jats:p>"

Recently, the challenge in STLF has been the load variation that occurs in each period, day, and seasonality. This work proposes the bagging ensemble combining two machine learning (ML) models—linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). For comparative analysis, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated and compared with three advanced deep learning (DL) models, namely, the deep neural network (DNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)+LSTM models. These models are trained and tested on the data collected from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with four different input features. The forecasting performance is measured considering mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) parameters. Using several input features, experimental results show that the integrated model provides better accuracy than others. Therefore, it can be revealed that our approach could improve accuracy using different data in different forecasting fields.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the present experiment was conducted to elucidate the effect of diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), a novel synthetic plant growth regulator, on oxidative damage, photosynthetic performance, changes in lipidomic profile, and unsaturation index of lipids in two white clover (<jats:italic>Trifolium repens</jats:italic>) cultivars (drought-sensitive “Ladino” and drought-resistant “Riverdel”) under PEG-6000-induced water-deficit stress. Results revealed that water-deficit stress significantly enhanced oxidative damage and decreased photosynthetic functions in both cultivars. However, the damage was less in Riverdel. In addition, water-deficit stress significantly decreased the relative content of monogalactocyl-diacylglycerols (MGDG), sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerols (SQDG), phosphatidic acisd (PA), phosphatidyl-ethanolamines (PE), phosphatidyl-glycerols (PG), phosphatidyl-serines (PS), ceramides (Cer), hexosylmonoceramides (Hex1Cer), sphingomyelins (SM), and sphingosines (Sph) in both cultivars, but a more pronounced decline was observed in Ladino. Exogenous application of DA-6 significantly increased the relative content of digalactocyl-diacylglycerols (DGDG), monogalactocyl-diacylglycerolsabstra (MGDG), sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerols (SQDG), phosphatidic acids (PA), phosphatidyl-ethanolamines (PE), phosphatidyl-glycerols (PG), phosphatidyl-inositols (PI), phosphatidyl-serines (PS), ceramides (Cer), hexosylmonoceramides (Hex1Cer), neutral glycosphingolipids (CerG2GNAc1), and sphingosines (Sph) in the two cultivars under water-deficit stress. DA-6-treated Riverdel exhibited a significantly higher DGDG:MGDG ratio and relative content of sphingomyelins (SM) than untreated plants in response to water deficiency. Furthermore, the DA-6-pretreated plants increased the unsaturation index of phosphatidic acids (PA) and phosphatidylinositols (PI) in Ladino, ceramides (Cer) and hexosylmonoceramides (Hex1Cer) in Riverdel, and sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerols (SQDG) in both cultivars under water stress. These results suggested that DA-6 regulated drought resistance in white clover could be associated with increased lipid content and reprogramming, higher DGDG:MGDG ratio, and improved unsaturation index of lipids, contributing to enhanced membrane stability, integrity, fluidity, and downstream signaling transduction.</jats:p>"

Comparable tools for the consideration of extended enterprise perspectives at this stage are not available despite the costs of non‐quality often attributed to supply chain issues related to early design decisions. This paper introduces an interface to a discrete event simulation package that derives supply chain processes from product system architectures, so enabling the quantification and visualization of supply chain risk in early design decisions. The interface uses input data, in the form of a product architecture and associated make‐buy scenarios, which are available in the preliminary design process. Supplier data needed to drive the simulations is predefined and editable by users. Results from a proof‐of‐concept software prototype demonstrate the feasibility of generating enterprise architectures from product architectures and coupling these with a systems design vee model to create executable simulation models that can be used to identify, quantify and visualize engineering supply chain process operations and consequential risks.</jats:p>",

To test the hypotheses, this study collected 1017 panel data of 102 Chinese listed companies in the agricultural and food industry from 2010 to 2019. Results show that supply chain slack exerts a positive effect on sustainable development performance, with objective environmental uncertainty positively moderating this direct effect. However, this positive moderating effect is weaker when there is a higher level of perceived environmental uncertainty from the perspective of metacognition.

In total, 24 groundwater samples from different depth were collected to analyze their components, with the combination of methods such as ion sources, normalization index, ions ratios, cation exchange and inverse modeling. The hydrogeochemical formation main factor was water–rock reactions and more weathering by sulfuric acid. Dissolution and pyrite oxidation were the main sources of , whereas carbonate weathering was the dominant source of . The vertical extent could be distinguished to three zones by mean and standard deviation of burial depth. The normalization index, ions ratios, cation exchange and water types exhibited clear vertical zonation. In shallow groundwater, dissolution led to a Ca- type water and overall stable concentrations of ions. Redox reactions in the middle region have caused significant increases in the total dissolved solids (TDS) and and a considerable reduction in pH; hence, Ca + Mg-SO4 + HCO3 became the dominant type. Re-dissolution and cation exchange played important roles at depth and caused the pH and TDS to increase slowly. The , Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations increased rapidly, whereas the concentration remained basically unchanged, and the water type was either Ca + Mg-HCO3 + SO4 or Na-HCO3 + SO4.

The study is developed with quantitative methods and spatial regression (spatial lag and spatial error using OLS as a benchmark), based on data collected from the Inside Airbnb and Tomslee websites. In the period 2014–2019, the listing trend in Rome has been increasing in absolute numbers. After the start of the pandemic, the trend became negative, and the decline of Airbnb offerings is more substantial for shared accommodation. Airbnb supply is related to the distance from the city centre, the average income of the area, empty apartments, singles and the share of foreign residents coming from high-income countries. A signal of spatial diffusion of Airbnb listings emerges in the coastal area, even if they are increasingly concentrated in the historic centre, where there is a<jats:italic>monoculture</jats:italic>of short-term renting.</jats:p>",

A study was therefore carried out to assess the water supply network of Goma Township using three performances indicators with a view to proposing possible solutions to the existing water supply challenges. The methodology involved the assessment and evaluation of the water production, the physical characteristics, and the hydraulic characteristics of the current water supply network. The research utilized secondary data comprising technical reports from review of the literature, GIS data sets, and a database of the existing network converted into an EPANET model to assess its performances. The results generally showed a low performance of the current water supply system (production capacity: 11%, hydraulic characteristic: 33%, physical characteristic: 71%) mainly related to the water demand which has outpaced the water supply capacity and several design issues. The methodology used in this study and the results obtained can be used not only for Goma Township but also by other Sub-Saharan African cities in order to solve the urban water supply crisis.\n</jats:p>",

Members’ competitive behavior and product goodwill play an important role in the decision making of CLSC members. In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with competitive manufacturers and single retailers is studied, in which the manufacturer produces and recycles the products, and the retailer is responsible for the sales of the products. On this basis, a dynamic linear differential equation of product goodwill is constructed, the optimal dynamic path of each decision variable is found, and the influence of price competition among manufacturers on the decision making of members in a dynamic closed-loop supply chain is studied. The conclusion is verified by an example. The results show that goodwill directly affects the wholesale price, the retail price, the recovery price, and the profit of supply chain members. The wholesale price and the retail price of products are not only positively affected by their own goodwill, but also by the goodwill of competing products. The manufacturer competition intensity will affect the product price and the supply chain member profit. To a certain extent, the more intense the manufacturer’s competition is, the higher the wholesale price and the retail price, and the greater the profit of the supply chain members.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the factors affecting service resources for the aged, divides China’s service resource supply and demand system into a supply subsystem, a demand subsystem, and a population and economy subsystem. Using system dynamics methods to analyze the causal relationship between variables and the state space method to build a mathematical model and perform simulation analysis, we research the the current situation of China’s service resources supply and demand balance for the aged.

The unsustainable use of groundwater threatens environmental flows in surface waters, sustainable development, and future food security. The connection between agricultural trade and groundwater depletion has been recently highlighted, but how groundwater depletion supports the production of industrial and tertiary goods, trade, and consumption remains less well understood. Here, we present the first analysis of groundwater use and depletion embedded in the complete supply chain of China (including primary, secondary, and tertiary products). We use a multiregion input‐output analysis coupled with the high‐resolution groundwater use modeling to track groundwater depletion from production to end consumer. Our modeling results show that groundwater depletion occurred primarily in water scarce North China for agricultural production, but the depleted resource was then incorporated throughout the supply chain and dispersed across Chinese and international consumers. ∼64 billion m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (±1 billion m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) groundwater was depleted in China, in which more than a half was from Xinjiang, Hebei, Henan and Heilongjiang Provinces. Approximately 40% of the groundwater depletion can be traced to interprovincial transfer (21 billion m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and export (4.8 billion m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The hot spots for final consumption of groundwater depletion were major cities in both North and South China. Importantly, over 60% of the groundwater depletion was embodied in industrial and tertiary products for final consumption, highlighting the importance of tracing groundwater through the full economy. Groundwater depletion represents a long‐term risk to supply chains, and policy‐makers can use this understanding to sustainably manage groundwater and diversify supply chains.</jats:p>",

As far as technical issues go, scaling, usability, and accessibility stand out. On the one hand, it is difficult to keep secure access control measures on-chain while simultaneously keeping a wide range of medical data off-chain. Finding out who owns what and spreading access control of data is the second challenge in medical settings. Using temporal blockchain, the Secured Healthcare System (SHS) aims to address these problems (TB).

There was a positive impact of the Reynolds number (50–200) on mass flux (13.15%), heat transfer coefficient (2.64%) and TPC (1.42%), while CPC decreased by 56.63%. The increment in the heat transfer coefficient was due to fluid mixing on the feed side, while the increment in the TPC was due to a higher temperature gradient across the membrane surfaces. The increment in the feed temperature (323–343 K) resulted in an increase in mass flux by 132.9%, while TPC decreased from 0.98 to 0.90. The degree of vacuum (640–750 mm Hg) increased mass flux and heat transfer coefficient by 72.52 and 425.83%, respectively, while the TPC decreased by 8.81%. The feed temperature was the most sensitive parameter with respect to mass flux. The developed CFD model was validated with in-house experimental results with reasonable accuracy.</jats:p>",

However, LIB production and electricity generation still heavily rely on fossil fuels at present, resulting in major environmental concerns. Are LIBs as environmentally friendly and sustainable as expected at the current stage? In the past 5 years, a skyrocketing growth of the EV market has been witnessed. LIBs have garnered huge attention from academia, industry, government, non‐governmental organizations, investors, and the general public. Tremendous volumes of LIBs are already implemented in EVs today, with a continuing, exponential growth expected for the years to come. When LIBs reach their end‐of‐life in the next decades, what technologies can be in place to enable second‐life or recycling of batteries? Herein, life cycle assessment studies are examined to evaluate the environmental impact of LIBs, and EVs are compared with internal combustion engine vehicles regarding environmental sustainability. To provide a holistic view of the LIB development, this Perspective provides insights into materials development, manufacturing, recycling, legislation and policy, and beyond. Last but not least, the future development of LIBs and charging infrastructures in light of emerging technologies are envisioned.</jats:p>",

For many years, research has been conducted to develop ex vivo storage solutions that limit RBC lysis and maintain a high survival rate of the transfused cells. However, little attention is directed towards potential fractionation methods to remove unwanted cell debris or aged blood cells from stored RBC units prior to transfusion, which could not only expand the ex vivo shelf life of RBC units but also avoid adverse events in transfused patients. Such fractionation methods could also limit the number of transfusions required for treating certain pathologies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD). In this work, magnetic fractionation is studied as a potential technology to fractionate functional and healthy RBCs from aged or sickle cells. It has been reported that during ex vivo RBC storage, RBCs lose hemoglobin (Hb) and lipid content via formation of Hb-containing exosomes. Given the magnetic character of deoxygenated- or met-Hb, in this work, we propose the use of a quadrupole magnetic sorter (QMS) to fractionate RBCs based on their Hb content from both healthy stored blood and SCD blood. In our QMS, a cylindrical microchannel placed inside the center of the quadrupolar magnets is subjected to high magnetic fields and constant field gradients (286 T/m), which causes the deflection of the paramagnetic, Hb-enriched, and functional RBCs from their original path and their collection into a different outlet. Our results demonstrated that although we could obtain a significant difference in the magnetic mobility of the sorted fractions (corresponding to a difference in more than 1 pg of Hb per cell), there exists a tradeoff between throughput and purity. Therefore, this technology when optimized could be used to expand the ex vivo shelf life of RBC units and avoid adverse events in transfused individuals or SCD patients requiring blood exchange therapy.</jats:p>"

Correctly understanding the supply and demand relationship of CES is the premise of ES sustainable management and helps to improve human well-being. However, the evaluation and mapping of CES supply and demand represents a significant gap in ES research. Using the Shigou Township of Mizhi County in China as an example, in this study, we evaluated CES supply and demand at the village scale. We first considered three aspects of supply potential, accessibility and quality to construct an indicator system of six types of CES supply, including aesthetic (Aest), sense of place (SP), social relations (SR), cultural heritage (Cult), education (Edu) and recreation (Recr) and obtained demand data through a questionnaire. Then, we identified the imbalance in the supply and demand of CES by Z-score standardization based on the quantification of the CES supply and demand. Secondly, bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to identify tradeoffs/synergies on the CES supply side, and chi-square tests were used to identify CES demand differences between stakeholder groups. The results indicated that the supply–demand patterns of CES presented evident spatial differences. The low-supply–high-demand patterns of Aest, SR and Recr accounted for the largest proportions, with values of 33.33%, 33.33% and 30.95%, respectively. The low-supply–low-demand patterns of SP and Cult accounted for the largest proportions, with values of 30.95% and 38.10%, respectively. The low-supply–low-demand pattern of Edu accounted for the smallest proportion (21.43%) and was mainly located in the south of Shigou Township. The southwest, northeast and central areas of Shigou Township were the key regions of tradeoffs/synergies of CES supply. There were significant differences in CES demand for SR, Cult and Edu among stakeholder groups. The results could contribute to optimizing regional ecosystem management and provide effective information for improving the imbalance between the supply and demand of CES.</jats:p>"

However, the mechanism underlying soil inorganic N production remains unknown for cash crops in karst regions. In this study, the rates of organic N mineralization to ammonium (NH4+) and NH4+ nitrification to nitrate (NO3−) were determined using a 15N tracing technique to evaluate the supply capacity of inorganic N in soils from woodland and pitaya plantations with different cultivation years (3, 9, and 15 years) in the subtropical karst region of China. The conversion of woodland to pitaya plantations significantly decreased the content of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), along with the soil pH and cation-exchange capacity (CEC), but significantly increased the content of available potassium, available phosphorus, iron, and aluminum, in a more pronounced fashion with the increasing length of pitaya cultivation. The conversion of woodland to pitaya plantations has not significantly changed soil NH4+ and NO3− content, but this land use has resulted in divergent effects on mineralization and nitrification rates. Compared to woodland (5.49 mg N kg−1 d−1), pitaya cultivation significantly reduced the mineralization rate to 0.62–2.38 mg N kg−1 d−1. Conversely, the nitrification rate significantly increased from 4.71 mg N kg−1 d−1 in soil under woodland to 9.32 mg N kg−1 d−1 in soil under 3-year pitaya cultivation, but this rate decreased to 1.74 mg N kg−1 d−1 under 15-year cultivation. Furthermore, the mean residence time of inorganic N was significantly higher in long-term than in short-term pitaya plantations, indicating the decline in inorganic N turnover with the increasing length of pitaya cultivation. Taken together, long-term pitaya cultivation could significantly decrease the supply capacity and turnover of inorganic N in soil. The Ca, Mg, SOC, and total N content, as well as CEC, were significantly and positively related to the mineralization rate, but negatively related to the mean residence time of NH4+ and NO3−, suggesting that the incorporation of organic matter can accelerate the soil inorganic N supply and turnover for long-term pitaya plantation in subtropical regions.</jats:p>"

As compared to the literature, lower exposure times (2.5–4.0 h) and solar radiations (250–410 W/m²) were sufficient for EC elimination. Then, assuming the complete-mix approach and first-order kinetics, it was possible to adjust EC decay rate constants (k) considering three different models: constant k-value, k as a function of water temperature and a new formulation for k as a function of both solar radiation and water temperature. All models performed well with normalized root mean squared logarithmic error (NRMSLE) lower than 20%, but the best fitting was obtained with the new approach. A new relationship between solar radiation and water temperature was also obtained, which allowed model simulations of EC decay for 34 municipalities in the Brazilian northeast, resulting in a color map for the region depicting the exposure periods of 1.8–5.6 h for reaching a 3-log reduction.</jats:p>",

However, little is known about the micronutrient‐induced TFs involved in 2‐AP biosynthesis. Here, we identify a number of TF families in two fragrant rice varieties, “Meixiangzhan‐2” (M) and “Xiangyaxiangzhan” (X), in response to Zinc (Zn) application through transcriptomic analysis. A total of ~678 TFs were identified and grouped into 26 TF families, each of which was found to be involved in numerous signaling pathways. The WRKY TF family was found to be the most abundant, followed by bHLH and MYB. Furthermore, members of the WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF, HSF, MADS‐box, NFY, and AP2 TF families were significantly upregulated and may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of aroma biosynthesis. In brief, this study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of 2‐AP biosynthesis and highlights the key TFs potentially involved in the production of aroma in fragrant rice.</jats:p>",

However, it is hard for the traditional water audit to meet the needs of the collaborative management of water environment and water ecology based on evaporation (3E), which requires a multi-dimensional evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to accurately evaluate industrial parks' impact considering the water life-cycle. This paper proposes a systematic 3E water audit method that contains a logical framework and a comprehensive evaluation index system with five dimensions and 25 indexes, then applies it to a typical iron and steel industrial park in China. The results presented the 3E audit score of the Chengsteel IP as 89.91, suggesting comprehensive performance is good. The score and grade of every index, especially the quantity of water evaporation per ton of steel, were provided. This paper indicates that the new method developed can systematically evaluate the impact of industrial parks. In addition, our analysis highlights the different management strategies and practices that relieve the impacts of the whole water-use process on legal, eco-environmental, economic, social, and technical dimensions.</jats:p>",

Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.</jats:p>"

By three-stage DEA and Tobit models, this paper measures the carbon sequestration output efficiency of 3706 state-owned forest farms involved in China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration’s 2008–2018 survey. We figure out how the mechanism on the carbon sequestration impacts output efficiency of these forest farms and analyze the temporal trends and spatial distributions of their outputs in various regions. Our results indicate that the overall output efficiency of state-owned forest farms in China is relatively low compared with the international advanced level and show that distinctive north-south regional differences exist. Specifically, the carbon storage of the state-owned forest farms in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia occupies more than half of the carbon storage of total amounts, but their output efficiency is unsatisfactory. Conversely, the forest farms in Southwest China have a medium amount of carbon storage and the highest output efficiency. After improving the external environments of these farms, the efficiency value in each province appears as a significant increment. Moreover, the effects of afforestation, timber harvests, the under-forest economy, and other operating behaviors exhibit regional heterogeneity to some extent. Therefore, this paper advocates reforming the current forest cultivation strategy that emphasizes afforestation and neglects management, and relevant government departments are supposed to adjust operations according to local conditions to promote sustainable forest management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the Kuroshio Current has been well-known for being nutrient poor in its upper layers, it sustains a great biodiversity within its region, including the Kuroshio Extension. Previous studies reported that the Kuroshio carries a large amount of nutrients in its dark subsurface layers, yet, the mechanisms of how these nutrients are brought to sunlit layers remain unclear. In a previous observational study, it is shown that when the Kuroshio flows near the shelf break, very strong turbulence with dissipation rates of O (10 <jats:sup>-7</jats:sup> W kg <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), caused by trapped near-inertial internal waves, leads to the generation of large diffusive nitrate fluxes of 1-10 mmol N m <jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> day <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Nevertheless, since these results were obtained from just one transect survey, questions remain, such as how long the enhanced turbulent diffusive nitrate flux extends downstream, and how the Kuroshio path modulations affect this nutrient injection. In this study, observed features were reproduced by using a high-resolution nested simulation coupled with a N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>PZD<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ecosystem model. The results show that when the model Kuroshio flows closely to the coast, it hits a small bump in the upstream region of the Hyuganada Sea producing negative potential vorticity. At the same time, trapped near-inertial internal waves in a streak of lowered lowest internal wave frequencies are reproduced near the area with low PV values, generating strong vertical mixing similar to the observations. Since more nitrate is brought upward on the continental shelf when the Kuroshio approaches to the coast, the enhanced vertical mixing effectively diffuses up the nitrate from subsurface to surface layers at a rate of <jats:italic>~O</jats:italic>(1 mmol N m <jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> day <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) toward 50-100 km downstream along the Kuroshio. Further analyses on how the distance between the model Kuroshio and the southeastern coast of Kyushu affects the nutrient supply, suggest that when the Kuroshio flows closer to the coast, the internal wave kinetic energy, the nitrate concentration, its vertical gradients and vertical diffusive flux increase.</jats:p>"

Owing to the implementation of the real-name mask rationing system, the historical inventory data of aggregated mask consumption in a pharmacy during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak (April and May 2020) in Taiwan were analyzed for supply-side analysis. We applied the Voronoi diagram and areal interpolation methods to delineate the average supply of customer counts from a pharmacy to a village (administrative level). On the other hand, the expected number of demand counts was estimated from the population data. The relative risk (RR) of supply, which is the average number of adults served per day divided by the expected number in a village, was modeled under a Bayesian hierarchical framework, including Poisson, negative binomial, Poisson spatial, and negative binomial spatial models. We observed that the number of pharmacies in a village is associated with an increasing supply, whereas the median annual per capita income of the village has an inverse relationship. Regarding land use percentages, percentages of the residential and the mixed areas in a village are negatively associated, while the school area percentage is positively associated with the supply in the Poisson spatial model. The corresponding uncertainty measurement: villages where the probability exceeds the risk of undersupply, that is, Pr (RR &lt; 1), were also identified. The findings of the study may help health authorities to evaluate the spatial allocation of anti-epidemic resources, such as masks and rapid test kits, in small areas while identifying priority areas with the suspicion of undersupply in the beginning stages of outbreaks.</jats:p>"

In this research, the fraction contents of six HMs in the Henan section of the Yellow River were investigated by adopting the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction procedure. Moreover, the potential health risk caused by HMs was evaluated by adopting both the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and ecological hazard index method. The results indicate the presence of a light HM pollution level in the Yellow River generally. However, the health risk caused by Cd cannot be neglected. Fraction analysis indicates that the content of the B2 fraction is high, which needs more attention. Overall, branch afflux might be one of the important pathways through which anthropogenic activities influence the Yellow River. The results of both the Igeo and ecological hazard index indicate that the potential health risk caused by HMs is low in the Yellow River, and the Yellow River protection policies implemented by Henan province may be the underlying reason.</jats:p>",

The article is devoted to the solution of the problem of developing technical solutions for multivariate analysis efficiency of energy complexes based on renewable energy sources in the system power supply of autonomous consumers. However, current global trends are such that the cost of electrolyzes and fuel elements decrease, and their reliability increases. To study the economic efficiency of the application of the hydrogen accumulation system, two models were included in the calculation program. In the first of the model, the increase in diesel fuel prices corresponded to inflation, in the second, the increase in diesel prices fuel outstripped inflation by 5-10% per year. Paying attention to the first option showed that to use the system accumulation of hydrogen is not economically feasible.</jats:p>",

This paper constructs the centralized decision-making in the supply chain and the Nash game competition model between supply chains and primarily studies the impact of risk aversion and the free-riding coefficient on supply chain pricing, promotion strategy selection, and expected utility. We show that the supply chain with high-risk aversion has relatively low pricing, but the demand and a total expected utility are high. We also identify that, on the premise of the same risk aversion degree of the two supply chains, when the free-riding coefficient between the chains is small and equal, the supply chain tends to implement the promotion strategy. When consumers have the same preference for the products of two retailers, the pricing of the free-riding supply chain increases with the increase in the free-riding coefficient, while the supply chain with a promotion strategy is the opposite. Based on the numerical results, we further give the optimal one-way free-riding coefficient when the two supply chains have the same degree of risk aversion; when there is a bidirectional free-riding behavior in the market, competition among supply chains gradually tends to the first two scenarios.</jats:p>"

Thus, businesses are investing to improve cyber‐security at a nontrivial cost. In this paper, we conduct a Stackelberg game‐theoretical analysis. In the basic model, we first derive the equilibrium pricing and cyber‐security level decisions in the e‐commerce supply chain. Based on real‐world practices, we then explore whether governments should impose cyber‐security penalty schemes. Our findings show that when the government is characterized by having sufficiently high emphasis on consumer surplus, implementing the penalty scheme is beneficial to social welfare. Then, we extend the analysis to examine how adopting systems security enhancing technologies (such as blockchain) will affect the government's choice of imposing penalty. We uncover that when it is beneficial to have government's penalty scheme, the technology benefit‐to‐cost ratio is a critical factor that governs whether the optimal penalty will be lower or higher with the adoption of systems security enhancing technologies. To generate more insights, we conduct further analyses for various extended modeling cases (e.g., with alliance, competition, and the defense‐level dependent penalty scheme) and find that our main results remain robust. One important insight we have uncovered in this study is that imposing government penalty schemes on cyber‐security issues may do more harm than good; while once it is beneficial to implement, the government should charge the heaviest possible fine. This finding may explain why in the real world, governments basically always adopt a polarized strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty or impose a super heavy penalty, on cyber‐security issues. </jats:p>",

Riemann-based SPH and Delta-SPH are widely used to solve this problem. In this paper, to enhance computational efficiency, the SPH method is implemented on a General Processing Unit (GPU) platform using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Parallelized SPH programs including the standard SPH method, Riemann-based SPH and Delta-SPH are verified by a dam break model with large Reynolds number and violent deformation of free surfaces. The results show that all SPH methods can vividly reflect the whole process of splashing, rolling and backward jet flow; both the Riemann-based SPH and the Delta-SPH methods are effective in alleviating the problem of inhomogeneous pressure distribution in the simulation process; the Riemann-based SPH method has better stability even with relatively large particle spacing, and it has higher accuracy in simulating impact pressure. When the number of particles reaches 100,000, compared with a single-thread Central Processing Unit (CPU) implementation, the speedups obtained with NVIDIA Titan V with high computing cores and Quadro K2200 with low computing cores are thousands and hundreds, respectively.</jats:p>",

Here, we report that RNA granules—monitored by DEAD-Box helicase 6 (DDX6)—disassemble during neuronal maturation both in cell culture and in vivo. This process requires neuronal function, as synaptic inhibition results in reversible granule assembly. Importantly, granule assembly is dependent on the RNA-binding protein Staufen2, known for its role in RNA localization. Altering the levels of free cytoplasmic mRNA reveals that RNA availability facilitates DDX6 granule formation. Specifically depleting RNA from DDX6 granules confirms RNA as an important driver of granule formation. Moreover, RNA is required for DDX6 granule assembly upon synaptic inhibition. Together, this data demonstrates how RNA supply favors RNA granule assembly, which not only impacts subcellular RNA localization but also translation-dependent synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.</jats:p>"

In addition to the growing use of electronic power devices in industrial and residential systems, such as UPS, controlled rectifiers, SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supplies), and DC Converters, there is a serious problem caused by harmonics in AC mains, which lowers the power quality. Harmonics can cause a variety of problems, including sensitive equipment failure, resonance issues, heated wires, power loss, and inefficient distribution systems. A passive or active power filter could be used to reduce harmonics. However, passive filters are more difficult to design and are bulkier. With the advancement of power electronics, active power filters were developed, and the best combination of both was supplied in the form of hybrid active power filters (HAPF). This study shows an approach to minimizing the harmonics contained in the output of a UPS connected to a nonlinear load. Experiments with several UPS types have been conducted under various nonlinear loads, as well as charging and discharging of batteries, and the proposed technique significantly reduces harmonics in a system with a HAPFs (hybrid active power filter) based on a unique FLCC (fuzzy logic current controller). In this paper, we use a fuzzy logic controller to generate pulse width modulation (PWM) switching signals in a single-phase half-bridge HAPF. The operation of the proposed PWM-FLCC will be studied in a steady and transient state. Based on a connection between the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) supplying a single-phase power to a nonlinear load, different power filter topologies and a brief review of reference current extraction (RCE) methods used in this study were also included and the most common configurations have been compared with their advantages and disadvantages to ensure the right selection of the power filter for UPS connected with the nonlinear load. The results of the investigation demonstrate that the HAPF with the fuzzy logic current controller has reasonable performance, with a significant reduction in current THD down to 1.09%, as per IEEE-519 standard.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer adopts eco-friendly technologies to produce green products for curbing carbon emissions, and the retailer is responsible for selling green products to consumers who exhibit low-carbon preferences. Two noncooperative game models, that is, the manufacturer-led Stackelberg model and the vertical Nash model, are developed under static and dynamic settings, respectively. The static analytical solutions of the models are derived by using game theory, and their complex dynamical behaviors are explored via bifurcation and chaos theory. The results indicate that the excessively large adjustment parameters of the players will destabilize the stability of the Nash equilibrium point, leading to more complicated behaviors such as bifurcation and chaos. The higher consumers’ low-carbon preference has a destabilization effect on the system’s stability while the carbon trading price may be a stabilizing or a destabilizing factor for the system under different scenarios. Besides, the influence of the government’s green subsidy rate on the system’s stability is not obvious in most cases. Furthermore, when the system enters into periodic cycles and chaotic motions resulting from the overly fast adjustment speeds, the channel members’ performance may be elevating or declining in different models. Therefore, the chaos in the low-carbon supply system is not always detrimental to the channel members. </jats:p>",

The problems between sustainable development of mining cities and environmental protection of water resources need to be solved urgently. Based on the state-danger-immunity (SDI) conceptual framework, this paper constructs the evaluation system of water resources carrying capacity (WRCC), and calculates the temporal and spatial differentiation of WRCC of mature mining cities from 2013 to 2019 by combining the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method, catastrophe progression model and coupling degree model. The results show that: (1) except that the WRCC grade of Bozhou rose to overload, the WRCC grade of other cities remained unchanged. Huainan, Chuzhou and Xuancheng all showed a downward trend, Suzhou and Chizhou were relatively stable, and Bozhou showed an upward trend. (2) The WRCC of mature mining cities showed an oblique N-type fluctuation. The change range of water resources quality state was small, and the changes in water resources security danger and water resources risk immunity were completely opposite. (3) The coordinated development of mature mining cities as a whole with Chuzhou and Xuancheng has changed from primary imbalance to severe imbalance. Other cities have been in severe imbalance.</jats:p>",

The evaluation results show that the utilization of agricultural water resources in the areas under the jurisdiction of Sichuan and Shandong Provinces in the basin was in a secure or a relatively higher state, whereas Ningxia was in a relatively unsecure state, and the remaining provinces were in a basic secure state. Based on the evaluation results, we have provided the corresponding countermeasures for the safe utilization of agricultural water resources in terms of water-saving irrigation technology, water resources monitoring system, and water resources management system to support the effective implementation of efficient water-saving irrigation of agricultural water resources in the Yellow River Basin.</jats:p>",

The quantification values (Cq values) and mutation detection status were compared between LBC samples and routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clot samples. ROSE LBC samples (n = 54) showed a higher yield of well-preserved tumour and wild type (WT) DNA, demonstrated by lower quantification cycles, no false positives or false negatives, and a higher sensitivity for low allele frequency mutations when compared with FFPE clot samples. The Biocartis Idylla™ provides highly sensitive, reliable and rapid testing for LBC samples for the detection of EFGR and KRAS mutations. BRAF mutations were not detected in the participant cohort; however, all LBC WT BRAF results correlated with the results from the FFPE clot samples. Access to rapid molecular testing using LBC samples can detect the most frequent driver mutations closer to the time of diagnosis, enabling the selection of the most effective first-line targeted therapy sooner, reducing delays or side effects from suboptimal treatments, patient anxiety and costs to healthcare systems, whilst improving patient outcomes.</jats:p>"

Lean principles aim to reduce waste, and many research works have explored their effectiveness in the supply chain. Yet, industries face the problem of selecting appropriate lean supply chain management practices for their present environment. The present study performed a detailed literature study to identify majorly adapted lean supply chain management practices and generalize the most important ones with lesser implementation issues. For this purpose, the multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely, gray relational analysis and complex proportional assessment of alternatives, are used to rank the identified lean supply chain management practices. Principal component analysis was used to generate criteria weights for computations. Out of 28 selected lean supply chain management practices from the literature, seven high-priority lean supply chain management practices are recommended as a generalized list as a result of prioritization by multi-criteria decision-making approaches such as total quality management, just-in-time production, pull system/kanban, 5S, information technology, work standardization, and customer relationship management. This study will benefit the practitioners to quickly identify suitable lean supply chain management practices to enhance their supply chain network, which can result in substantial cost savings. </jats:p>",

It is crucial to assess the resilience of urban water supply systems and develop corresponding disaster mitigation and improvement strategies. Urban water supply systems include many subsystems, but existing researches generally focus on a single subsystem. Therefore, this paper proposes a correlation analysis method and a factor analysis method for the resilience evaluation index system of urban water supply systems by combining each subsystem and applying grey system theory. The method can reflect the four dimensions of the water supply process (water source, water plant, supply and distribution network and users) and the five dimensions of the urban management system (society, natural environment, economy, physics and organization). Taking Qingdao as an example, a multi-level integrated evaluation model based on a cloud model is applied to simulate and analyze the resilience of Qingdao's water supply system. As a result, decision support is provided for planning and building resilience systems for urban water systems in the short and long term, based on four main factors.</jats:p>"

Most of the ecological and environmental problems, such as environmental pollution, global climate change, and loss of biodiversity, are related to urban systems. How to coordinate urban development with the urban ecological carrying capacity is related to the destiny of the city itself, and also to whether its surrounding areas can successfully achieve the goal of high environmental quality and sustainable development. At present, the theory and methods of urban ecological carrying capacity research are relatively new, which has caused problems for policy makers in practical applications. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for urban ecological carrying capacity assessment based on the analysis of ecosystem services supply and demand. Combined with multi-source spatial data and spatial model methods, the supply and demand of ecosystem services were spatially quantified. The capital city of China, Beijing, was the case study area for this research. The spatial differentiation of the supply–demand relationship of ecosystem services is formed. The priority areas for ecological carrying capacity improvement at pixel scale and at the administrative level are obtained, respectively. The results show that the first priority area is concentrated in the center of the urban area, accounting for 31.11% of the total area of Beijing. According to the secondary zone and the specific ecosystem service type, the ecological carrying capacity improvement strategy of different zones is proposed. This study provides a new perspective for investigating urban ecological carrying capacity and for identifying the priority areas for ecological carrying capacity improvement, and helps the policy-makers to design tailored policy actions.</jats:p>"

The tool was to allow us to open up dialogue around disease prevention and control, and make tangible the tacit situated practices of stakeholders working along the poultry supply chain. Our findings show that for those working along the poultry supply chain, the term biosecurity was either consistently open to interpretation, or too rigid to reflect or allow for local variations.

The objective of this study is to use advanced vibrational molecular spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection [ATR]–Fourier transform infrared [FT/IR]) to reveal carbohydrate molecular structure properties of faba bean partitions (stem, leaf, whole pods [WP], and whole plant) and faba bean silage before and after rumen incubation in relation to nutrient availability and supply to dairy cattle. The study included the correlation between carbohydrate‐related spectral profiles and chemical profiles, feed energy values, Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System carbohydrate fractions, and rumen degradation parameters of faba bean samples (whole crop, stem, leaf, WP, and silage) before and after rumen incubation. FTIR spectra of faba bean sample before and after 12 and 24 h rumen incubations were collected with JASCO FT/IR‐4200 with ATR at mid‐IR range (ca. 4000–700 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) with 128 scans and at 4 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> resolution. The univariate molecular spectral analysis was carried out using OMNIC software. The results show that ATR–FT/IR spectroscopic technique could detect the change of microbial digestion to carbohydrate‐related molecular structure. The spectral parameters of feed rumen incubation residues had a stronger correlation with less degradable carbohydrate fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose) while spectral profiles of original faba samples had a stronger correlation with easily degradable carbohydrate fractions (starch). In conclusion, rumen degradation of carbohydrate contents can be reflected in the change of its molecular spectral profiles. The study shows that vibrational molecular spectroscopy (ATR–FT/IR) shows high potential as a fast analytical tool to evaluate and predict nutrient supply in the ruminant system.</jats:p>",

We have used the Mann-Kendall method, t-test, and wavelet analysis to analyze the characteristics of sediment load variation, the Cumulative volume slope rate of change, and the River Impact method to quantitatively assess the degree of sediment variation and the influencing factors. The results show that (1) The annual sediment load at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River at the Pingshan, Cuntan, and Yichang stations all showed a significant decreasing trend, with mutations in 1997, 2003, and 2002, respectively, with the main period of 15 years, 24 years, and 10 years. (2) A series of human activities such as interception of dams, sand mining in river channels, and soil and water conservation measures are the main reasons for the significant reduction of sediment load in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with the contribution of human activities exceeding 80% in all cases after the 1990 s and 90% after the 21st century. (3) Under human activities, the annual sediment load at Cuntan station has been highly altered, while serious alterations have occurred at Pingshan and Yichang stations.

Prefabricated construction has superior strengths in terms of both the environment and economy, but low carbon is not one such strength. Meanwhile, the increasing number of consumers with environmental awareness makes it necessary to investigate consumer preferences and behaviors. Therefore, we firstly built a prefabricated construction supply chain consisting of a prefabricated company (leader) and a manufacturer, using the Stackelberg model. To regulate and mitigate carbon emissions, this study investigated the implementation of a cap-and-trade policy. Consumer environmental consciousness was considered from preferences on improving the prefabricated rate and carbon reduction. This study provides decision-making suggestions, not only from a pricing point of view but also for green production, i.e., the prefabricated rate and carbon reduction. We find that consumer environmental consciousness and the cap-and-trade policy improve decision making. To effectively limit the manufacturer’s emissions, we suggest governments set a cap below a certain threshold. However, under the policy, the prefabricated company has free-rider behaviors and gains greater profits as the leader, which results in an unfair profit distribution. Hence, for the sake of optimizing the supply chain’s profits, the cost-sharing contract and the two-part tariff were discussed. Both contracts achieved Pareto improvement, while the two-part tariff contract realizes coordination and reaches the desired level under a centralized system. Numerical analysis also verified the theoretical feasibility.</jats:p>"

Collected data were analyzed by descriptive analysis and assessing both for internal and external factors of drivers-barriers. Research findings showed that the community proceeds from a traditional mindset with regard bamboo resources and utilization but that the community actually already owned social capital to strengthen and drive modern bamboo utilization.

However, there is significant variation in projected bioenergy deployment results, as well as concerns about the potential environmental and social implications of supplying biomass. Bioenergy deployment projections are market equilibrium solutions from integrated modeling, yet little is known about the underlying modeling of the supply of biomass as a feedstock for energy use in these modeling frameworks. We undertake a novel diagnostic analysis with ten global models to elucidate, compare, and assess how biomass is supplied within the models used to inform long-run climate management. With experiments that isolate and reveal biomass supply modeling behavior and characteristics (costs, emissions, land use, market effects), we learn about biomass supply tendencies and differences. The insights provide a new level of modeling transparency and understanding of estimated global biomass supplies that informs evaluation of the potential for bioenergy in managing the climate and interpretation of integrated modeling. For each model, we characterize the potential distributions of global biomass supply across regions and feedstock types for increasing levels of quantity supplied, as well as some of the potential societal externalities of supplying biomass. We also evaluate the biomass supply implications of managing these externalities. Finally, we interpret biomass market results from integrated modeling in terms of our new understanding of biomass supply. Overall, we find little consensus between models on where biomass could be cost-effectively produced and the implications. We also reveal model specific biomass supply narratives, with results providing new insights into integrated modeling bioenergy outcomes and differences. The analysis finds that many integrated models are considering and managing emissions and land use externalities of supplying biomass and estimating that environmental and societal trade-offs in the form of land emissions, land conversion, and higher agricultural prices are cost-effective, and to some degree a reality of using biomass, to address climate change.</jats:p>",

As part of Mediterranean cultural heritage, these plants are a major driver of rural tourism, in many areas representing an important raw material for various bio-based industrial sectors. Besides their economic value, MAPs enhance social integration and maintain gender balance as harvesting and processing MAPs is clearly a female dominated task. Despite the prominent contribution of MAPs to local development, conservation of biodiversity and the development of the traditional Mediterranean food system, many challenges and knowledge gaps could potentially place the sector’s development at risk. The aim of this work is to examine the present situation of the MAPs sector in the most productive countries around the Mediterranean and to identify future challenges and priority actions to develop the MAPs sector in the region. To do so, a supply chain analysis was performed to identify the main stakeholders involved. Various experts from Croatia, France, Greece, Spain, and Tunisia participated in the SWOT analysis and the Delphi approach employed in this study. The results highlight the main challenges facing the sector in Mediterranean countries. Five groups of challenges are identified, related mainly to certification and labelling, life quality and wellbeing, market development, research development, and transforming and processing. To overcome these challenges, a set of actions is validated by the interviewed experts with the aim of improving marketing strategies and including various innovations related to political, legal, organisational, and institutional frameworks.</jats:p>"

Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, targeting prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, from samples collected seasonally during 2014-2020 indicate that nitracline depth is the most robust predictor of spatial microbial community structure and biodiversity in this region. Striking ecological changes occurred due to the transition from a warm anomaly during 2014-2016, characterized by intense stratification, to cooler conditions in 2017-2018, representative of more typical upwelling conditions, with photosynthetic eukaryotes, especially diatoms, changing most strongly.

Quality function deployment (QFD) has been applied in many areas to solve multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems successfully. However, there is still lack of sufficient research on the use of MCDM to develop two house-of-quality systems in the supply chain of new energy materials manufacturing enterprises to determine ripple effect factors (REFs), supply chain agility indicators (SCAIs), and industry 4.0 enablers (I4Es). This study aimed to develop a valuable decision framework by integrating MCDM and QFD; using key I4Es to enhance the agility of supply chain and reduce or mitigate its ripple effects ultimately, this study provides an effective method for new energy materials manufacturers to develop supply chains that can rapidly respond to change and uncertainty. The case study considered China’s largest new energy materials manufacturing enterprise as the object and obtained important management insights, as well as practical significance, from implementing the proposed research framework. The study found the following to be the most urgent I4Es required to strengthen the agility of supply chain and reduce the key REFs: ensuring data privacy and security, guarding against legal risks, adopting digital transformation investment to improve economic efficiency, ramming IT infrastructure for big data management, and investing and using the new equipment of Industry 4.0. When these measures are improved, the agility of the supply chain can be improved, such as long-term cooperation with partners to strengthen trust relationships, supply chain information transparency and visualization to quickly respond to customer needs, and improving customer service levels and satisfaction. Finally, REFs, such as the bullwhip effect caused by inaccurate prediction, facility failure, and poor strain capacity caused by supply chain disruption, can be alleviated or eliminated. The proposed framework provides an effective strategy for formulating I4Es to strengthen supply chain agility (SCA) and mitigate ripple effects, as well as provides a reference for supply chain management of other manufacturing enterprises in the field of cleaner production.</jats:p>"

The centralized and decentralized decision models propose joint quality efforts based on the consideration of quality preference and loss. From the perspective of SC resilience, we analyze how SC members can optimally make price, quality, and quantity decisions resiliently and robustly under the disruption of quality preference. The results show that (1) no matter the kind of decision model, considering quality preference disruptions can significantly increase the SC profit; (2) there is a resilience range in decisions with the influence of the disruption cost. The original optimal decisions in the resilience range are robust and sustain SC performance without change; and (3) the disruption significantly impacts offline channel retailers, who are at a disadvantage when competing with online channels. A centralized decision model can achieve higher profits and quality levels in response to demand disruptions.

To further research the government subsidies and retailer’s fairness concerns on the optimal decisions of product pricing, green R&amp;D, and service level, we construct four two-stage GSC models: no subsidy and fairness concerns, subsidizes manufacturer without retailer’s fairness concerns, subsidizes manufacturer with retailer’s fairness concerns, and subsidizes all members with retailer’s fairness concerns. The results show that subsidizes to manufacturers has significantly improved supply chain performance and environmental governance, but it exacerbates the unfair distribution of profits among members, and retailers’ fairness concerns drive them to offer lower green service level. With the green demand of consumers being unable to be fully satisfied, the consumer surplus and effectiveness of government environmental governance decrease accordingly.

Foreign fishing and international trade divert nutrients caught in marine fisheries from nutrient-insecure toward nutrient-secure nations. Where nutrient-insecure countries do benefit from foreign fishing and trade, there tends to be high vulnerability to future changes in nutrient flows arising from changes to foreign fishing and trade. This research highlights the need for greater transparency around distribution of fish and for nutrition security to be considered more centrally in development of trade agreements.</jats:p>",

Despite its complexity, the essential and crucial role in the waste management process is that of an individual. Residents of Latvia face several challenges in the recycling process – lack of infrastructure, knowledge and individual motivation to sort the waste for the common good. European Union has set ambitious goals in regard to waste reduction. If the situation in Latvia does not rapidly improve, it will not achieve these goals.This paper proposes the game theory and a positive been conducted encouragement approach to help improve the situation. A literature review of established theories has and results in a proposal of an informal approach – fun theory. The final section offers a brief overview of four different research studies about waste recycling and individual motivation toward it. A range of theories and motivational aspects related to the problem have been considered and theoretical grounds laid for further and practical research, namely, a unified collection of information in a format of a household waste themed game that could be tested by employing a sample of a Latvian population.</jats:p>",

Here, we conducted a two-year field study to compare the impacts of eight combinations of planting patterns (PPs) and mulching on the soil water content (SWC) in the top 60 cm soil layer, the growth, the yield, and the WUE of wheat under two irrigation rates (1.00 and 0.50 ET). These combinations included three conventional flat planting (CF) patterns, including CF without mulch (CFNM), with plastic film (CFPM), and with wheat straw mulch (CFSM); three raised-bed planting (RB) patterns, including RB without mulch (RBNM), with plastic film (RBPM), and wheat straw (RBSM) mulch; and two ridge–furrow planting (RF) patterns, including RF without mulch (RFNM) and with plastic film mulch (RFPM). The results showed that the tested treatments affected the SWC at different depths under both irrigation rates. Compared with the two non-mulched treatments under 0.50 ET, the SWC of the three PPs with plastic film and the two PPs with wheat straw mulching were significantly higher before irrigation by 14.4–22.0% and 6.9–17.2% at 0–20 cm soil depth, 16.4–29.0% and 6.6–14.9% at 20–40 cm soil depth, and 3.3–34.8% and 3.4–14.5% at 40–60 cm soil depth, respectively. All measured wheat parameters, except harvest index, were significantly affected by the interaction between irrigation rate and PPs. The highest values for plant dry weight (PDW), yield components, grain yield (GY), and WUE under 1.00 ET were obtained in the two PPs with wheat straw mulch, while the three PPs with plastic film showed the highest values of these parameters under 0.50 ET. The yield response factor (Ky) based on PDW was acceptable for all PPs mulched with plastic film and wheat straw as well as for RFNM, while Ky based on GY was acceptable only for the PPs mulched with plastic film and for RFNM, as the Ky values of these PPs were less than 1 under 0.50 ET. The SWC at different depths exhibited quadratic and nonsignificant relationships with all parameters under 1.00 ET, while these relationships were linear and strong under 0.50 ET, with a few exceptions. Overall, we conclude that combining any PPs with plastic film mulching could be used as a feasible and effective strategy for obtaining high wheat yield and WUE in the irrigated and arid agroecosystem.</jats:p>"

In order to tackle the challenges identified in the European Green Deal, one must reach an equilibrium between the production and the absorption of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2030. The EU goal is to achieve a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, as compared to 1990. It is also planned to make future human activity more climate-neutral, which means saving resources, optimising energy consumption, recycling waste into new products, using agricultural products, including food, to their full extent, without losses. Significant changes in the key economic sectors of member states are to take place in accomplishing the EU climate neutrality goals. Recycling of waste is an integral component of circular economy. Biogas reactors make it possible to efficiently recycle biological waste, producing biogas. Biogas is a resource suitable for generating electric power and heat; while refining biogas, one can produce biomethane, to serve as an alternative to currently used types of fossil fuels. The goal of this study is to analyse the possibility of manufacturing biomethane from organic waste, through the use of biogas plants that receive funding via the mandatory procurement system in Latvia. The study revealed that at least half of the biogas plants, if repurposed for the manufacture of biomethane, would be able to generate EUR 70.2 million in revenue within a year, assuming a biomethane price of EUR 100 per MWh-1, thus fully compensating any income not received through mandatory procurement funding.</jats:p>",

With their limited availability, it is critical to distribute the vaccines reasonably. We simulated the SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission for 365 days over four intervention periods: free transmission, structural mitigation, personal mitigation, and vaccination. Sensitivity analyses were performed to obtain robust results. We further evaluated two proposed vaccination allocations, including one‐dose‐high‐coverage and two‐doses‐low‐coverage, when the supply was low. 33.35% (infection rate, 2.68 in 10 million people) and 40.54% (2.36) of confirmed cases could be avoided as the nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) adherence rate rose from 50% to 70%. As the vaccination coverage reached 60% and 80%, the total infections could be reduced by 32.72% and 41.19%, compared to the number without vaccination. When the durations of immunity were 90 and 120 days, the infection rates were 2.67 and 2.38. As the asymptomatic infection rate rose from 30% to 50%, the infection rate increased 0.92 (SD, 0.16) times. Conditioned on 70% adherence rate, with the same amount of limited available vaccines, the 20% and 40% vaccination coverage of one‐dose‐high‐coverage, the infection rates were 2.70 and 2.35; corresponding to the two‐doses‐low‐coverage with 10% and 20% vaccination coverage, the infection rates were 3.22 and 2.92. Our results indicated as the duration of immunity prolonged, the second wave of SARS‐CoV‐2 would be delayed and the scale would be declined. On average, the total infections in two‐doses‐low‐coverage was 1.48 times (SD, 0.24) as high as that in one‐dose‐high‐coverage. It is crucial to encourage people in order to improve vaccination coverage and establish immune barriers. Particularly when the supply is limited, a wiser strategy to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 is equally distributing doses to the same number of individuals. Besides vaccination, NPIs are equally critical to the prevention of widespread of SARS‐CoV‐2.</jats:p>",

The Shiyang River Basin is an important natural reserve in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province. Global warming and human activities have led to extreme ecological changes in this region. Exploring the response of the ecological environment of the Shiyang River Basin to a changing climate is important for studying the sustainable development of the fragile ecological environment in this basin. The meteorological data for this study was obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center, and the average temperature and precipitation data were acquired from four meteorological stations. By investigating the changes in the watershed climate and social environment in the Shiyang River Basin, the corresponding changes in glacial and surface water resources, landscape patterns, and natural and anthropogenic factors in the basin under changing environment were analysed. The results show that the temperature in different seasons has increased in the past 60 years, and the inclination rate of air temperature was 0.56 °C/10a. In addition, precipitation increased slightly at 0.737 mm/10a. Natural conditions and climate change have reduced the supply of glacial meltwater in the Qilian Mountains, and the regulation of glacial snow in downstream rivers is poor. The distribution of the water production rate in each river was similar to that of precipitation. The runoff modulus of the deep mountain area was greater than that of the shallow mountainous area. The western region is larger than the eastern region, and the rationalisation of the land use structure in the basin has a decisive effect on optimising the landscape pattern of the basin. The spatial evolution of the vegetation cover in the basin is generally stable; under the combined action of climate change and human activities, downstream water resources are reducing, and landscape vegetation is shifting to a high risk in the Shiyang River Basin. Among the influencing factors, anthropogenic factors play a dominant role in the runoff variation in this basin. Climate warming and unregulated human activities are the main causes of regional environmental deterioration. The study findings can contribute to understanding the coupling relationship between the natural and ecological evolution process of the inland river basin and human activities in the arid zone. Further, exploring the change trend of the ecological environment of the Shiyang River Basin can help determine the human adaptation countermeasures to mitigate ecological deterioration and ensure sustainable development of ecologically fragile areas.</jats:p>",

From its availability and facilities to supply depend over 909 ths.  inhabitants or 25% of the country population. The most important water resources are surface water that are represented mainly by the Dniester and the Prut rivers situated at the borders of the pilot region as well as groundwater. Internal rivers are characterized by low flow and do not represent significant resources. Surface water resources lead to decrease for the last decades due to different factors including reservoirs impact as well as climate change. Development of water supply and especially water sewerage system is an important factor in order to assure people and industries with water and qualitative life. In this regard, plus to evaluation of water resources dynamics, the aim of the present research is regional and local assessment of the state and use of public water supply and sanitation systems in the mentioned region for the last decade (2010-2020). Thus, total volume of abstracted water for public water supply systems was, on average, 18.8 mil. m³. For the study period, the total volume of water delivered to the population increased by 1.8 times (4.1 mil. m3), including in rural areas by 4.5 times (by 2.6 mil. m³), and in urban areas, by only 35 % (1.6 mil. m³). As a result of the expansion of the aqueduct network, ≈½ (48%) of the population of region has access to public water supply systems, including 83% in urban areas and only 31% in rural areas. Despite the rapid expansion of public aqueducts, water consumption per capita is low and is only 71 l/day, including 84 l/ day in urban areas and only 53 l/day in rural areas. Population access to the public sewerage systems is only 19%, including 55% in the urban areas and only 0.3% − in the rural areas. Slow expansion of the public sewerage systems is caused by higher costs compared to water supply systems, and most local public authorities do not consider them as a priority.</jats:p>"

In order to help prevent and reduce food waste, reduce the environmental impact of food production and food waste, and promote access to healthy food for all, it is essential to design and develop smart, food-oriented food chains. Therefore, the involvement of local entrepreneurs, municipalities and citizens in the development of the food security ecosystem of cities and regions is important. Involvement in local food supply chains allows businesses to increase the added value of their products and make farmers less vulnerable to market risks by reducing the number of intermediaries through diversification and better price control, guaranteeing less asymmetric relationships with customers. Municipalities promote the consumption of quality products through green public procurement of food and thus reduce the risk of obesity and chronic diseases, but in the long run the costs of health care. In Latvia, according to the data of 2019, only 3% of biologically certified farms sold their products through public procurement, incl. purchase of school catering. The aim of this study is to identify barriers and possible solutions for increasing the share of local organic food purchased by mainstream schools. The study finds that the role of local organic food in green public procurement and its impact on territorial development is linked to environmental, social and economic benefits. The main obstacles to participating in GPP tenders and winning the tender were: 1) the quantity and range of products required (division of goods into lots), as well as the purchase prices of organic products; 2) high bureaucratic burden for “small” producers, complex Electronic Procurement System and tender submission criteria; 3 cal organic food is more expensive than imported; 4) limited financial resources; 5) insufficient amount of food produced. There were significant communication gaps between stakeholders regarding GPP, as well as a lack of knowledge about the organic market and how to implement GPP.</jats:p>",

We develop a simulation model to analyze the effects of various supply chain node disruptions on new retail supply chain performance and service level with consideration of four scenarios: disruption-free; manufacturer disruption; warehouse center disruption; offline store disruption. The main results show that supply chain node disruptions have negative impacts on the performance and service level. Besides, the warehouse center disruption has the most devastating effect on this new retail supply chain. Overall, this paper provides insights for decision-makers to consider disruption issues when designing resilient new retail supply chains.</jats:p>"

To solve the problem of multi-source heterogeneity of on-board system O&amp;M data, an entity matching (EM) approach using the BERT model and semi-supervised incremental learning is proposed. The heterogeneous knowledge fusion task is formulated as a pairwise binary classification task of entities in the knowledge units. Firstly, the deep semantic features of fault knowledge units are obtained by BERT. We also investigate the effectiveness of knowledge unit features extracted from different hidden layers of the model on heterogeneous knowledge fusion during model fine-tuning. To further improve the utilization of unlabeled test samples, a semi-supervised incremental learning strategy based on pseudo labels is devised. By selecting entity pairs with high confidence to generate pseudo labels, the label sample set is expanded to realize incremental learning and enhance the knowledge fusion ability of the model. Furthermore, the model’s robustness is strengthened by embedding-based adversarial training in the fine-tuning stage. Based on the on-board system’s O&amp;M data, this paper constructs the fault KB and compares the model with other solutions developed for related matching tasks, which verifies the effectiveness of this model in the heterogeneous knowledge fusion task of the on-board system.</jats:p>",

To reduce overall emissions, it is also necessary to reduce them from agricultural production. The study aims to assess the size and dynamics of changes in emissions from agriculture in EU countries. Based on FAO data, a trend in 1999–2019 was determined. It was also assessed how the level of emissions changed per production unit, including the extent to which these changes resulted from changes in the production volume and to what extent from the improvement of the production techniques. Overall, production increased by about 0.8% during the period under review, and GHG emissions decreased by 10.8% to 587 Mt CO2 eq. As a result, the emission intensity decreased by 11.5% from 1.74 to 1.54 kg CO2 eq. per 1 Int. $. There were differences in reducing emissions per unit of production between countries. The emissions per unit decreased more in the NMS with less developed agriculture, which has more significant potential to improve produc tion techniques. In more developed countries, changes were minor, and some even increased emissions per production unit. The main factor in reducing the emission intensity by 0.2 kg CO2 eq. per 1 Int. $ was the introduction of better production techniques with a 74% share in this change; to a lesser extent, it was possi ble through better use of energy in farms (26% share). Further reduction of the emission intensity will be relatively small. It may result from the regional intensifi cation of agriculture, the increase in production scale, and the higher level of mechanization. A more signifi cant reduction of emissions will require a reduction of production and changes in its structure, mainly limiting the production of cattle and milk and thus changes in the level and food consumption structure.</jats:p>",

We test hypotheses using two-waved survey data from 206 Chinese manufacturers and structural equation model analysis. The results indicate that information sharing with customer mediates the impact of green customer integration on radical environmental innovation, while information redundancy mediates the effects of green supplier integration on environmental incremental and radical innovation. In addition, information sharing with supplier negatively affects information redundancy, while information sharing with customer positively affects information redundancy. We also find that knowledge combination strengthens the positive effects of information sharing with supplier and customer on incremental environmental innovation and the negative impact of information redundancy on radical environmental innovation.

We compare EU10 average figures to EU27/15 averages and outline the changes by specialisation in total resource use of (i) labour (AWU), (ii) land (UAA) as well as in (iii) average farm size (UAA/specialised farms), (iv) total farm productivity (SO/farm), (v) labour productivity (SO/AWU) and (vi) area productivity (SO/UAA). We conclude that production and productivity growth of specialised farms in EU 10 differs by country, and by type and size of farming and, each CEEC has followed her own path of farm structure development in line with the country’s tradition and economic possibilities. We give regional characteristics of development in main specialisation types broken down to 5 farm size categories. We concluded the number of cereal farms increased in 6 out of 10 countries in all farm size categories and that of cattle farms went up in 5 out of EU 10 from 2005 to 2016. Farms with these two specializations have significantly extended agriculture land use and more than tripled production, but used more labor compared to basis year. SO/Farm/UAA/AWU productivity indicators of cereal farms increased quite a bit in most farm size categories in all EU 10 countries to a less extent in cattle, poultry pig and dairy farms. Growth in area productivity was led by pig, poultry, and cereal farms at E 10 level. Growth of the three productivity indicators in EU 10 are scattered quite a bit by farm types, and by countries but generally was headed by three farm size categories as 5-19.9 ha, 20-49.9 ha and 50-99.9 ha. However, the distance between EU10 and EU15 related to the level of production, land, and labour productivity still shows wide gap which needs to further narrow in the coming years.</jats:p>",

We construct alternative future narratives that vary economic growth, forest management, and environmental policies and then conduct econometric analysis to project forest area and timber supply over the next 80 years under five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Forest area changes from 2020–2100 ranged from a 11% decline in SSP3 (regional rivalry) to 0.2% for SSP1 (sustainability). Maine’s forest carbon stocks and timber supply can still mutually increase before 2070 for all pathways, largely due to improvements in forest management, growth, and yield. Overall timber supply is projected to increase by 0.21–0.51% per annum, with supply expanding faster for pathways with higher timber price growth. Total forest carbon stocks (ecosystem and products) are projected to increase 0.40–0.64%/yr for similar reasons. Sensitivity analysis indicated the key drivers most likely to affect Maine’s forest sector are timber prices, population change, personal income, land value, and conservation land area.

Therefore, the scientific problem solved in the article is: how does joy and fear advertising appeals impact willingness to recycle? This paper aims to determine the impact of joy and fear advertising appeals on willingness to recycle. To reach the aim of the article, the implicit association test and questionnaire survey were provided. The analysis of research results revealed that the fear appeal advertisement for recycling seems more interesting, but the implication can be made that a bigger impact on the attitude toward recycling and willingness to act is made by joy appeal advertisement which is preferred unconsciously.</jats:p>",

Direct employment in the power generation sector witnessed a net growth of 0.12 million, while over 10 times that number of jobs (1.40 million) have been lost in the upstream sectors, mainly in coal mining and washing, finance, oil and gas extraction and transportation. Among the top 10 critical paths, the share of employment driven by solar and wind power increased to 12.31% in 2017, more than nine times that in 2012. Furthermore, three scenarios have been set up to evaluate the employment patterns in 2030 and 2050. Under the 1.5 °C scenario, projection shows that the power sector could support over 5 million jobs in 2050, with more than 80% of these being related to renewable energy. Policy suggestions for a just transition, such as resettlement of laid-off workers and job transfer in upstream industries, are comprehensively discussed.</jats:p>",

The productivity of poultry is characterised by the rate of egg-laying or the number of eggs produced per hen a year and affected by the availability and diversity of feed materials (especially protein). In recent years, researchers have focused on legumes of various species as promising sources of protein for livestock production, such as beans, peas, lupine, alfalfa etc.; therefore, in Latvia more attention is paid to the production of protein crops or legumes. The aim of the research was to identify the impact of domestically sourced legume seeds included in diets for laying hens on the economic performance of egg production. Two kinds of protein crops were examined by the research: peas `Bruno` and dried alfalfa pellets. Feeding laying hens with peas or dried alfalfa pellets made it possible to produce eggs with a heavier weight (55.28-67.07%), which in turn makes it possible to increase revenues (10.3-12.9%) from the sales of eggs with the same feed consumption.</jats:p>",

Government policies related to lowering carbon emissions deeply affect supply chains. This paper builds a supply chain decision-making model under three different regulatory policies: a pure carbon tax, a pure low-carbon subsidy, and a mixed policy with both a carbon tax and a low-carbon subsidy, then compares and analyzes the impacts of these three different regulatory policies on carbon emissions, manufacturer and retailer income, and marginal profit in order to determine the best course of action with respect to supply chain decision-making. Our results indicate that the supply chain decision-making model under the mixed carbon tax and low-carbon subsidy policy results in a unique Nash equilibrium solution between the retailer subsidy rate and the manufacturing carbon reduction rate in a non-cooperative game. Although a carbon tax is beneficial to the ecological environment, retailer income increases slightly as the carbon tax coefficient increases before declining rapidly. Manufacturer income has a negative linear relationship with carbon tax, and an excessive amount of carbon tax increases the burden on companies. Therefore, the government must establish reasonable standards for carbon tax collection while offering moderate low-carbon subsidies at the same time as a means of optimizing social welfare.</jats:p>"

Here, the Baihua Lake watershed, an important drinking water source for Guiyang City, was taken as the study area. The location-weighted landscape contrast index (LCI) and non-point source pollution risk index (NSPRI) were developed based on the ‘source–sink’ landscape theory. The method takes into account the risk of pollution source formation and pollutant transport. A total of 348 natural sub-watersheds were used as assessment units by estimating the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution emission (absorption) potentials of different landscape types in the sub-watersheds and considering the influence of vegetation cover, distance from the reservoir, and slope in the transmission process, a quantitative assessment of Baihua Lake's pollution was carried out; the reliability of the method was verified by comparing the assessment results with measured water quality data and field surveys. The results indicate (1) 132 sub-watersheds (37.93%) dominated by source effects, mainly distributed in Yanshanhong Township, Yeya Township, and the Qinglong Subdistrict, with construction land and farmland as the main landscape types, and 216 sub-watersheds (62.07%) dominated by sink effects, mainly distributed in Zhanjie and Baihuahu Townships, with forests as the primary landscape type. (2) Additionally, 17 sub-watersheds (4.89%) show extremely high risk for non-point source pollution; these watersheds are mainly distributed in the Qinglong Subdistrict and mainly consist of urban residential areas and schools. These sub-watersheds discharge a large volume of sewage, which threatens the water quality of the upper reaches of Baihua Lake and must be managed.

Progress in information technology opens up opportunities for commercial transactions in the digital environment, thereby raising operational productivity and the flow of goods and services to a new level. The digital transformation of commercial transactions occurred very fast owing to the CODID-19 pandemic, thereby contributing to a significant increase in the number of commercial transactions both globally and nationally that have become available to more than half of the world’s population. Making digital commercial transactions is affected by a number of factors: information technology infrastructure, Internet speed, digital security, consumer skills, consumer protection and delivery logistics. The research analysed data on the population using the Internet in Latvia, the EU and the world. The research identified correlations between: the number of digital commercial transactions and the population, mobile Internet speed and the number of individuals who shopped online, the categories of goods purchased online and gender, the amounts of money spent on online purchases and the employment category. In 2020, according to Eurostat, 56% of the population of Latvia made digital commercial transactions. The figure for Latvia was 8% lower than the European Union average. A comparison of the numbers of digital commercial transactions between Latvia and the other Baltic States revealed that the figures for Latvia were mediocre. The number of transactions was higher in Latvia than in Lithuania by 2%, while Estonia experienced the largest increase in the number of digital transactions, which was 12% higher than in Latvia. The comparison indicates that it is possible to increase the number of digital commercial transactions in Latvia.</jats:p>",

A reliable traceability system for the whole grain and oil food supply chain will help to improve the quality and safety of these products, thus enhancing people’s living standards. Driven by the trusted blockchain and trusted identity concepts, this paper constructs an information traceability model for the whole grain and oil food supply chain, and it describes how contract implementation and example verification are performed. First, an information traceability model framework of the whole grain and oil food supply chain is established based on the survey and analysis of the grain and oil food supply chain. Second, trusted identification, blockchain master–slave multi-chain storage, and trusted traceability mechanisms are designed. The trusted identification mechanism is used to track the data information of the whole grain and oil food supply chain. The blockchain master–slave multi-chain storage solves the problem of miscellaneous information caused by many links in the whole grain and oil supply chain, while the credible traceability mechanism ensures the credibility of information collection, storage, and transmission. Finally, based on the data flow, the model operation process is analyzed. Using the information traceability model, the grain and oil food trusted traceability system is designed and developed with the Hyperledger Fabric open-source framework, and a case study is conducted to verify the system. The results show that the model and system constructed in this study solve the problems of low data security and poor sharing, which exist widely in the traditional traceability mechanism, and enable the trusted uplink, storage, processing, and traceability of multi-source heterogeneous information in the lifecycle of the whole grain and oil food supply chain. The proposed system improves the granularity and accuracy of grain and oil food traceability, and provides support for the strategic security of grain stock.</jats:p>"

The composite addition of biochar and phosphate material is considered a promising method of immobilizing toxic metals in sandy soils, but the synergistic effects of this process still need to be further explored, especially in typical tropical vegetables. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the agronomic and toxic metal-immobilization effects of single amendments (phosphate rock, activated phosphate rock, and biochar) and combined amendments, including biochar mixed with phosphate rock (BCPR) and biochar mixed with activated phosphate rock (BCAPR), on vegetables grown in tropical sandy soil. Among these amendments, the composite amendment BCAPR was the most effective for increasing Ca, Mg, and P uptake based on water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), showing increased ratios of 22.5%, 146.0%, and 136.0%, respectively. The SEM-EDS and FTIR analysis verified that the activation process induced by humic acid resulted in the complexation and chelation of the elements P, Ca, and Mg into bioavailable forms. Furthermore, the retention of available nutrition elements was enhanced due to the strong adsorption capacity of the biochar. In terms of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) passivation, the formation of insoluble mineral precipitates reduced the mobility of these metals within the BCAPR treatments, with the maximum level of extractable Cd (86.6%) and Pb (39.2%) reduction being observed in the tropical sandy soil. These results explore the use of sustainable novel cost-effective and highly efficient bi-functional mineral-based soil amendments for metal passivation and plant protection.</jats:p>"

Although the electrification of vehicles and replacing petrol with biofuel are the strategies being considered in Malaysia, these strategies have yet to be fully evaluated from an environmental perspective. In this study, a life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the greenhouse gas emissions of different types of transportation means (passenger cars, two-wheelers (motorbikes), and buses) with several types of powertrains (petrol, biodiesel, electricity) based on multiple lifecycle stages in Malaysia. The impact of considering land use change for the biodiesel production in the LCA was also considered in this study. It was found that the transition from internal combustion engine vehicles fueled by petrol to electric vehicles would reduce the greenhouse gas emission for passenger cars, two-wheelers, and buses. However, because the greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel-fueled vehicles are higher than those of petrol-fueled vehicles, even without considering land use change, the results indicate that the transition from a 10% to 20% biofuel blend, which is a current strategy in Malaysia, will not result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the transport sector in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

The analysis was based on the specifics of the agrosphere, including that one of the types of products is the main one (grain, root crops, marketable fish), the others are conjugate or secondary. A zonation of the production of marketable crop production has been formed. As a result of the research, the distribution of farms was carried out in accordance with the recommended zoning.

A method for the distribution of the main indicators of objective factors for reducing the cost of crop production and livestock industries is proposed.

A revised DO model for shallow eutrophic lakes was applied to identify trends in the lake's DO content during the non-frozen period and determine the equilibrium relationship of DO in the water body. The coefficient of determination and the Nash efficiency of the model proved the feasibility of the model. The main drivers affecting the DO balance of the lake were photosynthesis, aeration and the lateral movements of oxygen-rich water, which accounted for 49.28, 14.72 and 36%, respectively, whereas respiration and sediment oxygen consumption, on the other hand, accounted for 1.56 and 98.44%, respectively. These findings suggest that photosynthesis and sediment oxygen consumption dominate the DO balance in eutrophic shallow lakes. A trend analysis of the average oxygen production and consumption rates indicated a maximum of 0.22 mg/L·h for photosynthesis and 0.20 mg/L·h for sediment oxygen consumption. A correlation analysis showed that water temperature was involved in changing the DO level of the lake mainly by affecting the oxygen consumption process.</jats:p>",

However, LSP’s smart transformation faces uncertainty in terms of investments and income, which seriously hinders LSP’s enthusiasm for logistics service innovation. In this paper, we construct a logistics service supply chain (LSSC) consisting of an LSI and an LSP to explore the incentive mechanism for LSPs to undergo smart transformation. As a benchmark for comparison, we first obtain the equilibrium results under centralized decision making and wholesale price (WP) contracts. Then, cost-sharing (CS), revenue-sharing (RS), and cost sharing–revenue sharing (CS-RS) hybrid contracts are proposed. It is found that when the CS coefficient is in a certain interval, the CS contract can increase the profit of LSI and the smart level of logistics service, but it will decrease the profit of LSP. With the exception that the wholesale price of logistics services will decrease, the equilibrium results under the RS contract and WP contract remain consistent. Only the CS-RS hybrid contract can achieve the perfect coordination of LSSC. In addition, by conducting numerical analysis, we find that the enhancement of the smart effect can encourage LSP to improve the smart level and increase the overall revenue of LSSC. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to explore the incentive mechanism between LSI and LSP in the context of logistics service smart transformation.

We developed a game-theoretic framework with a manufacturer and retailer as a leader and follower, respectively, and the retailer makes the promotional effort. We examined the effects of product quality, promotional effort, and hybrid channels on the supply chain performance in four dual-channel structures. We found that, regardless of qualities, retailers generally prefer to engage in the promotion even though manufacturers are reluctant to share promotional costs. However, promotional effort does not always improve the supply chain profit across channels, and there is an interaction between product-channel structure and promotional effort. The preferences of manufacturers and retailers in all feasible regions of quality levels within the aforementioned structures can be ranked. There exists a feasible region of quality levels where the supply chain can achieve the Pareto improvement without any additional coordination mechanism, and both players prefer the channel structure (Π4) that retailers sell high-quality products with promotional effort. Moreover, the extended analysis suggests that the less significant the product variety is, the less effort is made by the retailer to promote the products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid growth in the prevalence of allergic diseases among children in the modern world dictates the need for detailed study of pathogenetic mechanisms, the search for new methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this pathology. Recent studies of the important immunological effects of vitamin D in allergic pathology make it important to study its effect on the course of gastrointestinal food allergy (GIFA) in young children. Purpose - to determine the serum concentrations of IL-10 and IL-17 in young children with GIFA, depending on the supply of vitamin D. Materials and methods. We examined 34 children aged from 2 months to 3 years with isolated gastrointestinal symptoms or a combination of gastrointestinal and skin symptoms associated with food. The comparison group consisted of 22 children of the same age with an unencumbered individual and family history of allergies. All examined children had quantified serum cytokine (IL-10, IL-17A) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and serum hydroxycalciferol (25(OH)D) levels. Vitamin D deficiency in subjects was considered at a concentration of 25(OH)D in serum &lt;20 ng/ml (or &lt;50 nmol/l), a concentration of 21 ng/ml to 29 ng/ml (or from 50.1 nmol/l up to 74.9 nmol/l) was assessed as vitamin D deficiency. A sufficient concentration of vitamin D was considered to be 25(OH)D serum level &gt;30 ng/ml. Data of clinical and laboratory researches were processed by methods of mathematical statistics accepted in biology and medicine. Results. There was a significantly increase in the average concentrations of IL-17A (180.4±23.0 pg/ml) and IL-10 (113.8±15.0 pg/ml) in children with gastrointestinal food allergy and in the comparison group - 45.7±18.1 pg/ml and 32.1±11.4 pg/ml, respectively, (p&lt;0.05), which reflects the intensity of the allergic inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract. In children with allergic gastrointestinal inflammation who were deficient in vitamin D, the mean concentrations of proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A and regulatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly higher than in children with GIFA and optimal supply of vitamin D 244.9±19.7 ng/ml and 49.45±2.14 ng/ml respectively against 135.2±33.3 ng/ml and 26.41±1.81 ng/ml respectively, (p&lt;0,05), which indicates a more intense activity of the inflammatory process in the intestine of children with insufficient supply of vitamin D. Conclusions. Allergic gastrointestinal inflammation in young children is characterized by increased concentrations of serum proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines - IL-10 and IL-17A, that is a protective reaction of the immune system and can be used as a marker of allergic inflammation in GIFA. The study of the regulatory effect of vitamin D on the expression of cytokines (IL-10 and IL-17A) in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation in young children will optimize the pathogenetic treatment of gastrointestinal food allergies. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study protocol was approved by the Local ethics committee of the participating institution. The informed consent of the patient was obtained for conducting the studies. No conflict of interests was declared by the authors. Key words: cytokine status, young children, allergic pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, vitamin D.</jats:p>",

In this research, firstly, a vehicle-road dynamics model has been developed. In addition, the actual driving trajectory data of skilled drivers are collected by driving simulator, and the lane-changing path planning model is established based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Last, in order to improve the tracking ability to the planning path, the trajectory tracking controller is established. A two-layer structure of lateral trajectory tracking control system is designed, in which the upper layer includes two algorithms: (1) PID feedback control based on preview deviation; (2) PID feedforward-feedback control based on the curvature of the path planning by skilled drivers. While the extension goodness evaluation is introduced in the lower layer which is used to evaluate two controllers in upper layer. According to the real-time state of vehicle-road system, the controller output with higher goodness is selected. Finally, the simulation results verify that comparing with the conventional single PID feedback control, the extension goodness evaluation control can effectively improve the passenger comfort while ensuring tracking accuracy. </jats:p>",

We use annual time series data covering the year from 1970 to 2018 and employ the Autoregressive Distributive lag (ARDL) and Granger causality test. The results of the ARDL-bound test confirm cointegration between the variables, as the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected. Further, the long-run results show that financial development and urbanization have positive correlation with energy demand. However, economic growth is negatively correlated with energy consumption. Similarly, in the short run, the financial market and urbanization stimulated energy demand. However, economic growth is insignificant with energy consumption. Besides that, a bidirectional relationship is noted between urbanization and energy consumption. Based on the finding, this empirical study suggests that policymakers and government should revisit their policies regarding economic growth, explore alternative sources of energy, and try to shift towards renewable energy, which is cheaper and eco-friendly.</jats:p>"

We used a PROBIT model to determine the influence of exogenous and endogenous factors on the choice of a small trading partner. The customers that come to the smallholders’ house to purchase the product are regarded as an exogenous factor. More attention needs to be paid to increasing value-added in the food chain in Uzbekistan and improving economic relations between its actors. The factor obtained as an instrumental variable is assessed as having a positive and high impact on the choice of smallholder intermediate trade partner. In other words, an increase in the level of acquaintances of intermediaries with smallholders will increase economic cooperation by 1.2 times, an increase in family income from agriculture by 19% and an increase in smallholder activity in the mahalle by 15.7%. It is estimated that the increase in the number of respondents’ livestock per unit, foreign experience per year and the level of use of credits per unit will increase economic cooperation with direct consumers by 34.4, 13.4 and 28.5%, respectively.

High cell density culture is favourable for photoautotrophic starch production in microalgae in the aspects of productivity and economy, but it often encounters low starch content or extra stress exposure that limits the production. This study aimed to economically enhance photosynthetic starch production from CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation in a green microalga <jats:italic>Tetraselmis subcordiformis</jats:italic> by regulating photosynthetic stress status with a signalling molecule γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) combined with the application of high initial cell density culture. By increasing initial cell density (ICD) from the normal of 1.1 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (NICD) to as high as 2.8 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (HICD), the starch content, yield, and theoretical productivity were improved by 7%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. The addition of GABA under HICD resulted in 14%, 19%, and 26% of further enhancement in starch content, yield, and theoretical productivity, respectively. GABA exhibited distinct regulatory mechanisms on photosynthesis and stress status under HICD relative to NICD. GABA augmented excessive light energy absorption and electron transfer through photosystem II that reinforced the photoinhibition under NICD, while alleviated the stress reversely under HICD, both of which facilitated starch production by enabling a suitable stress status while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient photosynthetic activity. The increase of ICD and/or GABA supply particularly boosted amylopectin accumulation, leading to the changes in starch composition and was more favourable for fermentation-based biofuels production. Preliminary techno-economic analysis showed that the highest net extra benefit of 9.64 $ m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> culture could be obtained under HICD with 2.5 mM GABA supply where high starch content (62%DW) and yield (2.5 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) were achieved.

As a typical rapidly urbanizing area and an emerging megacity in China, Chengdu is confronting the pressure of inadequate water supply. The present study divides the macroeconomic factors that affect the water resource supply and demand balance into six major subsystems: water resources supply, water demand, water drainage, population, ecological environment and economy. The combining variable interaction description and predictive simulation models are applied to simulate the water supply and demand ratio (S:D) from 2005 to 2035. Further, this study designs different development scenarios to simulate the change of S:D ratios by altering the parameter values of driving factors. The results show that: (1) the S:D ratio will decline if the current development scenario continues, implying the serious water resources shortage and the severe water supply-demand conflict in Chengdu; (2) socio-economic water demand and wastewater/rainwater reuse are the key driving parameters of S:D ratio, especially the water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial value-added; (3) the S:D ratio will increase from 0.92 in the current baseline scenario to 1.06 in the integrated optimization scenario in 2025, and the long-term planning brings 2035 from 0.71 to 1.03, with the proportion of unconventional water supply rise to 38% and 61%, respectively. This study can provide a decision-making tool for policy-makers to explore plausible policy scenarios necessary for bridging the gap between the water supply and demand in megacities.</jats:p>"
