      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the central role of customers in services, it is striking that the predominant view of service supply chain management is primarily based on the perspective of the organization. In this conceptual study, we explore the conceptualization and management of service supply chains from a customer perspective, that is, how a customer manages, coordinates and integrates service provision to create value. We have taken a systems thinking lens, and in particular Checkland's characterization of systems (1981), to guide our analysis, worldview, boundaries, hierarchies and mechanisms of control. As a result of this perspective, we have identified eight features of service supply chains and suggested four research opportunities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research examines the relationship between strategy and structure in the highly complex services offshore outsourcing environment. The analysis uses data from the in‐depth case studies of six organizations that purchase services (primarily call center services) to assess how the strategy of offshore outsourcing of services affects organizational structure and to develop a better understanding of the offshore outsourcing of services phenomenon. While organizations often have local buying offices and very formal structures for buying materials globally, the same is not true for purchased services. The issue of proper organizational structure for effectively managing offshore outsourced services has not been assessed. This research also aims to add to the growing body of literature related to Service‐Dominant Logic, which recognizes that services cannot be effectively studied through the lens of manufacturing. This research applies case study findings to assess how the elements of structure, namely centralization, formalization and complexity, are affected by offshore outsourcing of services. All of the organizations studied here indicate that their processes evolved and that pursuing an offshore services purchasing strategy lead to structural adaptations in terms of more centralized, team‐based structures, more formalized processes and more complex structures. However, most of the cases tried to retain some level of flexibility to allow for continued adaptation and improvement.</jats:p>",

A fundamental purpose of the STF is to more clearly define the field of SSC research and to provide conceptual foundations, as well as empirical observations. A review of SSC literature shows three perspectives of SSC research that correspond to the source‐make‐deliver processes from the well‐known supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. The STF contains articles that assume each of the three SSC perspectives: sourcing of services, making services, and services involved in product delivery. A fourth paper introduces a newer perspective in which the customer is the center of a network of interrelated service providers. This STF can serve as a springboard for future SSC research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article conceptualizes service supply chains according to the Unified Service Theory, which defines services as bidirectional supply chains that have customers both providing resources to and receiving resources from service providers. We establish how eight traditional roles in manufacturing supply chains are assumed by customers in service supply chains. Those service–customer roles include component supplier, labor, design engineer, production manager, product, quality assurance, inventory, and competitor. We describe how these eight roles are manifested in both business‐to‐consumer and business‐to‐business service contexts. We confirm the distinctiveness of these eight customer roles through an initial empirical study and show how the roles are manifested across different types of services. We then demonstrate how these distinctive customer roles can form the basis for service supply chain innovation.</jats:p>",

Satisfying consumers' water needs requires energy for supply, purification, distribution, and treatment of water and wastewater. This energy consumption to provide water is linked with negative environmental externalities. This paper provides an overview of the energy and environmental costs related to water supply services in Mexico City, one of the largest cities in the world; this city is heading towards a major water crisis, more than 30% of its water supply comes from external sources. The internal groundwater sources are overexploited between 9 and 12 m3/s generating 6–28 cm of sinking every year. The current water availability is 130 lt/person/day, which is below the minimum requirements. Also, half of Mexico City's water supply is lost through poor infrastructure alone and mismanagement of water resources. The external and internal sources of water supply are analyzed in terms of the energy consumption and costs as well as the generation of contaminants in the atmosphere such as CO2, SO2, N2O. Finally, some opportunity areas are provided to reduce energy use and contamination of the non-sustainable water consumption pattern of Mexico City.</jats:p>",

Yet supply chain visibility generally remains a challenge as observations of order progress are often irregular and collected manually. The emergence of Automated Identification (Auto-ID) technologies like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is improving the effectiveness of supply chain tracking systems. The authors propose a model that describes how Auto-ID observations across a supply chain and historical observation data can be combined to produce an ongoing order location estimation over time. The model is based on probabilistic reasoning principles and the resulting location estimation can be used to support operational decisions as well as to assess the quality and value of tracking information. The authors provide explicit instructions as to how to use the proposed model and using an illustrative example, they demonstrate how the model can produce ongoing location estimates based on RFID read events.</p>",

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the reconstruction of water supply system from the economic viewpoint and identifies affecting factors. Assessments show it is more effective to terminate 60% of plants. The following factors were taken into account; intake water amount, length of conveyance pipe, diameter of conveyance pipe, difference in elevation between the abolished and integrated plants, and ratio of hourly maximum amount of water distribution, treatment capacity ratio, the anti-seismic capacity of abolished plants. Out of these factors, the intake water amount from abolished plant to merged plant has the highest correlated factor affecting the reconstruction of water supply system from the economic viewpoint.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The Indian retail industry majorly constitutes of small retailers, comprising of approximately 12 million small shopkeepers and increased competition has made companies understand the significance of this unorganized small retail sector. Most companies feel that coordinating their downstream supply chains is critical for long term growth and sustainability. The paper examines the supply chain coordination amongst retailers, distributors, logistics providers, customers, and major Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) multi-national companies in India. The findings confirm that supply chain integration, information sharing, and supply chain design are being given proper attention by FMCG companies. They appreciate the strategic value of information sharing for establishing collaborations with the small retailers for effective performance of supply chains. Even in the fragmented, ill-defined, unorganized, and disjointed small retail sector in India, information sharing between supply chain partners is given precedence. Lack of technological infrastructure does not deter MNCs from establishing information linkages with small retailers and harnessing it for supply chain efficiency.</p>",

This research takes e-tourism, a relatively new discipline, as a case study, highlighting a knowledge supply chain is the potential solution to leverage the understanding of tourism industry needs and tourism curriculum provision. The paper begins with a competency gap analysis between knowledge demand and supply. It then applies the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model to analyze the “as-is” situation of the present knowledge flow in curriculum design, and finally proposes a “to-be” conceptual framework by integrating tools and methods of knowledge management and supply chain management in a knowledge supply chain (KSC). This demonstrates that a KSC can help in achieving e-tourism requirements of higher education stakeholders at both industrial and academic levels.</p>",

BPA, chlorinated BPAs, and TCP were not detected in the tap water at the outlet of lined pipes in most cases. However, all of these chemicals were detected in the tap water after 16 h of retention. The sums of BPA and chlorinated BPAs in the retained tap water were usually high when the residual chlorine levels were low. The residual chlorine was related to temperature, residual chlorine in the tap water at the inlet of lined pipes, and the elapsed time. From the results of leach tests, it was indicated that no marked changes in BPA concentration over the 24 months of the continuous test. Chlorinated BPAs and TCP were accumulated on the surface of lined pipes during the continuous test.</jats:p>",

This is an applied research and has done as a Survey, Correlation and cause-effect research. In this research, confirmative factor analysis, correlation test, co-linearity test, and path analysis were used. Innovation aspect of the study is making a comprehensive view to relationship between supply chain strategies, business strategies, and knowledge management strategies with knowledge sharing in the supply chain. Another innovative aspect of the study is attention to supply chain strategies in context of knowledge management, because there are few researches about knowledge management in supply chain. The paper tries to describe quantitatively all the relations in multidimensional structure. Findings show that effective knowledge sharing in supply chain is influenced by the hierarchy of strategies. Therefore, supply chain strategies influence the business strategies and business strategies affects knowledge strategies and at least, knowledge strategies influence the effective and systematic knowledge sharing in the supply chain. Therefore, knowledge sharing is most of all influenced by knowledge management strategies; but is indirectly influenced by business strategies and supply chain strategies.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The primary goal of this study is to investigate the roles of expectations and purchase criticality on consumers' brand perceptions and attribution behaviors in service delivery failures. The provision of logistics services is often a crucial point in supply chain management that can influence brand perceptions of customers. Indeed, the level and the quality of customer service provided may determine whether the organization will retain existing customers or even attract new ones. As a consequence, a failure in logistics customer service and its effect on overall perceptions of a brand should not be underestimated. Furthermore, the involvement of a third‐party logistics (3<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PL</jats:styled-content>) company in this failure situation can create considerable shifts in the responses of consumers, especially in the attribution behavior for cause of failure. By applying scenario‐based experiments, this study demonstrates the dynamics by which customer expectations, purchase criticality and 3<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PL</jats:styled-content> companies affect consumer brand perceptions and attributions. The results suggest the presence of two expectation‐based buffering effects in delivery failures. The first buffering effect is revealed in overall brand evaluation and repurchase intention, while the second buffering effect is observed in consumer brand attribution. The findings indicate that higher expectations may protect the brand and cause more attribution to the third‐party service provider. Additionally, it is shown that criticality of the purchase has crucial impacts on brand evaluations and attributions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cyprus Island has been divided into two parts since 1974. In April 2003 crossing the Green Line across the borders became possible and both parts of the Island benefited from this; firstly due to resulted domestic tourism in both sides and secondly from new employment opportunities mainly for Turkish Cypriots in South. Besides that, positive expectations over the Cyprus problem accelerated the expenditures in both sides. In the North, demand for land and new dwellings increased, pushing prices upward. Demand for land and a new property by foreigners is busted in recent years. The UK, Israel, Russia and some other countries started to buy land in the North Cyprus by securing resources to their businessmen especially in the areas of Komi Kepir, Kalogrea, Akanthou, Karpass, Risokarpaso, Yialousa and Livera. Such increase in demand by foreigners decreased the supply of land to domestic use. This has many implications on North Cyprus economy which is very small with limited resources in production. In this study, 4- factor, 13-industry a single country general equilibrium model is used to investigate the changes in income, employment, prices, output and inputs required for production resulted from this supply shock. Results show that, under fixed capital and flexible labor market, 10% reduction in land supply increased the value of land by 108.8%, income increased by 2.04 % and prices of skilled labor and capital increased by 1.028% and 1.020% respectively and due to the reduction of land supply, output decreased by 1.53%.</jats:p>",

Water resource needs for the future will be significantly affected by climate change and population growth. A ‘Water for Life’ equation has been adopted as a multi-faceted approach to achieving future, sustainable water security. The four parts of the equation are dams, recycling, water efficiency and desalination. Significant achievements have been made over the last 10 years which have allowed us to bolster the demand/supply balance by 50%. In the future, a portfolio approach will be used to select schemes for water supply security. Major factors considered will include construction and operational cost, volume of water saved or produced, public health and environmental risk, customer and community acceptance and political willpower.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most water distribution networks are assemblies of buried elements which makes their diagnosis complex and requires implementing an asset management (AM) policy of actions performed in the short, medium and long terms. To implement such an AM, decision makers must diagnose the condition of the asset by developing specific tools for establishing priorities between assets and plan the actions needed to maintain or improve their condition. This study focuses on two topics. (i) The implementation of a spatiotemporal analysis of the propagation of pipe breaks. This innovative approach inspired by criminality analysis allows focusing on hotspot zones in order to discriminate critical assets. We have designed a new ‘clustering’ criterion that can be used as a prioritization criterion for asset sorting. (ii) The second part addresses the issue of multi-criteria decision making concerning the classification of pipe renewal candidates by comparing two kinds of aggregation method: (i) an unsophisticated approach by using adapted weighted sum methods; and (ii) a sophisticated approach by using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and the ‘Elicitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité’ (ELECTRE III). The underlying reason for comparing these methods is to know whether the unsophisticated methods ensure reliable replacement policy compared to the sophisticated one.</jats:p>",

ACPL was started as a trading organisation in electrical items in Delhi by Munish Kumar, an engineer by profession in 2001. In 2004 he ventured into manufacturing, which expanded in two locations in Ghaziabad, NCR Delhi. Later his two sons, engineer and management graduate, respectively, joined the organisation. In less than a decade, by 2007, ACPL had grown to be a private limited organisation. ACPL manufactures ITs required by power boards and companies for conversion and usage of high voltage (11 kV/33 kV) transmitted power into 220 V single phase/440 V three phase power. From tender/enquiry through manufacturing to inspection and despatch takes a long supply chain cycle time holding space as well as inventory. An interview with the chairman of ACPL in the case highlights issues affecting its margins and growth. The long process to delivery time may be in vogue in this type of industry but this holds up a huge inventory. The company management has been working to resolve this crisis along with an urgent need to grow in a competitive environment. The problem is being addressed.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Expected learning outcomes</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This case study should help students to understand the concept of the supply chain and supply cycle, in a manufacturing company in particular. It has been found that students understand the supply chain as part of the marketing function dealing with finished stocks, warehousing and delivery to end customers as per agreements, and arranging payments from customers. The supply chain also deals with in bound materials management. Raw materials planning, purchasing, inventory management are crucial for effective business operations management in any organisation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Supplementary materials</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Teaching notes are available; please contact your librarian for access.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

These problems have greatly affected the effectiveness of our EPC project management as well as the comprehensive performance of our CSC. The reason can be largely attributed to the lack of advanced project management thinking and appropriate EPC project management model. This essay is to introduce lean construction supply chain management model to EPC project, aiming at applying lean thinking as well as relevant lean technologies to solve the major problems of our EPC project management and improve the overall competence of our CSC.

Statistical data regarding the levels of production, internal availabilities for consumption, exports, and imports have been analyzed. The hypothesis whether domestic agricultural output satisfy demand has been verified and the results show that, in order to satisfy demand, imports supplement internal production of agro-food products. The share of imports varies from 4.5% for potatoes to 85% for fish and fish products. Trade balances are negative for all agricultural products, except cereals. These findings have significant implications for the work of policy makers and businesses, as it calls for changing the strategies and practices in this area.</p>",

In the past two decades, SCM has drawn much attention from manufacturers and organizations for optimizing their operations. In this paper, a mathematical model to optimize costs of the supply chain for defective and repairable goods through the application of just-in-time (JIT) logistics is proposed. The hypothesis is that the defective goods are repairable and some of them are considered as scraps. The aim of this model is to minimize the total cost of production, maintenance, freight, reworking, scrap goods and shortage to retailers. The proposed model is novel and LINGO has been used to solve it. The validity of the model was proven by testing 12 sample problems and the results showed correctness and fine function of the model. Based on the data parameters, this model can also determine which manufacturer or distributor in the particular period of the production needs to be active. The model is applicable for all producers that are encountering with problem of producing of defective goods.</jats:p>"

Numerous mortalities can be reduced when an effective national blood transfusion system is in place including leading causes of death such as maternal hemorrhage, sickle cell anemia, and malaria. There exists a circular relationship between blood supply and safety: efforts to ensure donor and recipient safety reduce the population of eligible voluntary blood donors, which in turn restricts blood supply. In this article we describe the main issues for blood supply in developing nations and emerging markets, identify the major causes and impact of transfusion transmitted infections, present a safety model that describes the relationship between defensive barriers in depth to assure safe blood, its effectiveness, and the impact it has on safe blood supply. We use twenty two nations in sub-Sahara Africa to present the safety model. Finally, we discuss strategies for blood safety and supply in developing nations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The replenishment of consumed oxygen in the open ocean oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off West Africa in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is studied, with a focus on oxygen transport across density surfaces (diapycnal flux). The latter is obtained from a large observational set of oxygen profiles and diapycnal mixing data from years 2008 to 2010. Diapycnal mixing is inferred from different sources: a large scale tracer release experiment, microstructure profiles, and shipboard acoustic current measurements plus density profiles. The average diapycnal diffusivity in the study area is 1 × 10−5 m2 s−1. No significant vertical gradient of average diapycnal diffusivities exists in the depth interval from 150 to 500 m. The diapycnal flux is found to contribute substantially to the oxygen supply of the OMZ. Within the OMZ core, 1.5 µmol kg−1 a−1 of oxygen is supplied via diapycnal mixing, contributing about a third of the total demand. The oxygen that is contributed via diapycnal mixing originates from oxygen that has been laterally supplied within the overlying Central Water layer by advective and eddy fluxes. Due to the existence of a separate shallow oxygen minimum at about 100 m depth throughout most of the study area, there is no direct net vertical oxygen flux from the surface layer of the study area into the Central Water layer. Thus all oxygen supply of the OMZ is associated with remote pathways.\n                        </jats:p>"

Most developed countries have undergone a process of secularisation in which the religious attachments of major segments of society, and also certain state institutions, have weakened. In recent years, welfare state expansion has stalled and most welfare states have entered an ‘age of austerity’. Changes in the welfare state terrain – primarily restructuring – have transformed the opportunity structure faced by faith-based organisations. A survey of faith-based organisation involvement in welfare across four countries – England, Israel, Germany and the Netherlands – reveals a complex picture. While in some countries welfare state restructuring creates opportunities for faith-based organisations to expand their role, in others the combination of secularisation and restructuring create unfavourable conditions for these organisations. </jats:p>",

Three feasible alternatives, such as, leaky-well, soak-away and infiltration trench were identified and designed to improve Dhaka's present unsatisfactory stormwater drainage system into one which is sustainable. For selecting the best one, we applied a multi-criteria decision analysis approach and chose the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. Eleven criteria under three categories (technical, economic and social) were considered to quantify relative priorities of alternatives. Pair-wise comparisons of alternatives were performed against each criterion and ranked using a scale from 0 to 9. During the process of applying AHP model, consistency of ranking was thoroughly checked and a reasonable level of inconsistency was accepted due to the nature of human judgement. After the analysis, it was found that leaky-well (percentage priority 43%) followed by soak-away (38%) was the most appropriate technology for improving urban stormwater management system in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The proposed model can also be used in better selecting WSUD and LID technologies in other geographic locations.</jats:p>",

Likewise, in many countries, specific water authorities at national as well as basin and watershed level have been formed and assigned the responsibility to allocate water according to the water policy and the associated legal framework. Yet, findings from the Competing for Water research programme show that real-world water allocation takes place through a wide array of institutions, ranging from the rural community, over agreements mediated by local lawyers, district officials and non-governmental organisations, to decisions made in the president's office. The Competing for Water programme entails empirical research conducted in Bolivia, Mali, Nicaragua, Vietnam and Zambia.

Sulfate radicals (SRs), generated particularly by the metal-mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), have been proposed to effectively decompose TCS and many other pharmaceuticals and personal care products. In spite of its significance for understanding the efficiency of SR generation and catalytic/non-catalytic nature of the oxidation reaction, metal speciation has not been adequately highlighted in previous studies. This study investigated the detailed changes in metal speciation in cobalt/PMS and iron/PMS systems and correlated it with TCS decomposition under different pH conditions. A rapid oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ and Fe2+ to Fe3+ generally corresponded with pseudo-steady state decomposition kinetics of TCS after its initial fast decomposition. The presence of potential threshold concentrations of metals to effectively activate PMS was found. A strong catalytic activity was observed for Co/PMS system at pH 3, where most of Co was present in the form of dissolved Co2+. The pH impacts were different for Co/PMS and Fe/PMS. TCS oxidation was fast at pH 5 for Co and pH 3 for Fe. However, long-term mineralization of TCS seemed less dependent on pH.</jats:p>",

Exemplifying an alternative paradigm of managing sustainability based on thorough understandings through change of their organizational culture and relationships with their selected Chinese suppliers. Their commitment to sustainability in the global supply chain is due to the moral consciousness of their leaders and the persistence, compassion, and humbleness of their dedicated corporate social responsibility officers. There are five major barriers for managing sustainability in the global supply chain in China: seeking low cost and production efficiency; lacking internal alignments between commercial and responsible supply chain objectives; lacking incentives to practice procedural justice or develop trusting relationships with their suppliers in China in which there is weak legal enforcement system and civil society; easily bypassing many social and environmental responsibilities in China; and evasive compliance-oriented mechanism (i.e., monitoring, evaluating, reporting and sanctioning) over Chinese suppliers. Pursuing sustainability under the existing low-cost operational efficiency paradigm cannot overcome these five barriers. Managing sustainability in the global supply chain must be driven by the spirit of caring people and environment.</p>",

The goals of this study were: to determine the biofilm dynamics in a model of four drinking water installations, to simulate daily household water consumption; to compare the biofilms developed on different polymer pipe materials and their influence on bacteriological water quality. The results demonstrated that bacterial density of biofilms depended on pipe material type and was influenced by water temperature. The biofilms on polyvinylchloride chlorinated and polyethylene materials had higher bacterial density than biofilms on polypropylene (PP) brands. The effect of the materials, and respectively the biofilms, on drinking water quality was stronger in the overnight stagnation periods, especially during the initial weeks of model operation, than in periods of water consumption. Heterotrophic plate count (HPC) in stagnant or in flowing waters and water temperature followed a similar curve pattern, demonstrating significant seasonal variations. In summer, the HPC values of stagnant waters were raised up to seven times higher than in winter and those of the outlet waters (during the consumption periods) were raised up to four times.</jats:p>",

Sufficient chlorine to achieve 6 log inactivation of Escherichia coli bacteria was produced at applied voltages as low as 5 V and with energy consumptions as low as 0.5 kWh/m3. At slightly higher applied voltages, the specific lethality of electrochemically produced chlorine was enhanced by at least two orders of magnitude to greater than 50 L/mg min. This dramatically enhanced lethality is consistent with a synergistic effect resulting from reversible electroporation when electric fields greater than 1.3 kV/cm are produced. There was no evidence for involvement of other species such as reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Disinfection of drinking water using the PEFT cell is cost competitive with other disinfection technologies and when enhanced by the electric field is much less likely to produce disinfection by products.</jats:p>",

In order to overcome the drawback of UV irradiation the integration of UV disinfection with sequential disinfectant was proposed. Among all the possible combinations and sequences, a UV/H2O2-Cl2 integrated system has proven to be effective in many previous studies. In this study, a UV/H2O2 flow-through system followed by free chlorine was built and studied. MS-2 coliphage, as a model for a waterborne virus, were inactivated to evaluate the disinfection capacity. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) tests and an Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 on such a proposed integrated system were also performed to determine re-growth potential of bacteria and genotoxicity, respectively. Briefly, such a proposed flow-through system was effective in removal of MS-2 coliphage and no genotoxic potential was detected according to the results; however, an increase of AOC may raise concerns of bacterial re-growth along the subsequent distribution system.</jats:p>",

Although water practitioners acknowledge the importance of developing stormwater as a water source, their risk perceptions might be barriers. Risk perceptions can be understood within a receptivity framework, with awareness, association, acquisition and application components. In this study, water practitioners' risk perceptions of stormwater harvesting and treatment in Australian cities were examined within this framework, to identify where to focus reform efforts within the water industry to improve their adoption. Analysis of data from an online survey exploring water practitioners' (N = 620) perceptions of risk of alternative water systems revealed that three-quarters of respondents thought stormwater harvesting and treatment yielded at least moderate benefits, supporting fit-for-purpose use of treated stormwater and installation of the infrastructure in different contexts. Perceived general risk of each was slight, although stormwater harvesting was perceived as more risky than treatment, and this difference persisted for specific risks, e.g. public health, environmental. In terms of the receptivity framework, perceived specific risks of stormwater harvesting and treatment systems challenge, to different extents, the practitioners' association, acquisition and application of the systems in Australian cities. In particular, reform efforts should be targeted to perceived management and cost-related risks.</jats:p>",

A large number of different types of parts forces manufacturers to improve the method of supplying parts on the assembly line. This paper presented an innovation system of supplying parts called Set Parts Supply (SPS) which has been implemented in a mixed-model assembly line. The basic idea of SPS is the process of selection parts and assemble parts are done by different operator at different area. This research is concentrated on the activities in SPS implementation and the design consideration for the equipment through a case based approach. After the implementation, it can be ascertained that the inventory has been reduced, the reduction of waste can be achieved and the shop floor are wellâ€“organized.</jats:p>"

Vizsgálatuk azt mutatja, hogy a globalizáció és a termelés nemzetközivé válása mindkét tényezőt jelentős mértékben befolyásolja. A termelés globalizációs trendjeinek megfelelően így a kelet-európai (fejlődő), illetve a nyugat-európai (fejlett) országokban eltérő üzleti modellek válnak dominánssá, amelyek különböző ellátásilánc-pozícióval és más-más szintű szolgáltatásnyújtással jellemezhetőek. A domináns üzleti modellek mellett természetesen más üzleti modellek is működőképesnek bizonyulhatnak a két vizsgált régióban. A létesítmények elhelyezésére, valamint az üzleti eredményességre vonatkozó mutatók elemzésbe történő bevonásával cikkük az Európában működő üzleti modellek kialakításának okára, valamint jövőbeli fenntarthatóságára is megpróbál választ adni. __________ The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between supply chain position and level of servitization in European manufacturing companies. The analysis shows that globalization and internationalization of production has dramatic impact on both phenomena. Due to the globalization trends different business models became dominant in the less developed Eastern-European and the more developed Western European countries, which can be characterized by different supply chain position and servitization level. Certainly other business models can also be successful in the two regions. Involving facility location motivations and business performance indicators the article shed light on the reasons of why these business models came alive and how sustainable they can be.</jats:p>",

First trend analysis of water quality at a river basin scale, based on historical water quality data and multivariate exploitation (principal component analysis, PCA), led to a classification of the monitoring stations with regard to the main pressures (land use, urbanization and hydroclimatic impacts). This method was applied to the Vilaine's watershed, the largest river basin in Brittany, western France, and one which is under agricultural and urban pressure. A complementary research using a UV index was proposed for the evaluation of spatial and temporal variations of water quality. This approach may be considered as a useful and relevant tool to quickly assess the variation of water quality and the main explanatory factors. It also points out monitoring stations under specific stressors considered as outliers regarding UV parameters. Finally, PCA and UV index give complementary results. PCA allows factors influencing drinking water resource to be highlighted and the UV index allows global water quality under specific times and impacts to be reflected.</jats:p>",

However, with only 9% of the total municipal wastewater generated currently being reused, the kingdom is projected as the third largest reuse market after China and the USA, and reuse capacities are projected to increase by 800% by 2016. This projected growth and the change in water portfolios offer tremendous opportunities to integrate novel approaches of water reclamation and reuse.

We first characterize a market equilibrium under a general, single buyback contract. We show that the buyer's stocking decision can be distorted in equilibrium. Such a downstream stocking distortion hurts the buyer firm's own performance, and it also influences the performances of the supplier and the supply chain. We further reveal scenarios where full supply chain efficiency cannot be reached under any single buyback contract. Then, focusing on contract design, we characterize conditions under which a menu of buyback contracts can prevent downstream stocking distortion and restore full efficiency in the supply chain. Our study demonstrates that in a supply chain context, a firm's incentive to undertake real economic activities to influence capital market valuation can potentially be resolved through operational means.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>It is a general trend for retailers to develop dual channel to serve different customers. Engaging in internet and drop shipping has raised serious awareness and attention in the retailing field. Retailers are competing for dominance from suppliers using terminal position in many industries like appliance and fast moving consumer goods. In this paper, the authors examine such supply chain context and propose the commitment contracts for the drop shipping supply chain. In a drop-shipping model, the retailer focuses on marketing and customer acquisition, so it has more customer demand information than the supplier. To optimize profit, the retailer usually sends over-estimated demand information to the supplier. On the contrary, the supplier has to design a contract to control such a behavior of the retailer. Their study is to optimize the profit of the supplier and the whole supply chain using the commitment contract that can coordinate the retailer and the supplier in dual-channel and drop-shipping supply chain. If the retailer’s order quantity achieves centralized level, the profit of the supply chain can be maximized.</p>",

Control logic was developed to decide coagulant dosage based on aluminum concentration in rapid mixing tank water based on results of semi-pilot scale experiments. This logic enabled quick feedback on the excess or lack of coagulant. It was found that the aluminum residual rate, which was proposed as an indicator of coagulation reactions, could be given as a function of coagulant dosage and turbidity. The effectiveness of the control logic was verified in semi-pilot scale experiments. Settled water turbidity was within ±0.5 NTU of target value even when raw water turbidity increased rapidly up to 100 NTU.</jats:p>",

Using a unique, operational level dataset, we empirically examine the learning curves through which performance improvements are realized under vendor managed inventory (VMI). Performance is measured at the downstream distributor locations by examining inventory levels after controlling for customer service performance (stockouts). We identify and assess three sources of learning: a supply chain dyad's self‐learning, learning spillovers from electronic data interchange (EDI), and learning spillovers from other supply chain dyads. We find that self‐learning, learning spillovers from EDI, and learning spillovers from other supply chain dyads, all have positive and significant impacts on a distributor's inventory performance. In addition, we find that self‐learning may exhibit a U‐shaped learning curve (i.e., performance first improves and then plateaus or declines). These findings suggest that the various learning experiences with VMI and EDI can lead to improved performance over time, but the path to improvement may be complex.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this paper is to develop a closed-loop supply chain network design model capable of recovering glass containers. A multi-period multi-product mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to maximize profit. The strategic design of the supply chain is dealt simultaneously with the tactical planning of its operation, which covers procurement, production, storage, distribution, take-back, reprocessing, reuse, and recycling. To illustrate the efficiency and practicability of the model, it is applied to a real-world case of beverage supply chain where the glass containers are either re-used or recycled into their original form, as raw materials. Finally, sensitivity analyses, from a financial perspective, have been conducted to reveal the determinants of profitable product recovery and grasp their managerial implications. The analyses showed that return rate and return acquisition cost have determinant impact on the economic viability of product recovery practice.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) removal by ceramic microfiltration (CMF) under different operating conditions was investigated and compared with the performance of a conventional water treatment plant at Bangkhen, Thailand. The tropical surface raw water for all the experiments was taken from Chaophraya River, Bangkok, Thailand. CMF studies were conducted with both pilot scale (Pilot-CMF) and laboratory scale (Lab-CMF) units. Observations indicate that the properties of raw water such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) vary with time. Under these varying raw water conditions, the conventional water treatment process demonstrates varying THMFP removals. The Pilot-CMF provides better and steady THMFP removals compared to conventional process. Bangkhen water treatment plant (BWTP) filtrate SUVA (2.01 ± 1.07) and Pilot-CMF filtrate SUVA (3.22 ± 0.98) were significantly lower compared to raw water SUVA (4.79 ± 1.39). This SUVA reduction indicated a higher removal of aromatic DOMs through both treatment processes. Pilot-CMF manifest a grater removal of hydrophilic DOM compared to filtrate from BWTP. This corresponds to a higher reduction of THMFP by Pilot-CMF over BWTP. It was found that higher removal of DOC by Pilot-CMF is associated with coagulation process, effects of suspended solids and membrane properties.</jats:p>",

The lower bound of this elasticity is estimated to be −1.8 for males and −3.6 for females. Additional findings suggest that this wage elasticity differs by the type of care provided to elderly parents and that it is larger in magnitude among individuals with siblings and those with independently living parents. Overall the reductions in the informal care constitute about 18% of the labor supply response for men and about 56% of the labor supply response for women, which are not compensated by monetary transfers.</jats:p>",

Owing to fierce market competition and rapidly changing business environment, organizations are forced to focus on their core competency and outsource their logistics function to third-party logistics (3PL) firms. In order to work hand-in-hand with customers to meet their day-to-day logistics needs, 3PL companies have to make use of ICT for efficient communication with clients and coordination of activities. Through analyzing the survey results of the Annual Third-Party Logistics Studies from 2007 to 2009, this study looks into ICT utilization in the 3PL industry from a global perspective. To supplement the findings, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the current status of ICT adoption by 3PL firms in China. As a global manufacturing base, China has a burgeoning 3PL industry serving a large number of domestic firms as well as multinational corporations, and is considered a representative developing country for investigation in the subject area.</p>",

Interports pose opportunities and challenges for operators involved in freight transport and trade. Mathematically, the authors identify the “interport model” as an extension of the conventional transshipment problem in a hub-and-spokes configuration with the interport treated as a novel kind of hub. The model highlights the advantages that shippers may enjoy in routing their containers from the seaports to their final hinterland destinations via one or several interports. They also discuss an empirical application portraying the intermodal transportation network in the Campania region, Italy. The major seaports of the region are Naples and Salerno; the recently constructed terminal, warehousing and processing facilities at Nola and Marcianise are recognized as interports. A linear programming model minimizes the sum of all container-related logistic costs throughout the entire network, including customs inspection, handling, and storage costs. The solution demonstrates the critical role of adequate customs facilities at the interports, and adequate railway connections between the seaports and the interports.</p>",

The analyses show that the water consumption forecast should adopt many kinds of methods to check each other, and finally determine a proper value. To ensure water yield of source water reliable and water quality to meet the requirements are the first principle of the water resource selection. The location of water plant should be determined according to the characteristics of the water source and the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, in accordance with the relevant requirements specification. The basic requirements of the pipe network layout are as follows: the security of water quality; the reliability of the water volume and water pressure; the operation reliability and the least investment. As a part of the overall planning, the water supply engineering planning should proceed from reality to deal with the relationship of the recent construction and long-term development in order to push small towns economy to a rapid growth.</jats:p>"

From 2006 until present, the possibility of applying fluidized ion exchange for NOM removal has been investigated at the plant. Pilot testing using Miex® (Magnetic Ion Exchange) resin demonstrated that under standard operating conditions, a TOC (Total Organic Carbon) removal efficiency of 40 to 50% can be achieved. Moreover, jar tests demonstrated that the application of ion exchange as a pretreatment for enhanced coagulation would allow the coagulant dose to be reduced by 60% without compromising effluent quality. Finally, column experiments were conducted to evaluate (i) the effect of full brine reuse and (ii) the possibility of using less expensive conventional ion exchange resins instead of the patented Miex® resin. Recuperation of the waste brine after flocculation with a ferric salt and dewatering was found to have no significant impact on the NOM removal efficiency. Column experiments with Miex® and conventional type 1 anion exchange resins revealed that the fluidization characteristics of both types of resin allow use in fluidized bed systems and that with both types of resin, similar NOM removal efficiencies can be attained. However, higher contact times are required when conventional resins are applied.</jats:p>",

Quantity discount offers are used as a tool to achieve the coordination between both parties. In non-coordinated mode the total annual profits of both parties are maximized using partial derivative and a lower and an upper bound are obtained for the supplier’s wholesale price. For the coordinated mode total annual profit of the whole supply chain system is maximized using partial derivatives and coordination may increase the total annual profit of the whole system is mathematically proved. In order to encourage the both parties to coordinate, a fair profit-sharing method is proposed based on the total costs that each party incurs.

Systematic, marketing, statistical, retrospective, situational analysis was performed. Bronchial asthma incidence data, data of drug supply system for patients with bronchial asthma in the Republic of Tatarstan were analyzed.                   Results. From 2005 to 2011 the number of patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma has increased by 23.9%, and there were 25 700 newly diagnosed cases. Out of 215 medications to treat bronchial asthma registered in the country, 68 are produced in Russia. The rate of inhaled medications produced by domestic is only 15.91%. Outpatients are provided with drugs under the federal and regional programs of preferential drug supply. In 2010 - over 81 thousand, in 2011 - over 87 thousand of prescriptions were issued under the program of vital drug supply for patients with bronchial asthma. The cost of drug supply exceeded 60 million rubles in 2010, in 2011 it was about 67 million rubles. There was a 5.87% increase of number of patients covered by drug supply in 2010-2011. If the patient denies the drug supply, he/she is responsible to pay for his medication, the approximate cost of treatment of patient with bronchial asthma is over 28 000 rubles per year. In 2011 the number of patients supplied under the regional supply program has significantly increased by 76.29% leading to decrease of cost of medications supplied per 1 patient. Conclusions. The need to find evidence-based solutions to the problems of drug supply system for patients with bronchial asthma at the regional level was identified.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), especially the reverse logistics system with the third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP) is very important for materials return, remanufacturing, repair, recovery, recycling, and reusing. In this paper, based on a one-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game with the manufacturer being the leader, we model a multi-echelon CLSC with 3PRLP under the consideration of impacts of environmental legislation on scrap recycling. Furthermore, in order to encourage the 3PRLP to exert him to return activities we design a target rebate-punish contract between the manufacturer and the 3PRLP under both stochastic price-dependent demands and stochastic effort-dependent returns. We analyze the closed-form analytic expressions for both united optimization strategies in centralized closed-loop system and the Stackelberg strategies in decentralized system, and conclude that the wholesale price contract may not coordinate the forward supply chain and the target rebate-punish may coordinate the reverse chain under certain conditions. Finally, according to the practice of Chinese steel enterprises we carry out some simulation experiments to validate our theoretical analyses and gain some insights into the impacts of reverse logistics activities on the practitioners operations and decisions. </jats:p>",

Experiments were conducted with water samples of different chemical composition, from three water supply systems in Croatia. AgNPs are of interest because of their use as an antimicrobial in numerous commercial products, and as a drinking water disinfection agent. To examine possible effects of AgNP contamination, the disinfection treatments were repeated with AgNPs in the water samples. AgNP contamination generally caused a decrease in the level of trihalomethanes by up to 59%. Influence of AgNPs on bromide ion incorporation into disinfection by-products (DBPs) was also examined. The most obvious example was the Osi water where ozonation step prior to chlorination increased the bromine incorporation factor from 0.156 to 0.339, while addition of AgNPs limited the increase to 0.249. Also, AgNP presence in almost all disinfection treatments increased dicarbonyl disinfection by-products. All treated waters were tested for genotoxicity using the comet assay and showed similar genotoxic potential. The results are preliminary, but could provide a basis for further studies evaluating the environmental impact of AgNPs in natural aquatic systems.</jats:p>",

The problem is different from the general location–allocation problem in so far as this framework takes into account the different maturity periods of each cane field. If the loading station is improperly located, it can result in high transportation costs from cane fields to the station and significant fluctuations in the station utilization rate. A modification of the well-known \"fuzzy c-means\" (FCM) method, which takes into account both the cane supply and the different cane maturity periods, is proposed to solve this problem. The objective of the model is to minimize the sum of the transportation and station utilization costs. The performance of this method is compared to that of the traditional FCM method. The results show that the proposed approach is practical for solving the problem and that it provides a better solution than the FCM method. </jats:p>",

In humans, acute exposure to moderate hypoxia has been demonstrated to result in vasodilatation in the coronary, cerebral, splanchnic and skeletal muscle vascular beds. The combination of submaximal exercise and hypoxia produces a ‘compensatory’ vasodilatation and augmented blood flow in contracting skeletal muscles relative to the same level of exercise under normoxic conditions. This augmented vasodilatation exceeds that predicted by a simple sum of the individual dilator responses to hypoxia alone and normoxic exercise. Additionally, this enhanced hypoxic exercise hyperaemia is proportional to the hypoxia‐induced fall in arterial oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) content, thus preserving muscle O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery and ensuring it is matched to demand. Several vasodilator pathways have been proposed and examined as likely regulators of skeletal muscle blood flow in response to changes in arterial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> content. The purpose of this review is to put into context the present evidence regarding mechanisms responsible for the compensatory vasodilatation observed during hypoxic exercise in humans. Along these lines, this review will highlight the interactions between various local metabolic and endothelial derived substances that influence vascular tone during hypoxic exercise.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fee-for-service (FFS) contracts, first introduced in 2004, dramatically changed the way the pharmaceutical distribution supply chains are designed, managed, and operated. Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit—the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 1.7% on average, and as much as 5.5%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply–demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3.63% on average and as much as 13.01%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy. </jats:p>",

Currently, the data about cargo available in the supply chain does not provide a timely and accurate description of the goods. To solve this data quality issue, data should be captured upstream at the point where goods are packed for transport to the buyer. Without ICT, it was not possible to get timely access to the original trade data. The data pipeline concept is an IT innovation to enable capturing data at the source. The data pipeline accesses existing information systems used by the parties in international supply chains. This paper explores the data pipeline concept and the benefits that businesses and governments could obtain from such an innovation. This study also identifies the need for a public-private governance model that has to accompany the technical innovation.</p>",

The drinking water sources of 13 districts of Uttarakhand have been assessed for the presence of four toxic metal ions (arsenic, cadmium, chromium and lead). The health aspects of the four metal ions have also been reviewed according to the prescribed limits set up by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and World Health Organization (WHO). The present study reveals the absence of arsenic at almost all stations. Cadmium has been found only at Rudrapur, whereas chromium is found to be present in more than prescribed limits, in Kolti, Mussoorie and Dehradun. Significant presence of lead in the six districts of the state is indicative of the fact that proper management strategy of toxic metal ion remediation is required. Chromium and lead have exceeded the prescribed limit in 1.3 and 4.5% samples, respectively. However, as per BIS standard, cadmium is higher than the prescribed limit in 0.6% samples but according to the WHO standard, cadmium has exceeded in about 26% samples. Out of the total 156 samples analyzed, 6.4 and 33.3% samples have been found to possess the toxic metal ions in more than the prescribed limits as per BIS and WHO guidelines, respectively.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon the principles of a total design method (TDM) of survey, a relatively high response rate of 57 percent was achieved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The nineteenth-century growth of biology, particularly as developed in Germany, was focused initially on morphology and anatomy. In Britain, the growth of biology followed T. H. Huxley's principle of teaching the characters of certain plants and animals selected as types of vegetable and animal organization, which brought demands for marine specimens for dissection. The history of the provision of such material in Britain is investigated, particularly apropos of the Marine Station at Millport. Supplementary information is presented on the equally long-standing specimen trade at Plymouth and on two small commercial concerns that supplied marine specimens (from the Isle of Luing and Shoreham-by-Sea). The demise of the specimen-supply trade in Britain in recent decades has resulted from curriculum changes in schools and universities no longer requiring students to do dissections (relating also to Health and Safety concerns about formalin-preserved material); and biology departments that can often no longer, as a result of financial stringency, afford the “luxury” of supplying students with the range of practical experiences that previous generations once valued so highly. The concern among some students about the ethics, or religious strictures, surrounding dissection is acknowledged. The need for biological conservation is stressed, as too, the need for awareness of the risks posed by alien species introduced into foreign ecosystems via international trade in live marine organisms. </jats:p>",

In the implementation stage, the game was tested on a group of undergraduate students specializing in the study of SCM. As part of the learning assessment, the student players were required to report their SC performance and sales figures using an inbuilt online evaluation system which also facilitated peer and tutor reviews. An evaluation was then conducted to collect students' and tutors' views on the game's effectiveness. Positive feedback was received, supporting the proposition that the WSCMG can be an effective tool in facilitating self-, peer-, and tutor-directed teaching and learning. </jats:p>",

Potatoes supply chain like other agricultural products in developed country like the  United Kingdom included some important beneficiaries. Interests are not same due to the nature of the professional  activity. In distribution systems in developed country always have problems to organise all beneficiaries. Some beneficiaries are discriminated some are not their status as profitable either company or sole trader. In the study,  potato farmers of Northern Ireland produce potatoes and these potatoes supposed to be distributed directly to the consumers. As the work in the capitalist society divided in many ways with profit motive, therefore there were many intermediaries between producers and consumers who worked for distributing NI potato to the consumers. They were related together with their own interest and goal. One beneficiary was not thinking about another beneficiary with any  kind of interest sacrifice. Finally farmers who were the main producers became discriminated with the price. This is the main problem found in the study. Consumers also have no intention to know the life of farmers. If farmers societyis not survived in sustainable development way then the potatoes will not be cultivated. Therefore in potatoes farming  everybody in the society needs to make their attention for the right of the potatoes farmers of NI.   DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbau.v10i1.12104   J.

Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the vitamin D supply among healthy blood donors and healthy elderly subjects in County Vas, Hungary. Methods: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, calcium and albumin (Cobas, Modular, Roche), as well as serum alfa-2-globulin concentrations (Gelelfo, Interlab) were determined in 178 serum samples (68 men, 110 women, 41 were taking oral contraceptives). The results were analysed according to sex and age (younger and older than 43 years), and the impact of oral contraceptive use was also taken into consideration. Results: Deficiency and insufficiency in vitamin D levels were detected in 9.6% and 32% of the studied subjects, respectively, whereas sufficient vitamin D levels were present in 58.4% of the subjects. 63% of the older and 41.2% of the younger group had suboptimal vitamin-D supply (p &lt; 0.01). In women taking oral contraceptives serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and alfa-2-globulin levels were significantly higher, whereas serum albumin and calcium levels were lower than in the control group. There was no difference in serum intact parathyroid hormone concentration between oral anticoncipient users and non-users. Conclusions: The occurrence of suboptimal vitamin D supply is significant, although less frequent than that in literature reports. In women taking oral contraceptives, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were higher, but serum intact parathyroid hormone concentrations were not decreased suggesting that the increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may be the consequence of oestrogen-induced alterations of serum protein fractions.

The water quality data from 2007 to 2009 were analysed for 12 different locations surrounding Gajraula for two seasons, i.e. wet and dry. Five point rating scale was used to classify water quality for each of the study locations. Rating curves were drawn based on the tolerance limits of drinking waters. In the present study, the WQI demonstrated a modest increase in wet seasons (August to November) than dry seasons (February to June) for all locations with a few exceptions. Hardness, total dissolved solids, NO3−, biochemical oxygen demand, and Fe in most cases were found to be responsible for the decline in seasonal WQI for various locations. However, the WQI around Gajraula varied from 50.6 to 87.7 and was found to be satisfactory except for some locations.</jats:p>",

The mechanisms behind this have remained unclear. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aims:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Here, we aimed to investigate a putative association between low Hb and Hct levels and infarct growth. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; All consecutive patients who received intravenous thrombolysis based on multimodal magnetic resonance imaging during the years 1998–2009 were screened. Laboratory data as well as admission magnetic resonance images and follow-up computed tomography scans of 257 patients were assessed. Overall, data of 100 patients were of sufficient quality and further analyzed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Decrease in Hb and Hct as well as perfusion-weighted imaging volume, mismatch volume, and final infarct size on follow-up computed tomography were associated with infarct growth. A linear regression model revealed Hb decrease (β = 0.23, p = 0.02) to be a predictor of infarct growth, independent of mismatch volume (β = 0.27, p = 0.004) and minimum sodium (β = -0.21, p = 0.03), and adjusted to the non-predicting variables age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, maximum leucocytes and C-reactive protein, blood glucose, and Hct decrease. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Hb levels that decrease after admission independently predict infarct growth in thrombolyzed stroke patients.

This article presents the optimization modeling approach for the pricing and coordinating schemes of SNWD‐ER project, and discusses the analysis results and their policy implications on the pricing and coordinating mechanisms in the SNWD‐ER water‐resource supply chain. For the government, formulating reasonable retail price upper bound is important to control the water resource wholesale price and retail price. Besides, various water‐saving mechanisms can increase the price elasticity of water demand and affect the wholesale and retail prices. For the corporations, increasing the water resource production capacity and its supply will decrease the wholesale and retail prices. Furthermore, keeping enough initial water resource inventory by enhancing the rainfall using rate, and using ‘free supply sources’‐rainfall, or even some flooding sources can effectively decrease the wholesale and retail prices. Finally, for the end‐users, enhancing the rainfall using rate can effectively decrease the wholesale and retail prices and reduce the energy consumption, which is good for the sustainable development and a low‐carbon economy.</jats:p>",

Application of 100% inorganics fertilizer + 10 tonnes FYM/ha (5.95 tonnes/ha) gave significantly higher grain yield over all other organics and organics + inorganics treatment. In chickpea, application of 100% P through inorganics gave higher chickpea yields (1.349 tonnes/ha) and was on par with 50% organics + 50% inorganics (1.277 tonnes/ha) and this indicated organics may reduce inorganics in the long run.

By using dual peak detection sample and hold circuits, we can avoid PSN missing detection and therefore avoid massive PSN detection error. We also added one dummy switch to cancel the charge injection effect and to improve the PSN detection accuracy. In the proposed design, we applied one PMOS type charging circuit to enhance the operation frequency of differential amplifier, which can widen both the PSN detection bandwidth and the detection range. As a result, in the proposed PSN detection circuit, the PSN detection bandwidth can be raised from 1 GHz to 2 GHz with the PSN detection error lowered to ±3%. Moreover, the PSN detection range is widened from 10%–50%VDD to 5%–65%VDD as compared with the state‐of‐the‐art design. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

After 1982/1983, natural sand supply from the river increased and accretion occurred on these coasts. Measured topographic changes were reproduced using the contour-line-change model considering changes in grain size.

Innovative removal technologies are available such as membrane filtration and advanced oxidation, but also biological treatment should be considered. By combining an advanced oxidation process with managed aquifer recharge (MAR), two complementary processes are expected to provide a hybrid system for OMP removal, according to the multiple barrier approach. Laboratory scale batch reactor experiments were conducted to investigate the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 14 different pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from MAR influent water and water subjected to oxidation, under different process conditions. A DOC removal of 10% was found in water under oxic (aerobic) conditions for batch reactor experiments, a similar value for DOC removal was observed in the field. Batch reactor experiments for the removal of PhACs showed that the removal of pharmaceuticals ranged from negligible to more than 90%. Under oxic conditions, seven out of 14 pharmaceuticals were removed over 90% and 12 out of 14 pharmaceuticals were removed at more than 50% during 30 days of experiments. Under anoxic conditions, four out of 14 pharmaceuticals were removed over 90% and eight out of 14 pharmaceuticals were removed at more than 50% over 30 days' experiments. Carbamazepine and phenazone were persistent both under oxic and anoxic conditions. The PhACs removal efficiency with oxidized water was, for most compounds, comparable to the removal with MAR influent water.</jats:p>",

An efficient two-phase interactive solution procedure is developed to obtain a good solution that maximizes the total supply chain profit and the satisfactory degree. The proposed solution procedure, modified from Sakawa et al.’s interactive fuzzy programming approach, can be easily adopted by practitioners. Through a negotiation case study, a well-known network product manufacturing supply chain in Taiwan is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and aptness of the proposed model and the solution procedure, as compared with Sakawa et al.’s method with only one objective at the manufacturer level. Finally, several important findings and managerial implications are drawn from the results of this study. </jats:p>",

However, while in legume nodules infected cells are located in the central tissue, actinorhizal nodules are composed of modified lateral roots with infected cells in the expanded cortex. Since an oxygen diffusion barrier around the entire cortex would also block oxygen access to the central vascular system where it is required to provide energy for transport processes, here each individual infected cell is surrounded with an oxygen diffusion barrier. In order to assess the effect of these oxygen diffusion barriers on oxygen supply for energy production for transport processes, apoplastic and symplastic sugar transport pathways in <jats:italic>C. glauca</jats:italic> nodules were examined. The results support the idea that sugar transport to and within the nodule cortex relies to a large extent on the less energy‐demanding symplastic mechanism. This is in line with the assumption that oxygen access to the nodule vascular system is substantially restricted. In spite of this dependence on symplastic transport processes to supply sugars to infected cells, plasmodesmal connections between infected cells, and to a lesser degree with uninfected cells, were reduced during the differentiation of infected cells.</jats:p>",
