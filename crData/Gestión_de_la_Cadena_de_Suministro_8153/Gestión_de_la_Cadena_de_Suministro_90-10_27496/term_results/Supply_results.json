Soon after Harrison Rowland moved into the park, Woods wrote to inform him that the park would no longer supply him with water. When the park was constructed, about 15 years earlier, pipes were laid that connected the subdivided lots to the well. Later, Woods bought certain lots, including the well. He was aware at the time of purchase that the well was the park's water source. Woods' desire to develop more property created a need for more water, and he decided to deny any new owner the right to have the water from his “private well.” On appeal, the court concluded that Rowland and the other purchasers, as owners of the quasi‐dominant estates, had a right to obtain water from the well because of the quasi‐easement.</jats:p>",

Although the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the marriage penalty for some couples, many will still pay more taxes than they would if they were single. A positive wage elasticity implies that a married woman facing a marriage penalty will work fewer hours than she would if the marriage penalty did not exist. This article estimates that if the marriage penalty were eliminated, the average married woman would increase her hours worked by 46 hours per year. Married women from high-income families and married women who earn substantially less than do their husbands would show an even greater response to elimination of the marriage penalty because women from these groups are likely to face larger marriage penalties. Women who contribute 25% or less to family income would increase their labor supplies by 101 hours per year on average, and women whose family income is in the top income quartile would increase their labor supplies by an average of 99 hours per year. </jats:p>",

Aragón) inoculated with several strains of <jats:italic>Rhizobium meliloti</jats:italic> were supplied with a low level of nitrate (5 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>). After 1 week, normalised nodule mass, obtained by dividing nodule weight by shoot weight, was decreased by one‐fourth. This result closely paralleled the bacteroid protein content of nodules, whereas the cytosolic content remained constant. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA, EC 1.7.99.4) of bacteroids increased rapidly after nitrate supply, with actual rates being highly dependent on the <jats:italic>Rhizobium</jats:italic> strain. The expression of cytosolic NR (EC 1.6.6.1) also varied depending on the bacterial strain but was largely insensitive to nitrate feeding. Nitrite reductase activity (NiRA, EC 1.7.2.2) of either bacteroid or plant origin was independent of the <jats:italic>R. meliloti</jats:italic> strain. Activation occurred after 3 and 7 days, respectively, of nitrate feeding. Significant amounts of nitrite were obtained throughout the experimental period from buffered extracts of both bacteroids and cytosol of nodules. However, when these nodules were ground in the presence of inhibitors of enzyme activity, nitrite was only found in nodules containing strain 102‐F‐51 after 1 week of treatment. These results agree with the recent hypothesis that nitrite plays a role in a secondary stage of nodule damage by nitrate. We propose that NiRA rather than NRA can be used as an internal probe of nitrate access to the infected region of nodules.</jats:p>",

This was designed to improve: (a) handwashing, particularly before cooking/eating and after defecation; (b) washing dishes immediately after use. Verbal messages were administered to two intervention groups, one also received a plastic container with a tap to assist these activities. Indicators of compliance were the direct observation of soaking dishes and the presence of faecal streptococci from fingertip-rinses; the main outcome indicator was <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> contamination of stored water. The intervention group receiving the container was significantly better than the control for indicators of compliance (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001 and <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·01) and its stored water was significantly less contaminated (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001). There was no significant improvement to the other intervention group, although some features of the intervention had clearly been made available to the control group. Humidity was significantly correlated with fingertip contamination (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·2; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001) and with the peak of reported diarrhoea around the beginning of the rainy season.</jats:p>",

Glycolate and glyoxylate, precursors of glycine in the glycolate pathway, had nearly the same effect as glycine.
