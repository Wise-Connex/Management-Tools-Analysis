No one approach can protect and secure; rather, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole needs to adopt a combination of approaches to ensure the safety and integrity of the supply channel. Right now, the most secure way to ensure product integrity and patient safety is through a primary distribution system, also referred to as normal distribution. Primary distribution involves the movement of pharmaceuticals from the manufacturer to the wholesale distributor to the pharmacy. Going forward, some new technologies offer great promise. The industry needs to address all technology solutions, from secure product packaging to tracking techniques such as tags, holograms, and ultimately radio frequency identification. All of these begin with the manufacturer, require wholesaler involvement, and rely on the pharmacy. The movement of product must be secure and the highest level of vigilance maintained. </jats:p>",

The credit raises lifetime social security benefit payments for recipients who delay receiving benefits after age 65 and offers a rare and important test of whether labor supply incentives built in to the program can promote work at older ages. The results suggest that the increased incentives raised employment among workers over age 65. In addition, the recent increases in social security's Normal Retirement Age also appear to be pushing up labor supply.</jats:p>"

In certain regions of the country the supervision to establishments involved in blood collection, processing and transfusion was neither strict nor sufficient. During the early period of 1990, HIV was transmitted among plasma‐apheresis donors in two central provinces. The relevant plasma‐apheresis centres, in which plasma is collected solely as source materials for fractionation, were accused for wrongdoings including not performing HIV screening, and mixing red cells from different donors with same blood types before back infusion.</jats:p>",

Asama, forming a WNW‐ESE directed zone with 1 km below sea level. The eastern end of this zone connects a narrow vertical pathway extending right under the summit crater, which erupted in 2004.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Significant challenges have developed for Aurora (Colo.) Water in the face of booming growth and widely variable water source productivity. The utility has implemented highly comprehensive water conservation programs, the urgent need for which became apparent during drought conditions beginning in 2002. At that time, the utility's reservoir storage levels dropped to 26% of capacity, or less than a year's worth of water supply. These programs, along with a 10‐year, $1.4 billion capital improvement program and the implementation of multiple‐barrier water treatment approaches to protect public health and meet high customer standards, have resulted in growing utility bills. The author examines how Aurora Water is progressively addressing these challenges by providing adequate service levels to current customers while positioning itself to meet future needs. Increasing urban water demands, especially in the southwestern United States, will require reallocation of existing water uses and the construction and operation of new water delivery systems. The information provided here can help today's utility manager negotiate the many challenges of the growing demand for water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Multiechelon inventory optimization is increasingly being applied by business users as new tools expand the class of network topologies that can be optimized. In this paper, we formalize a topology that we call networks with clusters of commonality (CoC), which captures a large class of real-world supply chains that contain component commonality. Viewed as a modified network, a CoC network is a spanning tree where the nodes in the modified network are themselves maximal bipartite subgraphs in the original network. We first present algorithms to identify these networks and then present a single-state-variable dynamic program for optimizing safety stock levels and locations. We next present two reformulations of the dynamic program that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving the optimality of the resulting solution. This work both incorporates arbitrary safety stock cost functions and makes possible optimizing a large class of practically useful but previously intractable networks. It has been successfully applied at several Fortune 500 companies, including the recent Edelman finalist project at Hewlett Packard described in detail in Billington et al. (2004). </jats:p>",

This mathematical-programming model addresses decisions pertaining to future plant structure, including possible closures, new plant acquisitions, and investments in production equipment. The silicon division has used the model and its scenario analysis capabilities extensively to obtain important benefits.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The electricity supply industry of the Democratic Republic of Congo is reviewed, from the formation of the Societé National d’Electricité (SNEL) in 1970 until today. The DRC government established a national utility, because electricity is a key element in the socio -economic development of a country. Due to the national monopoly of SNEL, hydropower plants could be constructed such as Inga1 and Inga2. They supply power to mining in the Katanga province, and to a steel company in Maluku, not far from Kinshasa. Currently, Inga1 and Inga 2 are not operating at full capacity. Many hydropower and thermal plants are located in different provinces and need to be refurbished to increase their capacity of electricity for the DRC. Due to technical problems, SNEL only generates 1150 MW. The electrification programme in urban and rural areas across the DRC caters for less than 10% of the 60 million inhabitants. In 1980, the government implemented a policy called Plan Directeur de SNEL for electrification, but the policies never reached their objectives. No Energy White Paper exists which outlines the entire policy framework for energy supply and demand. Power sector reform has also not been implemented in the electricity sector. This paper outlines future government options in the electricity sector. Accordingly, the Public Private Partnership model could play a major role in attracting private partners to invest in the electricity sector in order to have different hydropower and thermal plants refurbished.</jats:p>"

Eighteen parameters were analysed and/or recorded for each weekly observation. The variables were of a physical, chemical and biological nature. Enteric virus presence was detected by cell culture analysis from ∼200 L samples of river water. A database of 108 observations was assembled. Of these only 100 complete observations were used for the modelling analysis. Model input parameters were selected solely based on their statistical significance in forward, backward and stepwise selection procedures. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) was used to determine the relative significance of the input parameters for predicting the presence or absence of enteric virus. The final, best-fit MLR model that used log-transformed values for enterococci, the AC/TC ratio, faecal coliforms (FC) and temperature demonstrated 82.5 and 81.4% sensitivity and specificity, respectively.</jats:p>",

Supply chain security is of paramount concern to the pharmaceutical industry, and companies employ a variety of technologies that can be used to authenticate packaged pharmaceuticals. Serialization of individual package units coupled with the use of machine-readable codes should permit the electronic tracking and tracing of these units throughout the supply chain. Progress on establishing identification and information technology standards is moving forward, but many complexities must be resolved, such that full implementation is still some years away. Several states are implementing pedigree requirements. To prevent the proliferation of differing state requirements, the Food and Drug Administration should take a leadership role in establishing clear federal guidelines and implement the pedigree requirements under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. </jats:p>",

A study of the Hopf bifurcation is done around one of the symmetrical equilibrium, as the parameters vary. The loci in the parameter space of the parameters values corresponding to subcritical, supercritical or degenerated Hopf bifurcation are found. The computation of the Liapunov coefficients is done using the derived formula. Numerical plots emphasizing the existence of different types of limit cycles are developed.

Through a multilevel, dynamic supernetwork framework consisting of the global supply chain network with electronic commerce and the social network, we capture the multicriteria decision‐making behavior of the various decision‐makers (manufacturers, retailers, and consumers), which includes the maximization of profit, the maximization of relationship values, and the minimization of risk. Relationship levels in our framework are assumed to influence transaction costs as well as risk and to have value for the decision‐makers. We explore the dynamic co‐evolution of the global product transactions, the associated product prices, and the relationship levels on the supernetwork until an equilibrium pattern is achieved. The pricing mechanism guarantees that optimality for each decision‐maker is achieved in the financially engineered multitiered, multilevel supernetwork. We provide some qualitative properties of the dynamic trajectories, under suitable assumptions, and propose a discrete‐time algorithm, which yields explicit closed form expressions at each iteration for the tracking of the evolution of the global product transactions, relationship levels, and prices until an equilibrium is attained. We illustrate the model and computational procedure with several numerical examples. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2006</jats:p>",

These were improved land with good grazing (IB), steeply sloping land with rough grazing (SG), wet moorland with sparse grazing (WM) and enclosed woodland that excluded livestock and deer (EW). Each MC contained the origin of a small stream that flowed into Swindale Beck, the river draining the valley. The water quality during the 14‐month study, as judged by chemical and physical parameters, was excellent, but it could not be regarded as pristine because of the frequent presence of<jats:italic>Cryptosporidium</jats:italic>oocysts arising from livestock and wild mammal faeces. Oocysts (0·2–5·6 l<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) detected by genus‐specific immunofluorescent antibody were found in 32% of 188 water samples tested: ranking order EW 44%, IB 34%, Beck 30%, SG and WM 26%. Similarly, oocysts were identified in 9·5% of 1730 faecal samples. Small wild mammals (28%), calves (15·7%) and lambs (8·1%) were the dominant sources, whereas adult livestock (1·8%) and large wild mammals (4·8%) were less important. Autumn showed the highest occurrence of oocysts for both water and faecal samples. No hydrological controls were found to have a significant impact on the occurrence or concentration of oocysts in the main river or in the MCs, suggesting that their presence is controlled by seasonal changes in pathogen prevalence in the animal reservoir.

If any one (or more) of these three elements is missing from a water services improvement programme, providing safe water is not successfully achieved. A study in a deep rural area in South Africa showed that providing small communities, using untreated river water as their only water source, with good quality water through a piped distribution system and accessible at communal taps did not fall within our parameters of safe water. The parameters for measuring the three principles were: absence of Escherichia coli in drinking water samples; accessibility by improving tap distances to within 200 m from each household; availability by assessing whether households have at least 25 L per person per day. Results show that although E. coli levels were reduced significantly, households were still consuming water with E. coli numbers at non-compliant levels. Access (distance) was improved from an average of 750 m from households to river source to an average of 120 m to new on-tap source points. This did not result in significant increases in household quantities, which on average remained around 18 L per person per day.</jats:p>",

Illuminated alga cells, co‐immobilized with islets in one compartment, were capable of restoring glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion during perifusion with anoxic medium. In the present study, a new model system for photosynthetic oxygen supply to encapsulated islets, containing two separate compartments—one for oxygen‐producing alga cells and the other for insulin‐secreting pancreatic islets—is described. No insulin response to increasing glucose concentrations was found when encapsulated islets alone were perifused with oxygen‐free medium. However, when the perifused chamber contained not only encapsulated islets, but also illuminated algae, immobilized in alginate, the islets showed twice the amount of insulin secretion in response to a high level of glucose (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). This finding suggests that the level of photosynthetic oxygen generated in the algal compartment was sufficient to support the functional activity of the islets. Such a technology may offer the potential application for oxygen supply to various transplanted immunoisolated cells.</jats:p>",

Over 2 months, the atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration and air temperature were manipulated to test the following hypotheses: (1) the responses of the three respiration components to changes in the rate of photosynthesis would differ both in speed and magnitude; (2) the temperature sensitivity of leaf and belowground respiration would increase in response to a rise in substrate availability; and, (3) at the ecosystem level, the ratio of respiration to photosynthesis would be conserved despite week‐to‐week changes in temperature. All three respiration rates responded to the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration‐induced changes in photosynthesis. However, the proportional change in the rate of leaf respiration was more than twice that of belowground respiration and, when photosynthesis was reduced, was also more rapid. The results suggest that aboveground respiration plays a key role in the overall response of ecosystem respiration to short‐term changes in canopy photosynthesis. The short‐term temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration, measured within a single night, was found to be affected more by developmental conditions than photosynthetic substrate availability, as the <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub> was lower in leaves that developed at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, irrespective of substrate availability. However, the temperature sensitivity of belowground respiration, calculated between periods of differing air temperature, appeared to be positively correlated with photosynthetic substrate availability. At the ecosystem level, respiration and photosynthesis were positively correlated but the relationship was affected by temperature; for a given rate of daytime photosynthesis, the rate of respiration the following night was greater at 25 than 20°C. This result suggests that net ecosystem exchange did not acclimate to temperature changes lasting up to 3 weeks. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the three respiration terms differ in their dependence on photosynthesis and that, short‐ and medium‐term changes in temperature may affect net carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.</jats:p>",

The number of vessels in the liver at 2 weeks postoperatively was determined by factor VIII immunolocalization and the gene expression of angiogenic factors was assessed by RT‐PCR. The total hepatic arterial supply to the liver was measured using the fluorescent microsphere injection technique. To further test the hypothesis, two additional groups of rats underwent hepatic artery ligation (HAL) or PPVL plus HAL (PPHAL). The integrity of hepatic microcirculation was then evaluated in all four groups by intravital microscopy.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> At 2 weeks after operation, the number of vessels detected by factor VIII staining was significantly higher in PPVL compared to sham. Densitometric analysis of RT‐PCR bands revealed a significant increase of vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression in PPVL compared to sham. Arterial flow to the liver measured by fluorescent microspheres was increased by 190% in PPVL compared to sham. When all four groups were compared, no prominent histological abnormality was observed in sham, HAL, and PPVL groups; however, PPHAL livers showed focal necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration around the portal triads. Additionally, only the PPHAL livers showed a decreased sinusoidal diameter and significantly lower perfusion index (PPHAL 42.9 ± 6.1; sham 85.7 ± 7.0, PPVL 80.2 ± 6.5, HAL 70.9 ± 4.5).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> These results suggest that the hepatic artery flow becomes the primary source for the blood supply of sinusoids and the compensatory change in the hepatic arterial system plays a critical role in maintaining microcirculatory perfusion following the restriction of the portal vein flow by PPVL.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Models of soil nutrient bioavailability and uptake assist in nutrient management and lead to a better understanding of nutrient dynamics in the soil-plant system. SSAND (Soil Supply and Nutrient Demand) is a steady state, mechanistic nutrient uptake simulation model based on mass flow and diffusive supply of nutrients to roots. It requires user inputs for soil and plant parameters to calculate a nutrient’s concentration at the root surface and the subsequent uptake by a plant root and/or extrametrical mycorrhizal hyphae. It can be considered a sub-model linked to hydrological or plant growth models. SSAND provides a basis for simulating nutrient uptake under different soil-plant scenarios, including multiple soil compartments, net mineralization inputs, changing root growth, changing mycorrhizal hyphae growth, changing soil water content and multiple fertilizer events. It incorporates uptake from roots and mycorrhizal hyphae, including the potential competition between these entities. It should be useful for simulating the effects of climate change on soil nutrient bioavailability. It should also be a useful tool for managers in evaluating fertilizer regime options. Key words: Nutrient bioavailability, nutrient uptake modeling, phosphorus uptake, mycorrhizae, Spodosols, climate change </jats:p>",
