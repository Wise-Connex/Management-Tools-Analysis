This is concentrated primarily in the Nile Valley and in the Nile Delta. The entire crop area is irrigated except for some rain-fed areas on the Mediterranean coast. The availability of additional water, due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam, led to increased cropping intensities on the old lands and the reclamation of over one million feddans of new desert lands. However, year-round irrigation has magnified drainage and soil salinity problems and this has affected the supply and quality of land.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previously developed suites of models integrate irrigation water supply and demand management for simplified surface reservoir supply systems. A central stochastic dynamic programming model is supported by simulation models, including a soil water‐plant growth model. That modeling is extended herein to include decisions about timing and quantity of reservoir water releases into the delivery system, resulting in the integration of supply, demand, and delivery management. Irrigators have rights to percentages of reservoir capacity, reservoir inflows, and downstream tributary flows. Natural rivers are the supply channels in the study area. Large on‐farm water storages exist for storing regulated and unregulated river flows available to the irrigators. Farms can be many days flow from the reservoir, requiring orders for reservoir releases to be lodged before the arrival of a previous order. The probability of unregulated flows from tributaries downstream of the reservoir further complicates ordering decisions. Abandonment of irrigated area to rain‐fed status occurs at two levels, forced abandonment if insufficient water is available at the farm when the irrigation‐trigger soil water deficit is reached, and planned abandonment to save water for possible later use. The need for forced abandonment is determined by simulation models; planned abandonment decisions are derived by stochastic dynamic programming. Results show annual net revenue means and standard deviations as functions of different capacities of the on‐farm storages and water supplies from either regulated or unregulated flows, or both.</jats:p>",

We test a model of quality supplied on a sample of audit engagements selected from a population of audited federal assistance programs. The empirical analysis finds that the probability of receiving a substandard audit increases with the length of the auditor‐client relationship. Our analysis finds a positive relation between fixed fee contracts and the incidence of violations of professional standards among audits of federal assistance programs. Additionally, we provide evidence that the incidence of noncom‐pliance with professional standards is significantly lower when the audit contract contains a provision for administrative and/or legal remedies in the event of substandard performance.</jats:p>",

Recovery of unlabelled N was used to determine the storage and immobilization of N for foliage growth, and the partitioning of labelled N taken up during the two periods was measured.</jats:p><jats:p>Initial growth of trees in 1990 was unaffected by the current N supply and determined only by the N supplied the previous year. High N throughout increased the number of needles grown in 1990 compared to low N‐treated trees, but had little effect on the dry weight of individual needles. When preconditioned with High N, trees responded to Low N in 1990 by a reduction in needle dry weight, without altering the number of needles produced. Low N trees supplied with High N in 1990 responded by increasing both needle numbers and dry weight, compared with trees supplied with Low N throughout. The amount of unlabelled N remobilized to foliage growth in 1990 was unaffected by the current N supply but reflected the amount of N in store, as determined by the N supply the previous year. The majority of N was remobilized from the 1989 foliage and none from roots. Partitioning of labelled N taken up during 1990 altered during the year, with a greater proportion of N taken up after 28 June recovered in the roots in all treatments, due to root growth as opposed to allocation of N to storage during the autumn, since root N concentrations fell between 17 June and the final harvest on 20 November.</jats:p>",

In this work a simple method for gate control of a semiconverter circuit feeding a separately excited DC motor is presented which is used to vary the motor speed. The transient as well as steady‐state characteristic performances have been obtained theoretically using closed form solution and experimentally using digital techniques. The required firing pulses were generated digitally using a 16‐bit microprocessor system. A set‐up for the experimental system has been designed and built in the laboratory. There is excellent agreement between the computed results and those obtained from the actual set‐up.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Four Holstein × Friesian cows with rumen and duodenal cannulae were assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square design consisting of four experimental diets differing in the nature of forage and the presence or absence of rapeseed oil supplement. Dietary treatments were composed of 60% grassland hay and 40% production concentrate (diet H), and of 65% corn silage, 28% production concentrate and 7% soybean meal (diet S). Each diet was also supplied with 7% rapeseed oil. These supplemented diets are designated respectively HO and SO. Digestibility of organic matter was 69.0, 67.5, 73.6 and 70.0% for diets H, HO, S and SO, respectively. The differences were mainly due to variations in NDF digestibility: 55.0, 50.4, 56.9 and 46.9% for diets H, HO, S and SO, respectively. These results are consistent with variations in VFA concentration and composition. However, differences among diets in in situ cellulose degradation were lower than expected. Starch and nitrogen degradation measured in situ, and ruminal outflow rate of liquid and solids were not modified by lipid supply. Hydrogenation of linoleic and linolenic acids was high (mean 88.9 and 89.5%, respectively) and did not depend on the diet. Key words: Cow, digestion, rumen, lipid supply </jats:p>",

Vines were grown with 0, 250 or 750 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The responses to nitrogen supply were compared with responses to shade, to examine the impact of reduced carbon assimilation on canopy leaf area and fruit yields. Nitrogen supply did not affect significantly any of the measured variables during the first season of the experiment. In the second season, canopy leaf area was reduced significantly where nitrogen supply was limited. The quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (φ<jats:sub>q</jats:sub>) increased from 0. 03 mol CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Q soon after leaf emergence to more than 0. 05 mol CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Q during the middle of the growing season.

For vines with high nitrogen, fruit yields in both seasons were similar, averaging 3. 05 kg m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>. Fruit yields in the second season were reduced significantly where nitrogen supply was limited, due to reduced fruit numbers. The relative effects of reduced leaf area and reduced leaf photosynthesis for carbon assimilation by nitrogen deficient vines were examined using a mathematical model of canopy photosynthesis for kiwifruit vines. Simulations of canopy photosynthesis indicated that effects on leaf area and on leaf photosynthesis were of similar importance in the overall effects of nitrogen deficiency on carbon assimilation. The effects of nitrogen supply on fruit numbers (i. e. flower development) preceded the measured effects on carbon assimilation, indicating that the nitrogen supply affected carbon partitioning to reserves in the first season.</jats:p>",
