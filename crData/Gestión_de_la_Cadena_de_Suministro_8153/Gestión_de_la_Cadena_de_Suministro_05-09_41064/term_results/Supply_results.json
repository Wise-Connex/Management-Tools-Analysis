First, supply chain integration covers issues relating to integration of core processes across organizational boundaries through improved communication, partnerships, alliances and cooperation. Second, strategy and planning examines supply chain management as a strategic matter for trading partners, along with factors relating to the amount of planning required.

At the same time, it is also apparent that this requirement to take such an holistic and systemic view of the supply chain acts as an impediment to more extensive implementation. The strategic nature of adopting a supply chain wide perspective, on the one hand provides significant potential benefit, and on the other requires trading partners to think and act strategically.

However, as a result of increasingly stringent screening measures, one of the greatest threats may be an insufficient supply. The balance between safety and adequacy of the blood supply has not received enough attention. Study Design and Methods. The authors developed a model to allow for empirical investigation of the determinants of a safe and sufficient supply. The model is a cohort simulation of allogeneic whole-blood donation, with the population of presenting donors stratified into 8 age and gender groups because the probability of donor and donation deferral varies by these characteristics. Parameters are estimated from year 2000 Blood Centers of Pacific (BCP) data. The model includes cost parameters, which were estimated using BCP expenditure data. The main outcomes are the number of transfusable units of blood and the unit cost of procurement. Results. The model tracks the production of a supply of blood, highlighting the influence of demographic characteristics, predonation deferral, underweight collection of blood units, and associated costs. The authors sought to establish model validity by showing that modeled results closely mimic the outcomes and costs observed by blood bank administrators. Conclusion. The model was developed to evaluate blood safety and policy decisions; it can be used to assess the impact of predonation deferrals, such as expanded European travel deferral for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or the impact of new testing strategies, such as nucleic acid testing for West Nile virus.</jats:p>",

Thus, comprehensible and reliable failure prediction models are required for operational and strategic planning purposes in order to guarantee a sustainable water network development. A lot of research work has been done in this field and the developed failure prediction models can be applied under various circumstances. However, most of the existing models have two major limitations: they consider a static state of the network without taking future developments into account, and they can hardly be applied to networks where only limited data on single pipe level is available. This paper describes a failure prediction model on the network and pipe type level, which is integrated in the KANEW framework for strategic rehabilitation planning.

The technology has been proclaimed to ‘lead to an entirely new relationship between people and things’ (J. D.

Others have said ‘we think it will be bigger than the Internet. All the Web did was connect computers to computers. That’s not as big as connecting things to computers’ (M. Roberti, publisher of RFID Journal, in interview with Markman, above). Promoters describe a supply chain where all assets are in perfect visibility through production, distribution, retail and consumption. According to one analyst, the world will need about half the warehouse space it needs today (P. Jilek, ‘Corporate Sector Focus, A Killer App?’ CSFB Investment Strategy, 17th June, 2003). This paper introduces RFID technology and its potential implications. Although the technology is compelling, there are serious nearterm challenges.

Since it is typical of Korean water services providers, the Seoul water department was selected while Tokyo's in Japan and Denver's in America were selected since they were considered as best practices of public waterworks much similar in governing structure to the one in Seoul. The results of benchmarking concluded that Seoul has traditionally been emphasizing more on “being a good public servant” providing drinking water services, and should be reformed in directions emphasizing ‘entrepreneurship’ to overcome its current limitations. Based on the results, a road map to reform the Seoul water department was established. Since it is typical in Korea, the reform plans and road map established were further recommended for reforming other drinking water services providers in Korea.</jats:p>",

Now, attention is focussed on introducing independent economic regulation, and on the sustainable management of water resources. Experience in Victoria, Australia, provides an interesting opportunity to consider the challenges of reconciling independent economic regulation of profit focused businesses while meeting goals for sustainability in the most efficient way. We conclude that effective integration of sustainability and economic regulation requires consideration of the incentives in economic regulation; investment in defining and collecting data and information to support decisions; greater utilisation of market based instruments; wider and extended use of existing evaluation tools and more explicit linking of these tools to decisions about allocation of resources. However we consider that priority should be given to institutional arrangements; we consider that reform will be required to align arrangements with objectives and thus facilitate efficient and consistent decision-making.</jats:p>",

The objectives were to identify the involved actors and their interactions, as well as the structure (formal and non formal) of the decision processes: institutional and regulatory contexts, steps of decision making, information fluxes, sharing out of responsibilities and of influence, participation of social and institutional stakeholders. Synthetic results are presented. The cases studied are diversified on several aspects. An “average” situation could be described as showing a moderate level of confrontation, with rather formalised procedures, and very centralised decision making out of the interrelations with road works programming. The highest diversity encountered among the utilities concerns the level of information inside the decision process: data considered, fluxes of information, “sophistication” of criteria taken into account.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper comments on the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies for risk assessment, appropriate for utilisation by Australian Water Utilities in risk assessment for drinking water source protection areas. It is intended that a suggested methodology be recommended as a national approach to catchment risk assessment. Catchment risk management is a process for setting priorities for protecting drinking water quality in source water areas. It is structured through a series of steps for identifying water quality hazards, assessing the threat posed, and prioritizing actions to address the threat. Water management organisations around Australia are at various stages of developing programs for catchment risk management. While much conceptual work has been done on the individual components of catchment risk management, work on these components has not previously been combined to form a management tool for source water protection. A key driver for this project has been the requirements of the National Health and Medical Research Council Framework for the Management of Drinking Water Quality (DWQMF) included in the draft 2002 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG). The Framework outlines a quality management system of steps for the Australian water industry to follow with checks and balances to ensure water quality is protected from catchment to tap. Key steps in the Framework that relate to this project are as follows:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Element 2 Assessment of the Drinking Water Supply System• Water Supply System analysis• Review of Water Quality Data• Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Element 3 Preventive Measures for Drinking Water Quality Management• Preventive Measures and Multiple Barriers• Critical Control Points</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper provides an evaluation of the following risk assessment techniques: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP); World Health Organisation Water Safety Plans; Australian Standard AS 4360; and The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines – Drinking Water Quality Management Framework. These methods were selected for assessment in this report as they provided coverage of the different approaches being used across Australia by water utilities of varying: scale of water management organisation; types of water supply system management; and land use and activity-based risks in the catchment area of the source. Initially, different risk assessment methodologies were identified and reviewed. Then examples of applications of those methods were assessed, based on several key water utilities across Australia and overseas. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach were identified. In general there seems some general grouping of types of approaches into those that: cover the full catchment-to-tap drinking water system; cover just the catchment area of the source and do not recognise downstream barriers or processes; use water quality data or land use risks as a key driving component; and are based primarily on the hazard whilst others are based on a hazardous event.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It is considered that an initial process of screening water quality data is very valuable in determining key water quality issues and guiding the risk assessment, and to the overall understanding of the catchment and water source area, allowing consistency with the intentions behind the ADWG DWQM Framework. As such, it is suggested that the recommended national risk assessment approach has two key introductory steps: initial screening of key issues via water quality data, and land use or activity scenario and event-based HACCP-style risk assessment. In addition, the importance of recognising the roles that uncertainty and bias plays in risk assessments was highlighted. As such it was deemed necessary to develop and integrate uncertainty guidelines for information used in the risk assessment process. A hybrid risk assessment methodology was developed, based on the HACCP approach, but with some key additions and modifications to make it applicable to varying catchment risks, water supply operation needs and environmental management processes.</jats:p>",

On the basis of changes in growth rate and food intake, after alterations in phosphate load, our laboratory previously suggested that these effects are mediated by intestinal signals (Landsman A, Lichtstein D, Bacaner M, and Ilani A. Br J Nutr 86: 217–223, 2001). The aim of this study was to further evaluate the role of dietary phosphate on food intake and appetite and specific organ growth, and to test for the presence of a serum factor that may affect renal phosphate handling in phosphate-resupplied rats. The experimental design was based on a comparison between groups of rats receiving identical low-phosphate diets but drinking water containing either phosphate or chloride. We show that 1) changes in food intake after alterations in phosphate load occurred in parallel with variations in digestive system distention, suggesting that dietary phosphate has also a direct effect on appetite; 2) dietary phosphate-dependent growth has a specific effect on the growth of liver and epididymal fat; and 3) serum of rats supplied with phosphate contains a factor that inhibits sodium-dependent phosphate transport in a model of renal proximal tubule cells. Collectively, these observations are in accord with the hypothesis that factor(s) emanating from the digestive system in response to dietary phosphate load may be involved in growth, appetite and renal handling of phosphate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Japan most of the water distribution networks were constructed during the 1960s to 1970s. Since these pipelines were used for a long period, pipeline rehabilitation is necessary to maintain water supply. Although investment for pipeline rehabilitation has to be planned in terms of cost-effectiveness, no standard method has been established because pipelines were replaced on emergency and ad hoc basis in the past. In this paper, a method to determine the maintenance of the water supply on an optimal basis with a fixed budget for a water distribution network is proposed. Firstly, a method to quantify the benefits of pipeline rehabilitation is examined. Secondly, two models using Integer Programming and Monte Carlo simulation to maximize the benefits of pipeline rehabilitation with limited budget were considered, and they are applied to a model case and a case study. Based on these studies, it is concluded that the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the appropriate investment for the pipeline rehabilitation planning is both convenient and practical.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technology and economic development has led to the growth of megacities and urban centres with populations in the millions. Such population expansion and densification increases the strain on wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which has been largely based on an end-of-line centralised model. However, in megacities new challenges arise, because provision of suitable sanitation is expensive and it requires infrastructure expansion through construction of extensive sewer networks and larger capacity wastewater treatment plants, which consume more energy. Alternative disposal techniques for solid and liquid waste generated during the treatment process are required, because disposal solutions are decreasing as landfill costs rise and environmental standards are tightened, the latter reducing opportunities for land reuse. Additionally, mass wastewater discharge can have a detrimental impact on the ecology of water bodies and on the health of downstream populations, and requires suitable treatment before disposal. These challenges have the potential to offset the savings that the economies of scale offered by the traditional wastewater collection and treatment systems can impart. The need for affordable and effective wastewater systems in megacities requires the re-evaluation of traditional systems and the re-engineering of water and wastewater transport and resource concepts. Alternative concepts in wastewater collection and treatment, such as decentralised treatment, allied with innovative solutions using current and new technology could play a role in providing affordable and sustainable solutions to deal with the wastewater issue. This paper investigates the scope that integrated wastewater treatment and localised water reuse (in-line treatment, sewer mining), resource recovery (biogas, biosolids), operational changes (timed discharge of sewers, vacuum sewers) and biotreatment (e.g. vermiculture, faecal coliform removal) can play to guarantee the longevity of wastewater infrastructure in megacities. These alternatives offer increased treatment efficiency, recovery of value-added products, and reduce infrastructure cost, whilst maintaining health standards and reducing environmental discharge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Few studies have investigated factors responsible for the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>demand/supply balance in the right ventricle. Resting right coronary blood flow is lower than left coronary blood flow, which Is consistent with the lesser work of the right ventricle. Because right and left coronary artery perfusion pressures are Identical, right coronary conductance is less than left coronary conductance, but the signal relating this conductance to the lower right ventricular O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>demand has not been defined. At rest, the left ventricle extracts ~75% of the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>delivered by coronary blood flow, whereas right ventricular O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction Is only ~50%. As a result, resting right coronary venous PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>is ~30 mm Hg, whereas left coronary venous PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>is ~20 mm Hg. Right coronary conductance does not sufficiently restrict flow to force the right ventricle to extract the same percentage of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>as the left ventricle. Endogenous nitric oxide impacts the right ventricular O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>demand/supply balance by increasing the right coronary blood flow at rest and during acute pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypoxia, norepinephrine infusion, and coronary hypoperfusion. The substantial right ventricular O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction reserve is used preferentially during exercise-induced increases in right ventricular myocardial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption. An augmented, sympathetic-mediated vasoconstrictor tone blunts metabolically mediated dilator mechanisms during exercise and forces the right ventricle to mobilize its O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction reserve, but this tone does not limit resting right coronary flow. During exercise, right coronary vasodilation does not occur until right coronary venous PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>decreases to ~20 mm Hg. The mechanism responsible for right coronary vasodilation at low PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>has not been delineated. In the poorly autoregulating right coronary circulation, reduced coronary pressure unloads the coronary hydraulic skeleton and reduces right ventricular systolic stiffness. Thus, normal right ventricular external work and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>demand/supply balance can be maintained during moderate coronary hypoperfusion.</jats:p>",

With an individual supply of working hours, a wage tax can even improve employment if wage setting is centralised and marginal utility from a public good is sufficiently high. Moreover, if a profit tax is used to finance public expenditure, higher tax reduces wages and improves employment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many rural areas domestic drinking water needs are met by a mixture of public water supplies and private water supplies. Private supplies are not subject to the regulations and management requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Amendments to the SDWA recently lowered the standard for arsenic from 50 to 10 ppb in public water supplies (effective in 2006). Churchill County, Nevada, has approximately 25,000 residents. Slightly more than half (13,500) rely on private domestic wells for water supply. Ample data and media publicity about high arsenic concentrations in water supplies and a federally led investigation of a leukaemia cluster suggested that residents of the county would be aware that arsenic concentrations in private wells were highly likely to exceed the 10 ppb standard. A survey carried out in 2002 showed that a majority of respondents (72%) consumed water from private wells and among them a minority (38%) applied treatment. Maximum, median and minimum concentrations of arsenic from all samples (n = 351) were 2,100, 26 and &amp;lt;3 ppb, respectively. Seventy-four per cent of all samples exceeded 10 ppb. A majority (87%) of those who applied treatment consumed tap water. The relatively low rate of application of treatment suggested that these rural residents did not recognize that consumption could have associated health risks. However, those who applied treatment were ∼0.3 times as likely to be consuming water with &amp;gt; 10 ppb arsenic than those who consumed water that was not treated. In areas where concentrations of arsenic have been demonstrated to be high, it may be important to conduct a focused educational effort for private well owners to ensure that they take the steps needed to assess and reduce risks associated with contaminants found in tap water, including arsenic. An educational effort could include promoting sampling efforts to determine the magnitude of arsenic concentrations, explaining the risk associated with arsenic consumption and providing information about choices for home treatment systems that are likely to be effective in removing arsenic. This may be especially important in rural areas where adverse health effects are not evident to local populations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamic behavior of service supply chains in the presence of varying demand and information sharing. Each stage holds no finished goods inventory, rather only backlogs that can be managed solely by adjusting capacity. These conditions reflect the reality of many service (and custom manufacturing, such as capital equipment) supply chains. While there is a growing literature on finished goods inventory management in supply chains, relatively little research exists on managing capacity in the absence of finished goods inventory. To address this problem, we develop a capacity management model for a serial chain. At each stage in the supply chain, our model relates capacity, processing, backlog, and service delays to capture the aggregate dynamic interactions between the different stages. Using a system dynamics simulation model in an experimental design as well as a formal analysis of a simplified, yet representative, model using control theory and signal analysis techniques, we characterize the conditions under which a “bullwhip effect” (i.e., an increase in demand and backlog variability as one looks up the supply chain) can occur. We then study the impact of different management strategies and levels of information visibility on capacity and service delay variability in a two‐stage model.</jats:p><jats:p>Conventional wisdom, derived from studies of make‐to‐stock manufacturing supply chains, strongly supports lead‐time reduction in order to mitigate the bullwhip effect. We show that lead‐time reduction can exacerbate the bullwhip effect in a service or custom manufacturing setting if it is not carefully coordinated with capacity adjustment. In particular, lead‐time reduction generally <jats:italic>reduces</jats:italic> backlog variance locally but often <jats:italic>increases</jats:italic> backlog variances at higher stages. Further, sharing end‐customer demand reduces backlog variances as in inventory supply chains but over‐reliance on it relative to local information may actually <jats:italic>increase</jats:italic> demand variance at higher stages. Finally, we show that the natural tendency to pursue system‐wide process improvement by imposing uniform parameter targets across the supply chain exacerbates demand, capacity, and backlog variances at higher stages. Instead, we show that a superior policy is asymmetric, holding the bulk of system backlog at the stage closest to the point of end customer demand.

The authors develop an integrative framework based on game theory and exchange theory, and linked with the resource dependence approach and transaction cost theory. Specifically, the relationships between four constructs are examined: the multi‐dimensional construct of uncertainty, the game‐theoretical construct of the shadow of the future, the exchange‐theoretical construct of social bonding, and supply management performance. Based on large‐scale surveys with supply managers, the framework is tested in a cross‐national study in the U.S. and in Germany.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Systematic modifications in canopy growth rates in response to N supply were of particular relevance and a main factor for differences in tillering intensity resulting in modified stand densities. In the present study, cultivar differences in spike development and interactions with N supply related more to abortion than to initiation processes for number of spikelets and number of flowers per spikelet. High grain density (grains per m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) of cv. Toronto was evident during reproduction stages even under conditions of medium N supply. However, decreased growth rates during the later part of grain filling in combination with low 1000 grain weight, which was barely modified by N fertilization, allowed only partial utilization of this potential. It is assumed that sink limitations were of particular relevance for grain yield development in cv. Toronto, while cv.

The results revealed cultivar‐related differences in response to N fertilization in all parameters included in this study. Amount and timing of N fertilization was a strong indicator of N uptake into canopies and three phases of cultivar differentiation became apparent. Cultivar differences in N content were most clearly expressed during early growth stages, but distinctive differences in canopy N uptake were observed during later growth stages. Nitrate reductase activity, water‐soluble carbohydrates (WSC), and plant nitrate content varied in response to N supply within cultivar‐specific patterns that included reversals in cultivar ranking during canopy development, and provided additional indications for elevated intensity of N metabolism in cv. Toronto when compared with cv. Batis. Apart from such differences Batis partially compensated for delayed N uptake in earlier phases during the latter part of grain filling, presumably due to differences in root system development. Cultivar differences in regression of tillering, stand density, grains per ear and grain density (grains m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) on a number of N metabolism‐related parameters have been determined. They contribute considerably to the understanding of cultivar differences in grain yield components, as presented in an earlier communication. For 1000 grain weight, least affected from N supply within each year, large differences between years seemed to relate to differences in WSC content observed between heading and flowering, whereas cultivar differences in the level of grain N content and reaction to N supply were more directly determined by differences in N uptake and remobilization, and possibly enhanced by sink limitations of Toronto in grain size development.</jats:p>",

The case of GMO‐free soybean supply illustrates the various aspects of risk prevention that can lead to a systematic model of sustainable supply chain management. The article illustrates how – after consumers pressed the food industry to exclude GMO soybeans from their products – a sustainable soybean supply chain was established. Approaching the issue on a pragmatic basis, several tools have proved to be useful in constructing the supply chain. The authors show what the crucial points of sustainable supply chain management are. They point out the great contribution of standards and platforms such as BSCI, ETI, SA8000 and Fairtrade labelling, whereas process models such as AA1000 provide useful guidance on immunization against potential stakeholder risks. Finally, the article shows how a systematic approach can help companies to establish their tailored sustainable supply chain management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A common characteristic of water utility and wastewater companies in developing countries is management problems and limited commercial vocation. In the biggest Latin American cities there is a level of infrastructure enough for providing a substantially better service than the one currently supplied to their badly served customers. For years decisions have moved between two extremes: public management – usually corrupted with playing politics and inefficiency problems, and privatization – sharply criticized by many, and which has shown tendencies to inequality that leave it far away from earning panacea status. This paper is intended to expose the advantages of a novel model in which a state-run company with commercial management problems, the EAAB, solves its limitations by keeping the ownership of its assets and successfully incorporating the participation of better practices from other specialized operators, one of which is a state-owned player, EEPPM. This scheme demonstrates how the service indicators of a system serving eight million inhabitants in the Colombian capital improved significantly with state-owned assets and private participation, without giving in to privatization pressures or stagnating in the usual inefficiency typical of public management in developing countries. This is proposed as a replicable experience that can be used in medium and large cities in other countries with similar management problems, with certain adjustments to fit the solution to the specific cases. This is also a practical case for conducting a comparison of competitiveness within a city, of interest for regulatory entities and investigators on the potential of comparative efficiency in a traditionally monopolistic industry.</jats:p>",

The tomographic images reveal anomalously thick crust (8–9 km) and a low‐velocity “bull's‐eye”, from 4 to 10 km depth, beneath the center of the ridge segment. The velocity anomaly is indicative of high temperatures and a small amount of melt (up to 5%) and likely represents the current magma plumbing system for melts ascending from the mantle. In addition, at the segment center, seismic anisotropy in the lower crust indicates that the crust is composed of partially molten dikes that are surrounded by regions of hot rock with little or no melt fraction. Our results indicate that mantle melts are focused at mantle depths to the segment center and that melt is delivered to the crust via dikes in the lower crust. Our results also indicate that the segment ends are colder, receive a reduced magma supply, and undergo significantly greater tectonic stretching than the segment center.</jats:p>",

This core contains a 600-yr-long undisturbed record of paleo-precipitation changes. Two measurement methods for sediment density, organic matter and biogenic silica contents are compared and the most appropriate techniques are selected. Together with aluminium and titanium concentrations, grain size and geochemical properties of the organic matter, these proxies are used to demonstrate paleo-precipitation changes around 40°S. Increase of terrigenous particle supply between A.D. 1490 and A.D. 1700 suggests a humid period. Contemporaneously, δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C data show increasing lake productivity, in response to the high nutrient supply. The A.D. 1700–1900 interval is characterized by a decreasing terrigenous supply and increasing δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C values, interpreted as a drying period. The magnetic susceptibility signal, reflecting the terrigenous/biogenic ratio, demonstrates that similar variations occur in all the undisturbed sedimentary environments of Lago Puyehue. The A.D. 1490–1700 wet period is associated with the onset of the European Little Ice Age (LIA) and interpreted as its local signature. This work supports the fact that the LIA was a global event, not only restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.</jats:p>",

To provide an overview of the quality of the groundwater, a longitudinal study was conducted, in which 30 sites were randomly selected from 1,575 registered extraction wells.

The quality of the water distributed to the MCMA varied between the rainy and dry seasons, with higher levels of pH, nitrates, chloroform, bromodichloromethane, total organic carbon, and fecal streptococci during the dry season. This study showed that the groundwater distribution system is susceptible to contamination and that there is a need for a strict, year-round disinfection strategy to ensure adequate drinking-water quality.

We applied typing based on variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) to isolates from 125 patients in 42 IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>clusters, for which thorough epidemiological data were available, to investigate the potential of this method in distinguishing epidemiologically linked from nonlinked patients. Of seven IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>clusters without epidemiological links, five were split by MIRU-VNTR typing, while nearly all IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>clusters with proven or likely links displayed conserved MIRU-VNTR types. These results provide molecular evidence that not all clusters determined on the basis of multibanded IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP patterns necessarily reflect transmission of tuberculosis. They support the use of MIRU-VNTR typing as a more reliable and faster method for transmission analysis.</jats:p>",
