When blockage of both the uterine artery and vein and the secondary vessels was performed before mating, 35.6% of the ova, as represented by corpora lutea (CL), were present as implantation sites at autopsy, ten days post coitum (ten days); 91.1% of the ova (CL) were present as implantation sites on the control side. During the time between electrocoagulation and mating (average, 8.3 days), some reestablishment of circulation had usually occurred. When unilateral coagulation was performed at one day and at five days, 2.6% and 14.6% of the ova, respectively, subsequently formed implantation sites.</jats:p><jats:p>When alternate secondary branches of the uterine blood supply to one horn were coagulated at one day, 40.6% of the ova resulted in implantation sites at ten days. Tertiary arborizations of undisturbed branches appear to revascularize portions of the horn to which the blood supply had been coagulated. When blood supply to the ovarian, middle or cervical portions of the uterus was blocked at one day, 6.3%, 42.9% and 14.3% of the ova, respectively, formed implantation sites. It is suggested that the blood supply to the ovarian portion of the uterus is critical to the descending embryo.</jats:p><jats:p>There was a significant correlation between the number of secondary vessels and the number of implantation sites in all intact uterine horns.</jats:p>",

There are two main systems, one penetrating the middle third of the anterior surface and the other entering the lower pole of the bone behind the patellar ligament. </jats:p><jats:p> 2. The relationship between these findings and the complication of avascular necrosis of the upper fragment of the patella after fracture is discussed. Forty-one cases of necrosis after operation have been studied and notes made on the pathological, clinical and radiological evolution of the condition. Whatever the severity of the ischaemic necrosis the prognosis was not substantially affected and good function was observed in all knees six months after injury. </jats:p><jats:p> 3. The surgical implications of the vascular anatomy are discussed. It is pointed out that surgical intervention may damage the blood vessels entering the anterior surface of the bone and that circumferential repair of patellar fractures may strangle the vessels in their peripatellar course. </jats:p><jats:p> 4. If removal of one-half of the patella after a transverse fracture is indicated, vascular studies indicate that the upper fragment should be removed. </jats:p>",
