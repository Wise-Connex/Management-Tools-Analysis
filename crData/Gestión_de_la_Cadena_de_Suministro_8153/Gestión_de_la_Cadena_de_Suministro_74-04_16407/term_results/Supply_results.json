The country ranked 9th in terms of producer. The country ranked 9th in terms of 1972 crude oil production with 3.4% of the total world rate and 15th in terms of remaining reserves with 1.5% of the world total of 560 billion barrels. Exports to the United States in 1973 averaged 1,127 thousand barrels per day of crude oil and pentanes plus, which accounted only for 6.5% of the total U.S. demand for all hydrocarbons (or 35% of U.S. crude oil imports), but it did amount to 58% of Canada's total production. Production of conventional crude production. Production of conventional crude from the presently producing area, the western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, is expected to continue at the present level for only a few years and then show a sharp decline. Intensive development of synthetic oil from tar sands and heavy oil areas could to some extent mitigate this decline, but the availability of frontier oil in the 1980's will be necessary to recover to the present supply situation. As a result of present supply situation. As a result of increased demand in present Canadian market areas for Western crude and the additional demand resulting from the construction of the Montreal Pipeline, the volume of exports to the U.S. will drop sharply by the end of this decade. The only alternatives to a complete cessation of crude oil exports by the early 1980's would be earlier movement of Mackenzie Delta oil to west-Coast markets through the Alyeska Pipe line or a smaller supply to Montreal than now planned. These alternatives will, however, only reduce the rate of decline in exports to the U.S.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In 1973 the Canadian oil industry produced 2.0 million barrels per day of crude oil and pentanes plus and 6.1 billion cubic feet per pentanes plus and 6.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.

While the levels represented only a small proportion of total United States demand (6.5% proportion of total United States demand (6.5% of the demand for all hydrocarbon liquids, and 4.4% of natural gas consumption), they did account for high proportions of Canada's productive capacity, 58% of oil producibility productive capacity, 58% of oil producibility and 46% of pipeline gas volumes.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Household appliances and personal items in contact with water supplied municipally or from private sources are subject to physical damages from chemical and other constituents of the water. This study translates these damages into economic losses for a typical household. Then it aggregates these losses at the national and individual state levels. To do so required several stages of analysis. First, the types of physical damages expected and the associated water quality determinants were identified, and the physical effects were then translated into economic losses. Second, damage functions were formulated to predict likely impacts of water quality changes on each household unit affected. Third, a computer program based on these functions was designed to estimate total damages per typical household and to aggregate them over selected regions. Finally, the program was applied to state‐by‐state data describing water supply sources and socioeconomic parameters. Total annual damages to U.S. residents in 1970 were estimated to be in the range $0.65–$3.45 billion, the mean being $1.75 billion. The mean translates to $8.60 per person annually. States having the highest total damages were California ($230 million) and Illinois ($164 million). On a per capita basis, Arizona ($22.53) and New Mexico ($18.58) ranked highest, whereas South Carolina ($1.15) and Oregon ($1.73) were at the other end of the spectrum. When per capita damages were compared by source of water supply, private wells were highest at an average of $12.34, treated groundwater was next at $11.20, and treated surface water was last at only $5.83.</jats:p>",

When the fruits of the first truss had developed the plants were treated with labelled CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> for 2 h in a glove box.

The assimilation rates per g fresh material, however, were not increased in each experimental set by the K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatment. The absolute quantities of labelled photosynthates transported from leaves and stems to the fruits were also greater in the plant with the higher potassium supply. In all experimental series the proportion of labelled material found in the fruits was higher in the plants of the K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatment (total label of the plant=100%) than in the plants of the K<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> treatment. This beneficial effect of potassium was also observed in cases, where potassium had not affected the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation rate. Expressing the distribution of labelled material in relative terms (percentage proportions) means that the effect of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation on the transport of photosynthates was excluded to a high extent. The higher percentage proportions of labelled material found in fruits and roots of the K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as compared to the K<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> treatment is, therefore, predominantly dependent on a specific effect of potassium on the translocation of assimilates.</jats:p><jats:p>The labelled material found in the soluble fraction of the stems consisted of about 90% sugars, nearly half of which was sucrose, the rest being mainly glucose and fructose. This finding suggests that sucrose is the most important transport form of carbohydrates in tomatoes.</jats:p>",
