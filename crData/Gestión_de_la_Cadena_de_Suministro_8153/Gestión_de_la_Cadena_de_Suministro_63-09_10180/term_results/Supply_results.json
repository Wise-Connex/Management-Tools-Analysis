Greater oil recovery is predicted at asubstantially lower capital investment. Problems of primary water source areovercome by off-stream reservoir. Treatment and injection facilities arecombined to reduce operation and maintenance costs. Under the line-drive typewaterflood scheme the operators expect to recover the equivalent of the primaryoil in eight years compared to a normal twenty-five years. It is anticipatedthat the ultimate oil recovery will be more than double the primary reserves.Utilization of specialized engineering services can result in substantial costsavings on projects of this nature.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>A portion of the Pembina field in the Keystone-Berrymoor area was thought tobe a good prospect for a secondary oil recovery scheme.

Implementation of this scheme is expected to increase presentincome, more than double the oil recovery, cost considerably less than apattern type flood, and be more economical in operation. The study indicated awater requirement of 3,500 B/D.This requirement and the generalconfiguration of the area and pattern governed the design of thefacilities.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Outline of Study Area and Brief History</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Immediately to the east of the recently formed Berrymoor Cardium Unit and inthe western portion of the main Keystone-Pembina area a part of the sprawlingPembina oil field was subjected to examination for waterflood. The study areawas contained mainly in Twp. 49, Rge. 5, W5M, and was designated the Lindalearea. Some additional areas to the east and south were considered unsuitablefor waterflood because of the poorer Cardium sand characteristics.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two groups, each consisting of about 30 children aged 10–11 years, were investigated with regard to physical working capacity, PCW 10–11 and itsannual variations. One of these groups, the test group, received vitamin D on two occasions: on the one hand, a daily dose of 1500 I.U. administered continuously for a period of two months; and on the other, a single massive dose of 400,000 I.U. The effect of vitamin D on PWC which had previously been reported by several authors could not be shown to be of statistical significance. The other group, the control group, like the test group, was subject to seasonal variations in PWC, with a significant minimum in late autumn, November December, and a maximum in April‐May. The cause of the observed seasonal variations have been discussed, and it seems that, to a great extent, they were due to variations in physical activity on account of differences in climate and in the length of daylight during the year.</jats:p><jats:p>In a smaller group the effect was studied of UV irradiation on PWC, heart volume, blood volume and total hemoglobin, in comparison with those of a control group. No effect of UV irradiation which was of statistical sig nificance was observed in connection with the test group. With regard to PWC and heart volume, both groups showed similar seasonal variations as those found in the larger material. In connection with blood volume and total hemoglobin, a somewhat divergent course was noted, as they increased during the entire period of investigation. The increase was, however, slightly larger during the spring months in comparison with that which was observed during the period October‐December and consequently, it appears that also these parameters were subject to some seasonal variations.</jats:p>",
