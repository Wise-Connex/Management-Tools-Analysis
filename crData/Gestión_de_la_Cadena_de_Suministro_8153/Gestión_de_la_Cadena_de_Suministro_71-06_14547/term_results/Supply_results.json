      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops an analytic model that evaluates the expected number of aircraft not operationally ready at a random point in time because of supply (NORS). The model was developed for application to the F-111 aircraft for a multilevel problem, where demand on a first-level line replaceable unit (LRU) eventually causes second-level demands for one or more modules that are components of the LRU. The model is for a single base. Since it is evaluative in nature, the inputs include item stock levels as well as item demand rates, average repair times, and resupply times. An optimization model to determine stock levels that minimize the number of NORS aircraft subject to a budget constraint would be preferable to the evaluation model. The paper shows, however, that an optimization model is not mathematically tractable because the criterion function is not separable into independent item calculations. But an example using F-111 data indicates that if the METRIC model [see Opns. Res. 16, 122–141 (1968)] is used to optimize stock levels, the resulting number of aircraft NORS is within 1 percent of the minimum number of aircraft achievable with the same budget. Finally, the well-known formula of Erlang for the M/G/s service system with no queue allowed is generalized to the case where demand rates and repair rates may be a function of the number of units already in repair. This enables us to examine the sensitivity of the optimal allocation of budget across a group of items when expediting may take place. Though expediting improves system performance, the conclusion is that the optimal allocation is virtually the same as the METRIC allocation. </jats:p>",

Some of the alternatives proposed for meeting the growing shortage of clean‐water or cheap‐water are reallocation, reuse, and importation. This paper outlines a methodology to assess all of these water supply alternatives by examining the amount and time‐staging for development of water sources. In conceptualizing the problem, sources of supply are classified in three categories: primary or base supplies, secondary or effluent supplies, and supplementary or imported supplies. A model of the water system is formulated as a “transportation problem” in linear programming depicting the possible sources of supply which can be used to satisfy the requirements of various water users. The optimizing objective in the model is to minimize the cost of water under various assumptions for operating the system. A case study of the Salt Lake Qty, Utah, area is used to illustrate the application of the model in obtaining optimal water supply allocations for projected future demands. Assessment of alternatives in the study include redistribution of supplies, time‐staging of supplies and related treatment facilities, and sensitivity of allocations to changes in costs.</jats:p>",

A discrete deterministic dynamic programming model was structured and operated to determine the optimal water supply capacity expansion paths for a hypothetical residential community with a given water pricing policy. The objective of the model was the maximization of future discounted consumers'surpluses plus producer's revenues net of the long‐run cost of supply. State variables were the size of system capacity in MGD and stage variables were the times of feasible capacity increase in years. Demand curves, population sizes, and growth rates for various economic sectors of the community were assumed known, as well as short‐run production and capital construction costs. Several policies, including constant unit rates, decreasing or increasing block rates and summer differential rates were tested. It was concluded that price plays a major role in the short‐run allocation and long‐run planning and conservation of water supplies. Conservational pricing policies were advocated as means of lowering the long‐run cost of water, using the water price‐demand function as a planning tool.

Until this event occurred, the existing water supply sources and those planned for the future had been considered adequate, as they were designed for the worst drought of record (usually the 1930‐31 drought). In view of this “change in hydrology,” the Delaware River Basin Commission authorized a study (DRBC Resolution 67‐4) to re‐evaluate the adequacy of existing and planned water supply sources of the Delaware River Basin and its Service Area (New York City and northern New Jersey).</jats:p><jats:p>Synthetic hydrology is a tool which can be used to overcome many of the limitations of the traditional approach. By analyzing generated streamflow traces in this study, it has been determined that there is a definite relationship between the accumulated rainfall deficiency during the drought and the return periods associated with various durations of runoff in the drought. This indicated that generated traces can be used to standardize the hydrology over an area where the intensity of drought varied. This represented an important facet in the study, because it provided a means to equalize the effects of this drought over the study area, and gave the Delaware River Basin Commission more information so that it could better plan and manage its water resources equitably, not only for the people within the Basin, but for the New York City and northern New Jersey areas as well.</jats:p><jats:p>Synthetic hydrology was used to determine yield‐probability relationships for 50‐year periods, and storage‐yield‐frequency relationships for existing and planned water‐supply reservoirs. It was also used to determine yield‐probability relationships for reservoir systems within the Basin. In the study, it was determined that monthly streamflow traces and uniform draft rates could be used in yield analysis because of the magnitude of the reservoirs and because seasonal variations of draft rate are small in the study area.</jats:p><jats:p>Although it was found that with the streamflow generating models (first order Markov) in common use today, it is not possible to definitely determine the actual frequency of a very severe historic drought, it is possible to place a drought in perspective by using synthetic hydrology. The study showed that it is a useful tool in determining water availability over a basin and is useful in studying water management problems such as interbasin transfers, and reservoir systems operations.</jats:p>",
