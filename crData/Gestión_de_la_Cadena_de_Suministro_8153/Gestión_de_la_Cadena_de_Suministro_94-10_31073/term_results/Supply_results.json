A nitrogen supply of 40 g/day (treatment L) was compared with 62 g/day (treatment C) during day 0 to 85 of pregnancy. In the last month of pregnancy nitrogen supply on treatment L was 50 g/day and on treatment C 74 g/day. Faecal digestible lysine supply followed the same pattern as nitrogen. Nitrogen and energy balances were measured during mid pregnancy (day 50 to 60; no. = 22) and late pregnancy (day 105 to 112; no. = 60). During mid pregnancy treatments had a minor affect on NR and energy metabolism. NEx on treatment L was proportionately about 0·40 lower than on treatment C. During late pregnancy NR was lower on treatment L than on treatment C. NEx on treatment L was proportionately reduced by 0·35 compared with treatment C. In parity 1 the lower NR on treatment L was compensated by a higher fat gain. Results indicate that nitrogen and faecal digestible lysine supply on treatment L were close to minimal requirement in late pregnancy. Assumed values for maintenance requirement of nitrogen (0·45 g N per kg M<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>) and efficiency of ingested nitrogen to NR (0·6) were in line with the results of the balance trials. The observed nitrogen retention of sows, especially during mid pregnancy, permits a reduced nitrogen supply to reduce NEx.</jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that this increase is partially due to capillary angiogenesis among muscle fibers with large increases in activity during exercise training bouts.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Two training programs were evaluated: a program consisting of 10–12 weeks of exposure to low‐intensity (30 m/min, 0 incline, 60 min/day) (LET) exercise bouts, 5 days/week, and a second program consisting of 8–10 weeks of exposure to repetitive bouts (6/day) of sprint (60 m/min, 15% incline) exercise, alternating running (2.5 min) and recovery (4.5 min), 5 days/week (IST). Cage‐confined rats were utilized (SED) as controls. After training was completed, rat hindquarters were perfusion‐fixed with modified Karnovsky's fixative. Transverse sections from soleus (Sol), and red (G<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>), mixed (G<jats:sub>M</jats:sub>), and white (G<jats:sub>W</jats:sub>) portions of gastrocnemius muscle were prepared to evaluate capillarization. Sections were analyzed using the Olympus Cue 2 Image Analyzer to determine capillary/muscle fiber ratio (C/F), number of capillary profiles per square millimeter of muscle area (CND), capillary surface area per volume of tissue, and capillary volume density.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Average area per muscle fiber and sarcomere length did not differ among groups.

Using Health Care Financing Administration data, this study documented national and regional patterns of entry and exist by Medicare home health providers from 1980 to 1990. Nationally, agency origination rates accelerated during the early 1980s and then dropped abruptly in the second half of the decade. The proprietary sector, accounting for approximately 42% of agencies in existence during the period of the study, exhibited the greatest volatility. Regional differences are also evident. Both expansion and contraction in Medicare home health services appear to be a response to the incentives of legislation implemented during this period. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>1. We investigated the roles of grass litter in streams that drain upland New Zealand tussock grassland, paying particular attention to the ways in which grass leaves differed in their characteristics from much more intensively studied tree leaves.</jats:p><jats:p>2. The instantaneous retention rates of tussock grass leaves (<jats:italic>Chionochloa rigida</jats:italic>) on the bed of a second‐order stream (0.157–0.515 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) were significantly higher than those of the elliptical leaves of lemonwood trees (<jats:italic>Pittosporum eugenioides</jats:italic>; 0.068–0.180 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>).</jats:p><jats:p>3. Instantaneous retention rates of grass leaves in two third‐order streams were very low. At high discharge, leaf retention rate was greater in Timber Creek (0.0040 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), a braided, gravel bed stream, than in the adjacent Kye Burn (0.0010m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), with its well‐defined channel and large, stable substrate particles. At baseflow, retention rates were similar in the two streams (0.0053–0.0064 m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for Timber Creek; 0.0047–0.0058m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for Kye Burn). Nevertheless, total coarse particulate organic matter (mainly derived from tussock litter) was present at lower densities in Timber Creek than Kye Bum, reflecting the instability of the bed of the former and its tendency to spread over a wide area at high discharge.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The results of a colonization tray experiment, in which substrate was mixed with tussock leaves, nylon ribbon or nothing, indicate that tussock leaves do not play an important role as microhabitat or food in the two third‐order streams. This may reflect the poor food quality of grass litter, and/or the relatively low availability and predictability of its supply.</jats:p><jats:p>5. An <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> experiment revealed that tussock leaves play a role, analogous to that reported for certain seagrasses, in stabilizing substrate and reducing sediment transport, apparently by reducing bed roughness and therefore the force of friction on the bed.</jats:p>",
