During regular nest censuses in multi-species colonies, we realized that the heron nestlings were less war-like, not pecking each other and not showing physical evidence of abuse. We began to observe a few great blue heron broods in the hope that interspecific differences might illuminate the egrets’ violence. Two seasons of descriptive data collection confirmed the casual impression. The Lavaca Bay heron nestlings fought only about 5% as frequently as great egrets in adjacent nests (Mock 1985). No heron siblicides were observed directly, and only one case out of 46 censused broods could even be inferred from the presence of wounds.</jats:p>",

Since TPV is a direct energy conversion technology with no moving parts in the energy conversion system, it has the potential to provide quiet, reliable, maintenance-free electric power for thousands of hours. These systems also have the potential to be as efficient as small portable engine generators, operate on military logistic fuels, and start and operate in sub-freezing environments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A 150 Watt thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power module has been designed, built, and tested. The technical approach taken in the design focused on optimizing the integrated performance of the primary subsystems in order to yield high energy conversion efficiency and cost effectiveness. An important aspect of the approach is the use of a narrow band fibrous emitter radiating to a bandgap matched photovoltaic array to minimize thermal and optical recuperation requirements, as well as the non-recoverable heat losses. For the prototype system, fibrous ytterbia emitters radiating in a narrow band centered at 980 nm are matched with high efficiency silicon photoconverters. The integrated system includes a dielectric stack filter for optical energy recovery and a ceramic recuperator for thermal energy recovery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The prototype TPV system uses a rapid mix distributed fuel delivery system with controlled feeding of the fuel and heated air into a flame at the surface of the emitter. This makes it possible to operate at air preheat temperatures well above the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel thereby substantially increasing the system efficiency. The system has been operated with air preheat temperatures up to 1367 K and has produced a uniform narrow band radiation over the surface of the emitter with this approach.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The design of the system is described and test data for the system and some of the key components are presented. The results from a system model, which show the impact of various parameters on system performance, are also discussed.</jats:p>",

It uses a generalized functional form and includes the variance of the inflation rate as an explanatory variable, and is estimated for Brazil in the period 1974-1994 under the assumption that the monetary policy is passive and that expectations are adaptive. The supply of money is then specified as a generalization to a stochastic environment of the rule proposed by Cagan (1956). The money demand and supply equations are then estimated simultaneously, under rational expectations, by using the Johansen (1991) VEC procedure and interpreting the two cointegrating vectors which arise as the supply and demand equations. The restrictions suggested by the hypothesized theoretical models for the money market equilibrium in high inflation processes are tested and accepted for this data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply is one of the growth limiting factors in many forest ecosystems. Seasonal patterns in soil N and P supply rate were examined during a 2-yr period (1994–1995) for forest floor (L, F and H) and upper mineral (Ae) horizons in an 80-yr-old aspen forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. Accumulation of plant nutrient ions on ion exchange resins incubated in the field can provide an estimate of nutrient supply rate in soils because ion exchange resins have the potential ability to simulate nutrient flux to plant roots. Nutrient supply rates and the effect of plant uptake on nutrient supply rate was assessed using ion exchange membranes buried inside and outside polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders. The difference between ion flux to the membranes inside (root uptake excluded) versus outside the cylinders was used as an index of plant nutrient uptake. From May to October, nutrient uptake (µg 10 cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> 2 wk<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) by plants ranged from 1.6 to 31.7 (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>-N), from 2.7 to 13.7 (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-N) and from 2.6 to 12.7 (P), with maximum N and P uptake in summer. Nutrient uptake by plants also varied among horizons. In general, plant uptake of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>-N, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-N and P was highest in the H horizon, followed by the F and Ae horizons, with lowest uptake apparent in the L horizon. The results are consistent with the distribution of plant fine roots: most were found in the H horizon (68%), followed by the Ae and F horizons (15%), and the L (2%) horizon. Autumn litterfall represented a nutrient return of 28–40 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and 4–7 kg P ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> to the forest floor which coincided with an increase in ion supply rates in the forest floor. During the growing season, atmospheric inputs via bulk deposition and throughfall contributed small amounts of N (1.8 kg NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> and 0.23 kg NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>-N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and P (1.38 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> inorganic P) to the forest floor. Recycling of nutrients by litterfall and subsequent mineralization and re-assimilation by plant roots in the forest floor is a dynamic and important component of nutrient cycling in boreal aspen forest ecosystems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, EC 1.4.1.2) is ubiquitous in plant species. It is now generally accepted that the primary role of this enzyme is not assimilation of ammonium and it has been suggested that GDH may be important in provision of carbon skeletons under conditions of carbon limitation. In carrot (<jats:italic>Daucus carota</jats:italic> L. Chantenay) cell suspension cultures carbon starvation results in de‐repression of GDH activity. The regulation of this de‐repression has not been investigated. This paper examines the possibility that the availability of adenosine nucleotides is instrumental in the regulation of GDH activity. In repressed cultures the adenosine nucleotides cAMP (0.2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>), AMP (0.2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) and ADP (0.4 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) caused an increase in GDH activity of 61, 33 and 7%, respectively. ATP (0.2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) had the opposite effect in maintaining repression of GDH. Under de‐repressed conditions only cAMP (0.2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) enhanced GDH activity (14%). Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using a range of inhibitors resulted in de‐repression of GDH and stimulation of respiration. The results from this work indicate that exogenously applied adenosine nucleotides and electron transport inhibitors alter the GDH repression/de‐repression status. Addition of these compounds alters or disrupts ATP levels, mimicking carbon depletion. This causes an increase in GDH activity, supporting the idea that GDH may provide carbon skeletons for carbon metabolism and suggesting that ATP status is important in regulation of the enzyme activity.</jats:p>",
