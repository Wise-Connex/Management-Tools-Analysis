It begins with a paper that looks at the likely effects of new technology on libraries and publishing. The Hermes and Apollo projects, and a broad systems view on new technology and the supply of ‘separates’ are discussed. Three discussion papers from the Library of Congress Network Advisory Committee on present position and long‐term future of document delivery in the USA are considered. Finally, two specific developments — the Chemical Abstracts Service Document Delivery Service and the OCLC/IAC electronic document delivery system — are reported.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This model national code for interlibrary lending was drawn up in 1983 by the IFLA Office for International Lending for the IFLA Section on Interlending. It is recommended as a model for all countries that do not at present have a national code for interlibrary lending or that wish to revise existing codes. A model national code clearly cannot take account of all variations in practice between countries. Provision has therefore been made for individual countries to include information specific to their country (see sections in square brackets). It is important to understand the research and study that lies behind this code. The following documents are recommended: i. Line, M B (and others). National interlending systems: a comparative study of existing systems and possible models. Paris, Unesco, 1980. (PGI/78/WS/24 Rev.) ii. Line, M B and Vickers, S. Principles of national interlending systems. Interlending Review, 1978, vol 6, no 2, 50–53. If the model code cannot be adapted to any particular country's needs, the following checklist may be used as a guide to the topics that a code should cover: i. definition of interlending. ii. a statement of any broad principles. iii. any other national regulations, manuals, etc that should be known. iv. verification of requests. v. location of required materials and/or channels to be used. vi. standard formats. vii. transmission methods for requests. viii. treatment of requests received. ix. delivery of requested material. x. loan periods, return of material, renewals. xi. responsibility for loss or damage. xii. charges and payment procedures. xiii. statistics.</jats:p>",

On late day 12, blood vessels are distributed over the whole cross sectional area of the foreleg. On early day 13, a rearrangement of the blood vessels is visible. Now an avascular centre is enclosed by a vascularized tissue mantle, in which the muscle anlage starts developing. Few capillaries are visible within the muscle anlage. After differentiation of the muscle anlage into individual muscles the epimysium is passed by a netlike capillary plexus enwrapping the first avascular muscles. With the establishment of the perimysium on day 16 of embryonic development some capillaries are also visible within the individual muscles. The diameter of the capillaries is by far larger than the diameter of the myotubes. In older embryos the perimysium shows an increasing number of such large capillaries, whereas in the epimysium the capillaries are less frequent. In the perimysium a few additional capillaries with a small diameter of about 5 µm occur. On day 3 postpartum, small capillaries are also visible within the muscle fibre bundles. In the perimysium many large capillaries are still obvious. The vascular supply on day 9 postpartum, resembles that in adult muscles. The vascular supply of the muscles progresses from their periphery to more and more smaller compartments within the muscles, in close correlation to the establishment of the muscular connective tissue.</jats:p>"

Although interlibrary loan practices were established on the basis of reciprocity among institutions, the imbalance between net lenders and net borrowers has been causing concern about the costs of such a service and who should bear them. Interlibrary loan charges are one means of distributing among libraries the actual costs of the information transfer process. On the other hand, it is in the public interest to allow access to appropriate information banks and interlibrary loan facilitates resource sharing schemes and therefore better use of those resources. Charging can be seen as a rationing mechanism: negative in effect and against the public good.</jats:p>",

For the filter, a ladder filter configuration composed of nine wire-mounted ceramic disk resonators and eight multilayer ceramic capacitors was adopted. Because of refinement of the filter design, only rough adjustment was fully sufficient for the frequency adjustment on the resonator. The filter exhibited analogous characteristics designed according to image parameter theory; both its temperature and aging characteristics were satisfactory. The stopband attenuation was more than 100 dB, due to suppression of spurious vibration. The filter size was reduced to 1/2 that of the usual quartz crystal filter. \n </jats:p>",

By this model it is possible to estimate the effects either of prolonged elevation of iodide supply or of a single administration of a high dose of inorganic iodide in the presence of autonomously functioning thyroid tissue. Prolonged elevation of iodide supply in regions of iodine deficiency will cause manifest hyperthyroidism in many cases of thyroidal autonomy (cases with facultative hyperthyroidism). The administration of a single high dose of iodide, as it is proposed for the situation of an accident in a nuclear power station (100 mg Nal) in order to reduce the radiation burden to the surrounding population, carries almost no risk in cases of thyroid autonomy.</jats:p>"

In general the main anatomical features seem to be in accordance with the anatomy in man. However there are some important differences worth mentioning and the nomenclature used in the rat is not adequate in all respects: 1. The branch of the celiac artery which bifurcates into the hepatic artery proper and the gastroduodenal artery should not be given the incorrect name hepatic artery but is named common hepatic artery. 2. The hepato-esophageal artery is a constantly present branch of the hepatic artery proper running in the hepatogastric ligament. 3. The right gastric artery, present in about 40% of the specimens, is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery which runs towards the lesser curvature where it communicates freely with a left gastric artery branch. 4. The gastrosplenic artery is one of the branches of the splenic artery. It divides into a gastric and a splenic branch. The gastric branch is the only short gastric artery present in the rat. 5. A gastro-epiploic artery at the splenic side of the stomach is not present in the rat. The continuation of the splenic artery into the greater omentum has been referred to as the left epiploic artery. Anastomoses with epiploic branches of the gastro-epiploic artery are present in the greater omentum.</jats:p>"

In this paper we first discuss the concept of hybrid systems and then describe experimental results obtained with a triple hybrid system incorporating a wind‐power generator, solar cells and Diesel generating equipment. It is then shown that the continuous time distribution of natural energy in the nonenergized state follows an exponential function. We apply a mathematical model which is in good agreement with the experimental results and develop a theory for derivation of the required storage battery capacity as well as the power to be applied by the Diesel generators. Then, applying this design method to various systems, we present a quantitative analysis of the complementary relationship between wind power and solar illumination and show that the triple hybrid system is most economical.</jats:p>",

High CO2 increased leaf area in all but two species, the increase varying from 20 to 75%. However, the water loss per plant followed a similar time course to that of plants in control CO2 concentration because of the reduction of daily transpiration rate per unit leaf area (range 4-39%). Cowpea and sunflower plants rewatered after one soil drying cycle showed 9 and 5%, respectively, lower transpiration rate in high CO2 over a subsequent drying cycle than in the first cycle. Averaging across all species and soil moisture contents, transpiration rate was less reduced by high CO2 (21%) than was stomatal conductance (36%) and this is attributed to the increased leaf temperature caused by reduced stomatal conductance.</jats:p>"

Sulfur supply had no effect on competition between the species.

In swards which were severely deficient in nitrogen, subterranean clover was more responsive to increasing sulfur supply than was ryegrass, but this did not cause interspecific competition. Under field conditions during spring, there was some indication that ryegrass was the superior competitor in sulfur-deficient swards which had received nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen application reduced the percentage of subterranean clover in the sward at all levels of sulfur supply, because it had a much greater effect on yield of ryegrass relative to the yield of subterranean clover. Sulfur application increased the percentage of subterranean clover in the mixed swards at each level of nitrogen supply.</jats:p>"

However, at 19 and 25�C ryegrass suppressed the yield and sulfur content of subterranean clover. When sulfur was applied to the mixture, nitrogen application did not result in competition at any temperature. When nitrogen supply was low, the yield and sulfur content of ryegrass were poor compared with those of subterranean clover. However, this did not result in competition between the species at low or high levels of sulfur supply. In both species, yield and sulfur content increased, and sulfur concentration decreased with increasing soil temperature. Hence there were severe symptoms of sulfur deficiency in plants grown with added nitrogen at 19 and 25'C, and no symptoms in plants grown at lower temperatures.

Fiber type distribution in WL/PL, EA, and NA averaged 59 +/- 6 (SD), 40 +/- 11, and 61 +/- 10% FT. Values for mean fiber area and FT/ST area were significantly greater in WL/PL compared with values obtained in EA and NA. Similar values for cap X fib-1 were observed WL/PL (2.06 +/- 0.74) and NA (2.16 +/- 0.34). EA exhibited greater cap X fib-1 (3.11 +/- 0.73) than WL/PL (NS) and NA (P less than 0.01).

Plant dry weight (DW) was increased substantially by high CO2 in all but two species (cotton and maize) at the first harvest (average increase of 65%, range from 26 to 132%). Over the whole period, increases in DW with high CO2 (average of 53%) were associated with increases in water use efficiency (WUE) of between 40 and 80% (average of 67% for all species). Cowpea and sunflower plants grown through two additional soil moisture drying cycles showed 26 and 21% increases, respectively, in the effect of high CO2 on WUE. Approximate calculations indicated that high CO2 increased the apparent efficiency of use of intercepted radiation by 11-49% (average of 27%) in C3 species but in C4 species there was no effect. The effect of high CO2 on the partitioning of DW varied between species and between harvests. During the first period, 14 species showed increased specific leaf weight of 10-40% in high CO2 and 16 species showed no effect of high CO2 on the root : shoot ratio. Over the whole experiment, eight species had lower leaf to total plant weight ratio in high CO2 attributable to increased non-leaf aerial tissues.</jats:p>"

At the same time, because of their role in educating the audiences of the future, they are equally a part of the solution. In good financial times no less than in bad, Americans have tended to regard support for the arts in a puritanical light. Universities therefore make their most solid contributions to the arts in kind, by encouraging artists and the arts as part of the primary educational mission and by exposing all students to both the old and the new in art, music, and drama. Even though direct subventions are bound to remain inadequate, institutions can effectively provide support for the arts by resuming some responsibility for instilling aesthetic judgment in the citizens and consumers of tomorrow. Universities have a historical obligation to develop the highest in human awareness. This includes helping to determine tomorrow's tune by taking responsibility for informing the tastes of those who will pay the pipers of the future. </jats:p>",

Irrespective of the density or proportion of each species in the mixture, changes in the supply of nitrogen and sulfur did not cause interspecific competition for sulfur. For subterranean clover, sulfur application increased the number of lateral branches, petiole length and shoot yield. Sulfur application had similar effects on ryegrass, but only at the high level of nitrogen supply. Nitrogen application increased leaf length and tiller number of ryegrass, and increased yield and sulfur content of shoots of both species. In swards where both species were in equal proportions, increasing the overall density from 10 to 30 plants/pot (i.e. from 497 to 1490 plants/m2) did not affect botanical composition or result in interspecific competition, but increased the degree of intraspecific competition. As density increased, the number of branches (tillers), the yield and the sulfur content per plant of each species decreased. Increasing plant density increased the average length of subterranean clover petioles, but had no effect on the average length of ryegrass leaves. When the ryegrass density in mixed swards was low, increasing the density of subterranean clover plants resulted in interspecific competition to the detriment of ryegrass. This competitive situation was considered to be due to competition for light, as it was not alleviated by the addition of sulfur and nitrogen.</jats:p>"

Contemporaneous decisions to market slaughter cattle were affected by the long‐term cycle as well as the more direct influence of slaughter prices and range conditions within a one to two year period. The responsiveness of these sectors to changes in cattle prices is qualified within the biological and climatic constraints, and customs of the tribal and commercial cattle producing economies.

There is a need, however, to augment these surveys with accurate longitudinal data which identifies the age‐specific variables of science teacher survival rates, incoming number of new teachers, and the rate at which science teachers change age cohorts. These three variables were used in a five year longitudinal study of all the physics and chemistry teachers in Kansas to project the need for teachers in 1985 and in 1990. The study indicated that the teachers 40 years and older comprised 33.5% of the physics/ chemistry teacher population in 1979–1980 and the percentage will steadily increase to 60.8 by 1990. The high turnover rate of science teachers 29 years old and younger is also contributing to the shortage of qualified physics and chemistry teachers.

Nitrogen application increased the external requirement for sulfur of ryegrass by greatly stimulating growth and, to a lesser extent, sulfur content. Hence nitrogen application decreased sulfur concentrations in ryegrass. In subterranean clover there was relatively little effect of nitrogen application on the external requirement for sulfur because nitrogen did not greatly increase the sulfur content. Nitrogen application did not affect the external requirement for sulfur by changing the distribution of sulfur either between root and shoot or within shoots. The internal sulfur requirements, based either on sulfur concentrations or nitrogen to sulfur ratios, in the young leaves of both species were unaffected by nitrogen supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The association between endosperm cell number and grain dry weight, and the dependence of endosperm cell division on the availability of organic nutrients, have been investigated in wheat. Two different procedures were used to vary the supply of nutrients to the grains during the phase of cell division. Detached ears were cultured in solutions of sucrose (0-60 g 1-1) and glutamine (0.125-0.75 g N 1-1), or intact plants were exposed to high (560 �mol m-2 s-1) or low (55 �mol m-2 s-1) photon irradiance. Cell number per endosperm, and grain dry weight, were both responsive to the concentration of nutrients in the external medium, and to the level of photon exposure. Average dry weight per cell was relatively independent of the level of nutrition or of photon exposure until cell division had ceased but, in the later stages of grain-filling, dry weight per cell in the cultured ears displayed a dependence upon the concentration of nutrients in the external medium.\n    Amounts of sucrose, other soluble carbohydrates and soluble amino nitrogen were extracted from the grains and, on a per grain basis, the amounts of all fractions varied in response to variation in the level of nutrients supplied to the ears, and to photon exposure. However, concentrations of these nutrients in the developing grains, calculated on a dry weight or water basis, were not associated with the rate of cell division in the grains. \n    While the evidence gathered supports the notion that growth (in cell number, and dry weight) of the developing endosperm is controlled inter alia by the provision of organic nutrients, the nature of the controlling mechanism is obscure. It seems that cellular division is not affected directly by nutritional supply through a mechanism involving the concentration of substrates for energy and protein synthesis within the developing grain.</jats:p>"

Male‐female pairs were kept for 4 months on one of three food rations: high–1 g food daily; medium–1 g three times per week; low–1 g per week. The number of spawnings was directly related to the food ration. The fecundity of the females on the low and medium rations declined. At all rations the inter‐spawning interval and egg size increased during the experiment. Egg size was positively related to ration and the length of the inter‐spawning interval, but the latter was inversely related to ration. Females on the high ration grew in weight while those on the low ration lost weight. Histological examination of the ovaries at the end of the experiment suggested that low rations reduced the proportion of oocytes that become vitellogenic. At the end of the experiment, the total, gonad and liver weight of females at a given length were significantly related to ration. No similar, significant effect was found for the males, although growth in length of the males was related to ration. Ration had no detectable effect on the histological appearance of the testes.</jats:p>",
