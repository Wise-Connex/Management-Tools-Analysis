      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: One-third of wine producers in South Africa are experiencing negative net farming revenues. The wine industry is close to the heart of South Africans and South Africa is known for its production of quality wine in the world. However, the wine-producing sector faces many difficulties that threaten its survival. Besides the possible impact of the land reform drive of the government, the industry is experiencing financial and operational pressures, which have been exacerbated by drought and high temperatures affecting the crops. These factors affect not only the wine producers but also the complete wine supply chain.Objectives: This article provides insight into the supply chain risks of producing wine. The study was conducted among wine producers in the Stellenbosch region of the Western Cape province of South Africa.Method: An exploratory, qualitative, case-study approach was adopted in this study. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 participants at five wine producers’ sites selected on a non-probability convenience sample basis. Thematic analysis was used to process the data.Results: The most critical supply chain risks factors identified through this study centre around the sourcing of dry goods, agricultural activities, wine-making activities and financial risks. It also came to light that the wine farmers do not formally analyse their risks.Conclusion: Wine producers can put in a greater effort to improve the relationship with suppliers of dry goods and they will more efficiently mitigate some risks if they actively analyse and manage their risks on an ongoing basis.</jats:p>"

The second supplier then supplies all the goods required by the retailer. The model is chosen as the simplest case to examine resilience. Time to recover from disruption to ship all goods required by customers is slightly worse when the order rate when it reaches capacity limits but is less than the delay in the system from supplier to final shipment. Just over one weeks' maximum shipments stock at each tier guarantees shipments impervious to the collapse of one supplier, controller type has little effect on the performance of the model. These results agree with other researchers in general trend but not in detail. The response does not match the ‘Resilience Triangle.'</p>",

Whereas most scholars look to <jats:italic>quantitative</jats:italic> Big Data to build theoretical insights, in this paper we illustrate the value of <jats:italic>qualitative</jats:italic> Big Data. We begin by describing the nature and properties of qualitative Big Data. Then, we explain how one specific method, topic modeling, is particularly useful in theorizing supply chains. Topic modeling identifies co‐occurring words in qualitative Big Data, which can reveal new constructs that are difficult to see in such volume of data. Analyzing the relationships among constructs or their descriptive content can help to understand and explain how supply chains emerge, function, and adapt over time. As topic modeling has not yet been used to theorize supply chains, we illustrate the use of this method and its relevance for future research by unpacking two papers published in organizational theory journals.</jats:p>",

Well‐executed case‐based research will always be an appropriate means for developing supply chain theory. However, this EDI seeks to highlight emerging approaches to theory building that provide alternatives to case‐based research or can be used as a source of triangulation with it. To start that discourse, this issue offers three emergent approaches. In “Theorizing Supply Chains with Qualitative Big Data and Topic Modeling,” Tima Bansal, Jury Gualandris, and Nahyun Kim explore the application of topic modeling to develop supply chain theory from qualitative textual big data evidence. Anne Touboulic, Lucy McCarthy, and Lee Matthews illustrate the use of critical engaged research to develop supply chain theory in “Re‐Imagining Supply Chain Challenges Through Critical Engaged Research.” In “A New Methodology for Supply Chain Management: Discourse Analysis and its Potential for Theoretical Advancement,” Cynthia Hardy, Vikram Bhakoo, and Steve Maguire describe the potential for discourse analysis for developing supply chain management theory. These are but a few examples of potential approaches to developing supply chain theory. We welcome submissions on additional approaches and sources of data that are used in other disciplines, but have yet to be applied in the context of developing supply chain theory, and submissions on approaches that are emergent in the social sciences, in general. <jats:italic>JSCM</jats:italic> welcomes submissions for this EDI through the end of 2020.</jats:p>",

Given limited water and financial resources, making decisions for improving intermittent water supply (IWS) becomes a complex process. The paths to continuous supply are a priori undefined, however, the provision of efficient service is crucial. In the scientific literature, limited research addresses how to improve intermittent systems, to enhance the current service while transitioning to continuous supply. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) tool using a genetic algorithm has been developed to assist in investment decision-making. This approach uses multiple cost-effective intervention options to maximize equity and reliability while minimizing cost implications in an IWS system. The costs in such interventions include expenditure on pipe replacement, booster pump and elevated tank installation. The approach was first tested on a benchmark Hanoi synthetic network, and then applied to the water distribution network of Milagro (Ecuador). The developed tool reveals the extent to which equity and reliability can be driving objectives, and how they can be factored into decision-making. The application of the MOO tool in intermittent systems in order to improve existing distribution networks with strategic infrastructure addition can provide greater equity and reliability.</jats:p>",

So far, little attention has been devoted to how government agencies and other actors interact within complex networks. In this study, we use a qualitative research approach to study interorganizational interaction in the context of a major U.S. disaster: Hurricane Sandy. Specifically, we investigate the relatively successful Sandy response effort conducted by the New Jersey state government in interaction with other humanitarian actors. We find that the government took three main roles in interacting with other actors within the disaster response network: organizer, facilitator, and supply network member. Moreover, we develop a grounded model that provides a theoretical explanation of the interaction process and highlights the practices used by the government during the response stage. In addition to contributing to the humanitarian research domain, our study advances the emerging discourse on networks whose focal actors are not for‐profit firms.</jats:p>",

Absorptive capacity theory provides a generalized explanation for how firms exploit their embeddedness in relationships with buyers and suppliers. We develop and test theory that relates combinations of four components of absorptive capacity (R&amp;D capability, product development capability, cooperative embeddedness, and competitive embeddedness) to success rates in three product development strategies. We used data from the American pharmaceutical industry to estimate generalized linear mixed models. Our results confirm known relationships between R&amp;D capability, alliance network position, and the development of radically new products, but reveal different sets of factors that influence differentiation and imitation. We describe a previously undetected influence of competitive embeddedness on the development of radically new products, a contrasting absorptive capacity structure for generic product development, and a mixed structure for differentiated product development.</jats:p>",

The supply chain activities are divided into five core processes, i.e. plan, source, make, delivery and return. Each level of the SCOR model is weighted using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The mapping of SCOR Model consists of 5 core processes at 1st level, 21 performance matrices at 2nd level, and 28 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) at 3th level. The result shows that the supply chain performance is 68,231. Referring to the performance indicators, the performance achieved by the supply chain at this time is in the average category. Proposed improvement strategies are designed based on lean supply chain principles, through the implementation of Gemba Kaizen which consists of 17 proposed strategies.</jats:p>",

As the result, the banana marketing margin is high due to high transport costs and transaction costs. Although the policy relevance of degree of vertical and spatial price transmission in banana supply chain, in Ethiopia is largely unknown, and this study assists to bridge the existing gap. The study investigates degree of spatial and vertical market integration and price transmission of banana supply chain in Ethiopia. ARDL co-integration bound tests and Granger causality tests are employed to examine vertical and horizontal price transmissions in banana supply chain using 10 years average monthly banana prices. The study finds relatively a higher degree of price transmission from central wholesale banana market to surplus banana market. Central wholesaler price has a significant effect on both banana producer and retailer prices in both long-run and short‐run. The result indicates that Granger causality is running from central wholesale market to local markets. There may be high transaction cost may reflect the vertical and spatial asymmetric price transmissions in banana supply chain. Policy interventions in banana supply chains could facilitate a faster and substantial degree of price transmission between actors in banana supply chain.</jats:p>"

More specifically, the highest value of rent is generated by the buyer establishing cooperative posture of both dyads in the triadic supply chains. The value of rent close to zero is revealed in the triadic supply chains with negative relational posture of both dyads. Interestingly, the lowest level of rent produced by the buyer from bridging the structural hole is reported with the triadic supply chains in which one dyad demonstrates a more cooperative relational posture, whereas the other one indicates an adversarial relational posture. Not only does this result suggest that there is no rent, but it even goes further to indicate a negative return (or loss) derived by the manufacturer in this group of triadic supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study is limited to the relational posture, either strong or weak; therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine a wider spectrum of behaviors, based on the adversarial relationships, deprived of mutual trust, when both actors in a dyad act opportunistically and antagonistically.

      "abstract": "<p>A major focus of current research is understanding why people fall for and share fake news on social media. While much research focuses on understanding the role of personality-level traits for those who share the news, such as partisanship and analytic thinking, characteristics of the articles themselves have not been studied. Across two pre-registered studies, we examined whether character deprecation headlines—headlines designed to deprecate someone’s character, but which have no impact on policy or legislation—increased the likelihood of self-reported sharing on social media. In Study 1 we harvested fake news from online sources and compared sharing intentions between Republicans and Democrats. Results showed that, compared to Democrats, Republicans had greater intention to share character-deprecation headlines compared to news with policy implications. We then applied these findings experimentally. In Study 2 we developed a set of fake news that was matched for content across pro-Democratic and pro-Republican headlines and across news focusing on a specific person (e.g., Trump) versus a generic person (e.g., a Republican). We found that, contrary to Study 1, Republicans were no more inclined toward character deprecation than Democrats. However, these findings suggest that while character assassination may be a feature of pro-Republican news, it is not more attractive to Republicans versus Democrats. News with policy implications, whether fake or real, seems consistently more attractive to members of both parties regardless of whether it attempts to deprecate an opponent’s character. Thus, character-deprecation in fake news may in be in supply, but not in demand.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The design of municipal water tariffs requires balancing multiple criteria such as financial self-sufficiency for the service provider, equity among customers, and economic efficiency for society. Globally, various forms of water tariffs are in use (e.g., tariffs based on fixed or volumetric charges, single and two-part tariffs, and increasing or decreasing block tariffs) but increasing block tariffs (IBTs) have become popular worldwide over the last few decades for two main reasons. Apart from the fact that IBTs incentivize households to save water by charging large volumes at a higher price, there is a widespread belief that IBTs are pro-poor. The latter would be the consequence of providing all households with a minimum amount of water at a low (subsidized) price while large water users pay higher prices. However cross-subsidization between wealthy and poor households will occur only if poor households’ consumption falls in the low (subsidized) block and if rich households consume in the higher block and pay a price that is above the average cost of supply. These two conditions are rarely met in reality and IBTs often fail to allocate subsidies to the poor effectively. There are a few examples of water utilities making adjustments to the tariff to take into account that poor households with large families are likely to be adversely affected by IBTs. However, the provision of a minimum amount of water for free (as in South Africa), the design of household-specific low-cost water allowances (as in California), or tariffs being adjusted based on household size do not usually improve the targeting of subsidies to the poorest households. The widespread use of IBTs is difficult to rationalize, in particular while knowing that the use of a (simple) uniform volumetric tariff where water provision is charged at its full cost could improve social welfare by removing price distortions and would be easier for households to understand than IBTs. This simple tariff could be combined with some consumer assistance programs to help the poorest households pay their bills.</p>"

Supply chain collaborative innovation has not only become the main means for enterprises in various countries to cope with imponderable changes, but also been the driver of increasing supply chain dynamic capability and of achieving sustainable development of supply chains. Based on the survey data of 510 Chinese enterprises, this paper adopts the hierarchical regression analysis and a structural equation model to study the impact of supply chain collaborative innovation on the sustainable development of supply chains. The results show that: (1) Three modes of supply chain collaborative innovation (namely, technology collaborative innovation, management collaborative innovation, and market collaborative innovation) have different effects on supply chain dynamic capability and sustainable supply chain performance. (2) Supply chain dynamic capability plays a significant intermediary role between supply chain collaborative innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. (3) Supply chain technology collaborative innovation has the greatest direct impact on sustainable supply chain performance, followed by supply chain management collaborative innovation. However, the direct effect of supply chain market collaborative innovation on sustainable supply chain performance is not significant; under the intermediary role of dynamic capability, supply chain market collaborative innovation has a significant indirect effect on sustainable supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

The objective of this research article is to investigate numerous risks that affect the aviation supply chain (ASC) performance and to develop a proposed framework to measure the overall supply chain risk index by considering the importance of each risk. Aviation industry is at higher level of risks, that's why the researchers have identified the most serious 10 supply chain risks (SCRs) in this industry. In order to tackle with this key problem, an indexing system for comprehensive risk evaluation has been developed, which captures the ratings and weights for risk factors, namely occurrence probability, severity of impact, and ease of mitigation, encountered by a holistic supply chain in a given scenario. In this context, to quantify the risks in a supply chain, the researchers have formulated as a fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (FMAGDM) model, based on fuzzy FMEA and extended VIKOR methods to analyze the most feasible solution according to the selected risk parameters as per situation. The results of the present study depicted that disruption risk, financial risk, and legal/political regulations are the most significant and typical risk (ASC). A practical case study in an aviation sector of Pakistan is piloted to check the practicability of the suggested methodology. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model has been discussed by ranking risk alternatives in descending order. In order to check the robustness of results, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fruit plays an important role in tropical horticulture and has high commercial value in domestic and international markets. There are several factors affecting the quality of fruit in the supply chain, including type of fruit, storage, distribution, harvesting, and packaging. This research was conducted to analyze the current situation regarding quality assurance in the international supply chain of tropical fruits by developing a tool to assess the level of quality assurance and chain collaboration. A techno-managerial approach was used in this research; therefore, a three-axes model was developed as the techno-managerial model. The three axes consist of degree of quality assurance, classes of fruit (regarding risk of chemical residue and quality deterioration), and degree of chain collaboration. For this study, five situations were chosen at random by considering the different degrees (from lowest degree to highest degree) of quality assurance and chain collaboration for each class of fruit. The results show that 10%–60% of importers require their suppliers to comply with quality assurance standards in Situation 1 (low-risk fruits, low degree of quality assurance, and low degree of chain collaboration) and Situation 2 (medium-risk fruits, low degree of quality assurance, and low degree of chain collaboration). Almost 100% of imported fruits have permeable peels which are removed before consumption. This group of fruit has medium-high perishable rate. With different types of fruits, the importers set different requirements with respect to quality assurance. Regarding chain participation, the most common situation is Situation 1 (more than 60%), in which the retailer has the biggest influence. The most common situation for suppliers who supply the product to import companies falls into Situation 2. This means that most of the commodities have permeable peels, so the suppliers follow the basic quality assurance standards and are at the low level in chain co-operation. Lastly, considering the usefulness of the model, it can be employed as a good tool in assessing the situation in practice.</jats:p>"

We question this view by combining an epidemiological model, calibrated to capture the spread of the COVID-19 virus, with a multisector model, designed to capture key characteristics of the U.S. Input Output Tables. Our two-sector model features a core sector that produces intermediate inputs not easily replaced by inputs from the other sector, subject to minimum-scale requirements. We show that, by affecting workers in this core sector, the high peak of an infection not mitigated by social distancing may cause very large upfront economic costs in terms of output, consumption and investment. Social distancing measures can reduce these costs, especially if skewed towards non-core industries and occupations with tasks that can be performed from home, helping to smooth the surge in infections among workers in the core sector.</jats:p>"

The retailer considers the market demand to determine the order quantity; the manufacturer chooses how to reduce emissions according to the retailer’s order quantity. We consider four cases, including the non-emission abatement, the emission abatement of decentralized decision-making, the centralized decision-making and the retailer providing a cost-sharing contract. By comparing the four cases, we find that the case of a retailer providing a cost-sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain, achieving a Pareto improvement for the manufacturer and retailer. In addition, we use the Rubinstein bargaining model to determine the cost-sharing ratio. Finally, numerical simulations are given to analyze the impact of the cost-sharing ratio on the equilibrium results, including the profit and the emission abatement level. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the cost-sharing ratio and consumers’ low-carbon awareness on the profits of the members in the supply chain. We find that the equilibrium results, including the order quantity, the emission abatement level and the profits of the members in the supply chain under contract, are higher than the ones under centralized decision-making. The results show that in the higher low-carbon awareness market, retailers should formulate a reasonable cost-sharing ratio to achieve emission reduction coordination.</jats:p>"

The business processes analyzed by using supply chain management approach. This study conducted a qualitative method based on interview and observation. Results of the study show that the pattern of MSME supply chains in Sambirejo Village is still relatively simple. In their processes, these MSME supply raw materials from suppliers or distributors of raw materials then process them. Afterwards, they distribute them to consumers using two different distribution methods (dual channel) there are distribute it directly and through an intermediary.Keywords: business process; UMKM; supply chain management</jats:p>"

The analysis covered expenses incurred by business entities on purchase thereof and supply by the entity. Data used in the study came from secondary sources published in studies by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), the Polish Chamber of Insurance (PIU) and the Central Statistical Office (GUS). Furthermore, information from the studies-related literature has been included. The time period of studies covered the years 2005–2018. Selected types of insurance included in financial insurance have been presented herein and industries which these products are especially targeted at have been indicated. Moreover, supply by entities has been discussed with an indication of insurers who hold a leading position in the financial insurance sales in Poland. It has been stated that the demand (by value) for financial insurance in the years 2005–2018 was growing. The amount of the gross premium written in 2018 was twice as high as in 2005 and amounted to PLN 1.09 billion. Furthermore, it has been determined that the highest average dynamics of market growth concerned insurance from various financial risks (group 16), which are usually offered jointly with other insurance products, but also the dynamics of expenses incurred on purchasing surety was over 200%, whereas, in 2018 it was even 360%.</jats:p>"

We analyze a coal mining union health insurance program in 1950s Appalachia with and without a complementary hospital construction program. Our results show that the union insurance alone increased hospital births and reduced infant mortality. Once the union hospitals opened, however, the insurance and the hospitals together substantially increased the net amount of hospital beds and health care employees, with limited crowd-out of existing private hospitals.

Increasing the distance between the producer and the consumer results not only in certain problems in maintaining profitability by small, local producers, but also in a threat to food safety. One way to counteract these adverse effects is to sell food through short supply chains. They shape the market in the direction of maintaining care for the sustainable development of all food production, but above all, maintaining and strengthening the production capacity ensuring the transparency of the high-quality food production process from an identifiable source of origin. The purpose of this article is to indicate the conditions on the side of both carp producers and consumers, conducive to building short supply chains, and determine whether they can be an effective alternative sales model in Polish conditions. The article focuses on the possibilities of developing short supply chains on the carp market in the Barycz Valley, concentrating the largest area of carp ponds in Europe. The research (surveys) included the five largest fishing farms and, on the recipient side, individual consumers and restaurants located in the Barycz Valley and Wrocław, and agritourism facilities in the researched area. The obtained results confirmed that short supply chains in the area of Polish aquaculture are characterized by high implementation potential. However, it is necessary to modify the current sales model so that the producers’ expectations regarding the sales volume and the obtained price are balanced with the expectations of consumers articulating the will to buy fish at a given time, place, and price. This, in turn, will ensure the high economic efficiency of fishing farms, and consumers will have access to a high-quality product.</jats:p>"

Using the panel data approach, we show that local banks positively influence the supply of credit unlike foreign and African banks. Foreign banks, on the other hand, have a negative influence on the supply of credit in Ivory Coast. In addition, the results highlight the positive impact of growth and market share on the supply of credit to the private sector. On the other hand, the size of banks and the inflation rate are unfavourable to the supply of credit in Ivory Coast. The study suggests that local banks should be strengthened so that they can provide more financing to the Ivorian economy.</jats:p>"

The catastrophic socio-economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill-strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent social-to-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ∼80% reduction in healthcare demands – beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>COVID-19 Medical Demand Forecast</jats:title><jats:p><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://eece.wustl.edu/chakrabarty-group/covid/\">https://eece.wustl.edu/chakrabarty-group/covid/</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec>"

One of the practices that must be modified is the generation of large volumes of Municipal Solid Waste [MSW] that results from a linear production process. Traditional supply chains are jointly responsible for this problem. A circular production process in which the consumption of natural resources is reduced is possible through Reverse Supply Chains. For this, it is necessary to have tools for the sustainable design of MSW recovery networks. The objective of this work is to propose a systems engineering procedure that serves this purpose. The main contribution is the proposal of an explicit and concrete way to conceptually design RSC, useful for decision makers. The procedure consists of four interconnected stages that constitute an interactive system that allow the design from the problem formulation to its validation. The procedure is applied to design a RSC for MSW in the Mexican municipality of Netzahualcoyotl. The designed RSC can move a volume of 420 tons of MSW per day in an urban area of just 50 square kilometers. The scope of this work is a conceptual design that still requires field testing to validate the estimated results and make a feedback process that allows strengthening the conceptual design procedure.</jats:p>"

The authors find that suitable FPIs to measure SCC for shareholders’ value are return-on-assets (ROA), days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and current ratio (CR). This means that higher ROA, shortened DSO, and an appropriate level of CR could reach a sustainable supply chain. These results will help the industry to avert a major disruption in supply chain processes and activities using suitable financial performance indicators.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a deep understanding of the historical development, path dependency and current status of the EU-28 residential heat sectors to inform strategy and policy makers and to open up this black box. Data is combined for buildings, installed technologies, fuel consumption and energy supply for Member States from 1990 to 2015, to analyse the importance of large-scale infrastructures and supply chains. Primary energy supply for residential heating is mainly based on fossil fuels; 70% in 2015 with 69% imported. The building level technologies are dominated by non-condensing boilers and stoves. Primary and final energy consumption decreased in spite of an increase in the total occupied living area in most countries. Path-dependency effects are found in the residential heat supply in EU. The analysis show path-dependent trajectories are present in most Member States, especially regarding natural gas infrastructure. The period shows many options for decarbonisation are not used to the full potential, e.g., energy efficiency in buildings, district heating, heat pumps. Past experiences should be considered when developing new decarbonisation strategies in Member States and on the EU level.</jats:p>"

It is known that the limit of comfort is the temperature of 26 oC. To reduce the temperature, use air conditioners, which are required 0,3...0,5 kW of electrical power for 10 m2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof housing. The study deals with the capture of solar energy by water and its use for domestic water purposes (DHW).\r\nThe goal of the research. Experimental verification of patented developments and calculations of hot water quantity obtained per day, energy savings and economic indicators.\r\nMethods of implementation. Experiments were conducted on the south window of the room, with water pumping by a pump and periodic measurement of air and water temperatures at the outlet of the system by mercury thermometer. The calculations were performed using the methods developed by the authors. The studies were conducted within three days of November. The temperature inside ranged a room from 19 to 23 °C. The system was operated in circulating mode on a water battery tank located below the absorber. Isolation of the absorber from the side of the room was made of a transparent food film.\r\nResearch results. Water temperature reached 45 °C per 1,5-2 hours. Water consumption is enhanced by the thermosiphon effect when water moves from the bottom up. On a clear day of spring and autumn, you can heat for 50-70 % more water than the average for the average day of months of the warm season. For preparing DHW with 1 m2 of absorber, it is possible to get 45-50 kW∙h of heat for each month from March to September, taking into account cloudiness. The savings from the use of hot water and from reducing the consumption of electricity in the air conditioner are calculated.\r\nConclusions. The payback period of the system, taking into account the cost of the heat for DHW and electricity savings for an electric air conditioner, is approximately 4-5 years. The cost of the system is close to the cost of a home air conditioner, for a premise with a single window oriented south. To the energy-saving factor, an additional advantage is the environmental friendliness of the system compared to the air conditioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

Different Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)-based models have been considered (Reorder Point, Reorder Point with pipeline on order inventory, and “pulse train”). Simulation system evaluates annual total logistics costs. Results show that in an environment, where local warehouse inventory levels are rather high and replenishment order quantity is rather small, it is important have frequent shipments divided in suitable intervals. In simulation model, this could be done e.g. with the use of “pulse train” function or incorporating pipeline on order inventory in order decision. The research findings are valid for a small-scale supply chain servicing small and geographically limited markets with clients assuming high customer service levels (e.g. 24-hours lead time). For bigger markets, the cross-docking based supply chain models are worth considering in simulations.</jats:p>",

The retailer is responsible for all online and offline channels’ orders, and the manufacturer gives the retailer a fixed fee. We construct a mathematical function model and analyze the greenness and pricing strategies of centralized and decentralized settings through the retailer Stackelberg game model. Due to the effects of the double marginalization of supply chain members, we adopt a simple contract to coordinate the green supply chain.

Alternative short supply chains for organic products are considered when seeking optimal scenarios to obtain the highest profit for producers, with maximizing profit being one of the main reasons for taking up business within this type of supply chain strategy. The aim of this study was to clarify the ideas of short food supply chains (SFSCs) and the organic production of food products and to indicate how economic benefits can be achieved in individual markets. The identified research gaps include the lack of a strong theoretical basis, as well as the lack of empirical studies concerning the multi-objective optimization of the economic effects of producers using computer simulation methods. However, the aim of this research was to identify the activities within such structures that can produce economic effects and influence the competences and soft relationships between the organizations participating in the chains. The adopted research methods included a critical analysis of the literature and the use of information technology tools and computer simulation. We found that computer simulation methods can lead to better decisions (to increase manufacturer benefits) regarding how to service selected markets within the SFSC. The most important limitations are the small territorial scope of the research and the consideration of only three of the most frequently purchased and manufactured products in Poland. This study was a pilot study, which will be developed further by the authors, from both a territorial and product point of view.</jats:p>"

Also, increasing the level of energy efficiency of the energy supply system is one of the important strategies to slow down the growth of demand and mitigate the negative impact on health, the economy and the environment. The article considers the integrated use of energy, the introduction of energy hubs as part of future energy networks and proposes a schematic diagram of an integrated energy supply system.

According to the results of the study, it is established that the schedule of SES generation and the schedule of electricity consumption by ventilation and air conditioning systems are similar, which leads to a reduction in operating costs and a reduction in the load on the building's power supply system. The scientific substantiation of the integration of the energy storage system into the energy supply structure has been further developed, which will ensure the reliability of the power supply and the efficiency of the solar power plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

This study uses experimental data with multiple non-linear regression techniques and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) models that are applied to introduce practical equations that can be used for design. Results show that the GEP method is superior to the regression analysis for predicting the discharge coefficient. Performance criteria for GEP are R2 = 0.995, RMSE = 0.021 and MAE = 0.015. Design examples are presented that show that the proposed GEP equation correlates well with the data and eliminates linear interpolation using existing graphs.</jats:p>",

The type of corn that would be produced is corn feed for poultry needs. Three agents are involved in this agent-based model: the farmers (or cooperatives), PTPN VIII, and the buyers of the corn yields. All agents face risks in doing their businesses which hamper or reduce their probability of achieving their business goals. The potential risks are identified using fuzzy reasoning method. The three blocks of farmland have different levels of fertility. Farmers are expected to compete for the hunt of farmland to rent for cultivating corns, until their funds run out. They must prepare the land, procure their best corn seeds, plant and maintain the crops, and eventually harvest, dry and sell their corn yield. The dryness of the corn grains dictates the selling price. The buyers will buy the corns until their demands are fulfilled for the particular season. There will be a negotiation process between agents to reach an agreement. Each agent seeks to achieve its goal. This is why agent-based modelling is employed. Netlogo software is used to develop the model. Based on fuzzy reasoning method the obtained result shows that the most potential risk is quality risk. The negotiation results show that when both buyer and seller experience heightened degree of risk appetite, the shortest negotiations are achieved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, trust is one of the key factors that ensures the acceptable mechanisms of economic and social relationships. It is not only an element of correct communication, but also a factor in inter-organizational bonds and a source of social dialogue. Trust has become a factor in the creation of value, as well as a key component of the conceptualization and operationalization of business models. It has revealed many problems at the strategic level, in the water sector in particular. From this perspective, trust is a major factor of strategies, models, and business processes which are currently being built. New types of business models that emerge have also started to include trust as part of their configuration. This is the case in the construction and implementation of social business models. A social business model can be understood as a business model whose factors that stimulate development include social aspects expressed in balancing economic, environmental, and social issues with the involvement of communities and their dynamic communication focused on the selected attributes of business models that stimulate growth and that are conducive to achieving success, expressed by economic and/or social profit. The satisfaction of stakeholders with such a solution is another condition for embedding this solution in the sphere of the social economy. In this approach, trust, which stimulates the growth of social and economic value in the component structure of the social business model, becomes particularly important. The aim of the paper is to present the place and role of trust as a key component of social business models. The scope of the paper includes research into public water sector industry companies located in the Province of Silesia and their social business models, with a focus on defining the position of trust among other attributes of these business models. The authors put forward a hypothesis that trust is a crucial component of the social business models of water supply companies that operate at the intersection of the market and social economy. Trust also helps companies from the water supply sector achieve both social and economic effects. It also becomes a source of reverse market polarization, where the value of a social business model materializes to create social and environmental effects without detriment to the economic effects.</jats:p>"

The duality of the mode of coordination of the suppliers depends on the relationship between the architect and the first-tier suppliers, according to the strategic degree of their competence. The contribution of this paper is to illuminate the plasticity, the adaptation of the purchasing strategy. The purchasing strategy therefore adapts to the nature of the equipment or systems outsourced, the stakes and expectations are not at all the same. The more complex the product manufactured by the subcontractor, the more the purchasing strategy will seek the mastery of a particular skill. The more standard the product, the more the purchasing strategy aims at reducing costs. The purpose of this paper is twofold. We will show, on the one hand, that there is within the same productive organization a duality of modes of coordination, On the other hand that there is an interaction between the purchasing strategy and these different modes of coordination.</jats:p>",

We resolve the equilibrium feedback control strategies with no fairness concern retailer, gap fairness concern retailer, and self-due fairness concern retailer. We find only under a specific condition, the feedback Markov equilibrium exists, and the expected return rate would approach to the stable state, regardless of the fairness type the retailer is. The equilibrium prices are decreasing over the return rate, and the equilibrium collecting control strategy is increasing over the return rate. The increasing of stochastic disturbance intensity can be beneficial to the supply chain members. The manufacturer should shift profit to the retailer since the retailer is fairness concern. By the comparison analysis, we find the gap fairness concern retailer is more aggressive, while the self-due fairness concern retailer is more reasonable for both the manufacturer and the retailer. Furthermore, we design a hybrid coordinate contract for the manufacturer to coordinate with the retailer.</jats:p>"

Performance and its evaluation can be considered as necessary conditions for the success of an organization, they constitute a field of research oriented by a strong demand from practitioners to develop best practices to improve the overall performance of the company. Supply Chain Management is a key strategic factor in rising corporate success in a global economy, challenging and complex climate. As consequence, supply chain performance evaluation has become one of the most interesting research areas focused on providing guidance to practitioners in selecting the appropriate performance model for the supply chain management. This article presents the results of the questionnaire survey, which aimed at identifying the most relevant supply chain performance assessment models used by the Moroccan industrial sector. To achieve the main propose of this study, the methodology used includes an empirical survey analysis using a questionnaire and statistical tools. The empirical survey was conducted among a sample of 120 Moroccan industrial companies during October, November and December 2019. Data gathered through an e-mail survey, face-to-face interviews and telephone interviews to approach companies by using a structured questionnaire. This study follows the design survey research methodology. Thus, we initially approach the selection and presentation of the adopted methods. Then, we present the sample selection phase, the mode of questionnaire administration and the data collection, and finally, the interpretation of research results. The findings showed that the lack of unanimity among Moroccan industrial companies on the appropriate approach to assessing supply chain performance, justified by the complexity of their own supply chains as organizational configurations, coupled with the complexity of their management approaches.</jats:p>"

The aim of the research was to explore the feasibility of setting up new donkey farming systems to supply the rising demand for ejiao using a system dynamics model of donkey production. Results show that the size of the initial female breeding herd, reproductive performance, age of reproduction, percentage of female births and average breeding life of donkeys are key variables affecting the time to build up the donkey population to supply the demand for hides, which will be at least ten to fifteen years. The implications of this are: (i) prices for donkey hides will continue to increase, (ii) companies producing ejiao will use other ingredients, (iii) China will continue to source donkey hides from around the world, and (iv) there will be continued theft and illegal trade of donkeys and concerns for rural households reliant on donkeys for their livelihoods and adverse impacts on donkey welfare.</jats:p>"

Their application is to supply a step-up current transformer for generation of the distorted current required to test the transformation accuracy of the distorted currents of the inductive current transformers. The proposed equations allow to calculate the maximum rms values of higher harmonic of distorted currents for its required main harmonic component. Moreover, they also enable the calculation of the maximum rms values of the main harmonic of the distorted current for which the required higher harmonic component may be obtained. This defines the usable bandwidth of the tested power source for their specific load. During work on high inductive impedance, the maximum voltage is the limitation that determines the higher harmonic value. While for resistive loads, the maximum current and the transistor’s slew rate are the limiting factors. The usage of the compensation system for the inductive reactance of the step-up current transformer under supply significantly increased its maximum output current. Its rms value with a 10% higher harmonic component up to 5 kHz was almost 400 A instead 100 A for the PWM-based power source and about 800 A instead 200 A for the power supply system with the audio amplifier.</jats:p>"

Digital worker reporting tools present unprecedented opportunities for lead firms to reach out directly to hard-to-reach workers for feedback on their working conditions via their mobile phone. These new technologies promise an efficient and cost-effective way to cut through the complexity of global production, gathering unmediated data on working conditions directly from workers at scale. As the market for these tools grows, this paper contextualises their emergence within the broader political economy of supply chain governance. It presents three sets of concerns about their use that must be addressed by businesses, investors, donors and governments that develop or utilise these tools. First, the quality of data gathered by these tools may be inadequate to reliably inform decision-making. Second, global brands may gather large quantities of worker data to identify legal, reputational and financial risks without addressing structural causes of exploitation or delivering outcomes for workers. Third, large scale collection of data from workers creates new risks for workers’ wellbeing and safety.</jats:p>"

However, a combination of policies that cuts across the land–cattle–market nexus is necessary to obtain a consumption level that almost meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for recommended animal protein intake.

The purpose of this study is to determine the current condition of the company's SCM and then analyze the value of the performance of green supply chain management and propose improvements to the company after knowing the most influential indicators in order to improve the performance of green supply management in the company. Based on the problems studied, the method used in the study is to measure the performance of the company's supply chain using the Supply Chain Operation References (SCOR) method. The initial hierarchy model of performance measurement is adjusted to the condition of the company to measure the performance of its supply chain, while the normalization of Snorm De Boer serves to equalize the matrix value used as an indicator of measurement. The importance of performance attributes is measured based on weighting with subjective questionnaires using AHP. SCM Conditions of PT.

The purpose of this paper is to provide regulators with systematic evidence on firm specific characteristics associated with reporting delay.

Together with OLS regression, we examine the association between reporting delay and firm characteristics (e.g., size, complexity, governance) that capture the supply and demand for timely audited financial reports. We choose a period immediately prior to the FMA enforcement of reporting delays to capture the voluntary choice of reporting timeliness by managers.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The audit lag (i.e. balance date to preliminary announcement to the NZX) is longer than the report lag (i.e. preliminary announcement date to the issuance of the report to the NZX). We find that audit risk factors (leverage and finance firms) and busy reporting period are associated with longer audit lag. Whereas, having a Big 4 auditor and an interim review reduces annual audit lag. Investor demand factors are associated with a shorter report lag. Firms with a loss and more segments have a shorter report lag, while firms with high market to book ratio have a longer report lag. These are consistent with agency and proprietary cost explanations. The interim report lag is only seven days shorter than the annual lag. The determinants of annual report lag provide weak explanations for the interim report lags.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Although all listed companies are sampled, the small sample size reduces the power of the analysis and may limit finding significant results at conventional levels.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The factors associated with reporting delays could be used by regulators as red flags to identify abnormal reporting delays. Interim reporting lags appear excessively relative to annual report lags. Therefore, regulators should investigate the reasons for the lack of timeliness of interim reports.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Report timeliness is an important, but often overlooked, component of accounting quality.

However, prior evidence on reporting delay in New Zealand is pre-IFRS and pre-recent regulatory reforms (such as the formation of the FMA). Hence, our contribution is to provide more contemporary-relevant evidence. We also distinguish between ARL and the financial report lag and found that different firm characteristics drive these lags.

The integrated water management practices such as reuse of water and the selected future scenarios are proposed to decrease and manage the unmet water demand of the city. Hence, future predicted scenarios which is the combination of the external factors (i.e. population growth rate and living standard) and water management strategies were considered. From the analyzed scenarios, optimistic future strategies will support the management of the existing water supply and demand system of the city. Similarly, in the integrated management strategies scenario, it was assumed that measures were taken at both the demand and supply side to improve the efficiency of water in the entire chain. Thus, if the water sector professionals and other concerned bodies consider the selected scenarios, it will go a long way to solve the water shortage problem in the city, and this will also help to promote sustainable water management.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The evapotranspiration losses due to water use in the warm months of the year are high for walnut production, for example, which is one of the main Iranian agricultural exports. Also, the water losses occurring in flood irrigation, surface storage, and water conveyance, and the high costs of drip irrigation increase the need for efficient irrigation methods. This study proposes induction irrigation as a novel method for preventing evapotranspiration losses, increasing water-use efficiency, and raising agricultural profitability. Induction irrigation relies on recharge and extraction wells to inject treated sewage and withdraw groundwater, respectively, and create a saturated zone in the plants' root area. This paper demonstrates that induction irrigation applied to walnut orchards would lower costs and water losses, avoid surface pollution, and increase agricultural profitability.</jats:p>",

In order to ensure the sustainability of economic development, China pays more attention to the role of science and technology in promoting the sustainability of the private economy. Based on a sample of all A-share listed companies in the Chinese capital market, we distinguished between government and non-government purchase order data, and examined the impact of large government background customers on private enterprise R&amp;D innovation from the perspective of supply chain risk transmission. Due to the implementation of China’s new accounting standards and the delay in the public update of government procurement data, we selected samples from 2007‒2015. The research results show that the government background customers can significantly increase the R&amp;D investment of private enterprises, and this relationship is more significant in the sample of mid-level government background customers and private enterprises in poor areas; further analysis found that government background purchase orders can promote innovation investment by mitigating the risks facing a company. From a practical point of view, the research findings of this paper are helpful for understanding the impact of customer structure on the innovation activities of enterprises in a market economy environment.</jats:p>"

The task becomes very challenging when the water demand exceeds the available water resources reserves. To address this pervasive allocation problem related to transboundary rivers, the bankruptcy method is used. The bankruptcy method distributes water among riparian states when their total demand exceeds the total available water. This paper describes a new methodology for the allocation of scarce water resources in a complex system using a stochastic game theory which is an extension of bankruptcy theory. The authors have also proposed ‘weighted bankruptcy’ approach that can be used under a stochastic setting. The weighted bankruptcy approach favors agents with ‘high agricultural productivity’. The bankruptcy rules have been applied in the water resource system in four critical scarcity scenarios. The available water is allocated under the simple and weighted bankruptcy rules. The results showed that under all four scenarios, the weighted bankruptcy rules favor the agents which have a high agricultural productivity. The stochastic bankruptcy approach under the simple and the weighted bankruptcy rules can provide important strategic information for better management and sustainable sharing of water resources.</jats:p>",

These ethical malpractices may damage the state agenciesâ€™ performance; undermine public confidence in governmentsâ€™ leadership and governance. The purpose of the study was to analyze the influence of ethical sourcing practices on performance of Teachers Service Commission of Kenya. The study's objectives were to examine the influence of transparency practices on TSC performance, assess influence of integrity practices on performance of TSC and, to evaluate influence of accountability practices on performance of TSC. The study was guided by three theories namely: Deontological theories-Kantian ethics, Teleological theories-utilitarianism and Dynamic capabilities theory. The target population comprised of 1351 TSC secretariat staff from among seven TSC directorates and Supply Chain Management Services (SCMS). Stratified proportionate sampling was used to select a sample of 239 employees. A descriptive research design was adopted in the study. Data was collected using a semi - structured questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Presentation was in form of percentages, frequencies, and tables. Key findings of study included: A response rate of 96.2 % was realized found to be adequate and sufficient to undertake data analysis. Majority of the respondents strongly agreed that the commission had embraced ethical sourcing practices (Transparency, integrity and accountability) and had consequently improved its customerâ€™s satisfaction levels. The study recommends adoption of ethical sourcing practices by organizations so as to optimize their operations. The researcher recommends a similar study on other organizations both private and public based on the studyâ€™s findings, shareholders, management and policy makers in the public service sector and other sectors can make informed decisions on the ethics and organization performance. To uphold research ethics, permission to collect data was sought from the University, NACOSTI as well as Teachersâ€™ service commission.

Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.</jats:p>"

The growing number of older people increases the pressure on health and care services as well as on family caregivers. Adult children are important care-providers in their parents’ final years. This study investigates how having a parent in need of care affects sons’ and daughters’ labour market participation. The question is investigated by analysing longitudinal data from the Norwegian life course, ageing and generation study. The empirical strategy is first to use register information about parents’ demise as an indicator for amplified care needs in the period prior to their death and explore patterns in labour market participation (employment and earnings) before and after the death of a parent. Then, register data are combined with survey data in order to separate caregivers from non-caregivers prior to the loss of a parent. The analyses show a negative employment trend in the years before and after the loss of a lone parent. They also show a different development in earnings between caregivers and non-caregivers. Caregivers have a weaker development in earnings both before and after the death of their parent compared to non-caregivers. The study concludes that caring for older parents has a negative impact on the children’s labour market participation in both the period with substantial caregiving needs and the period following the parents’ demise.</jats:p>",

Through the comparative analysis of equilibrium results, it is found that the optimal strategies of suppliers and manufacturers as well as the total revenue of the green supply chain in the cooperative games are better than those in the non-cooperative game scenario. Meanwhile, undertaking part of suppliers’ green innovation cost by manufacturers is the Pareto optimization mechanism that increases the total revenue of the green supply chain and their respective revenues. The research results of this article provide theoretical support for green supply chain enterprises to formulate incentive mechanisms for scientific strategy-making and reasonable revenue distribution. </jats:p>",

The relevance of the research is justified by a changing economic environment in which money and other financial assets can act in a digital form. The objective of the study is to describe the possible changes in the money supply with adding digital financial assets to the household portfolio with the use of endoteric approach. We use the post-Keynesian postulates, in particular, horizontalizm, to describe the process of endogenous money creation by the banking system through lending. The underlying methodology is based on the use of stock-flow consistent (SFC) modeling approach. Unlike previous research, the article considers a wider range of financial instruments in portfolios of macroeconomic agents, which made it possible to specify the demand for credit more fully. It is concluded that the adding “new” digital financial assets to portfolios is likely to affect the expansion of savings diversification, rather than endogenous money supply. The importance of real output and disposable income growth for changing in savings, investments and the demand for credit is outlined.</jats:p>",

During this period, highly efficient internal combustion engines emerged as the new propulsion system instead of steam turbines.

The purpose of this study was to develop a system configuration and a control method of methane number adjustment using combined cascade/feed-forward controllers for marine Otto-cycle engines to improve reference tracking and the disturbance rejection. The main principle involves controlling the downstream gas temperature of the fuel gas supply system to meet the required methane number. Three controllers are used in the combined cascade/feed-forward control for adjusting the downstream of the gas temperature: the cascade loop has two controllers and the feed-forward has one controller. The two controllers in the cascade loop are designed with proportional–integral (PI) controllers. The remaining controller is based on feed-forward control theory. A simulation was conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method, focusing on the disturbance rejection and set-point tracking, in comparison with a single PI controller, a single PI controller with feed-forward, and cascade control.</jats:p>"

Also there are subdivisions of customs authorities on their territory. This type of business activity provides the business entities with the comprehensive service and enables them to reduce the time spent moving to each of the necessary control services or logistics facilities when moving cargoes in different customs regimes. Therefore, it is proposed to apply the concept of logistics chain reliability with a freight customs complex as its element. The latter will take into account business entities` financial and time expenditures with non-productive timing at the different transition stages of material flow, and will enable to optimize information flows. The paper considers the procedure of placing imported goods in a temporary storage warehouse.

The generalized algorithm for constructing a reliability model of a freight customs complex`s operation is offered allowing to determine the reliability level of each individual element in a logistics chain.</jats:p>"

It is found that its change affects the level of current harmonics of all types of the studied greenhouse irradiators. With decrease of nominal supply voltage by 10 %, the total harmonic distortion THDi decreases by 9 % for emitters equipped with high pressure sodium lamps (HPSL), by 10 % for emitters with electrode-less lamps and by 3 % for LED based emitters. With increase of nominal supply voltage by 10 %, THDi increases by 23 % for lighting devices equipped with HPSL, by 10 % for irradiators with electrode-less lamps and by 3 % for LED based emitters. Therefore, changes of supply voltage cause the least effect on the level of current harmonics of LED based emitters and then the emitters with electrode-less lamps. Change of the level of supply voltage causes the greatest effect on the level of current harmonics of HPSL based irradiators. Mathematical models of dependence of THDi on the level of supply voltage for greenhouse emitters equipped with LED, electrode-less lamps and HPSL lamps were formulated. These mathematical models may be used for calculations of total current when selecting transformers and supply cable lines for greenhouse lighting devices, for design of new or reconstruction of existing irradiation systems of greenhouse facilities, and for calculation of power losses in power supply networks of greenhouse facilities during feasibility studies for energy saving and energy efficiency increasing projects.</jats:p>",

In-depth qualitative research with workers before, during, and after BWL reveals the root causes underlying noncompliance. Findings indicate that improvements across a number of compliance areas are enabled by collective worker voice mechanisms established by BWL at the factory level. Workers also highlight additional positive impacts of these improvements beyond the workplace.

Moreover, the retailer’s optimal order quantity, expected utility and coordinating wholesale price are decreasing in loss aversion and confidence levels, respectively. We also find that when the contract parameters are restricted, the combined contract may coordinate the supply chain even though neither of its component contracts coordinate the chain.</jats:p>"

However, the recommended temperature range of 300–500 °C has led to confounding results on the maintenance of the nitrogen (N) supply ability of CM after carbonization, and thus requires further investigation. The objective of this study was to identify an upper limit (threshold) temperature to guide the carbonization of CM in order to ensure that the good N supply ability of the manure after carbonization is preserved. CM was carbonized at 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, and 475 °C. Afterwards, chemical properties, surface functional groups, N speciation, N supply ability, and their relationships were investigated. The results indicated that the N supply ability of CM carbonized at 350–375 °C was comparable to the N supply ability of CM, which is possibly due to the minute alteration of the chemical properties, surface functionality, and N speciation that occurred in CM at these temperatures. At ≥400 °C, the N supply ability of CM was significantly reduced due to the increasing alterations of the chemical makeup as heating temperature increased. For sustainable maintenance of the good N supply ability of CM after carbonization, the manure should not be carbonized above 375 °C.</jats:p>"

The scheme of the integrated water supply system of Kremenchuk was built to calculate reliability, which reflects the movement of water from the source to the consumers and the main structures of the water supply system.  The work of the water supply system of Kremenchuk and its structure is analyzed.  In terms of reliability, it is concluded that water pipes are the least reliable element. The statistics on the failures of the water supply systems of the city of Kremenchuk are analyzed.  The calculations showed that the actual failure rate for steel pipes d = 1100 mm of water pipes in Kremenchug is 2 failures per 10 km of steel pipe per year, which is 2 times higher than foreign and domestic data. The reliability assessment of both the integrated and district water supply system of Kremenchuk was performed on the failure of water supply systems for both separately connected individual elements.  Comparative analysis of reliability of the integrated and district water supply system of Kremenchuk without fail has shown that the zoning significantly increases the reliability of water supply in the Kryukivsky district, and the reliability of water supply of the Avtozavodsky district remains unchanged. In the integrated system in the Kryukiv district, the parameter of the flow of failures was  1/year, that is, about 3 times a year a break in water supply is possible. In the district system, both systems operate independently, which is why everything remains unchanged in the Avtozavodsky district, and the failure flow parameter for the Kryukivsky district is significantly reduced and is:  1/year, which corresponds to a water supply interruption of about once every 2.5 years.  Thus, zoning can increase the reliability of water supply in the Kryukovsky district of Kremenchuk approximately 8 times.\nKeywords: the water supply system, reliability, dependability, zoning.</jats:p>",

In Brazil, 11% of the population inhabits the semiarid, and despite several mitigation measures taken by the State, it is still ranked as the most vulnerable Brazilian region and potentially the most affected by climate change. Throughout Brazilian history several public policies focused on water supply in the semiarid region have failed for different reasons. Two recurring arguments are the lack of financial resources and poor management. This work presents an analysis of a public policy that aims to provide quality and perennial water by desalting local brackish groundwater, the Programa Água Doce (PAD). We used the ecodevelopment theory to discuss the economic sustainability of the policy. The methodology used was a documental analysis, and a literature review to understand PAD’s main strengths and weaknesses. We found that the continuous flow of public and private investment was a decisive element to the implementation of the technology during the initial transference of responsibilities moment. In addition, by the gradual reduction of public investment, the management of the systems became local and funded by private resources from the beneficiaries. The PAD presents, in its dynamics, advances in the field of the dissemination of water treatment technologies and social technologies, especially in relation to the Management Agreements. However, the lack of processes for community empowerment and no strengthening of cooperativism resulted in disconnected systems that were not able to ensure economic sustainability.</jats:p>"

The quality traits of the mono-varietal pasta obtained from each management zone were assessed in view of site-specific pasta production for a short supply chain. To this purpose, semolina from cv. Biensur obtained from management zones with different fertility treated with N at variable rate was tested in comparison with a commercial reference (cv. Aureo) to produce short-cut pasta. Biensur semolina demonstrated to have technological characteristics positively correlated with the low-fertility zones treated with high N doses (200 and 200+15 kg/ha) and, to a lesser extent, with the high-soil-fertility zones (130 and 130 + 15 kg/ha of N). The lower quality parameters were obtained for pasta produced with wheat from medium-fertility zones, independently of the N dose applied. The derived pasta obtained from the low-fertility zones treated with high N doses had cooking and sensory properties comparable to those of pasta obtained using the reference cv. Aureo. These results are explained by the higher amounts of gluten proteins and by a higher glutenin/gliadin ratio in semolina, which are indicators of technological quality. Overall, the results indicate that segregation of the grain at harvest led to the production of semolina with higher protein content and, hence, to a higher pasta quality. Therefore, site-specific pasta could be a potential asset for a short supply chain, aiming to improve traceability and environmental and economic sustainability.</jats:p>"

We investigated the impact of acute and chronic changes in carbon supply on inter-guild competition in two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), operated with (R1) and without (R0) external organic carbon supply. The microbial and nitrifying community composition of the reactors differed significantly. Interestingly, acute increases in the dissolved organic carbon inhibited nitrification in R1 ten times more than in R0. A sustained increase in the carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency and increased denitrification activity to a greater extent in R1, and also increased the proportion of potential denitrifiers in both bioreactors. The findings suggest that autotrophic biofilms subjected to increases in carbon supply show higher nitrification and lower denitrification activity than carbon-fed biofilms. This has significant implications for the design of nitrifying bioreactors. Specifically, efficient removal of organic matter before the nitrification unit can improve the robustness of the bioreactor to varying influent quality. Thus, maintaining a low C/N ratio is important in nitrifying biofilters when acute carbon stress is expected or when anoxic activity (e.g. denitrification or H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S production) is undesirable, such as in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).</jats:p>"

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA’s stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04/19/2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.</jats:p>"

However, research on end-use disaggregation from rudimentary data is limited. Rudimentary data is defined as data recorded in intervals longer than 1 min, or data recorded with resolutions larger than 0.1 L/pulse. Developing countries typically deal with rudimentary data, due to the high cost and high resource investment associated with high-resolution data. The aim of this study was to extract useful event characteristics from rudimentary data, without identifying the actual end-uses per se. A case study was conducted in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, where 63 homes were equipped with iPERL smart water meters. The meters recorded flow measurements every 15 s at a 1 L/pulse resolution, rendering the recorded data rudimentary. A total of 1,107,547 event pulses were extracted over the 217-day study period. Although the method presented is limited in the sense that water use events cannot be identified, the method allows for disaggregation of event pulses in the presence of rudimentary data. Using this tool, it is possible to lift valuable information from rudimentary data that would subsequently benefit service providers in setting water demand strategies.</jats:p>",

In order to limit further damage and wood value loss after natural calamities, high volumes of salvage wood have to be rapidly transported out of the forest. In these cases, robust decision support and coordinated management strategies based on advanced contingency planning are needed. Consequently, this study introduces a contingency planning toolbox consisting of a discrete event simulation model setup for analyses on an operational level, strategies to cope with challenging business cases, as well as transport templates to analyze outcomes of decisions before real, costly, and long-lasting changes are made. The toolbox enables wood supply managers to develop contingency plans to prepare for increasing risk events and more frequent natural disturbances due to climate change. Crucial key performance indicators including truck to wagon ratios, truck and wagon utilization, worktime coordination, truck queuing times, terminal transhipment volume, and required stockyard are presented for varying delivery time, transport tonnage, and train pick-up scenarios. The strategy BEST FIT was proven to provide robust solutions which saves truck and train resources, as well as keeps transhipment volume on a high level and stockyard and queuing time on a low level. Permission granted for increased truck transport tonnages was evaluated as a potential means to reduce truck trips, if working times and train pick-ups are coordinated. Furthermore, the practical applicability for contingency planning is demonstrated by highly relevant business cases such as limited wagon or truck availability, defined delivery quota, terminal selection, queuing time reduction, or scheduled stock accumulation. Further research should focus on the modeling and management of log quality deterioration and the resulting wood value loss caused by challenging transport and storage conditions.</jats:p>"

In this study, we introduce a strategy–structure–performance (SSP) framework to explore the mechanism through which proactive environmental strategies improve environmental performance by utilizing green supply chain integration. Based on the questionnaire survey data of 252 Chinese manufacturing firms, a structural equation model was established to verify our hypothesis. The results show that firms that implement a proactive environmental strategy tend to promote the green integration of suppliers through internal green integration and thus improve their environmental performance. By distinguishing two kinds of activities of green supplier integration (greening the supplier and environmental collaboration with the supplier), we found that environmental collaboration with the supplier can directly promote the environmental performance of manufacturing enterprises, but supplier greening indirectly enhances the environmental performance of enterprises through supplier environmental collaboration. The boundary conditions of the influence of internal green integration on green supplier integration are discussed, and we found that the relationship cability plays a moderating role in the influence of internal green integration on supplier green integration.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate concentrations were in the range of 0.180–0.510 mg/L, 0.0–0.178 mg/L, and 0.675–1.165 mg/L, respectively. The ammonium and nitrate concentrations were still below the maximum permissible concentrations for the river water quality standard of class II established by the Regulation Governor of West Sumatera at all of the sampling locations, except at midstream for ammonium, while the nitrite concentration had exceeded the quality standard from midstream to downstream of the river. The increase of the nitrogen concentration was observed from upstream to downstream of the river. Spatial analysis shows significant differences in nitrogen concentrations were obtained between the upstream and the midstream of the Batang Arau River (p &amp;lt; 0.05) but were not observed between the midstream and the downstream. This indicates the effect of different anthropogenic activities along the river. Based on the obtained results, for an effective monitoring program of the nitrogen concentration along the Batang Arau River, reducing the sampling locations from eight to five could be implemented.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the accuracy of T and S values based on sparse measurements is also examined. The Cooper–Jacob method and the recovery test method have been applied to obtain both T and S, and T values, respectively. Groundwater level measurements at Moudania aquifer, Chalkidiki, Greece, are used as an illustrative example. Our main conclusions are (a) assuming that pumping starts earlier than it actually does, leads to the underestimation of T and the overestimation of S, (b) transmissivity might be overestimated if the residual drawdown, due to previous pumping cycles, is substantial, (c) in recovery tests, the deviation of the straight line that fits the experimental points from the point (1,0) is an indication of residual drawdown, and (d) sparse measurements can offer reasonable estimates.</jats:p>",

Under the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), green infrastructure through the use of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) is the recommended policy to manage and treat storm water runoff. Given the limited published experimental information on permeable interlocking concrete block pavements (PICPs), this paper presents novel results from an experimental laboratory study on a permeable interlocking concrete block pavement rig, investigating the short-term hydrology of the pavement, and water quality aspects related to the retention capacity of suspended solids (SS) through the pavement structure. Results of the volume analysis demonstrate high capability of the permeable structure to reduce the concentration time and attenuate the storm. Water quality testing was employed mainly as an indicator of the tendency of the suspended solids retention by the structure, indicating increasing tendency in the sediment mass retention progressively after each rainfall event. Experimental results obtained in the present study have direct application on the implementation of PICPs in car parking lots, urbanised pavement structures and pedestrianised walkways.</jats:p>",

Based on system analysis of domestic and foreign traction power supply systems of railways and electric transport of large cities, the concept of their development is substantiated and proposed by increasing the supply voltage of traction substations and minimizing capacity upflows and energy losses, which provides resource and energy savings.\nIt is suggested that the investment programs of the structures that are part of Corporation «Ukrzaliznytsia» and the municipal services be synchronized according to their technological indicators, as well as according to the criteria of energy efficiency and quality of energy supply with similar investment programs of external energy. For reduction of energy losses, it is proposed: realization of rational schedule of train movement and deep high voltage inputs with the prospect of transition to own 110 kV distribution networks, modernization and equipping of modern rolling stock electrical equipment and infrastructure of the main and perspective directions of the railways.\nThe need to expand tram and trolleybus lines and modernize power supply devices in terms of resource conservation requires new technologies for the design, construction and operation of the facilities of municipal enterprise «Miskelektrotransservice». Such technologies have been implemented by the «DAK-Energetika» enterprise in the manufacture of modern electrical equipment of municipal enterprise «Miskelektrotransservice» TS.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background</jats:bold>: Injuries are a major public health problem globally. With sound planning and organization, essential trauma care can be reliably provided with relatively low-cost equipment and supplies. However, availability of these resources requires an effective and efficient supply chain and good stock management practices. Therefore, we study aimed to assess trauma care resource-related supply management structures and processes at health facilities in Ghana. By doing so, the findings may allow us to identify specific structures and processes that could be improved to facilitate higher quality and more timely care.<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: Ten hospitals were purposively selected using results from a previously performed national trauma care capacity assessment of hospitals of all levels in Ghana. Five hospitals with low resource availability and 5 hospitals with high resource availability were assessed using the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool and stock ledger review. Data were described and stock management practices were correlated with resource availability.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: There were differences in stock management practices between low and high resource availability hospitals, including frequency of reporting and audit, number of stock-outs on day of assessment (median 9 vs 2 stock-outs, range 3 – 57 vs 0 – 9 stock-outs, respectively; p=0.05), duration of stock-outs (median 171 vs 8 days, range 51 – 1,268 vs 0 – 182 days, respectively; p=0.02), and fewer of up-to-date stock cards (24 vs 31 up-to-date stock cards, respectively; p=0.07). Stock-outs were common even among low-cost, essential resources (e.g., nasal cannulas and oxygen masks, endotracheal tubes, syringes, sutures, sterile gloves). Increased adherence to stock management guidelines and higher percentage of up-to-date stock cards were correlated with higher trauma resource availability scores. However, the variance in trauma resource availability scores was poorly explained by these individual factors or when analyzed in a multivariate regression model (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.72; p value for each covariate between 0.17 – 0.34).<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Good supply chain and stock management practices are correlated with high trauma care resource availability. The findings from this study demonstrate several opportunities to improve stock management practices, particularly at low resource availability hospitals</jats:p>"

The proposed model aims to optimize the flow of materials in the supply chain network (SCN), and determine the amount and location of facilities and the planning of transportation in conditions of demand uncertainty. Thus, maximizing the total profit of operation, minimizing adverse environmental effects, and maximizing customer and supplier service levels have been considered as the main objectives. Accordingly, finding symmetry (balance) among the profit of operation, the environmental effects and customer and supplier service levels is considered in this research. To deal with the uncertainty of the model, scenario-based robust planning is employed alongside a meta-heuristic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the model with actual data from a case study of the steel industry in Iran. The results obtained from the model, solving and validating, compared with actual data indicated that the model could optimize the objectives seamlessly and determine the amount and location of the necessary facilities for the steel industry more appropriately.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transaction cost economics (TCE) is one of the most widely referenced organization theories in operations and supply chain management research. Even though TCE is a broadly applicable theory of governance, one of its specific topics of interest—the make‐or‐buy decision—readily aligns with some of the central research questions on how firms manage supply chains. However, both general management and operations management researchers sometimes misunderstand and misapply TCE's aims, assumptions, and logic. A common mistake is to read TCE as a theory of competence or of power. While TCE relates to both, TCE is essentially a theory of efficient governance of transactions in particular and exchange relationships in general. Our purpose in this study is to review the intellectual and theoretical foundations of TCE, its primary aims, and its applicability as a theory of supply chain efficiency. To this end, we discover much common ground between TCE and research in operations and supply chain management. We close by discussing implications for future research, focusing on how operations and supply chain management researchers could contribute to broader academic conversations on management and governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research paper aimed to design and present a sensitivity analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic-fuel-cell-battery (PV/FC/B) system to supply a small community for the recently planned grand city NEOM in Saudi Arabia. The location of the city of NEOM is characterized by a high average level of solar irradiance. The average daily horizontal solar radiation is around 5.85 kWh/m2. A detailed feasibility and techno-economic evaluation of a PV/FC/B hybrid energy system were done to supply a daily load demand of 500 kWh (peak-35 kW). The PV array was the main source to meet the load demand. During the surplus periods, the battery was charged using extra energy and powered the electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen was stored for later use. During the deficit periods, the FC and/or battery supported the PV array to meet the load demand. Two benchmarks, the cost of energy (COE) and net present cost (NPC), were used to identify the best size of the PV/FC/B system. Variation of the tilt angle of the PV array and the derating factor were considered to determine the effect of the performance of the PV/FC/B system’s COE and NPC. The main findings confirmed that a 200 kW PV array, 40 kW FC, 96 batteries, 50 kW converter, 110 kW electrolyzer, and 50 kg hydrogen tank was the best option to supply the load demand. The values of total NPC and COE were $500,823 and $0.126/kWh. The annual excess energy was very sensitive to the declination angle of the PV array. The minimum annual excess energy was achieved at an angle of 30 degrees. It decreased by 75.7% and by 60.6% compared to a horizontal surface and 50 degrees of declination, respectively. To prove the viability of the proposed system, a comparison with grid extension along with a diesel generation system was carried out.</jats:p>"

The highest concentrations of lithium were found to occur in subpermafrost water of the Lower Jurassic – Middle Cambrian aquifer system due to the presence of clay rocks. The ion exchange method was demonstrated experimentally to be capable of reducing lithium levels to the drinking water standard. A series of laboratory experiments performed by the author produced graphical curves of lithium removal from model solutions and natural subpermafrost waters. They also provided the kinetic and dynamic characteristics of the lithium removal process. In the course of the experimental studies on the subpermafrost water purification of casting by the ion exchange method, content of lithium reduced from 0.41 to 0.006 mg/L. The results of this study may be useful for developing subpermafrost water treatment schemes for drinking purposes</jats:p>",

However, a better coordination between food waste and safety policies is also needed, which requires: balancing the scientific evidence and the precautionary principle; reviewing current food safety regulations to identify areas potentially leading to avoidable waste; combining the monitoring of safety hazards and waste along the agri‐food chain; provision of tailored information on linkages between food safety and waste; and investment in technologies to accurately assess the edibility of food.

The high demand of soy sauce requires Company X, as producers, to ensure that consumer needs are always met. Therefore, it needs the help of many stakeholders, including suppliers and distributors to support the continuity of production. Since many members are involved, Company X needs to maintain the optimal performances. One of which is by applying supply chain risk management. This study aimed to identify and analyze supply chain risk in the soy sauce production process. Firstly, all activities carried out by supply chain members were mapped using Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) approach. Secondly, the potential risk of these activities was analyzed using House of Risk Phase 1 (HOR-1) method. 16 risk events and 19 risk agents were identified based on SCOR approach and HOR-1 method. Following the risk identification stage, the priority rank of risks was analyzed using Aggregate Risk Priority (ARP). The results showed that there were 5 priorities of risk agents required to be mitigated, i.e. human error, misorder of product, power outage, raw materials variants, and disruptions during product transportation. This study suggests risk mitigations as follows: to give rewards, punishments, and work motivation to workers; to alter and enhance SOP of ordering, storing, distributing, and supplier cooperations; to use electricity generator during the production process; to control the quality of raw materials; and to regularly maintain the distribution vehicle.</jats:p>",

In this study, physical model experiments were performed to investigate the uniform characteristics and energy dissipation of a hydraulic-jump-stepped spillway, which is a new type of stepped spillway for increasing the unit discharge capacity and energy dissipation. Based on the redefinition of uniform flow, experimental results show that at a given stepped spillway slope, a smaller height for the beginning of the uniform flow region, a greater uniform aerated flow depth and a greater uniform equivalent clear water flow depth can be obtained as compared with the traditional stepped spillway due to strong aeration in the aeration basin. Under the condition of uniform flow, the energy dissipation rate of stepped spillways can be estimated by the equivalent clear water flow depth with given inflow conditions. Compared with the traditional stepped spillway, the uniform flow over the hydraulic-jump-stepped spillway has a smaller specific energy, revealing that the hydraulic-jump-stepped spillway is more advantageous for dissipating energy, especially at large unit discharges.</jats:p>",

An ESUVT.01 type electronic control system developed by OOO PPP Dizelavtomatika (Saratov) for a D50 (6 ChN 31.8/33) locomotive diesel engine manufactured by Penzadizelmash is presented. It is shown that fuel efficiency and exhaust gas toxicity indicators can be significantly improved by optimizing the initial fuel supply phase, that is the injection advance angle. Experimental studies are conducted to assess the influence of this angle on the locomotive engine characteristics. Bench tests were carried out on a 1-PDG4D diesel generator consisting of the above-mentioned diesel engine and a traction generator MPT-84/39. As the result of the tests, dependencies of the diesel characteristics on the injection advance angle are obtained, and the need to optimize the injection advance angle according to the diesel operation mode is confirmed. Optimized values of the injection advance angle in the diesel characteristics modes are obtained. Fuel efficiency and exhaust gas toxicity indicators are determined at the optimized injection advance angle.</jats:p>",

It is known that the price of material and installation of the primary circuit collector is 30% of the total cost of the heat pump heating system. The use of a solar collector in the primary circuit of a heat pump eliminates the need for drilling or underground installation of a low-potential thermal energy collector. The rejection of the classic types of collectors: horizontal collectors and vertical probes, also has a positive environmental effect on the soil. The combined use of a solar collector and a heat pump will add variability in the layout of the heat pump heating system. The article presents the results of a theoretical study of the feasibility of operating solar collectors at the latitudes of the Republic of Tatarstan. A comparative analysis of various types of heat pump and solar collector is given, based on which the main components of the combined system were selected. The work includes calculations of the required power and surface area of the absorption of the solar collector. The results of a comparative analysis of the performance of the solar collector are presented, depending on the angle of incidence of sunlight and the average level of insolation. As a result of the work, it was determined that the use of a solar collector in the primary circuit of a heat pump will be twice cheaper compared to horizontal collectors and 4 times compared to vertical probes. </jats:italic></jats:p>"

This study focuses on uncertain bi‐objective supply chain network design problem with cost and environmental impacts under uncertainty. As such network may be designed for the first time in a geographical region, this problem is modelled by the concepts of belief degree‐based uncertainty theory. This article is almost the first study on belief degree‐based uncertain supply chain network design problem with environmental impacts. Two approaches such as expected value model and chance‐constrained model are applied to convert the proposed uncertain problem to its crisp form. The obtained crisp forms are solved by some multi‐objective optimization approaches of the literature such as TH, Niroomand, MMNV. A deep computational study with several test problems are performed to study the performance of the crisp models and the solution approaches. According to the results, the obtained crisp formulations are highly sensitive to the changes in the value of the cost parameters. On the other hand, Niroomand and MMNV solution approaches perform better than other solution approaches from the solution quality point of view.</jats:p>",

Such data structures can further complicate the assessment of nonresponse bias, which plays a key role in establishing the credibility of research results. A survey of 75 research articles with dyadic data, published in five empirically focused supply chain management academic journals, over the last decade, reveals a lack of agreement on methods used in the assessment for potential unit nonresponse bias. Of the various statistical tests found, only the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) approach allows for a single statistical test to be utilized in assessing for potential unit nonresponse bias via incorporation of the design structure of the dyadic data. We investigate the use of an effect size confidence interval coverage, of a MANOVA, to detect a meaningful difference between respondents and nonrespondents correctly. Our results show that with dyadic data, such meaningful differences can be detected with significantly smaller sample size requirements than traditional approaches such as <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐tests or ANOVA. Recommendations are provided for setting up and executing a MANOVA to assess for potential unit nonresponse bias with dyadic data.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the organizational and economic support of managing international supply chains, in a time of competitive pressure and changing economic climate, has forced many countries and executives of international companies to re-evaluate their work and capabilities. Because of this, they have a need to direct their supply chain in search of new, more profitable and economical ways in the context of globalization. Firms' resources and capabilities play an important role in border logistics supply decisions.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the organizational and economic support of managing international supply chains in the context of globalization, using research methods: analysis, observation and conclusions.\nResults. Global processes that permeate all spheres of economic activity, flatten national borders, expand opportunities to capture new markets for goods and services, integrate the world space into a single area with logistics chains. This topic has become very relevant in modern life in both domestic and foreign activities of the country. This article reviews the organizational and economic support for managing international supply chains. Their importance in the activity of the countries and at the enterprises is considered. The concepts of supply chain and the means to evaluate their effectiveness are explored.\nConclusion. The further development of world trade and the desire of many countries to accelerate the pace of integration into the global trading system will depend not only on maintaining an open global economic system, but also on enhancing the number and effectiveness of support structures such as managing the economic and organizational support of logistics chains. Using the right and up-to-date processes, the tools of organizational and economic management of international chains will lead to profit for companies and the country.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Standing deadwood is an important attribute of old-growth boreal forests and it provides essential microhabitats for deadwood-associated species. In managed boreal forests, short rotations tend to limit the amount and diversity of standing deadwood. This study evaluates if the anthropogenic supply of deadwood attributes through tree girdling or by providing nest boxes may favor deadwood-associated species. We studied the short-term response of saproxylic beetles, foraging woodpeckers, and secondary cavity users to snag and cavity supply in 50 to 70-year-old black spruce stands. In spring 2015, we girdled 8000 black spruce according to two spatial distributions (uniform and clustered), and we also installed 450 nest boxes of six different sizes at three distances from the forest edge. Using trunk window traps, we captured significantly more beetles in sites with girdled trees than in control sites in both 2015 and 2016. We also recorded a trend of a greater abundance of beetles in clusters of girdled trees than within uniformly distributed girdled trees. Trypodendron lineatum (Oliver) dominated beetle assemblages, representing 88.5% of all species in 2015 and 74.6% in 2016. The number of beetles captured was 7× higher in 2015 than in 2016. In contrast, we observed greater amounts of woodpecker foraging marks in fall 2016 than in either fall 2015 or spring 2016. Woodpeckers foraged significantly more in clusters of girdled trees than within uniformly distributed girdled trees. Woodpeckers’ foraging mark presence was positively associated with the proportion of recent cuts at 1 km around the study sites. Five Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus Forster) pairs used nest boxes and occupied smaller box sizes that were located away from the forest edge. Our study showed that structural enrichment can be effective in rapidly attracting deadwood-associated species within managed forest stands.</jats:p>"

They strive to bridge that gap by depleting nonrenewable water aquifers and expanding centralized energy-intensive desalination technologies. Continuing to adopt the same unsustainable approach could deplete the water aquifers and increase the consumption of fossil fuel and the ecological impact on air, water, and land. However, the traditional paradigm of centralized desalination systems could be shifted by increasing the utilization of renewable distributed generation, which can be coupled with emerging desalination technology such as adsorption desorption desalination (ADD), which has autonomous and resilient attributes that can contribute to the sustainability of decentralized fresh water supply in the future. In this work, three commercialized desalination technologies were reviewed and compared with emerging ones to explore the most economically and environmentally efficient systems within the context of decentralized water production. The well-known configurations of ADD were evaluated and compared with sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO), which is recognized as the principal commercialized desalination technology worldwide. The quantitative case study methodology was used by investigating four centralized seawater desalination plants in Saudi Arabia (SA) with their associated pipeline systems from the energy consumption point of view to determine the applicability of implementing ADD technology in SA and similar arid areas. The study reveals that adopting decentralized ADD technology coupled with renewable energy sources could reduce the specific energy consumption from 4 kWh/m3 to less than 1.38 kWh/m3. Combining reduced energy consumption from desalination plants and elimination of supply pipelines could potentially result in a significant reduction in energy consumption and carbon emissions. Finally, the study may be useful for researchers working on enhancing ADD processes, as well as technology users who would like to implement the most efficient ADD configurations. Additionally, it may initiate a direction of utilizing the results of original critical reviews as a methodology to develop the applied technologies.</jats:p>"

A company’s financial position affects its performance and survivability in dynamic and volatile markets. Those that have weak financial performance are vulnerable when operating in environments that are uncertain and financially unstable. Companies adopt various solutions and techniques to manage, effectively and efficiently, the flow of money to and from its suppliers and buyers. Reverse factoring is an innovative technique in supply chain financing. This paper develops a joint economic lot size model where a vendor coordinates operational and financial decisions with its multiple suppliers through the establishment of a reverse factoring arrangement. The creditworthy vendor systematically informs a financial institution (e.g., bank) of payment obligations to selected suppliers, enabling the latter to borrow against the value of the relevant accounts receivable at low interest (borrowing) rates. The paper also presents a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the behavior of the model and to compare the economic and operational performance of a supply chain with and without a reverse factoring agreement. The results show that the establishment of a reverse factoring agreement within the supply chain improves the economic performance and impacts on the operational decisions.</jats:p>"

So far, no attempt has been made at the Member State level for the identification of UTPs in the food supply chain and their impact on the relevant stakeholders. This study drew on this gap and attempted to identify the UTPs that exist in the Cypriot food supply chain, assess their impact on the involved stakeholders and provide guidelines that will assist the transposition of EU relevant Directive to the national law. To achieve this goal, the study was based on a quantitative survey of a representative sample of businesses using a specific questionnaire. The results showed that particular UTPs do appear in the food supply chain with a different frequency, while the majority of businesses have been victims of UTPs in the last five years. Notably, the estimated cost of UTPs as a percentage of the business annual turnover is considered important ranging from 5.7% for retailers to 31.9% for farmers. Thus, most participants agree that UTPs in the agricultural food sector should be regulated by national legislation. We argue that the national legislation for UTPs should be a mix of policies that integrate private, administrative and judicial methods of monitoring and enforcement. Policy and decision makers should seek to reinforce the role and the bargaining power of small businesses in the food supply chain. This might be accomplished through the development of efficient producers’ organizations, short food supply chains, interbranch organizations and strategic partnerships.</jats:p>"

Due to the uneven generation and consumption of renewable energy sources under the influence of external conditions (wind, solar radiation, etc.), renewable energy sources should be reserved by means of traditional energy in the so-called hybrid mode, when traditional alternators must work together with renewable energy sources. In this case, the task of creating a tracking inverter that converts direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) according to the characteristics of the AC generator arises. At Bauman Moscow State Technical University the experimental samples of a DC-to-AC inverter with its own logic and microcontroller have been developed and created. They control the conversion mode either by the signals of the reference AC network, or by the signal of the microcontroller. The proposed devices are designed to fully automate power generation processes and power consumption processes in hybrid power supply systems and are designed to manage input and output generating capacities and power consumers to ensure maximum efficiency of power generation from renewable energy sources.</jats:p>",

In the supply chain, the collector collects end-of-life products from consumers in the market. Then, both recyclers purchase the recyclable waste from the collector, and each recycler turns them into new materials. The manufacturer has no recycling facilities; therefore, the manufacturer only purchases the recycled and new materials for its production from the two recyclers. Under this scenario, price competition between recyclers is inevitable. With two pricing structures (Nash and Stackelberg) of the leaders group and three competition behaviors (Collusion, Cournot, and Stackelberg) of the followers group, we suggest six different pricing game models. In each of them, we establish a pricing game model among the members, prove the uniqueness of the equilibrium prices of the supply chain members, and discuss the effects of competition on the overall supply chain’s profitability. Our numerical experiment indicates that as the price competition between recyclers intensifies, the supply chain profitability decreases. Moreover, the greater the recyclability degree of the waste is, the higher the profits in the supply chain become.</jats:p>",

The Agri-food supply chain has characteristics that are unique and complex if compared with a conventional supply chain. Sustainability risk management in the supply chain is the key to a competitive organisation in the long term. The aim of this paper is to review current research on sustainable risk management in the Agri-food industry chain. These reviews were arranged in steps systematically, ranging from searching related to review of supply chain sustainability risk management (SCSRM), reviewing the general framework of SCSRM and the framework of Agri-food SCSRM. Selection of literature review papers in the period 2010-2019, and obtained 30 papers. Risk aspects were analysed using a multi-dimensional approach (economic, social, environmental, technical, and institutional) that influences the sustainability of the Agri-food industry. The results show that there are few studies focusing on risk management to achieve a sustainable supply chain system. Some studies only focus on Triple Bottom Line elements (economic, social, and environmental). Sometimes, these studies do not consider risks from other elements such as technical and institutional aspects that can be influence the sustainability of the Agri-food industry. Technical aspects such as the reliability of technological systems and institutional aspects as policymakers support sustainability in a business process. The contribution of this paper is to provide an initial theoretical framework to guide researchers in analysing risk through a multi-dimensional approach to sustainability.</jats:p>",

In addition, the conventional topologies suffer from a shoot-through problem resulting in their low system reliability. In this paper, to overcome the above issues, systematic design approaches of a three-phase buck rectifier with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and a protection algorithm are proposed to obtain the high reliability of the DC distribution system, which can deal with fault conditions and can regulate the output voltage level. It only requires a single stage of the three-phase buck rectifier. Also, a thyristor switch is added without any commutation circuits to cut off the output from the fault circuit. The shoot-through faults do not occur in the buck rectifier, leading to high reliability. A dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter is applied as the UPS to supply the electric power from the battery when the buck rectifier is shut down under the fault conditions. Finally, the protection algorithm is proposed to detect the fault conditions and to regulate the output voltage level.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the wireless network performance in terms of total achievable throughput, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE) are extensively examined using the MATLAB-based Monte-Carlo simulations taking multipath fading, system bandwidth, transmission power, and inter-cell interference (ICI) into consideration. The numerical results demonstrate that the energy-trading facility can achieve net present cost (NPC) and greenhouse gas saving up to 3.20% and 65.8%, respectively. In the end, the performance of the hybrid solar PV/BG system has been thoroughly compared with the standalone solar PV, hybrid PV/wind turbine (WT), and hybrid PV/diesel generator (DG) systems under on-grid and off-grid configurations for benchmarking.</jats:p>"

According to companies’ concerns regarding product demand forecasting, many researchers have developed various forecasting models in order to improve accuracy. We propose a hybrid forecasting model called GA-GRU, which combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Because many hyperparameters of GRU affect its performance, we utilize GA that finds five kinds of hyperparameters of GRU including window size, number of neurons in the hidden state, batch size, epoch size, and initial learning rate. To validate the effectiveness of GA-GRU, this paper includes three experiments: comparing GA-GRU with other forecasting models, k-fold cross-validation, and sensitive analysis of the GA parameters. During each experiment, we use root mean square error and mean absolute error for calculating the accuracy of the forecasting models. The result shows that GA-GRU obtains better percent deviations than other forecasting models, suggesting setting the mutation factor of 0.015 and the crossover probability of 0.70. In short, we observe that GA-GRU can optimally set five types of hyperparameters and obtain the highest forecasting accuracy.</jats:p>"

The value generated in combination with the contradictory agendas among actors makes any groundwork for future research a challenging endeavor. Hence, an end-to-end mapping of the food supply chain under examination is a vital prerequisite for the design of a comprehensive research framework. This study exemplified such a mapping approach in the Greek sustainable tomato supply chain, providing significant insights for an impactful research agenda. Data were obtained from secondary sectoral sources and open interviews with key players across the supply chain—covering all its main stages, i.e., production, packaging, storing, transportation, wholesaling, and retailing. The findings are summarized in three supply chain maps that illustrate the areas concerning sustainability, value chain and stakeholders. These maps synthesize a bigger picture of the supply chain that reveals the complicated interactions among its actors, the hidden bottlenecks in the flow of information and the areas that need deeper exploration. Its fundamental implication is the design of a targeted research framework, underlying the main priorities of the Greek tomato supply chain and eventually the Greek agri-food sector.</jats:p>"

The lifespan of solar cell equipment and batteries is 20 years. This paper will be simulated in 4 cases and the result will be the price of electricity based on the value of capital divided by the total electricity produced by solar cells and batteries for 20 years. Case 1 when using solar cell day and night using batteries and the result of electricity price for case 1 is 718.648 Rp kWh. Case 2 when using solar cell day and night using its own electricity from the generator and the result of electricity for case 2 is 990.952 Rp/kWh.

Numerous suppliers and contract types are available; however, their selection is a complex decision for procurement managers. In addition, managers typically dedicate a portion of their wood fiber demand to each group of suppliers, which is referred to as a portfolio strategy. Despite the available literature in contract selection, the consideration of contract types and their characteristics have not been addressed for the complex procurement process. In this study, a mixed-integer optimization model is proposed to best select contracts for pulp and paper procurement. The challenge was to plan deliveries in each time period to satisfy the demand of raw material at the mills. The potential of this model is demonstrated with a case study based on characteristics from a forest company in Quebec, Canada. A comparison between traditional fixed and flexible contracts is presented. Different portfolio strategies are also evaluated for groups of suppliers to investigate potential improvements. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current low-carbon economy, the government has adopted carbon taxes and carbon trading policies to control the carbon emissions of manufacturers. As consumers become increasingly aware of low-carbon, some retailers have also started investing in low-carbon to shape their public image and increase their competitiveness to attract more customers. In this paper, the Stackelberg game method is utilized to solve the model, and the graphs are used to analyze the benefits of retailers' low-carbon investment on the supply chain through numerical analysis. It is found that when the emission reduction cost coefficient of manufacturers is relatively low, manufacturers are willing to reduce carbon emissions. At this time, increasing carbon tax and the carbon emission permits price can effectively promote the emission reduction behavior of manufacturers, because it increases demand for products and the profit of manufacturers and retailers. However, when the emission reduction cost coefficient of the manufacturers is quite high, increasing carbon tax and carbon emission permits price cannot effectively promote the emission reduction behavior, because this situation of the emission reduction reduces the profit of manufacturers. The main contribution of this paper discovers that the green cost coefficient of retailers' low-carbon investment will adjust the impact of the carbon tax and the carbon trading price on the profits of retailers and manufacturers which proves that retailers’ low-carbon investment is beneficial to the supply chain. When the emission reduction cost coefficient is high and the green cost coefficient is low, increasing the carbon tax or carbon emission permits price can increase the profit of manufacturers and retailers. Finally, we design a supply chain coordination of comprehensive sharing contact for retailers and manufacturers. The result shows that this contract has economic and environmental benefits, and that it is beneficial for the environment and economy of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

This study aims to describe the pattern of product flow in the cayenne supply chain in Gorontalo. The study used the survey method and sampling using a purposive sampling technique to farmers and traders. Data analysis used descriptive analysis and Hayami added-value analysis. The results of the research show that the product flow pattern in the cayenne supply chain is a product distribution in the form of fresh cayenne pepper and dried cayenne pepper. Farmers sell fresh cayenne through collector traders, wholesalers, market traders and directly to retailers. While processing and distributing dried cayenne by retailers. The added value created by every kg of fresh cayenne pepper is Rp 1,126,688 or 90.27% of the production value. Hayami’s additional analysis shows that the added value in every one kg of dried chili is Rp. 7,400 or 59.20% of the value of the product. The rate of profit is 58.1% of the value of production, meaning that every 100 kg of production value will be obtained as much as 58.1 kg of profit.</jats:p>",

In order to achieve sustainable development in an all-round way, it is necessary to fully and effectively allocate rare mineral resources. With the least resources, the greatest benefits can be generated and the greatest benefits can be obtained. In the context of the new normal economy, the era of allocating resources based on demand has ceased to exist and is replaced by an effective supply-side structure.

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) engages in non‐shivering thermogenesis in response to cold exposure. Several aspects of its function require significant arterial and venous supplies. For example, the arterial system delivers endocrine signaling molecules and metabolic substrates including glucose and non‐esterified fatty acids to both stimulate and fuel BAT thermogenesis. Heat produced from BAT is then presumed to transfer to the blood passing through the tissue to protect core body temperature in response to the initiating cold stimulus. However, whether human BAT contains such a vascular system is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the arterial and venous supply to supraclavicular BAT. Six healthy subjects [4 men; age: 30.7 ± 5.8 yrs.; body mass index: 21.7 ± 3.5 kg/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>; total body fat % (dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry scan): 23.5 ± 6.2 %] underwent time‐of‐flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the arterial and venous systems and quantitative fat/water MR imaging (FWMRI) to identify BAT. Angiography images were reconstructed at 0.5×0.5×2.0 mm resolution. FWMRI was performed using a 21‐echo spoiled gradient‐echo sequence, with computation of the fat signal fraction using the manufacturer’s algorithms. FWMRI images were reconstructed at 1.0×1.0×4.0 mm resolution and then resized to match the resolution of the MRA data. The supraclavicular BAT depot was hand‐defined from the apex of the lung to its superior margin in the FWMRI images. Coronal, axial, and sagittal maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the BAT regions were overlaid onto co‐registered MIPs of the arterial and venous angiograms. In five subjects, there was a single, tortuous branch of the second part of the subclavian artery that supplied the BAT depot; in the sixth subject there was insufficient conspicuity to trace this artery back to the subclavian artery. The arterial diameters ranged from 1.5–2.5 mm. In no case was the artery observed to pass completely through the supraclavicular BAT depot. In two subjects, there was a single 3.5 mm diameter vein returning from the head and passing through the medial portion of the BAT. In the other four subjects, there were 3–4 veins with 2–4 mm diameters that returned from the head and that passed through both the medial and lateral portions of the BAT depot. Individuals with the largest diameter arteries also tended to have the most extensive venous systems. These preliminary data suggest that MRA and FWMRI may be used to quantify the arterial and venous supplies of the human supraclavicular BAT depot. The extensive venous supply to BAT, coupled with the absence of arteries passing fully through this BAT depot, together suggest that the primary thermogenic role of the supraclavicular BAT depot is in rewarming blood returning from the head to the central circulation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Support or Funding Information</jats:title><jats:p>NIDDK/NIH R01‐DK‐105371, NCATS/NIH UL1‐TR000445</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Its thin, elongated third digit serves as a tool for tap‐scanning and prey extraction during percussive foraging for wood‐boring insects. The surface temperature of digit III is higher than the other digits on the foraging hand; in contrast, digit III has a lower temperature than the other digits on the stabilizing hand and this difference has been hypothesized to relate to stenotic kinking of the palmar digital arteries during hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Though previously described qualitatively, aye‐aye hand vasculature has never been photo‐documented or quantified. Here we describe and compare the arterial supply of the forearm and hand in <jats:italic>Daubentonia madagascariensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Lemur catta</jats:italic> in the context of hand function during foraging.</jats:p><jats:p>The forelimbs of two primates, one aye‐aye and one ring‐tailed lemur, were dissected and arterial morphology was documented and photographed.

In <jats:italic>L. catta</jats:italic>, the brachial artery does not pass through the entepicondylar foramen and a superficial palmar arterial arch supplies the digits. By contrast, in <jats:italic>D. madagascariensis</jats:italic> the brachial artery does pass through the entepicondylar foramen and the palmar aspects of the digits are supplied by individual branches of the ulnar and radial arteries rather than an anastomotic arch. These two species also differ in terms of the diameter of the arteries leading to the digits relative to the diameter of the ulnar artery (as a way of assessing relative scale). In the aye‐aye, the arterial supply to digit III has the smallest relative diameter (digit IV has the largest). In the ring‐tailed lemur, digit V has the largest total relative diameter and digit I the smallest.</jats:p><jats:p>These observed differences in the vascular supply of the forelimb and hand in <jats:italic>Lemur catta</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Daubentonia madagascariensis</jats:italic> likely relate to differences in foraging and locomotor strategy. While it has been suggested that stenotic kinking is responsible for the relatively low temperature of digit III on the stabilizing hand in the aye‐aye, our study suggests that this temperature differential may instead be due to the relative under‐supply of this digit compared to the other digits of the hand.</jats:p>",

Groundwater flows are associated to phreatic aquifers in relationship with secondary porosity generated by fracturing, which is increased by dissolution processes in case of carbonate formation producing karstic systems and by the weathering phenomenon mainly affecting granodioritic rocks. Water geochemistry shows low to medium electrical conductivity (EC) depending on the geological formation, but a unique calcium bicarbonate facies. Spring water EC shows limited temporal variations. The isotopic composition of spring indicates a meteoric origin, local infiltration and groundwater flows with low residence time. A conceptual model of the recharge zone is proposed that crosses the surface watershed and covers part of the adjacent Rio Jordán basin, where the Berlin Paramo is located.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One common method for assessing the affordability of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services is to compare a household’s reported WASH expenditure, as a proportion of total household expenditure, to a predefined threshold. Another common method is to subtract this reported WASH expenditure from the household’s total income (or expenditure), and then compare that result against a minimum amount needed to purchase other basic goods and services. The innovative, alternative approach to determining affordability introduced in this paper borrows from the method commonly used to draw the monetary poverty line. This offers five advantages over the common methods of investigating the affordability of WASH services. First, it defines a “basket” of WASH services that accounts for the type and level of WASH services that a household receives (and that involves a threshold quality of service, deemed necessary for health and well-being). Second, it makes use of the actual costs of service, therefore moving away from household estimates of WASH expenditure that tend to be inadequate and rarely reflect actual costs. Third, it considers both initial fixed costs and recurring consumption costs, each of which pose their own unique challenges to affordability. Fourth, it makes use of household-level data on access to WASH services, which allows for the grouping of households into categories with distinct policy implications. Finally, this approach facilitates scenario analyses, whereby the impact of different pricing policies can be assessed. This approach is then applied to rural Nigeria, using data from the General Household Survey (GHS) 2015–16, to demonstrate its utility as a tool to better focus policy reform on the actual affordability constraints of the unserved. </jats:p>",

This research develops a conceptual framework of dynamic system as a strategic tool to ensure sustainability of apple juice supply. It comprises of two steps. First, related triggers are identified. This generates apple juice supply chain into three subsystems, there are supply, demand, and production sub-systems. Second, identifying the interactions between variables of integrated system and eventually supplying feedback. Data and information were collected by interview to related stakeholders. System was designed by conceptualization using cause and effect diagrams (CLD) based on apple juice supply chain configurations that have been obtained. CLD was used to for transformation of obtained interview results. Result shown supply chain of apple juice in Kota Batu consist of 4 tiers. The relationship of feedback between variables then divided into 3 sub-systems. The proposed framework could be used to model the operation of the supply chain network under study and obtain a true reflection of its behaviour in future research.</jats:p>",

More and more attentions are paid to the research of low-carbon supply chains. Based on a two-level low-carbon supply chain in the context of carbon trading, a Stackelberg game model was established for government subsidies to determine a coordinated and balanced solution for supply chains in situations dominated by manufacturers. The optimal strategies for low-carbon technology innovation are analyzed within the context of governmental subsidies. This study’s conclusions are as follows: (1) When government subsidies are in place, regardless of who the government subsidies are meant for, manufacturers and retailers that do not generate carbon emissions will transfer the subsidies to the companies that generate carbon emissions by adjusting wholesale prices and retail prices to maximize their own profits. (2) When consumer prices are sensitive, the government’s optimal subsidy intensity increases as consumers’ low-carbon preferences increase. When consumer prices are not sensitive, the government should not provide any subsidies. (3) When consumers’ low-carbon preferences are weak, the retail price of products will decrease with the increase in subsidies; when consumers’ low-carbon preferences are strong, the opposite dynamic occurs.</jats:p>"

These units cover the preserved records of both river‐dominated deltas and wave‐dominated coasts, representing shoreline transits over a breadth of timescales, likely of both local and regional extent. The role of extant accommodation, rates of creation of accommodation and rates of sediment supply in determining parasequence architecture is assessed through analysis of relationships between: (i) proxies of these variables at different scales (rates of aggradation and progradation, facies‐belt shoreline trajectories, systems‐tract type, parasequence‐set stacking patterns, parasequence progradation angle and stratigraphic rise, size of feeder rivers); and (ii) parameters that describe the geometry and stacking style of parasequences, and associated shallow‐water sand bodies. Statistical analyses of database outputs indicate which proxies of accommodation, sediment supply and accommodation/sediment‐supply ratio are significant as predictors of parasequence architecture, and allow for interpretations of the importance of allogenic and autogenic factors. The principal results of this study reveal the following: (i) parasequence thickness varies as a function of water depth, accommodation generation and erosional truncation, and these variations are also reflected across types of systems tracts and parasequence sets; (ii) the dip length of parasequence sand bodies demonstrates scaling with measures of accommodation/sediment‐supply ratio at multiple scales, partly in relation to the possible effect of sediment supply on progradation rates; (iii) in systems tracts, stratigraphic trends in parasequence stacking due to autogenic mechanisms or to acceleration or deceleration in relative sea‐level fluctuations are not revealed quantitatively; (iv) some association is seen between the abundance of deltaic or river‐dominated parasequences and progradational stacking; (v) positive but modest correlation is observed between measures of river‐system size and the dip length of shallow‐marine parasequence sand bodies. The resulting insights can be applied to guide sequence stratigraphic interpretations of the rock record and the characterization of sub‐seismic stratigraphic architectures of subsurface successions.</jats:p>",

As conflict escalations are often reported to fragment economic space, we suggest an empirical framework which allows for estimating changes in the size of markets often split by frontlines. This approach uses a differentiated goods oligopoly model to separate effects of conflict intensity on consumer demand, costs of trade, market size, and market structure. We combine daily sales of apples in Hebron - one of the focal points of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict - and variables quantifying complementary aspects of conflict intensity. Conflict is found to suppress demand and affect competition more significantly than it increases costs of trading. Simulations indicate a 15% reduction in total daily consumption during conflict of high intensity while a pacification would yield a 20% welfare gain. This empirical framework allows disentangling the effects of conflict on food markets. The results suggest that relief policies should consider alleviating effects of fragmentation of economic space, e.g., by ensuring humanitarian corridors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Supply chain is essential for an organization as it helps to maximize the operations which are profitable through the production, capacity, subcontracting, inventory and stock outs optimum levels. The traditional supply chain involves high documentation cost, with data involved that are mostly inaccurate and useless. In supply chain, the system of production plays an important role. The pinch analysis concept is initially used in the approach of energy conservation, and has extended to the optimization of resources and process integration. This paper presents the application of supply chain using pinch and cascade analysis for biogas production from palm oil mill effluent (POME). Biogas falls under the renewable energy where it can be produced via anaerobic digestion of POME. POME contributes to huge environmental impact mainly due to its high organic content. Supply chain via pinch analysis is used targeting to eliminate or reduce the difficulties faced in conventional supply chain. In this biogas supply chain analysis, it aims to meet the demand in a specific time frame. Minimum production rates are determined as accordance to the demand of electricity from 2020 to 2050. The pinch points are the points where the supply and demand are at the minimum, which the optimum production rate of electricity is able to determine from supply chain via pinch analysis. Monte Carlo Simulation tool is involved in the later stage of the study. It is used in the findings of analysing the increment of more than 10% of up-scale and down-scale production demand for each year for 35 years. The simulation is done from 2016 to 2035 of every five years interval. At the end of the study, the optimization of biogas production was achieved with the application of supply chain via pinch analysis. The supply and demand of biogas to electricity projection from 2020 to 2050 is forecasted. The optimal planning of electricity production from biogas was indicated in the supply chain cascade analysis.</jats:p>",

On the supply side, factors that school inspectors reported included the inability of Swedish teacher seminars to examine enough teachers and the problematic behaviour of local school boards.

Different supply air parameters have significant impacts on the UFAD system performance. In this study, experimental study and energy simulation software EnergyPlus were used to investigate the UFAD performance in a full size experimental room. The distance between diffusers and human, supply air temperature and velocity were discussed. The orthogonal experiments were employed to discuss the effect of supply air parameters on the temperature distribution, thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). By the analysis, the most important factor is the distance between diffusers and human. Furthermore, the preferable supply air parameters are suggested by means of controlling parameters. The results show that better thermal stratification and thermal comfort can be achieved when the distance between the swirl diffusers and human is 0.7m, the Supply Air Temperature (SAT) is 18-20°C and the Supply Air Velocity (SAV) is 1.2-1.5m/s. Another contribution of this paper is that the energy consumption of UFAD system is calculated by EnergyPlus. The calculation shows that the satisfied thermal stratification and prominent energy saving can be achieved simultaneously by using reasonable supply air parameters, such as the SAT is 18°C and the SAV is 1.2m/s.</jats:p>",

To achieve a sustainable ecological management regime in Zhengzhou City, this study presented a comprehensive framework for identifying dynamic changes of ES supply and demand and managing ES. Using land use data of Zhengzhou City in 1995, 2005, and 2015 and incorporating expert knowledge and the ES evaluation matrix, we evaluated the spatiotemporal changes in the ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Gradient analysis was conducted to identify urban–rural patterns in the budgets of ES supply and demand. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was employed to identify the hotspot areas of ES surpluses or deficits. The research results show the following: (1) In the past 20 years, the supply-and-demand relationship of ES in Zhengzhou has gradually evolved in a direction where supply falls short of demand. The average budget index of Zhengzhou’s ES supply and demand decreased from 7.30 in 1995 to −4.89 in 2015. Changes in the supply and demand status of ES in Zhengzhou corresponded to the background of rapid urbanization. (2) Urban–rural gradient differences exist in the budgets of ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Core development areas, such as the Zhengzhou urban areas, are in deficit, whereas a balance or surplus can be observed in rural areas far from urban centers. (3) The surplus hotspots of ES budgets were mainly distributed in the western and southern mountainous areas of Zhengzhou, and they were scattered and the scope shrank, with a decrease of 2.73 times in 20 years, whereas the deficit hotspots expanded outward with each urban area as the center, with an increase of 5.77%. Ecological management zoning (ecological conservation area, ecological improvement area, and ecological reconstruction area) with the effective guidance of ecological and economic policies could comprehensively improve ES management and achieve urban sustainability. The framework in this study can easily and quickly assess the supply and demand status of ES and provide scientific support for the ecological management in rapidly urbanizing areas.</jats:p>"

Performance measurement of a SSC, not only measured economically, but also related to social and environmental performance. All stages in the form of planning and managing all activities involved in Supply Chain Management (SCM) such as procurement, conversion, logistics, communication, and collaboration with partners, must be carried out with high quality.

Social network theory suggests that buyer–supplier relationships are influenced by networks of ties in which they are embedded. While prior research has concentrated on networks of trade interactions, we instead examine the influences of networks through common investors. Utilizing a large sample of buyer–supplier relationships, we find that the presence of CIIs improves suppliers' operating and market performance, especially for suppliers with greater dependence on buyers. In addition, supplier performance increases with the common ownership stakes held by CIIs, but decreases with the asymmetric ownership stakes of CIIs across supply chain partners. We find that better financial collaboration between the partners appears to be a mechanism through which CIIs enhance supplier performance. Lastly, we find that the role of CIIs in strengthening supplier performance is distinct from that of direct equity links. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel role of indirect cross‐ownership in fostering supply chain collaboration and coordinating vertical relationships and, in turn, improving supplier performance.</jats:p>",

The research results show that the risk factors in the supply chain affect supply chain linkages, including risk from the supply, market risks, and information risks. More specifically, risks from the supply are negatively related to supplier links. This is consistent with the views of (Frohlich, 2002; Zsidisin, 2003; Zhao et al., 2013) but this also contrasts with the theory of the relationship between environment and organization. If some supply is problematic, people would be ready to look for new suppliers. This may also be the focus of trust and commitment in business relations between organizations in Vietnam. The results of this study indicate that the risk from supply does not usually have any impact on customers. This is in contrast with the research results of (Frohlich, 2002; Zsidisin, 2003; Zhao et al., 2013). Finally, the risks from the environment surprisingly show no impact on supply chain linkages. This result is completely contrary to the research results obtained by (Khan and Burnes, 2007).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Mexico is the center of domestication and a center for diversity of maize. Area planted with maize is the country’s largest agricultural land use, mostly planted by smallholder family farmers known as campesinos. Due to the large area they plant with saved seed from native varieties in a wide variety of environments across the country, maize evolution under domestication continues today at a very large scale and under a multiplicity of selection pressures. Campesinos have been considered mainly subsistence farmers. Here we show that subsistence production is insufficient for explaining the scale of the area they plant with maize and on which its contemporary evolution under domestication depends. Our hypothesis is that beyond supplying their own consumption needs, campesinos across Mexico collectively produce maize to respond to the demand of non-maize producing local consumers. Here we quantify the extent of subsistence versus surplus production among campesinos, showing that subsistence production cannot explain the scale of their maize cultivation. Then, we test statistically the association between the scale of maize cultivation and socioeconomic variables that link campesino production to the demand by other consumers and examine the implications of the results for the supply and conservation of native maize in the country. Our results suggest that maize trading linking campesinos to other consumers may be important and widespread. We conclude that there are important opportunities for maintaining maize evolution under domestication at large scale by strengthening local maize markets.</p>"

In the supply chain of citronella oil, the community usually acts as a supplier (fragrant lemongrass farmers), manufacturers (distillers of citronella oil), and distributors (collectors of citronella oil). The main problem in the citronella oil refining industry is the uncertainty of the supply chain. Fragrant lemongrass supply chain mapping is done to determine the capacity and needs of all actors involved from raw material sources to retail consumers. Thus, the continuity of fragrant lemongrass supplies increased production capacity in refineries, and market potential can be estimated more precisely. On the other hand, integration between industries is needed to prevent the impact of environmental damage while increasing profits. The symbiosis model of the citronella refining industry is expected to optimize the potential and existing resources through an industrial system that is efficient, integrated, easy to implement, and environmentally sound. This paper will discuss how the application of supply chain management concepts in the symbiosis of the citronella refining industry so that the objectives of cooperation in the environmentally sound supply chain can be realized.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to design a risk management by identifying risk events from the company’s business processes based on Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR), to determine the causes of priority risks and then identifying risk mitigation strategies using House of Risk stage 1 (HOR1), and ranking risk mitigation strategies by considering company criteria in determining risk mitigation strategies using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). From the results of the study, 21 risk events dan 13 priority risk causes’ identified, and 9 risk mitigation strategies’ determined. Risk mitigation strategies’ rank sequentially were conducting briefings and evaluations every day, coordinating with suppliers continuously, making signboards at the warehouse, tightening the implementation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), providing ongoing training, evaluating supplier performance, monitoring more frequently, demand management with considering safety stock and service levels, and had supplier reserves. So, this study suggests PT.X to implement the risk mitigation strategies for minimizing the risks in the company.</jats:p>",

All the examined individuals were students.&#x0D;\nResults. It has been shown that the course of diseases is accompanied by a layering of clinical manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, which are more pronounced in cases of comorbidities. It has been found out that vegetative supply prevails in a number of indicators in the patients with an erosive form of gastroesophageal reflux disease. It has been proven that in almost all the cases of erosion (8 people - 72.7%), the individuals experienced some clinical manifestations of vegetative provision, such as general weakness, increased fatigue, lability of the pulse and blood pressure, and palpitation. At the same time, the “vegetative tail” was recorded only in a third (34.7%) of the studied without erosive lesions of the esophageal mucous membrane. The patients with an erosive form of the disease have a long period of experiencing some manifestations of autonomic dysfunction (up to 3 months) that considerably affects the quality of their life.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Coupling of autoimmune thyroiditis and gastroesophageal reflux disease leads to the emergence of autonomic reactivity. Vegetative “supply” of the course of comorbidity between gastroesophageal reflux disease and autoimmune thyroiditis becomes more pronounced in the presence of an erosive process in the mucous membrane, which is also known as one of the factors of its possible manifestations.</jats:p>"

Many studies have focused on the water-saving potential of these systems, but research into aspects that impact stormwater retention—such as demand patterns and climate change—is lacking. This paper investigates the short-term impact of demand on both water supply and stormwater management and examines future and potential performance over a longer time scale using climate change projections. To achieve this, data was collected from domestic rainwater harvesting systems in Broadhempston, UK, and used to create a yield-after-spillage model. The validation process showed that using constant demand as opposed to monitored data had little impact on accuracy. With regards to stormwater management, it was found that monitored households did not use all the non-potable available water, and that increasing their demand for this was the most effective way of increasing retention capacity based on the modelling study completed. Installing passive or active runoff control did not markedly improve performance. Passive systems reduced the outflow to greenfield runoff for the longest time, whereas active systems increased the outflow to a level substantially above roof runoff in the 30 largest events.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are a large number of disabled elderly people in China, which results in huge care and financial burdens to their families and society. However, China has not yet launched a unified long-term care insurance (LTCI) system. This study aims to predict the contribution rate of LTCI in China from 2020 to 2050 based on the long-term care (LTC) cost of the disabled elderly, aged 65 and over, in order to provide strong evidence for the establishment of a unified and sustainable national LTCI system in China. The simulations are based on data from the population census data, the Chinese statistical yearbook, and the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) database. Based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) financing model from the perspective of fund balance, an overall simulation model and a Monte Carlo simulation are used to estimate the contribution rate of LTCI for disabled elderly from 2020 to 2050 in China. The total financial demands will increase sharply from 538.0 billion yuan in 2020 to 8530.8 billion yuan in 2050. Of that total, 80.2% will be required in urban areas. In addition, the per capita financial demands of care in urban and rural areas in 2050 will be approximately six times and 11 times higher than in 2020, respectively. The predicted results show that the overall contribution rate of LTCI in China will increase sharply from 1.46% in 2020 to 5.14% in 2050, an increase of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the contribution rate in 2020 will be close to 1.33% in Japan in 2015 and 1.40% in Germany in 2010. According to the 1:1 payment proportion between employer and employee, each side bears 0.68% of the insurance premium. From 2020 to 2050, the financial demands of long-term care for disabled elderly in China will increase, especially in urban areas, and the burden of per capita financial demands in rural areas will increase significantly. The overall contribution rate of LTCI will increase linearly and the payment burden of policyholders will increase year by year. This study provides evidence of the need for the establishment of a sustainable financing mechanism for multiple financial supplies.</jats:p>"

In this study, we consider a two-echelon supply chain composed of two competing manufacturers, two retailers, and one third-party logistics firm. The first manufacturer produces a green product, while the second manufacturer produces a nongreen product. Each of the two retailers can sell only a green product, only a nongreen product, or both green and nongreen products. All products are initially stored by the third-party logistics firm and delivered to the retailers. This study investigates product pricing, the degree of greenness of the first manufacturer’s product, and carbon emission reduction as carried out by the third-party logistics firm. Using a three-stage Stackelberg game framework, we present the equilibrium strategy on pricing, the degree of greenness, and carbon emission reduction for five different distribution channel structures. One of our major findings is that competition between the two manufacturers has a positive influence on the profitability of the supply chain. We also find that it is desirable for each manufacturer to choose a cross-distribution channel for its products considering the sustainability and profitability of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

In our previous studies, a repetitive inductive PPS circuit topology based on a bridge-type capacitor switching circuit and a high-temperature superconducting pulsed power transformer(HTSPPT) was proposed. By using superconducting inductors, this circuit reduces the power requirements of the primary power supply. However, to prevent the charging current from exceeding the critical current of the superconducting inductors, the circuit must enter the discharging phase immediately when the charging current reaches the designated value, even the discharge time is inappropriate. On the issue, this paper proposes a new operation mode, which is inspired by the trickle charging of accumulators. In this mode, the circuit can keep working in the introduced trickle charging phase until the discharge pulse is required. To study the feasibility of this mode, a preliminary experiment was carried out based on an HTSPPT. The results show that the discharge time can be controlled by instructions and the proposed operation mode is feasible. In addition, the critical parameters and error control methods of the proposed operation mode are also analysed and discussed.</jats:p>",

The aim of this narrative review is to use the food supply chain as a lens of enquiry to distinguish between compliance‐based and integrity‐based organizational climates and frame and rationalize why deviant behavior arises and how it can be identified. Contemporary theory is explored and critiqued using case studies to contextualize the challenge of organizations promoting supply chain compliance and at the same time recognizing the need for deviant behavior to occur in order to drive innovation and continuous improvement within food supply chains. Deviant behavior can be perceived as either positive in terms of driving continuous improvement or destructive where this behavior has a negative impact on the organization. Although multiple cultural maturity models seek to characterize positive food safety culture and climate, there is minimal research that focuses on the characterization of deviant negative behavior or the development of early warning systems designed to pinpoint signals, traits, or characteristics of this behavior such as low staff morale, theft, property destruction, or absenteeism. The use of cultural maturity models and assessment tools is of value in assisting organizations to translate from a rule, instrumental, or compliance‐based organizational climate to an ethically strong organizational climate that focuses on integrity, building trust, and values and a new cultural maturity model is proposed and explored.</jats:p>",

Based on the load characteristic and the lumped-element equivalent circuit of the railgun, the characteristics of the railgun’s breech voltage in above three phases were analysed. Under the condition that the size of the launching system is close to the same, the change ranges of the breech voltage of the augmented railgun is much larger than that of the simple railgun, and the breech voltage of the augmented railgun is a very high forward voltage in the rising phase. The influence of the breech voltage on the discharge characteristics of the capacitive pulsed power supply was studied. In the rising phase, the high breech voltage of the augmented railgun has a significant adverse effect on the pulsed discharge characteristics of the capacitive pulsed power supply whose pulsed forming net consists of a large number of pulsed forming units with small energy storage and high resonance frequency. As a result, part of the stored energy of the capacitive pulsed power supply cannot be used effectively, which leads to the decrease of the working efficiency of the launching system. Using the launching system with a 13-MJ capacitive pulsed power supply and a medium calibre augmented railgun, the launching simulation and test were completed, and the analysis was verified. The research has important enlightenment for improving the match between the capacitive pulsed power supply and the railgun.</jats:p>",

The proposed paper presents the results of a critical thinking on how Zara applied innovation and continuous improvement in its operations and strong business model to maintain its unique competitive advantage over time. Our study shows that the secrets behind its exponential success are mainly a sophisticated sustainable supply chain, integrating efficiently the layers of design, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution to stores for customers. It has to do with the best trade-off between low storage and shorter time response to customers in a contracted volatile market. Concisely, this research on specialized studies done over recent years seeks to help professional leaders grasp the best managerial and relational practices, along with developed operations’ research tools based on demand forecasting, inventory-distribution and clearance pricing optimization models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small phospholipid signaling molecule, whose levels are increased after cerebral ischemia. We hypothesized that exogenous LPA would increase the size of infarct and reduce microregional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance after cerebral ischemia‐reperfusion. This was tested in isoflurane‐anesthetized rats with middle cerebral artery blockade for 1 hr and reperfusion for 2 hr with or without LPA (1 mg/kg, at 30, 60 and 90 min after reperfusion). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>‐iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small vessel (20–60 μm diameter) arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. There were no significant hemodynamic or arterial blood gas differences between groups. The control ischemic‐reperfused cortex had a similar O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic‐reperfused cortex with many areas of low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (43 of 80 veins with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation below 50%). LPA did not significantly alter cerebral blood flow, but it did significantly increase O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption of the ischemic‐reperfused region. It also significantly increased the number of small veins with low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturations in the reperfused region (76 of 80 veins with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation below 50%). This was associated with a significantly increased cortical infarct size after LPA administration (11.4 ± 0.5% control vs 16.4 ± 0.6% LPA). This suggests that LPA reduces cell survival and that it is associated with an increase in the number of small microregions with reduced local oxygen balance after cerebral ischemia‐reperfusion.</jats:p>",

In this context, the Dutch company aQysta has developed the Barsha pump (BP), the first-ever commercial version of the spiral pumps. BPs, however, face several constraints that affect the decision-making and access of smallholders to this and other agricultural technologies, and thus to their benefits. On this subject, Product Service System (PSS) is a type of business model able to potentially cope with a number of restrictions of different nature. Moreover, if co-created with the feedback of the users, and by addressing contextual tensions of different cases, these models can be substantially richer than their top-down counterparts. Six cases of the use of BPs have been addressed in Nepal and Malawi. Both primary and secondary data, analyzed qualitatively under the analytic induction approach, were collected through unstructured interviews and Q-methodology. Evidence shows a wide range of (non-)technical facilitating and hampering conditions for the BP, as well as preferences of the smallholders in regard to existing and proposed business model elements. Based on the corresponding analysis, a set of opportunities for an improved BP-based business model – PSS, aiming to fulfil several (and at times opposing) needs, is ultimately proposed in the current paper.</jats:p>",

To fully account for indirect (virtual) water dependencies, virtual water flows need to be known along complex supply chains. To this purpose, we build a new environmental multiregional input–output model for U.S. regions. The model is used to quantify the domestic, blue virtual water flows and analyze the water footprints of 69 major U.S. cities. Our results show a large inequality in the urban water consumed for economic production: just 7 out of the 69 cities included in this study account for 35% of the U.S. national water footprint of production. This is due to the production of water‐intensive agricultural products in the metropolitan areas of western cities. The inequality reduces for the urban water footprint of consumption because, through the supply chains of industrialized food sectors, western virtual water is partially transferred to eastern cities as final demand. The water embodied in industrial products and services tends to be higher in western cities than in eastern cities; that is, the water embodied in food services could be several times higher in Los Angeles than in New York City. Trade hub cities attract large inflows of products which are mostly transformed for consumption elsewhere. Thus, the omission of product interdependencies within trade hub cities can increase by several times their water footprints of consumption. Overall, the proposed model is able to enhance subnational estimates of U.S. virtual water flows.</jats:p>",

In the practice of supply chain, environmental regulations and supply chain contracts are applied with the attempt to improve environmental performance. However, whether these measures are actually effective remains unanswered. In this paper, we study a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer adopting joint emission reduction strategy. We first investigate under what circumstance the environmental regulation can effectively result in higher emission reduction efforts. The result shows that when the cost coefficient satisfies certain conditions, the increase of penalty or subsidy can lead to more investment in emission reduction. In addition, if the environmental impact caused by the production process is extremely high, the enforcement of the regulation is ineffective. We also explore how the cost-revenue-sharing contract affects the emission reduction strategy and the coordination of the members in the supply chain. The results suggest that the incentive effect of environmental regulation is more effective when the supply chain coordination contract exists. Numerical experiments are also presented to verify our analytical conclusions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last two decades, Pakistan’s energy demand has grown exponentially with very diminutive measures taken by the government to fulfill the needs. The large power plant projects are cumbersome, take years to be completed and require plenty of time to get fully operational. The idea of distributed generation works well in this case. Renewable energy comes well into play when we talk about distributed generation but the dependability of renewable energy resources on back-up such as batteries makes them unappealing. The objective of this paper is to practically implement a backup for the renewable energy resources using a mechanical storage such as CAES (Compressed Air Energy System). The proposed model is a composite technology, which comprises of EES (Electrical Energy Storage) and electrical power supply system. Solar energy driven compressor is used to compress the air in a storage tank, which is used on demand to drive the generator coupled air turbine. The fact that the developed system is solar powered, no other fuel is used with air and it uses mechanical storage instead of conventional storage like batteries, which makes the developed prototype system efficient, economical and durable as compared to the existing CAES. This paper focuses on the thermodynamic investigation, design and finally implementing a prototype CAES for a small load as an un-interrupted power supply system.</jats:p>",

To date, no real-world study has been conducted into real business cases. Thus, this case study has been carried out to verify the utilization of IBS in reducing the construction cost of housing projects. Three case studies based on interviews were reviewed and analyzed using the content analysis approach. The findings showed that there were significant differences between utilizing the IBS approach compared to the conventional method. However, the factors of volumes, IBS supplier radius, land acquisition, design, type of residential units and construction company capacity are the main concerns which have been emphasized in applying the IBS method for affordable housing supply by the developers and manufacturers. The most interesting outcome was the fast completion of the construction projects which resulted in speeding up the claiming process. Thus, the implementation of IBS will enhance the developers’ cash flow. This study concludes that the high potential of utilizing IBS components in affordable housing programs can be related to the overall reduction of construction costs, since more units were planned to be constructed in Selangor. However, the affordable housing program agencies should play a vital role in land acquisition.</jats:p>",

Differentiation of power supply systems of consumers was carried out, according to the results of which it is advisable to pay special attention to the location of the source of electric energy generation. The paper suggests that in the conditions of the Arctic zone it should be as close as possible to the center of energy consumption and the possibility of combined generation of electric and thermal energy.</jats:p>",

The electricity supply for the inhabitant islands in Thousand Islands region is supplied by State Electricity Company (<jats:italic>PLN</jats:italic>) with the on-grid interconnecting system on the medium voltage marine line I (<jats:italic>SKLTM</jats:italic>) along 76.79 km. Meanwhile Sebira Island supplies electricity using the Diesel Power Plant (<jats:italic>PLTD</jats:italic>) provided by the Regional Government (<jats:italic>PEMDA</jats:italic>). To increase the reliability of the SKLTM line I system in the Thousand Islands, SKLTM line II will be built along 67.7 km in 2018-2021. Based on the description of the development plan, this paper will redesign the electricity supply system with 100% renewable energy power plants in each of the 11 inhabitant islands in the Thousand Islands, namely the hybrid system of Solar Power Generation (<jats:italic>PLTS</jats:italic>), Wind Turbine Power Plant (<jats:italic>PLTB</jats:italic>), Diesel Power Plant (<jats:italic>PLTD</jats:italic>) and Crude Palm Oil (<jats:italic>CPO</jats:italic>) Power Plant (<jats:italic>PLTBn CPO</jats:italic>). The average annual solar radiation in the Thousand Islands region is 5.08 kWh/m2/day and the annual average wind speed at an altitude of 50 m is 3.29 m/s.

In this paper, a new group multi‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) plan is proposed by combining two MCDM methods based on the fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy ELECTRE III methods that convert the experts' opinions to triangular fuzzy numbers based on the level of uncertainty associated with various quantitative and qualitative criteria. Considering the opinions of four non‐stakeholder experts and data analysis using the fuzzy Delphi method, the criteria were evaluated. Then, by analysing the results using the fuzzy ELECTRE III method, the final ranking of scenarios is obtained. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the decision‐making system in scenarios ranking. The total expense, flood control, reservoir capacity and diversion and water transfer played a significant role in selecting the optimal scenario. Additionally, a hydrologic model was developed to evaluate the performance of the optimal scenario in terms of qualitative criteria. The data indicated that there was a good agreement between the results obtained from the hydrological model and the scenario ranking by the employed method. Altogether, a comparison of the proposed method with other MCDM methods, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by simulation of ideal solution, indicated that the results of the employed method matched more closely to the local experts' opinion.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the total chlorine residuals of all sites were negatively correlated with the temperature of the treated water, while the total chlorine residual of pipeline water did not uniformly correlate with that of the treated water. Further, a chloramine decay calculation study showed that pipe wall-induced decay contributes a lot of chloramine losses by conducting Total Chloramine Decay Model (TCDM) calibration with the monitored data. Hence, increasing the total chlorine residual of treated water, especially in the hot season, may not effectively maintain the disinfectant concentration at an ideal level.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the retailers’ overconfidence and fairness concerns were introduced into the decentralized supply chain, while the Stackelberg game model between the manufacturer and the retailer was built. Furthermore, an innovative supply chain contract, i.e., buyback contract, with promotional cost sharing was designed to achieve supply chain coordination along with overconfidence and fairness concern. Finally, a numerical analysis was also conducted to analyze the effect of overconfidence, fairness concern, and the validity of the contract. The principal findings of the study include the positive correlation between retailers’ overconfidence and optimal order quantity, sales effort, expected utility, and profit. Although the order quantity and sales efforts were not affected by the fairness concern of the retailer, the contract achieved coordination with a win-win outcome when the level of overconfidence and fairness concern was moderate.</jats:p>",

This SME cooperates with corn farmers and retailers who joined the supply chain of corn chips. The uncertainty of the maize cropping pattern, the production process that depends on weather conditions, and the demand for fluctuating corn chips are the factors that can trigger a variety of risks. The research objective was to identify and assess the risk of corn chips’ supply chain in <jats:italic>Lembah Hijau</jats:italic> and to mitigate the risks. The method used to assess the risk is Fuzzy Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) by using the questionnaires which were filled by five expert respondents. The raw material, production process and marketing are the variables that will be reviewed. The results showed that by identifying the risk of corn chip supply chain, 14 risks consisting of 3 risks in the raw material variable, 6 risks in the production process variable and 5 risks in the marketing variables were found. Based on the highest <jats:italic>Fuzzy Risk Priority Number</jats:italic> value of raw material variable, the risk found was the fluctuation of corn price. Meanwhile, the risk in the production process variable was the weather conditions that do not support the production process and the risk in the marketing variable was the return of corn chips product.</jats:p>",

In these contexts, substantial leverage effects for sustainability in supply chains (SCs) can be expected by reducing adverse impacts on society and minimising related risks. For this ethical end, an adequate understanding of the respective sourcing contexts is fundamental. This case study of South Africa’s (SA) mining sector uses institutional theory and the notion of institutional uncertainty to empirically analyse the challenges associated with establishing social sustainability. The case study research is informed by 39 semi-structured interviews with top management representatives and various state and non-state decision makers in SA. Our findings suggest that (social) sustainability in the institutional field is mainly shaped by the Social and Labour Plan institution, induced by state actors and mining companies’ practices. However, four weakening factors were identified that adversely affect this regulative institution, drive institutional uncertainty and allow for mining companies’ gradual decoupling. Contrastingly, complementing pressures of non-state actors limit institutional uncertainty and push toward mainstreaming the stipulations of the institution. This study contributes to the business ethics literature by providing an in-depth exploration of institutional uncertainty’s drivers and barriers within an upstream SC setting and shedding light on multiple actors’ interplay and relevance in sector-wide sustainability. The findings are condensed into three main propositions as well as an analytical framework as a basis for follow-up research. This case study helps practitioners understand and manage complexity that results from actor plurality and institutional uncertainty in EMDEs.</jats:p>",

The addition of hydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles and nanocellulose reduced membrane hydrophobicity, but the dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles assisted silane modification to improve surface hydrophobicity. Besides reducing the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles, nanocellulose induced the formation of larger pore size and higher porosity as proven in SEM images and gravimetric measurement, respectively. The abundant moieties of nanocellulose accelerated the exchange between solvent and non-solvent during phase inversion for the formation of large pore size and porosity, but membrane thickness increased due to the thickening effects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current use and distribution of agricultural water resources is highly prone to effects of global climate change due to shifting precipitation patterns. The production of vegetable crops in open field cultivation often requires demanding water applications, being impaired in regions where climate change will increasingly evoke water scarcity. To date, increasingly occurring precipitation-free periods are already leading to moderate water deficits during plant growth, e.g., in southern Europe. Among all vegetable crops, leafy vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) are particularly vulnerable to limited water supply, because leaf expansion is highly dependent on water availability. Besides biomass production, water limitation might also affect the valuable nutritional composition of the produce. Therefore, we investigated the impact of moderately reduced water supply on the chemical composition of spinach, cultivated in the open field in three consecutive years. Two different water supply treatments, full and reduced irrigation, were used in a randomized block design consisting of three sets of six plots each. In the reduced water supply treatment, the total amount of supplied water, including both irrigation and natural precipitation, amounted to 90%, 94% and 96% in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, of the full, optimal water supply treatment. Spinach grown under limited water supply showed significantly higher fresh biomass-based contents of polyols (e.g., inositol, glycerol), ascorbic acid, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorous, zinc and manganese, as well as total flavonoids and carotenoids. Increased dry biomass-based levels were found for total inositol, zinc and manganese, as well as decreased levels for malic acid, fumaric acid, phosphate and chloride. Furthermore, we report a high seasonal variation of several minor phytochemicals, such as single flavonoids. Spinacetin derivatives, spinatoside-glucoside as well as a rather unusual hexuronylated methylenedioxy flavonoid showed highest amounts when grown under relatively low irradiation in autumn. Levels of patuletin derivatives tended to increase under high irradiation conditions during spring. In summary, the chemical composition of spinach was shown to be highly sensitive to moderately reduced water supply and seasonal variation, but the overall nutritional quality of fresh marketable spinach was only marginally affected when considering health-related constituents such as minerals, trace elements, flavonoids and carotenoids.</jats:p>"

A new backwash strategy, in which air scouring was only applied with sludge water discharging, was proposed to improve backwash performance in a water plant using UF. Four gravity-driven UF systems were simultaneously run at increasing air scouring intervals (3–24hours) and sludge water discharging intervals (12–24hours). The membrane fluxes were monitored to assess membrane fouling and the mix solution turbidity was also monitored to investigate deposition of particles. The results indicated that membrane fouling was not aggravated by the extension of air scouring and sludge water discharging intervals. Water backwash on its own induced a shift of particle deposition from the membrane surface to the bottom of the membrane tank due to limited cake layer breakage, enabling the extension of sludge water discharging intervals. For the gravity-driven system investigated, the running cost, including energy, water and chemical demand, was reduced by 16.67% as the air scouring and sludge water discharging intervals increased from 3hours to 24hours and from 12hours to 24hours, respectively.</jats:p>",

The blood supply of the HSG is difficult to study due to its helical structure and encasement in hard bone. The objective of this study was to present the first three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and analysis of the HSG blood supply using synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) in combination with histological analyses of archival human cochlear sections. Twenty-six human temporal bones underwent SR-PCI. Data were processed using volume-rendering software, and a representative three-dimensional (3D) model was created to allow visualization of the vascular anatomy. Histologic analysis was used to verify the segmentations. Results revealed that the HSG is supplied by radial vascular twigs which are separate from the rest of the inner ear and encased in bone. Unlike with most organs, the arteries and veins in the human cochlea do not follow the same conduits. There is a dual venous outflow and a modiolar arterial supply. This organization may explain why the HSG may endure even in cases of advanced cochlear pathology.</jats:p>"

The complexity, diversity, and technicality of food safety problems are intertwined, which constantly promotes the Chinese government and the food industry to explore effective food safety governance mechanisms. As the dominant form of vertical coordination in agri-food supply chain, contract farming is conducive to promoting farmers’ safe production behavior, improving food quality and safety, and ensuring public health. However, the low contract performance rate seriously restricts the effect of contract farming on reducing the risk of food safety in China. This paper empirically investigates the role of farmers’ risk attitude and contract arrangements in their enforcement. The data is derived from a household survey and economic field experiment of fruit farmers participating in contract farming in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces of China. We measure farmers’ risk attitude by using an economic field experiment, and examine how risk attitude and contract arrangements affect contract enforcement with a probit model. The results show that contract enforcement is significantly (1% level) influenced by farmers’ risk attitude. Farmers with greater risk aversion and loss aversion and farmers who are more accurate in evaluating probability information are more likely to fulfill the contract. Additionally, most contract arrangements have a significant effect on contract enforcement at the 5% level. Contract arrangements with floor pricing, bonus, and long duration are related to a higher rate of farmers’ contract performance. Furthermore, the factors influencing contract enforcement differ based on the levels of farmer’ risk attitude. The findings of the study may be conducive to formulating relevant agricultural policy to influence farmers’ decision-making and thus improving food safety and ensuring public health.</jats:p>"

This case report describes an unusual pattern in the arterial blood supply of the kidneys. The variation was discovered in an elderly Puerto Rican female during the course of a routine dissection on an embalmed cadaver. The left kidney received arterial supply from two accessory renal arteries. An upper accessory renal artery branched directly from the aorta and entered the kidney at the upper pole. A lower accessory renal artery branched from the main renal artery and entered the main part of the kidney at the level of the hilum. Additional branches appear to supply the left suprarenal gland both directly from the aorta and from the upper accessory renal artery. The right kidney was missing due to unknown causes occurring during the life of the individual.</jats:p><jats:p>This variant is uncommon, and suggests an atypical embryological development. As the kidney ascends, it gathers its blood supply from nearby arteries, and when it reaches its final destination, one artery remains while the rest degenerate. When this process fails, multiple renal arteries are present in the adult, each with an important function that is not supplemental to that of the main renal artery. However, these extra renal arteries may represent the formation of additional blood vessels rather than an embryological vestige. Understanding these types of variations may help avoid clinical complications, especially during radiological examinations and surgical approaches, such as partial nephrectomies. This is especially true of the extra hilar artery occurring at the level of the hilum, which might be confused for a typical renal artery during imaging.</jats:p>",

As the source is disseminated over a large area and affected by seasonality, the potential benefit is highly dependent on other cost and benefit trade-offs along the supply chain. This review paper aims to assess operational management research methods used in biofuel supply chain planning, including both upstream production and international downstream trading. There have been considerable operational management studies done on upstream processes in biofuel production based on different strategic and tactical decision making of a single or multiple feedstocks, considering economic and environmental factor. However, the environmental consideration is often limited to carbon emission where the other environmental impact such as land-use change, biodiversity loss, irrigation and fertilisation are often being overlooked. Biofuel supply chain and trading at international level remain as an apparent research potential where only limited numbers of global energy models explicitly simulate international bioenergy trade. The leading biofuel producing countries in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, are selected as a case study to investigate further on how the supply chain management model could be applied considering the existing biofuel support policies. This study is expected to contribute to the selection of operational management research methods used for decision making under robust policy context, followed by several recommendations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural irrigation is a very important link in agricultural production, but in the current situation of water shortage, reasonable control of agricultural water supply can not only achieve the purpose of irrigation, but also save water resources to the maximum extent. Therefore, this paper studies the agricultural water supply control system and its related circuits. According to the actual situation of agricultural irrigation, based on the nine-point controller in logic control, a control system of agricultural water supply based on nine-point controller is designed, and also the corresponding control circuit. The control system is verified by experiments. The results show that the control system circuit can meet the operation requirements under extreme conditions and has high stability. The experimental results of the control system show that the whole control system is obviously superior to the traditional PID control system, while the actual application results show that the whole control system has a good response and can control the water supply system in real time according to the actual situation of agricultural irrigation.</jats:p>",

This paper mainly disscusses DMCI problems in trigger circuits of high-power thyristors in the following aspects: initially, circuit models of high-frequency parasitic parameters of pulse transformer and SMFET are established; next, principles of DMCI in trigger circuits of high-power thyristors are investigated; furthermore, DMCI suppression methods are also analyzed; ultimately, experiments have been carried out to verify the theoretical analysis.</jats:p>",

As the setup, scanning power supply is required to excite the scanning coils and deflect the energetic electron beam across a titanium foil window in horizontal and vertical direction respectively. The excitation current of the scanning coils is determined by the energy of the electron beam and the deflected length. Therefore, the scanning power supply must be functioning automatically and continuously to ensure the uniform dose distribution and unavoidable heat issue. As the result, the scanning power supply using the combination of signal generator and power amplifier has been developed and functioning as expected.</jats:p>",

In addition, through the cooperation of each part, the proposed power supply system can provide continuous power without neutral sections. The NS compensation principle of the new system is illustrated. Depending on the operational state of the traction load, the control model is presented for different working patterns, including a regenerative braking pattern, a peak clipping pattern and a valley filling pattern. Moreover, a hierarchical control strategy including upper energy management and low‐layer converter control is proposed, which effectively coordinate switches between the different working patterns. Finally, the validity of the control method and the excellent performance of the system are demonstrated by a case study. The results indicate that compared to a conventional TPSS, the ESTPSS increases the RBE utilisation of the system by 83%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inter-organizational cost management is a strategic cost management approach to managing costs that span organizational boundaries in supply chains. Drawing on the resourcebased view of the firm, we develop a model to predict which inter-related resources might enable companies to manage inter-organizational costs. We test this model using a survey of managerial accountants whose organizations are part of a supply chain. Using structural equation modeling, we conclude that the resources of internal electronic integration, external electronic integration, internal cost management, and absorptive capacity play significant direct and indirect roles in the development of an inter-organizational cost management (IOCM) resource. We find that these resources are inter-related and together are useful in enabling companies to ultimately benefit from managing inter-organizational costs. We find in particular the importance of relational resources associated with absorptive capacity in the development of an IOCM resource. Our research contributes to theory and practice by explaining how specific resources can be combined in allowing companies to better manage inter-organizational costs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As application of electric energy have expanded, the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) concept has attracted considerable attention, and new UPS technologies have been developed. Despite the extensive research on the batteries for UPS, conventional batteries are still being used in large-scale UPS systems. However, lead-acid batteries, which are currently widely adopted in UPS, require frequent maintenance and are relatively expensive as compared with some other kinds of batteries, like metal-air batteries. In previous work, we designed a novel metal-air battery, with low cost and easy maintenance for large-scale UPS applications. An extensive analysis was performed to apply our metal-air battery to the hybrid UPS model. In this study, we focus on including an optimal control system for high battery performance. We developed an algorithm based on receding horizon control (RHC) for each fan of the cooling system. The algorithm reflects the operation properties of the metal-air battery so that it can supply power for a long time. We solved RHC by applying dynamic programming (DP) for a corresponding time. Different variables, such as current density, oxygen concentration, and temperature, were considered for the application of DP. Additionally, a 1.5-dimensional DP, which is used for solving the RHC, was developed using the state variables with high sensitivity and considering the battery characteristics. Because there is no other control variable during operation, only one control variable, the fan flow, was used, and the state variables were divided by section rather than a point. Thus, we not only developed a sub-optimal control strategy for the UPS but also found that fan control can improve the performance of metal-air batteries. The sub-optimal control strategy showed stable and 6–10% of improvement in UPS operating time based on the simulation.</jats:p>"

However, the clay plain was developed from prior stream channels characterised by sandy clay loam textures that are permeable. Cheap methods of soil physical and chemical characterisations are required to map the supply channels used to move water on farms. Herein, we collect apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) from a DUALEM-421 along a 4-km section of a supply channel. We invert ECa to generate electromagnetic conductivity images (EMCI) using EM4Soil software and evaluate two-dimensional models of estimates of true electrical conductivity (σ—mS m−1) against physical (i.e., clay and sand—%) and chemical properties (i.e., electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste extract (ECe—dS m−1) and the cation exchange capacity (CEC, cmol(+) kg−1). Using a support vector machine (SVM), we predict these properties from the σ and depth. Leave-one-site-out cross-validation shows strong 1:1 agreement (Lin’s) between the σ and clay (0.85), sand (0.81), ECe (0.86) and CEC (0.83). Our interpretation of predicted properties suggests the approach can identify leakage areas (i.e., prior stream channels). We suggest that, with this calibration, the approach can be used to predict soil physical and chemical properties beneath supply channels across the rest of the valley. Future research should also explore whether similar calibrations can be developed to enable characterisations in other cotton-growing areas of Australia.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a unique RE framework for performance optimization of the pharmaceutical sector in a veterinary organization. A standard questionnaire was used to collect the required data. Next, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) approaches were employed to formulate the problem. Sensitivity analysis was performed based on the most appropriate model of DEA and FDEA. The results showed that redundancy was the most effective factor in enhancing efficiency in PSCs in the veterinary organization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main reason why supply uncertainty reduces supply chain performance is that it is difficult to estimate whether uncertain supply matches demand. Seldom do papers study retailers’ decision-selection problems according to the reliability of uncertain supply in satisfying demand. This paper considers the optimal decision selection of a retailer working with a main supplier facing supply uncertainty and a backup supplier whose yield is infinite or uncertain. The retailer can enforce demand management by adjusting prices, seeking the backup supplier to make up for the lack of products or mixing the two decisions. We provide the definition called the reliability level of serving the market (RLSM) to characterize the reliability of uncertain supply in satisfying market demand. Under different RLSMs, the participants maximize their profits based on a confidence level in three scenarios: benchmark, infinite backup supply and uncertain backup supply. Whether the main supplier determines the wholesale price or not, we find that in the benchmark, the retailer orders from the main supplier if the RLSM is low; otherwise, the retailer gives up purchasing the product. In the latter two scenarios, our results show that the particular order strategy chosen by the retailer depends on the values of the RLSM and that the retailer’s order quantity follows threshold rules. It is interesting that for different RLSMs, the retailer chooses either a price adjustment strategy, a backup supply strategy or neither of them but does not choose the mixed one, which is counterintuitive. We also derive the particular scenario that is good for the retailer by comparing the results in the three scenarios. Finally, a proper RLSM is suggested for the retailer to balance the reliability of serving the market and her profit.</jats:p>",

Firms are now required to report not only their operations' carbon emissions but also their suppliers'. This research explores the institutional pressures emanating from buyers and industry peers driving supplier firms to disclose high‐quality carbon emission publicly—our concept of carbon transparency. Many firms are increasingly adopting incentives to engage their employees in corporate climate change programs. Thus, we study the impact of three institutional pressures—<jats:italic>coercive</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>mimetic</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>normative</jats:italic>—and examine when these pressures are more (or less) effective for driving supplier carbon transparency depending on the presence of climate change incentives. We used Carbon Disclosure Project's supply chain program (CDP‐SCP) as our research context. To gain deeper insight into the CDP‐SCP as well as the drivers and challenges of suppliers' carbon transparency, we conducted interviews with three CDP officials, three CDP‐SCP members (i.e., buyers), and six CDP‐SCP participants (i.e., suppliers). To test our hypotheses, we used a unique dataset from CDP‐SCP and complemented it with four other archival datasets for a sample of 835 suppliers operating in 41 countries during the 2013–2015 period. The results show that suppliers <jats:italic>without</jats:italic> climate change incentives are more vulnerable to coercive and mimetic pressures, whereas suppliers <jats:italic>with</jats:italic> climate change incentives are more receptive to normative pressure in terms of how much carbon transparency they exhibit. Thus, our study proposes an extensive concept of supplier carbon transparency, provides a comprehensive analysis of its external/internal drivers, and reveals when institutional pressures are more/less effective in eliciting supplier carbon transparency. This research also provides strategies for how buyers, suppliers, and CDP can foster more carbon transparency in supply chains.</jats:p>",

The research aimed at assessing Supply Chain Practices and how they are perceived to impact the performance of firms in Sierra Leone a case study in a Telecommunication Company (Sierratel). Two paradigms of the supply chain were developed for this research. Supply chain enablers (Organization, People, Technology, Plan, Source, Deliver, Information Sharing) and supply chain non-financial performance (Flexibility, Responsiveness, Reliability and Agility). Self-administered questionnaires were sent to thirty-four respondents through google form using a simple stratified random sampling technique. Descriptive statistics is applied to analyse the data through SPSS. The findings showed differences in various supply chain practices adopted and implemented by the company. People, Technology, Delivery, Responsiveness, Reliability and Agility did not create much impact on the company’s performance. Further analysis also revealed that supply chain processes as one of the practices among the others adopted and implemented are almost in its right footpath as compared to strategy and performance but continuous improvement of supply chain practices will attain a sustainable competitive advantage and hence firm’s performance.</jats:p>",

Thirty five groundwater samples were collected and analysed for various parameters. Hydrogeochemical evolution visualized with the Gibbs diagram showed that the groundwater is mainly controlled by water–rock interactions. Factor analysis on the other hand identified three major groups of geochemical constituents and showed that weathering and anthropogenic inputs are the dominant factors controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area. Isotopic analyses revealed that oxygen-18 of groundwater (18O = −2.96 ‰ VSMOW) is close to that of rainfall (18O = −2.47), indicating that the groundwater is recharged by rainwater without evaporation. The geogenic composition of urban groundwater in Yaoundé is modified by secondary processes and anthropogenic input.</jats:p>",

However, with the acceleration of urbanization and the explosion of urban populations, the contradiction between water supply and demand in some areas, especially in big cities, has become increasingly prominent. It is simply not sufficient to rely on local conventional water resources to meet urban water demand, and a single source water supply mode has a higher vulnerability, resulting in greater safety risks in urban or regional water supply systems. Therefore, giving full play to the water supply capacity and carrying out multi-source water supplies are necessary and urgent. This paper gives an overview of the optimal allocation of multi-source for urban water supply concerning variation tendency, modeling methods and facing challenges. Based on the variation tendency of water consumption and water supply pattern in China, Tianjin is taken as a typical city for systematically outlining water supply changes and cause analysis. Subsequently, the modeling methods for proposing the optimal allocation scheme are summarized, which are composed of defining the topological relation, constructing the mathematical model and seeking the optimal solution. Ultimately, the current and emerging challenges are discussed including emergency operation of multi-source water supply and joint operation of water quality and quantity. These summaries and prospects provide a valuable reference for giving full play to the multi-source water supply capacity and carrying out relevant research so as to propose the optimal allocation scheme in urban multi-source water supply systems.</jats:p>"

On the basis of water environment capacity and total maximum daily load (TMDL) theory, water quality standards are set in accordance with the requirements of the water body function. Considering seasonal influence and the pollution load contribution rate, a total pollution load control plan and a load optimization allocation plan are proposed, in order to realize the distribution of pollution load among point source, non-point source and safety margin. According to the calculations, TMDL of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH3-N in the flood season (June–September) in the Duliujian River is the largest, about 27,005 kg/d and 2,296 kg/d, respectively. During the dry season (December–March), the reduction of COD and NH3-N is the largest, reaching 50.74% and 90.14%, respectively.

The wetlands were surveyed for pre-historic channel features, depth to groundwater surface (GWS), and subsurface salinity intrusion by ground penetrating radar (GPR) in 50 profiles, totaling 11.1 km in track line distance. Only small flood-discharge/tidal channel features (&amp;lt;10 m width and 1&amp;ndash;2 m depth) were recorded in the interior floodplain areas. GWS reflections were observed at 0.5&amp;ndash;2.0 depth, where the GPR signal was not obscured by localized salinity intrusion (~0.5 km landward distance) from the adjacent Coquille Estuary channel. Top-sealed piezometers (1.5&amp;ndash;2.0 m depth) were installed at 10 sites, where in-situ groundwaters were monitored for temperature (8.5&amp;ndash;16.5&amp;deg; C), conductivity (&amp;lt;100&amp;ndash;18,800 &amp;mu;S cm-1), and pH (2.5&amp;ndash;7.8) on a seasonal basis. Dissolved oxygen was semi-quantitatively measured (ChemSticks) at some sites, and all sites were monitored (fall, winter, summer) for GWS level. Low dissolved oxygen (DO &amp;lt;1 ppm) at four sites was of particular concern for potential discharge into small channels that were to be constructed for juvenile salmonid nursery habitat. The horizontal and vertical asymmetries of conductivity (salinity), used as a conservative groundwater source tracer, and measured GWS elevation trends (gradients) led to a four-part flow model for shallow groundwater supply in the Ni-les&amp;rsquo;tun floodplain. Freshwater supplied, in part, by hillslope discharge contributes to low pH and low DO water quality in the shallow aquifer. Saline water, supplied by subsurface salinity intrusion and evaporative capillary rise, could introduce salinity toxicity to isolated (stagnant) surface ponds. Following construction of a dense channel network (2009&amp;ndash;2011) by the Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, selected Ni-les&amp;rsquo;tun channel waters (13 sites) were monitored (2011-2012) for resulting water-quality. The tidally-connected channels generally showed improved water-quality relative to groundwater in some nearby piezometer sites. However, low-quality groundwater supply compromised some channel reaches (DO ~2.0&amp;ndash;4.7 ppm) that depended on groundwater recharge from hillslope discharge during either summer or winter conditions.</jats:p>"

The issue in the downstream development is how to map current downstream supply chain development, including current interaction between actors, so we can make a decision for future downstream development priority. This paper designs the mapping of the downstream supply chain of shallot commodities to see the interaction between actors in the shallots agorindustrial downstream supply chain network. The research method used was agent-based modeling (ABM) based modeling to determine agent behavior and its interactions in the shallots agro-industry supply chain. The structure of the agent structure in the supply chain was designed with the quadruple innovation helix (QIH) approach, which consists of 4 actors’ classifications, namely farmers, private sector, government, and universities. This research produces an interaction design that can be used as a basis for evaluating performance, added value and other aspects through the interaction behavior of each QIH actor in agent-based modeling to support downstream innovation in shallots agro-industry. Case studies in the Cirebon district of Indonesia show that the ABM and QIH models designed are able to show the form of interaction between downstream supply chain actors.</jats:p>",

Although several studies have investigated the benefits to network leaders from these systems in various industries, little attention has been paid to the delivery of substantial benefits and advantages to its partners. Based on information technology (IT) applications and SCC literature, this paper proposes a model relating partners use of SCMS to benefits. Data from 168 partners using an SCMS implemented by a leading bicycle supply chain in Taiwan to test the hypotheses that SCC and operational performance has a mediating role linking SCMS use in order to affect a partner’s performance. The results indicate that SCMS implementation has a significant impact on SCC, which in turn create a significant positive effect on operational (sustainable) performance, ultimately leading to improved growth rate and profitability in partners. Another interesting finding of the research is that SCMS cannot directly affect financial performance. In addition, from sustainable performance aspects, it is revealed that IT enables supply chain management (SCM) to achieve environmental value through information sharing (up and down), process integration (vertical and horizontal) and automation (i.e., planning, operation and control). This finding highlights the importance for maximizing benefits and sustainability for the whole supply-chain partners, the IT implementation must be integrated with the sustainable development goals and inserted in the eco-operation supply-chain platform process. The results also contribute to the debate in prior studies by disclosing why so many partners could not find to gain benefit from these IT implementations. Furthermore, this study represents the first attempt to examine how partners benefit from IT use in SCC for traditional industry.</jats:p>"

Without a fast and optimal decision for emergency control in response to sudden water pollution accidents, dispatchers or decision-makers will not be prepared to respond to the accidents during the process of an emergency spill. To address this gap, a framework for fast and optimal decision support in emergency control is reported in this paper. The proposed fast and optimal decision system covers four stages. In this study, the analytical hierarchy process integrated with grey fixed weight clustering was used to determine the gate closing mode. The emergency control strategy in ice cover formation period is presented. A case study was examined in the demonstrative project conducted in the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. The relative errors of the arrival time of the peak concentration and the peak concentration in monitoring points between the actual monitoring values and the formula calculation values are less than 18%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The quality of drinking water is a powerful environmental determinant of health. Water becomes contaminated with faecal material due to inadequate protection of the source, unhygienic practices of the community at the source, and poor household handling practices. The objective of this study was to assess the level of bacteriological contamination of drinking water supply from protected water sources to point of use and water handling practices among beneficiary households of Boloso Sore woreda, Wolaita zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey and bacteriological analysis of water were conducted in January 2019. The study included 545 households for water handling practices, and 75 samples from stored water from households and eighteen water sources were included for faecal coliform test. Data were analyzed using SPSS v21.0. Descriptive and logistic regression statistical models were used. Sixty percent of shallow wells, 60% of protected hand-dug wells, and 25% of protected on-spot springs were found positive for faecal coliform. In general, 44% of water source samples and 91% of household water samples were positive for faecal coliform. In general, 38% of households were practicing unsafe water handling practices. High school and above level of education (AOR = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.03, 11.57), getting higher monthly income (AOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.96, 5.85), households with small family size (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.83), frequency of water collection twice a day (AOR = 2.88, 95% CI:1.56, 5.33), and presence of water payments (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.72) were significantly associated with water handling practice. Unsafe water handling was a common practice in the study area, and water sources and household water storage were not free of faecal coliform, indicating noncompliance with the World Health Organization water quality guideline. Hence, capacity building is mandatory for the protection and management of water sources and safe water handling practices in the household and community.</jats:p>",

Here we report seawater concentrations of Fe, Mn, Co, Cd, and Ni alongside the redox indicator iodide/iodate in the Peruvian OMZ during the 2015 El Niño event. The El Niño drove atypical upwelling of oxygen‐enriched water over the Peruvian Shelf, resulting in oxidized iodine and strongly depleted Fe (II), total dissolved Fe, and reactive particulate Fe concentrations relative to non‐El Niño conditions. Observations of Fe were matched by the redox‐sensitive micronutrients Co and Mn, but not by non‐redox‐sensitive Cd and Ni. These observations demonstrate that oxygenation of OMZs significantly reduces water column inventories of redox‐sensitive micronutrients, with potential impacts on ocean productivity.</jats:p>",

In the research reported here we develop index measurements further so that they can be applied to food categories and be used by food processors and manufacturers for specific food supply chains. This research considers how they can be used to assess the sustainability of supply chain operations by stimulating more incisive food loss and waste reduction planning. The research demonstrates how an index driven approach focussed on improving both nutritional delivery and reducing food waste will result in improved food security and sustainability. Nutritional improvements are focussed on protein supply and reduction of food waste on supply chain losses and the methods are tested using the food systems of Kenya and India where the current research is being deployed. Innovative practices will emerge when nutritional improvement and waste reduction actions demonstrate market success, and this will result in the co-development of food manufacturing infrastructure and innovation programmes. The use of established indices of sustainability and security enable comparisons that encourage knowledge transfer and the establishment of cross-functional indices that quantify national food nutrition, security and sustainability. The research presented in this initial study is focussed on applying these indices to specific food supply chains for food processors and manufacturers.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the price strategy of competitive supply chain based on bank financing is studied when many retailers are short of funds in the competitive environment. It is found that once the market share among retailers is fixed, the wholesale price of suppliers and the selling price of retailers will gradually increase with the increase of competition intensity, regardless of whether the retailer has financial constraints or not. The greater the competition intensity among retailers is, the better the expected profit of each member of the supply chain and the system will be. Finally, with the help of numerical analysis, the validity of the conclusion is depicted and verified. The relevant conclusions enrich and develop the financing theory of competitive supply chain, providing a strong practical reference value for the fund risk management of supply chain enterprises in the competitive environment.</jats:p>",

Batch mode of adsorption experiments were carried out and the parameters investigated included agitation time, MB concentration (100–180 mg L−1) and adsorbent dose (25–200 mg/50 mL). The adsorption of MB reached equilibrium at 120 min for 100 mg L−1, 140 min for 120 mg L−1 and 160 min for other concentrations tested. Based on the Langmuir isotherm, the monolayer adsorption capacity (Q0) was found to be 500 mg g−1. The kinetic data were also fitted to the pseudo first-order, second-order and intraparticle diffusion models, and the experimental data followed closely the pseudo first-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy (ΔH° 3.86 J mol−1K−1), standard entropy (ΔS° 65.86 J mol−1K−1) and standard free energy (ΔG°) indicated the spontaneous nature of MB adsorption by ZAJHC. The adsorption was found to be endothermic in nature. Alkaline pH was favourable for the adsorption of MB. The pH effect and desorption studies suggest that ion-exchange might be the possible mechanism governing the adsorption process.</jats:p>",

By collapsing GSCI into three dimensions (i.e., green supplier integration, green internal integration, and green customer integration), this study explores an indirect GSCI‐green innovation link in which knowledge exchange and knowledge combination are deemed as mediators. We employ survey data from 237 Chinese manufacturers and structural equation modeling techniques to test research hypotheses. Our findings support the major argument that the impact of GSCI on green innovation is indirect. Specifically, green internal integration impacts green product and process innovation via both knowledge exchange and knowledge combination; while green supplier integration affects green product and process innovation indirectly only via knowledge combination and green customers integration affects green product and process innovation indirectly only via knowledge exchange. This study advances our understanding on the GSCI‐green innovation relationship.</jats:p>",

Moreover, as demonstrated in this study, the combined prediction model based on ESMD can effectively predict the non-stationary extreme runoff series, while providing reference for forecasting other non-stationary time series.</jats:p>",

Due to uncontrollable factors such as traffic congestion or bad weather conditions, the time taken for the product to be delivered from each production origin is uncertain. As the wholesale market is open for trading only in a fixed‐time window, any fresh products arriving earlier face the risk of decay, and any arriving later cannot be sold. The market demand for the product is random and follows a general distribution. We formulate the basic problem as a multi‐source selection model with random yield, taking into account the trade‐off between purchasing cost and other costs such as deterioration loss arising from delivery uncertainty. We derive the optimal order quantities from different origins and propose algorithms to search for them. We also investigate the effects of delivery uncertainty on service level and transport mode selection. Finally, we examine two extensions. One considers a capacity limit in each production origin, and the other incorporates information updating. For the first extension, we propose algorithms to compute the optimal solution based on its structural properties. For the second problem, we derive the optimal purchasing policy according to updated information such as details of the arrivals of previous orders.</jats:p>",

Households in more urban (as compared to rural) cells were more likely to use improved water sources (including piped water on-premises), make regular payments for water, rely on shared sanitation facilities, and make use of manual sludge emptying services. Most households (72%) used an unlined pit latrine not intended for emptying and reuse. These findings suggest that small town servicing models should prioritize non-sewered sanitation management, including incentives for safe excreta containment and disposal opportunities.

The studies were conducted in the territory of the village of Chud Navashinsky district of the Nizhny Novgorod region, subject to karst-suffusion processes. The hydrogeological characteristic of the study area is determined; the generalized characteristics of the seasonal fluctuations of the river flow are calculated. The development of karst processes in the study area is assessed. It has been determined that during the year, the period of spring flood on the Oka River has the greatest impact on landfall formation. It has been established that unauthorized dumps of municipal solid waste located in the karst zones of the Chud village affect the chemical composition and increase the total salinity of groundwater used for decentralized water supply.

Nevertheless, there has not been enough focus on how managers, employees, and stakeholders respond to the tensions caused by contradictions and how they try to reach a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating how members of an agricultural cooperative in the Apulia region (Italy) try to join the organizational forms of business and social values, namely, the sustainable practices related to CO2 emission reduction, resource use efficiency, and food waste mitigation. Additionally, the study goes further and explores whether and how these contradictory pressures are solved. Starting from the sensemaking approach, the study carried out an inductive case study through the use of a multiple case study design and in-depth interviews. The findings highlight the following two novel aspects: (1) Managers prefer to adopt a cumulative mitigating hybridization approach and (2) a weak integration can be noticed between social and commercial dimensions, originating from a lack of holistic perspective and poor interorganizational communication.</jats:p>"

Though many studies assess embryo responses to long‐term (i.e., chronic), constant incubation temperatures, few assess responses to acute exposures which are more relevant for many species. We subjected brown anole (<jats:italic>Anolis sagrei</jats:italic>) eggs to heat shocks, thermal ramps, and extreme diurnal fluctuations to determine the lethal temperature of embryos, measure the thermal sensitivity of embryo heart rate and metabolism, and quantify the effects of sublethal but stressful temperatures on development and hatchling phenotypes and survival.

These data indicate a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at high temperatures. Exposure to extreme, diurnal fluctuations depressed embryo developmental rates and heart rates, and resulted in hatchlings with smaller body size, reduced growth rates, and lower survival in the laboratory. Thus, even brief exposure to extreme temperatures can have important effects on embryo development, and our study highlights the role of both immediate and cumulative effects of high temperatures on egg survival. Such effects must be considered to predict how populations will respond to global change.</jats:p>",

Les protocoles mis en oeuvre ont permis de développer une modélisation à partir de l’absorbance UV à 254 nm. L’équation cinétique de production permet d’évaluer précisément les concentrations en THM totaux à moyen et long termes sur une gamme étendue de températures : 7 à 25°C. Le modèle intègre le « bromide incorporation factor », indice de caractérisation de l’état bromé, qui permet d’exprimer les résultats en unité de masse de THM totaux. L’applicabilité du modèle à d’autres groupes d’eaux est également présentée.</jats:p>",

In this manner, the sedimentary record of fossil coastal dunes in Sri Lanka provides evidence for environmental and climatic changes during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. As yet, these environmental shifts are poorly resolved because the sedimentary facies and their depositional architecture have not been studied and only very few age constraints are available. Facies analysis of a lithological section at the Point Kurdimalai sea cliff in the Wilpattu National Park (NW Sri Lanka) reveals a striking resemblance to the stratigraphic succession associated with the Teri Sands in southeastern India, which is better dated. The reason is that deposition occurred under the same geological, climatic and geomorphological conditions in the two regions. This special situation allows for litho‐ and climate stratigraphic correlations across the Gulf of Mannar and links the landscape evolution at Point Kudrimalai to late Quaternary climatic events and sea‐level changes. Our results show that the formation of red coastal dunes (Red Beds) in Sri Lanka was a multi‐phase process across the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary and hence the differentiation between an Older Group of Plio‐Pleistocene age (including the Red Beds) and a Younger Group of Holocene age in the Quaternary stratigraphic chart for Sri Lanka is not justified.</jats:p>",

We measured the temporal patterns of the soil profile mineral N and PAW to 100 cm depth, wheat aerial biomass and N uptake in both years.

In a below average rainfall season, wheat biomass produced on lupin residues was responsive to N input with soil profile mineral N depleted by increased crop N uptake early in the season. In an above average rainfall season, a higher soil mineral N supply increased actual and potential grain yield, total biomass, N uptake, harvest index and water use efficiency of wheat, regardless of the source of N. Our study showed that the combination of lupin residues with high N rate increased soil profile mineral N at early growth stages, providing a greater soil N supply at the time of high wheat N demand, and the inclusion of a legume in the rotation is critical for improving the N supply to wheat, with added disease break benefits in a low‐rainfall sandy soil environment.</jats:p>",

In this study, the radon concentrations of 15 different brands of bottled drinking water and their radiological hazards were measured and evaluated. The results indicate that the concentration range of radon in water is 13.3 ± 4.7 to 300.0 ± 21.6 mBq/L, and is lower than the limit level (11.11 Bq/L). The results compared with radon concentrations from other countries or regions show that the radon concentrations in this study are almost within the range of those of all the others. The average annual effective dose for infants, children and adults in the three age-groups is 0.657, 0.535 and 0.665 μSv/y respectively, which is lower than the recommended level of 0.1 mSv/y. The results also show that the bottled water does not pose a major health hazard to the public. Moreover, combined with statistical analysis, it is concluded that the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) and Ca2+ in bottled mineral water has a strong correlation with the radon concentration in the water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to protect the environment and reduce energy consumption, new energy vehicles have begun to be vigorously promoted in various countries. In recent years, the rise of intelligent technology has had a great impact on the supply chain of new energy vehicles, which, coupled with the complexity of the supply chain itself, puts it at great risk. Therefore, it is quite indispensable to evaluate the risk of the new energy vehicle supply chain. This paper assesses the risks faced by China’s new energy vehicle supply chain in this period of technological transformation. First of all, this paper establishes an evaluation criteria system of 16 sub-criterion related to three dimensions: the market risk, operational risk, and the environmental risk. Then, variable weight theory is proposed to modify the constant weight obtained by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Finally, a risk assessment of China’s new energy vehicle supply chain is carried out by combining the variable weight and the cloud model. This method can effectively explain the randomness of matters, and avoid the influence of value abnormality on the criteria system. The results show that China’s new energy vehicle supply chain is at a high level. Through the identification of risk factors, mainly referring to the low clustering risk, technical level risk and information transparency risk, this paper can provide a risk prevention reference for corresponding enterprises.</jats:p>"

There was an interaction only between the cactus pear silage level and water offerings for drinking water. Goats fed 42% cactus pear silage had greater intake of non-fibrous carbohydrates, energy, Ca, Mg and Na minerals, water intake, urinary water excretion, body water retention and nutrient digestibility. Cactus pear silage inclusion up to a 42% rate reduced eating and ruminating time and increased the time spent idling as well as the eating and the ruminating efficiency rate. Water restriction at 48 h reduced drinking water intake. Performance and blood metabolites were not affected by cactus silage inclusion or water offering. Cactus pear silage inclusion at up to 42% for goats is recommended during periods of water shortage in semiarid and arid regions because it improves eating, the ruminating efficiency rate, and body water retention; cactus pear silage inclusion at this rate reduces water consumption and it does not affect the performance or health of the animals.</jats:p>"

Container B with no CWI was planted with Sedum lineare Thunb. Results indicated that CWI could increase soil water content and make the variation of soil water content gentle in the containers on the roof. The green roof with rain storage had the function of heat preservation in winter and cooling effect in summer, especially for the green roof with CWI. Compared with container B, container A gave better plant growth, for ‘steering wheel’ microfiber CWI can basically provide automatic and suitable water supply for the plant.

This paper evaluates the safe yield of groundwater in suitable areas using a numerical model of groundwater flow and discusses the influence of RBF on the temporal variation of regional hydraulic heads, groundwater flow, river flow, and groundwater–surface water interaction (GSI) under different precipitation frequencies from 20% to 95% along the Second Songhua River in Northeast China. This study shows that the potential of RBF is enormous and that the total safe yield of groundwater abstraction was 29.56 × 104 m3/day under the precipitation frequency of 95%. The direction of regional groundwater flow was not obviously changed except within the local groundwater flow field under the maximum safe yield pumping conditions. When the precipitation frequencies are higher than 75%, the direction of the GSI might be changed, and the rate of river recharge of groundwater is enhanced. The water quantity that would be captured from the river does not threaten the safety of the river ecology. It is concluded that there were no obvious adverse impacts of the large scale of RBF on regional water resources in the Second Songhua River area.</jats:p>",

P scarcity invokes differential expression of genes involved in processing of most if not all elements encompassing an individual (the ionome). Whether such ionome‐wide adjustments to P supply impact growth and trophic interactions remains unclear. We quantified the ionomes of a resource‐consumer pair in contrasting P supply conditions. Consumer growth penalty was driven by not only P imbalance between trophic levels but also imbalances in other elements, reflecting complex physiological adjustments made by both the resource and the consumer. Mitigating such imbalances requires energy and should impact the efficiency at which assimilated nutrients are converted to biomass. Correlated shifts in the handling of multiple elements, and variation in the supplies of such elements could underlie vast heterogeneity in the rates at which organisms and ecosystems accrue biomass as a function of P supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a two‐stage decision problem, namely, the allocation and deployment of reserved inventories (RIs) in a supply network with random demand surges. The demand surge follows a time‐dependent stochastic process and our objective is to minimize the expected total unmet demand in the presence of positive transshipment lead times. We first solve the optimal deployment problem given that the demand surges have occurred at some locations. We show that the optimal deployment policy is a “nested” policy with respect to the shadow price at each location, where a shadow price represents the marginal reduction of the expected total unmet demand due to a marginal increase of RIs. Specifically, locations with higher shadow prices have higher priority in inventory allocation. We then consider the optimal allocation problem in the pre‐positioning stage. We show that under certain conditions the optimal allocation is increasing in the total amount of RIs. We introduce a new stochastic order for distributions defined on sets called the first‐order stochastic dominance and use it to show that the expected total unmet demand is higher when one of the following is true: the demand surges tend to occur simultaneously at more locations, the post‐surge delivery takes a longer time, more demand arrives earlier, or the demand has a higher volatility. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a quantitative evaluation method to measure the efficiency of the individual nongovernmental 3PL firms and explore the valuable information for the management of 3PL business with Apriori and K-means. Taking TopChains (an emerging nongovernmental 3PL company) as an example, the monthly supply and demand (S&amp;D) level and matching degree were evaluated via the integrating data mining algorithm (i.e., Apriori and K-means) and TOPSIS entropy weight method based on historical data. The findings demonstrate that the S&amp;D level varied with time and space, and the customer demand in February tended to reduce substantially. Besides, the outcome of S&amp;D matching degree in June is undesirable, indicating the unsatisfactory efficiency in resource management. The evaluation maneuver stated in this study can serve as a valuable tool to measure individual nongovernmental 3PL enterprises’ efficiency in terms of S&amp;D, and for reference, the results can aid in rational enterprise investment plan. Besides, this attempt broadened the direction of ARM and K-means being applied in the logistics field.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the influence elements of water resource carrying capacity in Shiyang River Basin are detected by the geographical detector. The results show that: (1) In terms of the spatial dimension, water resources in Shiyang River Basin are not in accordance with the distribution of social and economic development and population distribution, presenting a prominent contradiction between supply and demand of water resources; (2) in terms of the temporal dimension, the pressure on water resources in Shiyang River Basin has gradually increased, and the area of overload, light overload and serious overload has been augmented; (3) the geographical detector indicates that the influences of the water resources system and coordinating system factors are declining, and the influences of the social economy system and ecological factor are obviously increasing. The influences of the interaction with any two factors are stronger than that of a single factor, and the synergistic influences of two factors are aggravated.</jats:p>",

Global hydroclimatic conditions have been substantially altered over the\npast century by anthropogenic influences that arise from the warming global\nclimate and from local/regional anthropogenic disturbances. Traditionally,\nstudies have used coupling of multiple models to understand how land-surface water fluxes vary due to changes in global climatic patterns and local land-use changes. We argue that because the basis of the Budyko framework relies on the supply and demand concept, the framework could be effectively adapted and extended to quantify the role of drivers – both changing climate and local human disturbances – in altering the land-surface response across the globe. We review the Budyko framework, along with these potential extensions, with the intent of furthering the applicability of the framework to emerging hydrologic questions. Challenges in extending the Budyko framework over various spatio-temporal scales and the use of global datasets to evaluate the water balance at these various scales are also discussed.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, due to the cost of collecting consumers’ knowledge, the wholesale price contract can no longer coordinate supply chain members effectively. It is necessary to study the problem how the retailers are encouraged to make more efforts for the cooperative innovation with manufacturers. This paper introduces two dynamic incentive contracts for improving collaborative innovation level in a two-player supply chain, and the impacts of these contracts on supply chain’s performance are investigated, by using a Stackelberg differential game model. The manufacturer, as a Stackelberg leader, determines the R&amp;D investment while the retailer is responsible for the retail price and the efforts in collection of the consumer’s information (or preference) to the products. The model incorporates a wholesale price contract and two incentive contracts to better understand how the manufacturer can facilitate the retailer’s efforts in the collection of consumer’s information and increase the profits of the members of supply chain. Our results suggest that the optimal profit of the supply chain, the retailer’s efforts in the collection of consumer’s knowledge, the retail price, and the innovation level under the reward incentive contract are higher than their counterparts in other contracts. In particular, the retailer’s optimal effort under the reward incentive contract is even higher than the one in the centralized decision scenario. However, if the manufacturer commits an effort target to the retailer, it shows that the retailer’s optimal effort is independent of the target. The manufacturer’s optimal R&amp;D investments are constants in the three contracts under the dynamic setting. Furthermore, numerical simulations show that the effort target has little impact on profits of the supply chain although it affects the decision making of supply chain members to some extent, whereas the retailer’s marginal reward offered by the manufacturer influences the innovation level of product and the supply chain’s profit significantly.</jats:p>",

Addition of a substance having redox activity can form an electron shuttle cycle between Fe(III) oxide and the microorganism, which can not only enhance the bioavailability of Fe(III) and accelerate electron transfer, but also improve the removal efficiency of contaminants. This paper compares and analyzes several common redox active substances, for their promoting effect and limiting factors of Fe(III) bioavailability. Moreover, the mechanism by which the electron shuttle promotes the bioavailability of Fe(III) oxide is discussed. This review demonstrates that the electron shuttle promotes the Fe(III) bioreaction process for the degradation and removal of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, azo dyes and other pollutants, which is of great environmental significance.</jats:p>",

Variations in vegetation morphology produce changes in the mechanical and fluid characteristics of overland flow. Determining the effects of vegetation lodging on the overland runoff flow regime and resistance is a prerequisite for accurately simulating overland runoff and convergence, revealing the mechanism of overland flow propagation, and the design and management of vegetation protection, soil consolidation, and ecological slope engineering. To systematically study the effects of vegetation lodging on overland runoff, four planting vegetation lodging angles (α) and 10 test water depths were used to simulate experimental research with a 1.0% slope ratio. Experimental results show that the depth and state of vegetation inundation and the degree of lodging significantly influence the flow regime and resistance. Under the same water depth, higher values of α are associated with higher values of the flow velocity, Reynolds number, Froude number, and Darcy–Weisbach resistance coefficient (f), and lower values of the drag coefficient (CD). The overall result is enhanced turbulence in the flow field and weaker flow resistance. Numerical statistics and difference analysis indicate that, when the vegetation is non-submerged, a 10° increase in α produces a 9.30% decrease in f. In the submerged state, a 10° increase in α causes a 26.70% decrease in f. CD is greatly affected by the boundary water depth. Below some critical water depths, an increase of 10° in α reduces CD by 8.48%. Above the critical depth, a 10° increase in α decreases CD by 41.10%.</jats:p>",

Due to the “hukou” system, interprovincial migrants in the urban districts are put in a weak position and become the disadvantaged.

The bottlenecks in ever exploiting benefits such as e-Life, to name a few at Mobile Equipment Providers (MEP) tiers, are complemented at Device Dependent Device Independent (D3I) configurations inherent at various tiers of Mobile Service Providers (MSP). While enabling a Supply Chain Management (SCM) augments a unique system support involving the MSPs and MEPs for desired Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Ad hoc Resource Planning (ARP), which we found prevalent in migration scenario from 4G to 5G technology deployment. Despite its complexity both in term of one-to-many and many-to-one across diverse MSP and MEP options, SCM operational objectives sets forth a unique challenge, hence is the main objective for our work presented here. In this paper, we presented a framework to enhance the 4G legacy in mobile service provider capacity for smart city Machine-to-Machine (M2M) backbone. The migration process is assessed with proposed strategic, technical and operational indicators, which demonstrate its adaptability and flexibility while integrating in conventional 4G deployments, especially taking into account radio devices and applications. Web-enabled Software Define Radio devices and applications are used to index the migration cost and support SCM planning and execution. We identify, the decentralization of mobile service providers infrastructure plays a major role in reducing the embedded complexity which often appears as primary bottleneck. MSP as a key player in the elasticity of migration, we presented a platform to support large as well as low MEP-MSP co-deployments. Pareto multi-criteria optimization is used to find the strategic indicators which are primary Transformation Steering Factors (TSF), valid in both device dependent or device independent M2M migration. We expose our result for achieving TSF, while rolling interoperability and reconfiguration of device deployed in a typical volatile inter-MSP or intra-MSPs tiers. Pareto Migration Indicators (MI) are optimized successively progressing across the transformation schemes; relative to base-line MSP services, hence enabling a lucrative choice while elasticity of provider-centric cost depends adaptively on technology legacy and M2M access of User Equipment (UE).</jats:p>"

Seven Temples d’étape, six Fire Shrines, and 25 masonry bridges were constructed along the East Royal Road to Preah Khan of Kompong Svay. We conducted measurements of magnetic susceptibility and chemical composition of laterite blocks and magnetic susceptibility of sandstone blocks used for the construction of the bridges to determine the supply ranges of the stone blocks and the construction ages based on the results obtained in this study and previous studies of Temples d’étape and Fire Shrines. The results suggest that most of the sandstone blocks for the bridge balustrades were supplied from quarries in the southeastern foothills of Kulen Mountain, but that the bridges close to Preah Khan of Kompong Svay have sandstone balustrades supplied from nearby quarries. In contrast, cluster and principal component analyses and t-tests using data for chemical composition and magnetic susceptibility of laterite blocks revealed that there were five sources of supply. These results elucidated that the supply ranges of laterite blocks were narrower than those of the sandstone blocks. Judging from magnetic susceptibilities, supply ranges, shapes, orientations of bedding planes, and stacking methods of the stone blocks, it was concluded that the construction age of the bridges is highly likely to have been in the early Angkor Wat period.</jats:p>"

An important question is how to expand public knowledge about consumer experience with a new product by using promotion strategies. This paper discusses the impact of advance selling strategies on a three-echelon supply chain when upstream enterprises launch a new product facing strategic consumers under social influence. This problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game, and a two-advance-selling-discount model is presented. Furthermore, we consider the impact of advance purchase behavior on the financing strategy when the retailer places an advance order. Several results are obtained: (i) the consumers’ utility in the second period is increasing in the number of predecessors. (ii) Upstream enterprises will provide deeper advance selling discounts when consumers become more patient or predecessors have a greater influence on imitators. Moreover, the total demand will increase when the consumer’s discount factor decreases or the impact intensity of predecessors increases. However, high innovation levels will drive enterprises to set high advance selling discounts. We also obtain the condition under which the total demand increases quickly as the innovation level changes. (iii) The two-advance-selling-discount model yields Pareto-improved results compared with the case where there is no advance purchase, though it cannot coordinate the supply chain. Finally, we extend the model to analyze the two-advance-selling-discount model with a minimum order quantity constraining the precommitted order quantity, and we show this can allow the enterprises to increase their profits. We also determine a condition under which the upstream enterprises should put a constraint on the minimum order quantity.</jats:p>",

This study characterized household storage practices and stored water quality in 94 households (N = 94) among four peri-urban neighborhoods in Arraiján, Panama with varying degrees of supply intermittency. We found that 18 (19.1%) households stored drinking water in unsafe containers. Forty-four (47%) samples of household stored drinking water had residual chlorine levels &amp;lt;0.2 mg/L. While 33 (35.1%) samples were positive for total coliform bacteria, only 23 (24.4%) had &amp;gt;10 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL total coliform bacteria. Eight (44%) samples were positive for Escherichia coli, whereas only one (1.3%) sample from the safe containers was positive. Twenty-nine (30.9%) samples had &amp;gt;500 MPN/mL heterotrophic plate count bacteria. These findings suggest that longer supply interruptions were associated with longer storage times and lower chlorine residual, which were associated with higher concentrations of indicator bacteria. This is one of the first studies in the Central-American region to show an association between the lack of turnover (replacement with fresh water) and greater contamination during household water storage. Thus, when drinking water supply is not completely continuous and household storage is required, decreasing the time between supply periods can facilitate safer water storage. Public awareness and education are also recommended to increase hygiene practices during water collection and storage.</jats:p>",

Data collected from 113 manufacturing firms in China reveal that distributive justice negatively moderates the relationship between internal and external integration, but positively moderates the relationship between external integration and firm performance. By contrast, procedural justice positively moderates the relationship between internal and external integration, yet insignificantly moderates the relationship between external integration and firm performance.

The Sinos River has an average concentration of 0.0735 mg.L-1 of F. But the F of both the water treated by the ETA of SL as well as in the final consumers of SL had concentrations above 0.9 mg.L-1 (State Ordinance No. 10/1999). In addition, we verified the presence of Pb and Cr (VI) in all types of water. The results with the animals showed a significant difference in T3 (p=0.032) and in T4 (p=0.043) from G3 to G1. In TAC, the difference was significant from G2 to G1 and G3 (p=0.007), showing that F and F with Pb interfere with the endocrine and antioxidant functions of rats. In addition, the fact that there are water fluoridation failures shows that the population is exposed to health risks. We confirm that drinking water fluoridation needs to be demystified and reconsidered as a public health intervention.</jats:p>"

We describe the metabolic engineering of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> to enhance mevalonate production from glucose and cellobiose. First, the mevalonate‐producing pathway was introduced into <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> and the expression of the gene <jats:italic>atoB</jats:italic>, which encodes the gene for acetoacetyl‐CoA synthetase, was increased. Then, the deletion of the <jats:italic>pgi</jats:italic> gene, which encodes phosphoglucose isomerase, increased the NADPH/NADP<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratio in the cells but did not improve mevalonate production. Alternatively, to reduce flux toward the tricarboxylic acid cycle, <jats:italic>gltA</jats:italic>, which encodes citrate synthetase, was disrupted. The resultant strain, MGΔgltA‐MV, increased levels of intracellular acetyl‐CoA up to sevenfold higher than the wild‐type strain. This strain produced 8.0 g/L of mevalonate from 20 g/L of glucose. We also engineered the sugar supply by displaying β‐glucosidase (BGL) on the cell surface. When cellobiose was used as carbon source, the strain lacking <jats:italic>gnd</jats:italic> displaying BGL efficiently consumed cellobiose and produced mevalonate at 5.7 g/L. The yield of mevalonate was 0.25 g/g glucose (1 g of cellobiose corresponds to 1.1 g of glucose). These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing mevalonate from cellobiose or cellooligosaccharides using an engineered <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> strain.</jats:p>",

To accomplish this, it firstly shows that the three-echelon LSSC can lead to global optimum under the centralized decision-making scenario and then deploys the contract coordination schemes, including revenue sharing, cost sharing, and unit delivery price contracts, in three semicentralized alliances, so as to achieve the same performance of the centralized decision-making scenario, in which each party in the LSSC can achieve the win-win situation. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed coordination strategies.

Wildfires may cause considerable direct and indirect effects on the local water cycle, but the influence on groundwater quality is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the chemistry of several springs connected to small public supply systems in a peri-urban area, following a large wildfire that took place in October 2017. Groundwater samples were collected in four springs that emerged within burned forests, while control samples were from one spring located in an unburned area. Sampling took place from October 2017 until September 2018, starting 15 days after the wildfire occurrence, to evaluate the influence of the time after fire and the effect of precipitation events on groundwater composition. Groundwater samples collected in burned areas presented increased content of sulfate, fluoride and nitrogen and variability in pH values. Iron, manganese and chromium contents also increased during the sampling period. Post-fire concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mainly the carcinogenic ones, increased especially after intense winter and spring rain events, but the levels did not exceed the guideline values for drinking water.</jats:p>"

Localized delivery of therapeutics directly into the kidney, via its arterial blood supply, has the potential to enhance their therapeutic efficacy while limiting side effects associated with conventional systemic delivery. Targeted delivery in humans is feasible given that we can access the renal arterial blood supply using minimally invasive endovascular techniques and imaging guidance. However, there is currently no described way to reproduce or mimic this approach in a small animal model. Here, we develop in mice a reproducible microsurgical technique for the delivery of therapeutics directly into each kidney, via its arterial blood supply. Using our technique, intra-arterially (IA) injected tattoo dye homogenously stained both kidneys, without staining any other organ. Survival studies showed no resulting mortality or iatrogenic kidney injury. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our technique in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). IA injection of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) successfully reversed AKI, with reduced physiological and molecular markers of kidney injury, attenuated inflammation, and restoration of proliferation and regeneration markers. This reproducible delivery technique will allow for further pre-clinical translational studies investigating other therapies for the treatment of renal pathologies.</jats:p>"

First, the different main fault modes in the aircraft power supply system are set on the control interface. Then, through the simulation model established on SIMPLORER, the aircraft power supply system power supply logic simulation is realized in the set fault mode. Finally, the simulation result is sent to the MATLAB to complete an identification process by using support vector machine method. The final state of each component and the identification result are shown in the control interface.

It is premised on the double lines of online service platform and offline recycling service system, thus forming a pattern of online disposal and offline trading. This mode is capable of integrating upstream and downstream resources on the network platform, creating a recycling and processing mode for the entire industry chain of waste sorting, and developing a circular development mode featuring “resources-products-waste-renewable resources” to realize the recycling of resources. In this paper, the abovementioned recycling mode is constructed using the dynamic method. Taking the recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) as an example, on the basis of the original recycling, an online recycling mode is added and the e-waste is reprocessed by means of classification. Besides, the final process of manufacturing is put into the market for new products. By comparing the efficiency of different classification processing channels and the efficiency of O2O recycling, it was found out that the higher the product quality, the higher the recycling efficiency, and the efficiency of online recycling was concluded due to offline recycling. The system effect is evaluated according to the environmental index. In addition, this paper demonstrates the applicability of the mode by introducing Gree Corp. The results of this research are believed as contributory to improving the efficiency of recycling and remanufacturing at corporate level.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dry land-based catfish fishery is one of the promising rural aquabusiness in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta. There are several problems in this business, for example, supply-demand balancing, calculation accuracy of production capacity, and equitable profit distribution to each stakeholder. This research aimed to design a closed-loop supply chain of dry-land catfish industrial-fishery model by employing the system dynamics approach. Powesim Studio 7 coupled MINITAB 14 was applied to measure the robustness of the supply chain management system, to predict optimum production capacity, and to balance profit distribution. A financial analysis was also performed to determine business feasibility. Three scenarios of price were created by considering the predicted trend of catfish consumption and formulated three alternative prices by appraising the juvenile fish production, aquaculture practices, local feedstock manufactured by farmers, and fish-by products distributed by small-enterprises. Those consideration units were constructed of four observed models. The highest profit to stakeholder was obtained by scenario III that was directed to increase the juvenile fish price to Rp 240/fish, consumption-sized fish at the price of Rp 18,000/kg, fish-by product at the price of Rp 150,000/kg, and local feed at the price of Rp 9,000/kg. According to financial analysis, the four subsystems in dry land-based catfish aquabusiness were all feasible by BCR&gt;1; PP was 5-9 years, NPV&gt;0, PI&gt;1, and IRR&gt;15%/year. The implementation of the system required synergetic action among policymakers, farmer cooperative, and local innovation centers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As information and communication technology evolves and expands, business and markets are linked to form a complex international network, thus generating plenty of cross-border trading activities in the supply chain network. Through the observations from a typical cross-border supply chain network, this paper introduces the fuzzy reliability-oriented 2-hub center problem with cluster-based policy, which is a special case of the well-studied hub location problem (HLP). This problem differs from the classical HLP in the sense that (i) the hub-and-spoke (H&amp;S) network is grouped into two clusters in advance based on their cross-border geographic features, and (ii) a fuzzy reliability optimization approach based on the possibility measure is developed. The proposed problem is first modeled through a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation that maximizes the reliability of the entire cross-border supply chain network. Then, some linearization techniques are implemented to derive a linear model, which can be efficiently solved by exact algorithms run by CPLEX for only small instances. To counteract the difficulty for solving the proposed problem in realistic-sized instances, a tabu search (TS) algorithm with two types of move operators (called “Swap I” and “Swap II”) is further developed. Finally, a series of numerical experiments based on the Turkish network and randomly generated large-scale datasets are set up to verify the applicability of the proposed model as well as the superiority of the TS algorithm compared to the CPLEX.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Microcystis sp. is one of the most studied genus of cyanobacteria worldwide. Once it has been identified in raw water, frequent analyses of cell density and toxic metabolites (microcystins) are recommended at the water treatment plants. However, both analytical procedures are highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, allowing the potentially contaminated finished water to reach customers. The identification of easily measurable parameters related to toxin production, preferably by on-line equipment, would mitigate this issue and help water companies to improve water safety and decrease operating costs. However, these devices still have precision limitations and need efficient mathematical models for converting light signals into cyanobacteria densities or cyanotoxin concentrations. In this scenario, this research aimed to develop a mathematical correlation between microcystin production and cell age and density, chlorophyll-a, pheophytin and phycocyanin in a Microcystis aeruginosa culture using a multiple linear regression model. Despite the significant correlation (p &amp;lt; 0.05) found between all the variables and total microcystin, a simplified and precise model (Adjusted R2 = 0.824) involving only phycocyanin and pheophytin concentrations was developed in order to provide an initial attempt to easily and cheaply predict microcystin concentration in raw water.</jats:p>",
