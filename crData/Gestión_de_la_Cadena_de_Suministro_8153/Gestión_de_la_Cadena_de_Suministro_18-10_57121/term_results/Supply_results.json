      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines supply chain power in the context of real earnings management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content>), instances in which executives execute (or forego) operations transactions for the sole purpose of meeting or beating earnings targets. We examine whether powerful major customers in supply chains exploit their positions to engage in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> to a greater degree than less powerful firms. We also examine (1) whether the stock market reacts differently to major customers’ and nonmajor customers’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content>, (2) whether any difference exists between major customers’ and nonmajor customers’ post‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> financial performance, and (3) how suppliers are impacted by their major customers’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> behavior. Results suggest that major customers exploit their supply chain power to engage in more <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content>. In contrast to the skeptical stock market reaction when other firms engage in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content>, we find no evidence that major customers’ earnings are discounted when there is evidence of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content>. Instead, the market appears to interpret major customers’ behavior as “legitimate” uses of power in supply chain management, rather than <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> typically considered to be value‐destroying. Further, we find that in post‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> periods, major customers that engage in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> exhibit better operating cash flow performance than nonmajor customers who do so. These findings suggest that the consequential costs of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> are lower for major customers than for nonmajor customers. Finally, we report evidence that the particular form of major customers’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> appears to determine the impact on their suppliers. Suppliers’ financial performance deteriorates when major customers’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">REM</jats:styled-content> entails discretionary expense cuts. These findings offer new insights into the benefits and uses of power in supply chain relationships, in a previously unexplored context. We discuss the implications of the findings for future research.</jats:p>",

To explore this; the study introduces SCC in a three-phase competitive advantages model adopted from the Barney 1995 model (with slight differences). Smart PLS 3.0 software package was adopted to carry out multi-variable data analysis.

Indeed, the study covered China, which is seen to be a communist-based economy. Another study’s limitation is that it narrows its data collection to disaster prone areas as documented by Guha-Sapir et al. (2012). Consequently, the findings of this study might be only applicable to areas that experience significant level of disruptions usually caused by disaster incidents.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study is also the first of its kind to propose a model for automobile manufacturing in disaster prone regions. This is done by introducing SCC as an economic, social and political factor, while risk ranking is introduced as an environmental factor to constitute the external changes that Barney 1995 introduced.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Several researchers have been argued that agility has become a prime driver of competitiveness. However, agility with respect to supply chain was not extensively studied, especially less attention was paid to empirical work. This article attempts to fulfill such need by investigating the relationship between supply chain agility (SCA) and organizational performance (OP) in the context of Iran. Primary data were collected through surveys distribution to 500 SC managers of all levels in Iranian SMEs. Subsequently, hypotheses were tested through SPSS and Structure Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed a positive relationship between SCA and OP along with positive relationships of each dimension of SCA (e.g., alertness, decisiveness, flexibility, accessibility, and swiftness). This article ensures that organizational OP might be improved by focusing SCA in the today's competitive environment.</jats:p>",

Yet, past evidence suggests that the adoption of supply chain technology does not guarantee enhanced supply chain operational performance. Drawing from the Resource Based View, this study found that information technology (IT) capability enabled supply chain technology adoption in achieving supply chain operational performance. Supply chain technology serves as a system in transforming IT capability into a higher value resources for an organization. The adoption of supply chain technology in managing supply chain deserved attention from researchers and practitioners, because business benefits from supply chain technology adoption improve firmâ€™s supply chain performances which enhance reliability, improve responsiveness, increase agility, and minimize cost in operation functions. This study provides a unique theoretical framework intended to aid researchers and practitioners develop a more thorough understanding of the linkages between information technology capability, supply chain technology adoption, and supply chain operational performance. The total of 201 questionnaires were sent to Malaysia's textile and apparel company that is listed in the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) and Malaysian External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE) directory. The total of 121 usable responses were obtained and analyzed through Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The discussion of this study is followed by presenting the results of the survey on the relationship of IT capability on supply chain technology adoption and supply chain operational performance. The results shown that supply chain technology adoption is mediating the relationship between IT capability and supply chain operation performance.Â Â </jats:p>"

Around 80% of the world trade by volume, and 70% by value, is done by sea and is managed by seaports across the globe. It is evident that managing the pressures of sustainability is one of the critical challenges for creating value and ensuring growth across all businesses. Port and maritime industry is required to ensure high level of accountability and transparency on sustainability concerns including waste management, climate change and global warming, energy efficiency, employee health, safety and security, impacts on local society and coastal and local environmental health. Because of the global nature of the port and maritime sector, it encounters more challenges in improving sustainability performance. This chapter covers sustainable port and maritime logistics. It starts by presenting an overview of logistics, supply chain management and maritime logistics. The second section discusses sustainability in the context of supply chain and logistics management. The third section explicates green port and maritime logistics aspects. The fourth identifies sustainability issues and introduces an integrated framework for sustainable port and maritime logistics. It wraps up with a brief section on suggested areas for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Alternative food movements have, from their origins, espoused values of social justice and environmental stewardship in an attempt to challenge existing economic and social norms related to food and farming. Three alternative food movements in North America exemplify the trade-offs between the three pillars of sustainable development: social equity, environment, and economy. Organic food has brought environmental benefits, but has struggled to challenge the status quo and promote the social benefits of the original movement when it goes to scale. Farmers’ markets have brought social and environmental benefits, but only in some cases reduced costs when compared to mainstream market levels. Consequently, good-quality food is often out of reach of low-income groups, as highlighted in a case study of access by underserved people in British Columbia, Canada. Regional food movements are a hybrid approach that balance some of the gains and some of the challenges of these systems. The extraordinary concentration of power in North American food systems stands in contrast to notions of social equity and undermines efforts to effect change in pursuit of sustainable alternative food systems.</p>",

Whereas in some countries at the end of the 1940s blood transfusion services were in an early stage of development, in England and Wales they had been expanded earlier. The effects of the Second World War, particularly the large quantities of blood required to deal adequately with the expected and actual civilian air raid casualties, greatly stimulated the growth of a blood transfusion service on a national scale. Unfortunately, it is not possible to present any series of statistics for the United States similar to those provided for England and Wales. It is not even possible to estimate with any degree of precision the total annual volume of blood collections, transfusions, and wastage.</p>",

Since Nakamoto invented the concept of blockchain together with its first application called “Bitcoin”, the topic of blockchain has been inundated with the booming of cryptocurrencies. People expect this novel distributed ledger technology to bring a revolution to the entire industry and thereby grab the opportunity to expand and strengthen their business. The supply chain is treated as a typical use case to adopt blockchain and relevant technologies in many previous studies. In this paper, we conduct an interdisciplinary study on business supply chain management and the latest distributed ledger technology. In accordance with our discussion and experiments, we list three major benefits that the adoption of blockchain is able to bring to contemporary supply chain management. Meanwhile, we also identify a few of challenges that the nowadays blockchain application could not effectively excel, and the potential mitigation to those challenges as well.</jats:p>",

To ensure effective decisions are made, this paper presents a fuzzy multicriteria analysis model for evaluating the performance of IoT based supply chain. The inherent uncertainty and imprecision of the performance evaluation process is adequately handled by using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. A new algorithm is developed for determining the overall performance index for each alternative across all criteria. The development of the fuzzy multicriteria group decision making model provides organizations with the ability to effectively evaluate the performance of their IoT based supply chains for improving their competitiveness. An example is presented for demonstrating the applicability of the model for dealing with real world IoT-based performance evaluation problems.</jats:p>"

It includes three main components: energy security, security of heat supply, security of people. The differences concern the subject, area, scope, as well as the degree and purpose of the analyses. The article is a continuation of research conducted by the author, presenting the concept of security of heat supply as a necessary “umbrella” supported by reliability and system resilience to threats, constituting a set of actions aimed at minimizing the risk. The subject of the analysis of this article is the security of heat supply, analysed in the context of heat supply management to recipients and risk analysis related to the lack of heat supply. The elements of decision theory were used as adequate for this purpose. Different configurations of heat distribution in the system have been taken into account when determining the expected values of risk related to the occurrence of power limitation for various degrees of restrictions and various network configurations. The author’s use of elements of decision theory in heat supply systems illustrated at the work gives the opportunity to assess and manage the security of heat supply to the recipient. It takes into account the possibility of different heat distribution configurations in the system at the operational stage, as well as may be the basis for optimizing changes in the distribution of power supply areas and selecting the most advantageous network configuration at the design stage.</jats:p>"

A high concentration of G6P is favorable for starch synthesis but can also stimulate G6P dehydrogenase initiating the glucose-6-phosphate shunt an alternative pathway around the Calvin-Benson cycle. A low concentration of glucose 6-phosphate will limit this futile cycle. In order to understand the biochemical regulation of plastidic glucose 6-phosphate supply and consumption, we characterized biochemical parameters of two key enzymes, phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH). We have found that the plastidic PGI in has a higher<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>m</jats:sub>for G6P compared to that for fructose 6-phosphate. The<jats:italic>K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub></jats:italic>of G6PDH isoform 1 is increased under reducing conditions. The other two isoforms exhibit less redox regulation; isoform 2 is the most inhibited by NADPH. Our results support the conclusion that PGI restricts stromal G6P synthesis limiting futile cycling via G6PDH. It also acts like a one-way valve, allowing carbon to leave the Calvin-Benson cycle but not reenter. We found flexible redox regulation of G6PDH that could regulate the glucose-6-phosphate shunt.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlight</jats:title><jats:p>Glucose 6-phosphate stimulates glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sphere of water supply and sewage is directly related to a human and society life including a certain creation of life conditions with satisfaction of the immediate needs of a person, and so on. Despite the time, era, change of historical conditions, ideology and culture, the need for water and services is associated with its constant. Just the state policy, goals and tasks of public authorities aimed at regulation of this sphere are changing. The state regulation in any sphere of economic relations is the influence of the state through the normative legal acts adoption, regulations and compliance control including the control by the subjects of the legislation sphere, and application of coercive measures in case of violation of these requirements. In this article, the author considers the water supply and drainage sphere as an object of state regulation, and analyzes the definition of the concept in this field, which is disclosed in various sources, as well as its components and characteristics, and methods of state regulation of the sphere. Formation and development of the water supply and water discharge sector of Ukraine took place as an integral part of housing and communal services. And only since 2002 the sphere of water supply and sewage became regulated by the separate Law of Ukraine «On Potable Water and Drinking Water Supply», which has defined the main concepts, subjects and objects of this phere, and the principles of state policy. While exploring the conditions of state regulated market economy transition, the principles of housing and communal services reform, the author analyzes the scope of water supply and drainage as a market for water supply and sewage services, and reveals its characteristic features. It is very important to identify the specific features inherent in the services of water supply and discharge – the demand inelasticity; dependence of the services supply on the availability of networks; availability of technological and infrastructure constraints in providing services; lack of any alternative to drinking water and water supply and sewage services; water supply and drainage are technologically separate processes carried out using various engineering systems. Paying no attention to the privileged position of natural monopoly entities providing centralized water supply and sewage services, the availability of production facilities, material and financial resources, a guaranteed market for sales of services and the lack of competition, the sphere of water supply and drainage (as well as the sphere of housing and communal services), unlike other branches of natural monopolies, is unprofitable. The statistical data in the field testify that today housing and communal services are the most technically backward sector of the economy with many accumulated problems. Reforms conducted at the state level do not provide the expected result. Until now, at the state level, there are no clearly formulated mechanisms for creating conditions, which would balance the interests of market participants, and protect the interests of consumers in providing them with good quality public services at reasonable prices, and create conditions for the effective functioning of natural monopoly entities, while attracting investments to the development of housing and communal services. And the fact that the water supply and sanitation sector is one of the most attractive in terms of reliability and investment return in the world practice, confirms the correctness of the chosen research direction.</jats:p>"

The contract included a mixture of fixed and performance-based payment terms. The performance element included the establishment of 35 District Metered Areas (DMAs) and the targeted reduction of NRW by 15 percentage points within the project catchment. The contract was a partnership between the contractor and the utility, whereby the contractor undertook the investigative work, while the utility was responsible for executing all resulting construction activities. A number of important lessons were learnt that should be applied to future projects. The contract design arguably placed too much risk upon the contractor. The original project timescale proved to be completely unrealistic. The data collected following DMA establishment enabled the cause of NRW in each DMA to be determined and the appropriate action taken. The quick win for real losses was automated pressure control, while permanent monitoring of large industrial users represented the same for apparent losses. Knowledge transfer to the utility proved to be arguably more important than achievement of contractual NRW targets. The contractor–utility working relationship proved crucial in facilitating eventual project success.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, power generation from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, is highly dependent on suitable weather conditions and therefore highly fluctuating. Thus, alternatives to compensate fluctuations in the energy production are necessary. Biogas plants have the potential to balance energy generation fluctuations and work independently from unstable weather. Experiments on laboratory scale showed that the storage of food waste had only a marginal impact on its energy content. A rapid acidification due to a lactic acid fermentation leads to a pH decrease and concomitant organic acids increase, preserving the stored organic waste. The pH dropped from initially 4.8 to 4 within the first 2 days of storage. It declined until day 10 to 3.6 and stayed at this level until the end of the experiment. Due to a low pH and a high VFA concentration, only minor amounts of gas were produced during storage. No formation of explosive gas mixtures was detected during the storage. Therefore, no safety precautions are necessary to avoid danger from explosion. The results obtained in laboratory were confirmed by experiments on real scale. Thus, pre-condition of organic waste for a flexible feeding and demand-oriented energy supply is feasible to balance energy generation fluctuations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cassava is a significant crop in the Philippines because of its many uses and increasing demand from feed milling industries. However, the supply for this crop in the country, compared to other ASEAN countries, remains low and relatively less competitive. There are studies suggesting the need to review factors affecting agricultural supply in the Philippines to support policy initiatives, but only a few studies were conducted specifically targeting the cassava subsector. This study tried to address these gaps. Using time-series regression analysis, this study measured the extent of the effects of the price, area, agricultural R&amp;D expenditure, tariff rate, and weather occurrences. Results from this study suggest that farm gate price as well as area, agricultural research and development spending, and tariff rate significantly determine supply. In contrast, extreme weather occurrences such as El Niño and La Niña have negative but insignificant effect on supply. In addition, this study has also proven that the identified determinants have long run relationship with cassava domestic supply, which suggests that cassava supply cannot readily adjust to changes in these determinants. These results provide insights into how each variable would affect supply, which have certain implications to policy such as the adoption of specific price policy intervention like price support schemes that safeguard farmers’ income against price fluctuations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain finance has broken through traditional credit modes and advanced rapidly as a creative financial business discipline. Core enterprises have played a critical role in the credit enhancement of supply chain finance. Through the analysis of core enterprise credit risks in supply chain finance, by means of a ‘fuzzy analytical hierarchy process’ (FAHP), the paper constructs a supply chain financial credit risk evaluation system, making quantitative measurements and evaluation of core enterprise credit risk. This enables enterprises to take measures to control credit risk, thereby promoting the healthy development of supply chain finance. The examination of core enterprise supply chains suggests that a unified information file should be collected based on the core enterprise, including the operating conditions, asset status, industry status, credit record, effective information to the database, collecting related data upstream and downstream of the archives around the core enterprise, developing a data information system, electronic data information, and updating the database accurately using the latest information that might be available. Moreover, supply chain finance and modern information technology should be integrated to establish the sharing of information resources and realize the exchange of information flows, capital flows, and logistics between banks. This should reduce a variety of risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain finance.</jats:p>"

The complexity of this problem is mostly attributed to the dynamic nature of the natural hydrosystems, of which the inputs are characterized by stochasticity. The assessment of the impact of alternative decisions on such a system requires a probabilistic approach. It is evident that this is a very demanding task even for a single-reservoir system, not to mention multi-reservoir systems. For this reason, computer codes have been developed since the early 1970s to help with this procedure. Nowadays, these codes have evolved into decision support platforms that offer a user interface to assist the pre-processing and the post-processing. However, the majority of the available tools are commercial and require a considerable amount of money for a licence. Thankfully, a few freeware tools that are based on the simulation–optimization method and with a modern user interface exist. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of these freeware tools. The assessment is based both on an analysis of the theoretical basis and on an application of the models on a simplified representation of the Athens water supply system.</jats:p>",

This arrangement is likely to have labor market consequences, in particular for women. We study the effect of coresidence on female labor supply in Kyrgyzstan, a strongly patrilocal setting. We account for the endogeneity of coresidence by exploiting the tradition that youngest sons usually live with their parents. In both OLS and IV estimations, the effect of coresidence on female labor supply is negative and insignificant. This finding is in contrast to previous studies, which found positive effects in less patrilocal settings. We go beyond earlier work by investigating effect channels. In Kyrgyzstan, coresiding women invest more time in elder care than women who do not coreside, and they do not receive parental support in housework.</jats:p>",

The state has bet on electricity supply as a growth industry, increasing capacity five-fold since 2000, but the resultant overcapacity could further limit room to manoeuvre. The electricity sector continues to be perceived as a political risk, a perception shaped by a post-reform loss by the reforming party, the India National Congress, in 2003.</p>",

Additionally, power restrictions prevent the use of survival heating during the night. The harsh mechanical vibration environment of launch and landing provides an additional challenge to reliability. A multi-physics simulation was created that took into account temperature property variations, as well as solving the transient analysis that also included rapid variation in power-pulsing during the operation of the laser. The steady state analysis employed a more traditional finite element based analysis, but with provisions for Mars gas convection and thermal radiation.</jats:p>",

Hundreds of MNCs in agri-commodity sectors have recently committed to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. In this article, we examine the power of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) participating in two initiatives that support the implementation of such commitments: the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) and Transparency for Sustainable Economies (Trase). Drawing on document and literature research, participant observation as well as semi-structured interviews, we find that these NGOs exercise power with MNCs, in particular in terms of raising awareness and changing corporate self-perceptions. At the same time, though, there is a bias towards representing the positions and interests of materially strong actors in global supply chains. In doing so, NGOs risk reinforcing MNCs’ power over more marginalized actors. In this light, we argue that initiatives such as AFi and Trase can only be a first step towards a new economic system that respects ecological limits and delivers social justice. In order to shape transformative change, NGOs need to more actively push discussions about equitable distribution, emancipation and justice in natural resource governance.</jats:p>"

This study precisely examined the effects of collaboration and supply chain design on customers&amp;rsquo; satisfaction at the downstream end of the chain using Ekiti State as study area. The study employed descriptive survey design with the use of structured Likert scale questionnaire administered to 381 retailers of noodles in Ekiti State. The research hypotheses were analysed using simple linear regression as statistical technique with the aid of SPSS version 22.0. At the end of the study, it was observed that both collaboration and supply chain design were significant predictors of customers&amp;rsquo; satisfaction of instant noodles in Ekiti State. However, collaboration among supply chain partners emerged as stronger determinant of customers&amp;rsquo; satisfaction than supply chain design. The study concludes that these two practices of supply chain management are highly important criteria any manufacturing firm especially in the noodles industry must pay close attention to in order to satisfy her consumers.</jats:p>"

To this scope, citrus waste management represents a major issue for citrus processors but, at the same time, it embodies a potentially unexploited resource for the rural sustainable development. This study focuses on analyzing the current management of citrus waste in South Italy and identifying the determinants and barriers that may affect an entrepreneur&amp;rsquo;s choice on the destination of citrus waste. Citrus processors&amp;rsquo; preferences about the contract characteristics needed to take part in a co-investment scheme have been investigated. Both analyses are preliminary steps to design an innovative and sustainable citrus by-product supply chain. Results show that the distance between the citrus processors and the citrus by-products plant is one of the main criteria for choosing alternative valorization pathways. Moreover, the required guaranteed capital, the short duration of the contract, and low risk are contract scheme characteristics that improve entrepreneurs&amp;rsquo; willingness to co-invest in the development of a citrus waste multifunctional plant.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the extent of nitrate removal from aqueous solutions using a new complex of activated carbon. The effects of operating parameters such as pH of solution (3 to 9), adsorbent dosage (0.4 to 5 g in 50 mL), contact time (5 to 300 min) and initial concentration of nitrate (50 to 300 mg L−1) were studied. The highest efficiency of nitrate removal (95.4%) was related to application of modified activated carbon to a solution with pH of 7 and 100 mg L−1 nitrate concentration. Increasing the amount of modified activated carbon from 0.5 to 1 g in 50 mL promoted removal of nitrate from 82.6% to 94.1%. Furthermore, increasing contact time from 5 to 30 min improved removal efficiency from 76.6% to 92.3%. The obtained experimental data were compatible with the Langmuir isotherm model. In general, the results demonstrated that employing Fe3+-modified activated carbon can be considered as a new method of nitrate removal from aqueous solutions due its convenience, safety and high efficiency.</jats:p>",

In this work, mathematical variable selection methods were utilized to find the optimal subsets of variables to develop predictive models for the two quality parameters of drinking water. The found variable subsets were evaluated using three modelling methods and comparisons with the expert knowledge-based models were carried out. The study pointed out the importance of expert knowledge and showed that predicting the quality of treated water is possible but finding an optimal subset of input parameters for a model that predicts the precise value of a quality parameter is challenging.</jats:p>",

We study ``horse race'' news (news on candidates' chances in an upcoming election) from six major online outlets for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential campaigns. We find robust evidence that horse race headlines were slanted congenially with respect to the preferences of the outlets' typical readers. However, evidence of congenial slant in the timing and frequency of horse race stories is weaker. We also find very limited evidence of greater within-outlet demand for headlines most congenial to outlets' typical readers, and somewhat stronger evidence of greater demand for relatively \\emph{uncongenial} headlines. We discuss how various aspects of our results are consistent with each of the major mechanisms driving slant studied in the theoretical literature, and may help explain when each mechanism is more likely to come into play. In particular, readers may be more likely to click on uncongenial headlines due to inferring that these stories are particularly informative when they stand in contrast to an outlet's typically congenial slant.</p>"

For apparent losses assessment, the traditional approach of deriving consumption profiles and testing water meters exceeds the resources of many utilities. While a few studies have explored alternative methodologies, these have largely not been validated and are susceptible to reproducibility and interpretation difficulties. This paper introduces an improved comparative billing analysis method that combines data preparation techniques, clustering analysis and classical regression analysis on monthly billing data of a water utility in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using the method, an average estimate of apparent losses due to metering errors of 8.2% was found against the best-case scenario of 9.4% using field investigations and laboratory tests, which also measure meter under-registration that the proposed methodology does not cater for. The validated results were possible at a fraction of the cost and effort, while also providing better insight into the underlying consumption patterns. The results show that data-driven discovery processes are viable alternatives for improved assessment and management of water losses.</jats:p>",

Specifically, our paper aims to investigate whether or not MNEs behave hypocritically by examining the alignment of CSR to business practices in MNE affiliates in developing countries. To answer this question, we apply standard ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques to data for over 1000 MNEs that claim to have a CSR ethos. We find that CSR-active enterprises report significantly higher worker wages, ceteris paribus. Local African suppliers benefit from CSR through knowledge transfer, but only when MNEs make tangible investments in supplier development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents a developed method for assessment of gas distribution over the cross section of a shaft furnace working in the countercurrent conditions. This method is scientifically based on the fundamental principles of the countercurrent heat exchange theory in shaft furnaces, i.e. dependences of the temperature field throughout the burden bed height on the ratio between heat capacities of gas and burden flows. The ratio between the gas flow heat capacity and burden flow heat capacity at the stock line level is determined by the averaged gas temperature at the burden bed output. By comparing these data, we estimated directions for improving the gas distributing system. Efficiency of this method was assessed when analyzing the system of air supply to the shaft furnace at one of the Ural plants. The analysis showed the main drawbacks of the existing gas distributing system and enabled to determine the main directions for reconstruction of this system. On the basis of the analysis results related to operation of the tuyeres and distribution manifold, we proposed more efficient options of their parameters, i.e. manifold cross-section area, tuyere number and diameter, angle of tuyere inclination to the horizontal. These changes provided a uniform distribution of gases across the furnace and improved conditions for melt flow in the furnace. Thus, we established virtually equal conditions for development of heat and mass transfer processes in the work space of the shaft furnace. The modernized system of air supply to MMSK’s shaft furnace increased the furnace performance by 14.14% in terms of burden, by 23.27% in terms of matte, by 15.15% in terms of slag and by 6.65% in terms of thermal efficiency. At the same time, the following parameters were reduced: specific fuel consumption (anthracite) by 17.46% and dust discharge by 40.5%. When supplying air to the furnace through the inclined tuyeres, it became possible to reduce formation of accretions and provide new working conditions for operating personnel due to a more uniform gas distribution across the horizontal section of the furnace. Within six months of furnace operation the personnel had no problems related to its operation.</jats:p>"

The setup costs, purchasing and procurement costs are dependent on lot sizes. The mathematical models for continuous and discrete variables of the chain are analyzed mathematically to maximize the expected average profits of individual and the collaborating systems. As our study suggests that collaborating system is always better than the decentralized system for known distribution cases, we also optimize the joint profit of the retailer and the supplier for a distribution free case which is implemented for unknown distribution. Finally, numerical examples of the demand patterns are illustrated to justify the proposed model. The punctual research directions from the proposed model are also provided in the conclusion section.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a supply chain where a retailer buys from a supplier who faces financial constraints. Informational problems about the supplier’s demand prospects and production capabilities restrict her access to capital. By committing to a minimum purchase quantity, the retailer can mitigate these informational problems and expand the supplier’s feasible production set. We assume a newsvendor model of operations and analyze the strategic interaction of the two parties as a sequential game. Key parameters in our model are the supplier’s ex ante credit limit, her informational transparency—which conditions the amount of additional capital released by the commitment—and the demand characteristics of the final market. We show that in equilibrium the supplier can benefit from a lower ex ante credit limit or lower informational transparency. The retailer always benefits from an increase in these parameters. We also indicate limits to the commitment approach: under certain conditions, the retailer may prefer to relax the supplier’s financial constraint by adjusting the wholesale price, or a combination of wholesale price and commitment. Our study provides a novel perspective on capital market frictions in supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2018.1727 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to choosing ways to improve the technological reliability of regional electric network (REN) to ensure reliable power supply. At the operational stage, the task of increasing operational reliability is assigned to the enterprise asset management system of the territorial network organization (TNO), as a REN operator. Technological reliability is ensured by an operational dispatch control system, which uses the existing reserves in the network to support the technological process of electricity supply to electricity consumers in case of network equipment failures. The relevance of improving the technological and operational reliability of power supply system (PSS) requires the development and improvement of methods for analyzing and assessing the TNO's readiness to provide power transmission services. The indicators adopted in Russia reflect the level of technological reliability of PSS. However, these indicators do not reflect the technical condition of the equipment, or identify causal relationship between an equipment failure and an interruption of power supply. The research is aimed at identifying “bottlenecks” from the technological reliability standpoint and substantiating maintenance and repair, and technical re-equipment and reconstruction measures to improve operational reliability. A PSS model is proposed reflecting the technical condition of the network equipment, the operational readiness of automation systems, the availability of structural, functional and load redundancy in the REN. A method is suggested for calculating the PSS reliability indicators, where the developed indices reflect the degree of development of the network technical potential and the role of the aforesaid nodes in the PSS. The method makes it possible to identify the network parts, where it is necessary to introduce new technologies. In contrast to a well-known method, which is based on expert estimates of probabilities of different circuit-mode states of the network and on the calculation of normal and post-emergency modes, a less timeconsuming formalized procedure for analyzing and evaluating the network structural and functional reliability is proposed. The results obtained allow to increase the validity of the decisions made both at the operational stage and the design stage.</jats:p>"

Operation simulations were conducted involving stakeholders from operations, Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), legal, finance, and procurements to identify current limitations, and the short, medium and long term solution in order to ensure such sharing will not compromise HSE and production performance.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>3. Results, Observations, Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The joint project management team has encountered multiple obstacles towards ILCT implementation such as vessel priority, marine HSE standardization, vessels technical specifications, joint coordination agreement, liabilities, cost allocation, accumulative contract value re-distribution, and governance matters. In overcoming the obstacles, the team has established ILCT Committee and ILCT Manual. The ILCT Committee comprises of PETRONAS and PACs members with the key roles to control the overall allocation of vessels, mediate any conflict, and improve ILCT performance. The ILCT Manual was jointly developed by PETRONAS and PACs to govern the implementation of ILCT and is regularly referred by PACs as guiding principle in operating vessels.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This national synergy resulted in 12 vessels reductions from 142 to 130 vessels that equivalent to RM100 millions of cost savings yearly. PETRONAS and PACs benefit from this synergy mainly through optimized traveling route, which results in lower Daily Charter Rate and fuel cost. It also supports PETRONAS’ agenda to nurture capabilities of local vessel owners to become regional vessel operators. The key success of ILCT lies on PETRONAS’ role as the regulator for Malaysia upstream industry, by orchestrating the cooperation across PACs in syncing the common alignment towards achieving the desired outcome of ILCT.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>4.

But it turns out that the glossaries of microeconomic textbooks do not give either the definition of demand (there is a reference — see the demand curve) or the units of demand measurement (there are no units of measurement between the price and quantity) and, accordingly, supply\nthat restricts their practical application. The model of the general economy — the synthesis of the “Capital” of Marx, micro- and macroeconomics — allows us to supplement the quantitative analysis of all market categories with qualitative analysis and, in particular, to define demand and supply through two factors of the commodity–use value and cost. The definition of categories and units of their measurement makes it possible to expand the field of application of theory (the demand for a set of goods and the supply of a set of goods) and formulate an algorithm for their use in business practice.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to inspect how innovation and sustainability are integrated into the wider context of the supply chains. To this end, a systematic literature review was carried out with a particular focus on papers published in recent years (2015–2017) so as to continue from a previous review on the sustainable supply chain innovation topic covering the time span of 1996–2014. The descriptive aspects of the published papers are firstly examined, i.e., the year of publication, journal, research methodology, industry field and country of the study, followed by the thematic ones, i.e., key themes of the innovation process, the types of innovation found, their newness, dimensions, and main theories that emerged. The analysis shows an upward trend of literature in numerical terms and a wider spread of sustainable innovations. Additionally, the research highlights further areas of research that are deserving of attention. These areas include analyses of specific industrial sectors which have been less covered in the published literature; research activities in the less developed countries; more attention on the social dimension of sustainability; a more general contribution from some nations that turned out to be less productive or even inactive on the sustainable supply chain innovation topic. Finally, a framework is developed which could constitute the basis for further developments and research on this issue.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Efficiently exploiting renewable, sustainable and green energy resources is one of the most critical challenges facing our world today. For example, as part of this challenge, Germany aims to generate 65% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and Ireland aims to generate 40%. Renewable energy sources, e.g. solar and wind energy, are plentiful and sufficient to power our ever-increasing demand for more devices, technology and transportation. However, the increased demand for electricity at peak times, the increased instantaneous penetration of the grid by energy from non-conventional generation systems (such as wind turbines and solar photovoltaic) and the intermittent and non-dispatchable nature of renewable energy sources are threatening the stability of the electricity grid and limiting the ability of the transmission system operator to respond to sudden changes in generation or demand. This is particularly an issue in isolated grids such as on the island of Ireland, where the failure of a single generator results in the loss of a significant fraction of the overall grid capacity in an instant. However, in mainland Europe, the electricity grid of each nation is interconnected and synchronised, allowing the loss of a single generator in one region to be compensated for by increasing the output of the many other generators on the continent by a small amount. In the future, there will be a need for significant grid-scale storage, load levelling and stabilisation of the grid. Electric vehicles will become more prevalent and the fraction of renewables on the grid will increase significantly. These technologies and the way in which they interact with the grid will greatly affect the stability of the electricity grid. Smart and innovative interaction of these technologies with the grid raises the possibility of optimising the level of energy storage required for stable and reliable grid operation. However, lack of planning in these areas could make future cost-effective, sustainable and reliable energy solutions hard to achieve.</jats:p>",

Synthesis of a thin-film composite membrane with a support layer carried out by dissolving an amount of polysulfone polymer and polyvinyl pyrrolidone in N-methyl,2-pyrrolidone via phase inversion process and a thin-film layer of the polyamide M-phenylenediamine (MPD) and 1,3,5-benzene trichloride by interfacial polymerization reaction for the fabrication of the TFC were examined. Water flux and reverse salt flux decreased with increasing the concentration of polysulfone polymer. The composite membranes with polysulfone at 16% and 17% had even higher efficiencies. Also, by increasing the concentration of the draw solution, further phenol and benzene could be removed. The highest rejection rates of phenol (polar) and benzene (nonpolar) were found to be 79% and 90%, respectively. The results showed the capability of the thin-film composite forward osmosis (TFC-FO) membranes for removing organic micro-pollutants from the aqueous solutions under different operating conditions, with the efficiency of removing nonpolar compounds being higher.</jats:p>",

The most costly, complicated and responsible for reliable water supply in modern water supply systems are the complexes of water transmission buildings, which include pump stations, water mains, pressure and regulation facilities. They are located on a large territory, hydraulically connected with each other and require an integrated assessment of reliability based on their constructive and functional indicators, as well as the normative consolidation of methods and indicators of reliability assessment. It is proposed to assess the functional reliability by constant coefficients of operational availability. They should be complied with the normative values of the operating efficiency factors. The numerical values of the operating efficiency factors for each of three categories of water supply systems in conditions of water supply reduction and limitation are determined on the basis of the present standards. The basic principles of the methodology of engineering calculations of functional reliability of water transmission buildingsâ€™ complexes (WTBC) are theoretically substantiated. The expediency and reliability of the assessment of functional reliability is confirmed by calculations. Improvement of functional reliability of WTBC can be provided by rational design schemes and efficient operation with intensive rehabilitation.Â Â </jats:p>"

Widely known for causing non-typhoidal foodborne infections (95%), and enteric (typhoid) fever in humans, Salmonella colonizes almost all warm- and cold-blooded animals, in addition to its extra-animal environmental strongholds. The last few decades have witnessed the emergence of highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, causing greater morbidity and mortality in humans. The emergence of several Salmonella serotypes resistant to multiple antibiotics in food animals underscores a significant food safety hazard. In this review, we discuss the various antibiotic-resistant Salmonella serotypes in food animals and the food supply, factors that contributed to their emergence, their antibiotic resistance mechanisms, the public health implications of their spread through the food supply, and the potential antibiotic alternatives for controlling them.</jats:p>"

Methods This is a study with a qualitative approach using a documentary analysis technique referring to the period between 2003 and 2015, in addition to the Agricultural Policy of 1991.  Results The results of the analyzes of the documents of the Federal Executive Power and the Public Policy Councils are similar, policies that seek alternatives to the negative impacts of the hegemonic model of food supply, different from the document of the Federal Legislative Power and Agricultural Policy, which superficially approach alternatives to these impacts, or are limited to strengthening the dominant productive system.  Conclusion Thus, a national food supply policy is needed for the planning of actions, considering social, environmental and health impacts and taking as reference the initiatives already built by sectors of the Executive Power and by the Public Policy Councils.</jats:p>"

At each level, optimum order quantity of frequent items is determined. This assists inventory manager to order optimal quantity of items as per the actual requirement of the item with respect to their category, content and brand.

Our study investigated the end-user water demand, the capital and operational costs, the carbon footprint, the freshwater availability and the risks surrounding water quality for several groundwater supply alternatives in Ugandan refugee settlements. We compared hand pumps, motorised pumps (solar, diesel and hybrid) and water trucking. The end-users’ survey highlighted the significant variability of water access. The economic evaluation showed that the breakeven year for solar and diesel pumps was greatly affected by the length of the water distribution systems (e.g., pipes, storage tanks), the chosen timeframe and the daily working hours of the diesel engine. When excluding capital investment, most alternatives were economically viable at the existing water fee (0.8 USD/m3), and solar driven pumps were down to 0.09 USD/m3. Finally, the combustion of diesel caused the highest CO2-eq emissions per m3. Water trucking is the worst option in both the economic and environmental analysis at 7–8 USD/m3 and &gt;1 kg CO2-eq/m3. The methodology and the results of this paper will support decision-makers to build and finance sustainable water provision solutions in refugee settlements.</jats:p>"

We exploit the evolutionary game model to analyze players’ behavioral patterns of their interacting strategies, whereby we attain the evolutionary stable strategies and their associated existing preconditions under various scenarios. We acquire a number of managerial insights, and particularly find that the evolutionary stable strategies of the channel carbon reduction and promotion are remarkably influenced by incremental profits resulted from causes, such as every player’s unilateral participation in emission reduction. In addition, we investigate a player’s free-rider opportunistic practice in cooperative carbon reduction and joint participation in emission reduction. However, the magnitude of profit increment will heavily influence the result of Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). Finally, the extensive computational studies enable us to verify the effectiveness of preceding models.</jats:p>"

The results show that in the manufacturer-dominated and Nash equilibrium games, product greenness, retailer profits, manufacturer profits, total supply chain profits, and a manufacturer's utility all decrease as the fairness preference increases, whereas the retail price and wholesale price are just the opposite of each other. In the retailer-dominated game, the retail price, product greenness, and total supply chain profits are not impacted by the fairness preference.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>: Water losses occurring in water distribution systems (WDSs) are now considered as a serious problem, necessitating a robust and effective management strategy. Non-revenue water (NRW) data indicate that most cities in Gaza Strip, Palestine experience high NRW. In 2015, the average percentage of NRW in Gaza Strip was 39%. This figure resulted in major financial, supply, and pressure losses, as well as excessive energy consumption. The estimated annual volume of NRW in 2015 was in the order of 34 million m3 which is equivalent to American $ 16 million. Furthermore, NRW is a good indicative of water utility performance; high levels of NRW usually indicate a poorly managed water utility. This paper investigates the reasons why NRW is so high in many cities in Gaza Strip. Results of the study revealed that the lack of incentives for management units, the lack of awareness of citizens-users of the water service, apparent losses, the blockade on Gaza Strip, the wars on Gaza are the main causes.</jats:p>",

It provides information flow that makes the supply chain more robust and resilient without undermining its efficiency. Smart systems use artificial intelligence methods for solving problems and facilitating decision‐making through rule‐based deduction. Accordingly, these systems can present specialists' skills and simulate their thinking process. The primary goal of expert systems is to implement knowledge acquisition process by converting knowledge to wisdom. This process is vital for critical decision‐making regarding important issues such as determining necessities of a particular contract. Companies use professional liability insurance of the products and services to ensure the purchasers and prevent potential losses. Although this practice is highly prevalent, there is not any particular procedure for measuring necessities of contracts. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy expert system for measuring the necessities of professional contracts regarding insurance coverage and improve the supply chain management using IT. This system can measure and report these obligations, considering specifications of each project. Taking into perspective variety of professional services/products, we consider software as a type of professional contracts, extract its important indices and give it to the system as the input. After the necessary stages, the system produces a proper response and presents the generated response to the user. The software of this expert system is web based, and there are four operating layers in its architecture. We implemented this program in MS Visual Studio Framework with C#.NET programming language. Moreover, we implemented MS SQL‐Server Database Management.</jats:p>",

According to the Brazilian and international press, it was due to climatic, anthropogenic, and water management factors. This paper assesses the hydro-climatic characteristics of the crisis by focusing on the Alto-Tietê basin and the headwater of the Piracicaba-Capivari-Jundiaí (PCJ) basin that supply 70% of the water consumed in the metropolis. Based on 16 rain-gauge stations, 5 runoff-gauge stations, and several statistical analyses carried over the 1951–2015 period, this assessment shows that the 2013–2015 hydro-climatic crisis resulted from a large number of days without rain in the north of the Alto-Tietê basin and to less intense precipitation events in the headwaters of the PCJ basin during the austral spring 2013 and the year 2014. It also defines a return period of 98 years for observed river flows in 2014. Despite the rare nature of this hydrological drought, the need for efficient water saving policies is brought forward.</jats:p>"

This study is focused on wine production under warm and dry climate conditions in south Portugal, in two major wine-producing regions (Tejo and Alentejo), characterized by small to medium sized wineries. Vineyards have been expanding in this region of Portugal, where about 50–70% of the vineyards are irrigated, increasing regional water demand. The aim of this study is to propose an integrative approach for wine production, where a simple calculation model has been developed and validated to preview water consumption and wastewater production, as functions of winemaking periods and type of processed grapes. Results revealed a global ratio of 2.2 ± 0.45 and 2.1 ± 0.17 Lwater/Lwine. Concerning dedicated indicators, 60–75% of the wastewater was produced during Period I and the red wine production represented a 50–64% increase in water consumption. This tool will enable winemakers to calculate Global and Dedicated Indicators, based on their own parameters, which provide information on flow volumes and peak flows. In this context, it will be possible to identify improvements for wastewater treatment and management towards water reuse as a promising solution for the wine sector in the framework of the circular economy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a two-year field trial, the effect of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilization was investigated on grain yield, grain quality parameters, formation of acrylamide (AA), and the precursor free asparagine (Asn) in organically and conventionally produced winter wheat cultivars. In both production systems, different types, amounts, and temporal distributions of N were tested. While the effect of S fertilizer types and amounts on free Asn was only tested in the conventional farming system. Within both cropping systems, grain yield and baking quality were significantly influenced by N treatment while the effect on free Asn was only minor. Especially within the organic farming system, increasing N fertilization levels did not increase free Asn significantly. A slight trend of increasing free Asn levels with an intensified N supply was observed, especially in the presence of crude protein contents of 14% or higher. But only N amounts of 180 kg N ha&amp;minus;1 or higher increased the probability of high free Asn contents considerably, while N supply below that amount led to free Asn values similar to the unfertilized controls. The results indicated that good baking quality can be achieved without significantly increasing free Asn levels. In addition, cultivars affected the levels of free Asn significantly. Compared to cv. &amp;ldquo;Bussard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Naturastar&amp;rdquo;, cv. &amp;ldquo;Capo&amp;rdquo; exhibited the lowest AA formation potential at an N supply of 180 kg N ha&amp;minus;1 while simultaneously reaching a crude protein content &amp;gt; 15% (conventional) and &amp;gt; 12% (organic). Thus, it seems that cultivars differ in their ability to store and incorporate free Asn into proteins. Over all trials, a correlation of free Asn and AA was shown by R2 = 0.77, while a relation of free Asn and protein was only R2 = 0.36. Thus, lowering free Asn by adjusting N treatments should not necessarily affect baking quality. S nutrition within conventional farming did not change free Asn amount or crude protein significantly, probably due to the fact that soil was not sulfate-deficient. In summary, it was evident that free Asn amounts in wheat varied widely both within cultivars and between cropping systems. In order to clearly unravel genotypic differences and their interaction with environmental factors and especially N fertilization, further research is needed.</jats:p>"

Low shares of imports are particularly characteristic of the new member states, which is indicative of weaker connections with the European and global agribusinesses in comparison with EU-15 countries. On the other hand, the proportion between volumes of agri-food products allocated to intermediate and final demand confirm that the agricultural sector is primarily a supplier of raw materials in most EU countries.

Not continuous electricity supply in some areas led to a power supply from an alternative power source becomes indispensable. One alternative power source is a solar cell. Solar cell is a sustainable source of electricity but power output is not constant depending on the sunlight. The power source is needed to anticipate the lack of power when the power generated by the solar cell is not enough.In this paper proposed a hybrid design that combines the power supply of electricity from the solar cell, the network provider of electricity, and batteries. This paper discusses methods of hybrid electric power from three sources. Hybrid power is usually done by PCC (Power Controlled Converter), which consists of a controlled power converter for each channel input, but in this study the method proposed hybrid power input specification in the form of a synchronization circuit PCC then replaced by a diode circuit.The design of hybrid power supply in this study resulted in the specification input from the solar cell with Vmp channels (maximum power voltage) 35VDC Voc (open circuit voltage) 43.78VDC, channels of electricity provider with the already converted with SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply) to 35VDC, and channels of a battery with a minimum voltage of 21VDC maximum 27.6VDC. The test results showed that the implementation of the proposed hybrid method can perform a single capture or hybrid power, and can transfer power between the source retrieval without pause. Implementation of the proposed hybrid method has a 21VDC output voltage range - 43.78VDC and efficiency of 98.6% - 99.5%.</jats:p>"

While this bundling strategy is attractive to consumers, it potentially allows consumers to resell the print book in the bundle, which might cannibalize retailers' sales. Consequently, it will influence all participants in the industry including the publisher, the retailers, and the consumers. Using a two-period model, the authors investigate the impacts of this strategy under both monopoly and competition. The authors compute the equilibrium outcome for both scenarios. The findings show that (1) under monopoly, both the publisher and the retailer sell at a higher rate; consumers also see higher total surplus; (2) under competition, the retailer who provides bundling will gain a competitive advantage. This study indicates that the bundling model yields a win-win strategy.</jats:p>",

Water is an indispensable element of life and a fundamental resource for many human activities. The situation of these watersheds is aggravated by conflicts of land use that end up intensifying the process of erosion and sedimentation of the water reservoirs. In addition, diagnostics that use environmental indicators are important tools for environmental planning. The present study made use of these indicators to evaluate the natural soil susceptibility to erosion in the catchment area of the DNOS water reservoir, in Santa Maria, south of Brazil. Using multi-thematic maps and geoprocessing tools (GIS), we obtained a vulnerability mapping, represented by indexes. This map is an important and skillful tool for territorial planning, for aiding environmental management and conservation of water resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain management is important for most firms in today’s competitive environment. This study considers a supply chain environment under which the firm needs to make decisions regarding from which supplier and what quantity of parts should be purchased, which vehicle with a certain emissions amount and transportation capacity should be assigned, and what kind of production mode should be used. The integrated replenishment, transportation, and production problem is concerned with coordinating replenishment, transportation, and production operations to meet customer demand with the objective of minimizing the cost. The problem considered in this study involves heterogeneous vehicles with different emission costs, various materials with dissimilar emission costs, and distinct production modes, each with their own emission costs. In addition, multiple suppliers with different quantity discount schemes are considered, different kinds of vehicles with different loading capacities and traveling distance limits are present, and different production modes with different production capacities and production costs are included. A mixed integer programming model is proposed first to minimize the total cost, which includes the ordering cost, purchase cost, transportation cost, emission cost, production cost, inventory-holding cost, and backlogging cost, while satisfying various constraints in replenishment, transportation, and production. A particle swarm optimization model is constructed next to deal with large-scale problems that are too complicated to solve by the mixed integer programming. The main advantage of the proposed models lies in their ability to simultaneously coordinate the replenishment, transportation, and production operations in a planning horizon. The proposed particle swarm optimization model could further identify a near-optimal solution to the complex problem in a very short computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the sustainable supply chain management problem with multiple suppliers, multiple vehicles, and multiple production modes simultaneously. Case studies are presented to examine the practicality of the mixed integer programming and the particle swarm optimization models. The proposed models can be adopted by the management to make relevant supply chain management decisions.</jats:p>"

DO increased, but BOD, NO3-N, and TP decreased, from the lower section (river kilometres (rkm) 7–58 from the river mouth) through the middle section (rkm 58–143) to the upper section (rkm 143–379) of the river. Lead and mercury showed weak/no trends (R2 &amp;lt; 0.5). Based on the river section, major land use groups were a combination of urban and built-up areas (43%) and aquaculture (21%) in the lower river basin, paddy fields (56%) and urban and built-up areas (21%) in the middle river basin, and paddy fields (44%) and other agricultural areas (34%) in the upper river basin. Most water quality and land use attributes had significantly positive or negative correlations (at P ≤ 0.05) among each other. The river was in crisis because of high FCB concentrations. Serious measures are suggested to manage FCB and relevant human activities in the river basin.</jats:p>",

Optical measurement approaches have shown great potential to partially substitute water sampling and laboratory analyses, but are obstructed by limited flexibility or high maintenance demands. In order to overcome these problems and to bridge the gap between in situ and remote sensing measurements, the use of close-range, above-surface reflectance measurements in the VIS-NIR domain to measure water quality parameters in surface water bodies was investigated. Remote sensing reflectance in a 1 m³ water tank with increasing, known concentrations of suspended solids was measured. A partial least squares model was trained to predict concentrations from reflectance curves, which performed well, considering the wide range of concentrations and illumination conditions (R²cal = 0.96, R²val = 0.97). The approach was then transferred to the field and further parameters were tested. Using a semi-autonomous spectrometer mounted to a boom stand on a motor boat, we traced substance concentrations in close intervals along a longitudinal gradient from inflow to dam in a drinking water reservoir in Brazil. The method is suitable for parameters directly influencing the reflection properties of the water body (e.g. suspended solids (R²cal = 0.93), chlorophyll-a (R²cal = 0.74)), or for parameters closely related to those (e.g. total phosphorus (R²cal = 0.97)). For chemical oxygen demand, the method is not well suited (R²cal = 0.14, R²val = 0.45). Once calibrated to the local conditions, the spectrometer can be used stationary or on moving platforms to map and monitor surface waters. The integration of the procedure into acoustic and imaging techniques is further investigated.</jats:p>",

The data are collected by distributing questionnaires to the companies that qualify the criteria of the sample, respondent target are procurement manager, production and IT.Findings: Samples are grouped into two ideal types of strategies used mean split technique. 53 SMEs adopt ASCS (Agile Supply Chain Strategy) and 49 SMEs adopt LSCS (Lean Supply Chain Strategy). Two of the strategy groups have a low value of misfit score; it means that the degree of fit between supply chain strategy and manufacturing strategy is high. The result of simple regression test by using one side technique shows that a regression coefficient values is negative both in LSCS and ASCS group, but the hypothesis test is only proven on ASCS group while LSCS group is not significant.Research limitations/implications: (1) The empirical finding of bivariate fit model test encourage a research space to explore the other contingent variable besides manufacturing strategy. For example, business and information technology strategy; (2) The measurement of the company performance becomes the objective of the success of the alignment of supply chain strategy with the contingent variable which should be specified using the performance variable of the supply chain.Originality/value: The use of Euclidean distance formula is expected to cover the technical limitations of contingency test by using interaction approach between the complex variables; the value of misfit score reflects the extent to which program alignment between the company functions.</jats:p>"

In the suspension, the height of the clear water–turbid water interface undergoes an initial, rapidly decreasing phase followed by a slowly decreasing phase with increasing settling time. The influences of initial settling height, primary sediment concentration and the size distribution of the sediment sample on the hindered settling process of the suspension are investigated. A large initial settling height of the suspension leads to a slow settling velocity of the suspension during the rapidly decreasing phase. The larger the primary particle concentration of the suspension, the more gently the vertical position of the interface decreases during the rapidly decreasing phase. Increasing the primary particle concentration also causes the slowly decreasing phase to appear later. Finally, a fine-grained sediment suspension results in a gentle decrease in the vertical position of the clear water–turbid water interface and a small settling velocity of the interface during the rapidly decreasing phase.</jats:p>",

Methodology/Approach: Initially, we carried out in-depth interviews with ten chain managers to learn about the manufacturing capabilities in order to develop a questionnaire for data collection. Then, we submitted the questionnaires to pretesting in ten enterprises. One hundred and twenty-five responses were collected from six technopoles. Originality/Relevance: In the supply chain management literature, there are records of its influence on business performance; however, research that directly investigate the moderating effect of manufacturing capabilities on this relationship are scarce, which indicates the relevance of this research and its originality for studies involving supply chains and technopoles. Main results: We found, with the data processed by linear regression, that manufacturing capabilities moderate the relationship between supply chain management and business performance. Theoretical/methodological contributions: From an academic point of view, the research’s contribution was the identification of the moderate effect of the manufacturing capabilities construct, through variables such as skilled production personnel, advanced production methods, and the effective transformation of research and development in effective production, to increase business performance.</jats:p>"

Existing literature has assumed loss neutral consumers, while in practice consumers are often more sensitive to utility losses than gains, i.e., customers are often loss averse. In this paper, we study the impact of such loss aversion on the retailer's optimal pricing and returns policies. We analyze three scenarios where the seller offers no refund, full refund and partial refund for the returned products. Under each scenario, the seller determines the optimal price, quantity, and refund amount (under partial refund case) in order to maximize the expected profit. Our results demonstrate that consumer loss aversion leads a no-refund retailer to charge lower price and order smaller quantity, has no impact on a full-refund retailer, and results in a more lenient returns policy for a partial-refund retailer. We also find contracts that coordinate supply chains selling to loss averse consumers. Therefore, this article sheds some lights on how the management of returns policies should be adapted when consumers are loss averse.</jats:p>",

The electron temperature and density of the plasma were diagnosed by applying in independent-constructed Triple Langmuir Probe diagnostic system, meanwhile, the charging and discharge test system were also constructed by ourselves. Three sets of experiments have been performed by two-stage light gas gun loading system and related measurement system. Especially, residual velocity was measured when projectile pierced through the solar array with composite structure. Experimental results revealed the discharge causes based on stress wave theory, and the discharge current characteristics of a primary and a secondary discharge of solar array induced by hypervelocity impact were given through hypervelocity impact experiments. Finally, it will provide a valuable benchmark for the construction of solar array against space debris.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have provided quantitative estimates of existing WP gaps and constraining factors for global maize production. Using a meta-analysis of 473 published studies covering 31 countries and 5,553 observations (932 site-years), we found the global average WP value for irrigated maize was 18.6 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> mm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. These WPs varied by factors such as seasonal precipitation, irrigation regimes, soil organic matter and soil pH. In current production systems, there exists a huge scope for improvement in maize WP, but the reported field experiments achieved only 20–46% of potential WP across all countries. Considering the future, raising WP to 85% of potential WP by 2050, a 100% increase in maize production could be achieved with 20% less planted area and 21% less water consumption than in 2005. Closing the WP gap may be critical to ensuring food security and achieving sustainable global agriculture.</jats:p>"

This effect is more evident in the food industries due to the high impact that this sector has on environmental and economical sustainability, considering the primary role of packaging systems, the huge water consumption both for the production and the cleaning processes or the energy utilization related to the treatment plant or to the raw material production. Thus, the aim of this study was to review the current state of soft drink supply chains with respect to industrial sustainability issues. For this reason, a comprehensive literature review was performed to understand what sustainable best practices and key performance indicators are largely applied to soft drink supply chains and then a comparison with two soft drink case studies was proposed to identify if there is a positive correlation between the literature and practical activities. The proposed case studies were thoroughly analyzed highlighting how the production process impacts on sustainability and pointing out potential best practices and key performance indicators. The key conclusion of this study is, on the one hand, to depict the current set of sustainable best practices and key performance indicators which companies performed according to the literature review and, therefore, revise the actual body of the literature, and, on the other hand, to figure out which of these best (or proper) practices and key performance indicators are also implemented in the real world, helping companies to make decisions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Functioning, healthy groundwater ecosystems are essential for high quality drinking water, and they minimize costs of processing groundwater for drinking purposes. </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>GroundCare is a multidisciplinary project, which is led by the Helmholz Institute in Munich, Germany and funded by the BMBF (German federal Ministry of education and Research). The aim is to parametrize and to quantify groundwater ecosystem services as a basis for sustainable water management and water pollution control by biomonitoring. In other words: the development of biological assessment techniques. </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Multiple parameters are evaluated (physico-chemical parameters, microbial and fauna community composition, ecotoxicological effects). Invertebrate fauna is investigated at five sites all across Germany. During the project, molecular identification through DNA Barcoding and Metabarcoding of groundwater invertebrates is being implemented and compared to traditional morphological bio-assessment. The subterranean fauna can be used as bio-indicators to validate groundwater conditions, in particular surface water intrusion. For the water suppliers, surface water intrusion means an increased risk of contamination. The discrimination of epigean from stygobiotic fauna is the simple and basic idea of this approach. </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>A very specific kind of water treatment is used by the water works in Würzburg (Bavaria), one of the fife study sites, which is located directly along the Main river bank. Uncommonly, they use part time river bank filtration if land-side groundwater levels are low. Another possibility is the extraction of Main River water by near-bank wells, followed by intensive water treatment and then the water is infiltrated again. </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The question asked was, whether the fauna indicates this specific situation or not. In the area, three types of subsurface waters can be distinguished, which are land-side groundwater, riverbank water and artificially infiltrated Main river water. Representative bores were sampled four times over one year for invertebrates. First results clearly show that the faunal patterns reflect these different hydrological situations.</jats:p>"

Here, the power needed to generate lift and fly at the speeds typical of modern large dragonflies is examined together with the metabolic rate and subsequent heat generated by the thoracic muscles. This evaluation agrees with previous work suggesting that the larger specimens would rapidly overheat in the high ambient temperatures assumed in the Permian. Various extant mechanisms of thermoregulation are modelled and quantified, including behaviour, radiation and the constraints on convective respiration and evaporation imposed by air flow through spiracles. However, the effects of these on cooling an overheated insect are found to be limited. Instead, an examination of the heat budget in the flight medium indicates that, at about 1.6 bar (160 kPa), thermoregulation supply enters into equilibrium and, even at high ambient temperatures, overheating can be avoided and enough oxygen sourced. This approach indicates how fossil biology can be used to examine past atmospheres.</jats:p>",

The wide range closed-loop stability is achieved by the recently proposed coordinated control law, in which the neutron flux and the temperatures of both main steam and primary coolant are chosen as controlled variables, and the flowrates of both primary and secondary loop and the control rod speed are chosen as manipulated variables. However, the thermal power is only controlled in open loop manner and hence could be further optimized through feedback. Motivated by this, a dynamic matrix control (DMC) is proposed for optimizing the thermal power of MHTGR based NSSS. A simple step-response model with the thermal power response data is utilized in designing the DMC. The design objective of DMC is to optimize the deviation of the thermal power from its reference under its rate constraint. Then, by the virtue of strong stability of existing control law and optimization ability of DMC, a cascade control structure is implemented for the thermal power optimization, with the coordinated control law in the inner loop and DMC in the outer loop. Numerical simulation results show the satisfactory improvement of thermal power response. This cascade control structure inherits the advantages of both proportional-integral-differential (PID) control and DMC, by which the zeros offset and the short settling time of thermal power are realized.</jats:p>"

This paper introduces a single-stage continuous conduction mode (CCM) soft-switched power factor correction (PFC) converter with a tandem topology. The proposed topology has two operating modes, namely resonant operation mode and boost operation mode. Such a design and control realizes the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS) of the power switches. The proposed topology has been introduced to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input current further in the boost PFC converter under lower power and higher output voltage conditions. The simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the performance of the proposed design and its control.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we test for allocative efficiency of fuel inputs for the Korean electric power industry over the period of 1990–2015. The potential cost savings and maximum power supply price markdown are calculated by imposing allocative efficiency. The power plants, on average, could have reduced their fuel costs by as much as 22.1% annually. The attainment of allocative efficiency would have enabled the power supply price to be cut by 7.6% annually. </jats:p>",

Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner‐occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply.</jats:p>",

The external social capital consists of external cognitive capital, external relationship capital, external structure capital and external position capital in this paper. Inter-organizational knowledge trading is divided into explicit knowledge trading and tacit knowledge trading. The results show that external structure capital and external position capital have significant positive impact on explicit knowledge trading, tacit knowledge trading and enterprise innovation performance. External cognitive capital has significant positive impact on explicit knowledge trading and tacit knowledge trading, it does not impact enterprise innovation performance significantly. Although external relationship capital has significant positive impact on tacit knowledge trading, it does not impact explicit knowledge trading and enterprise innovation performance significantly.

Etna volcano are frequently recognized as the result of complex crystallization regimes that, at shallow crustal levels, unexpectedly change from H2O-undersaturated to H2O-saturated conditions, due to the impulsive and irregular arrival of volatile-rich magmas from mantle depths. On this basis, we have performed hydrous crystallization experiments for a quantitative understanding of the role of H2O in the differentiation of deep-seated trachybasaltic magmas at the key pressure of the Moho transition zone. For H2O = 2.1–3.2 wt %, the original trachybasaltic composition shifts towards phonotephritic magmas never erupted during the entire volcanic activity of Mt. Etna. Conversely, for H2O = 3.8–8.2 wt %, the obtained trachybasalts and basaltic trachyandesites reproduce most of the pre-historic and historic eruptions. The comparison with previous low pressure experimental data and natural compositions from Mt. Etna provides explanation for (1) the abundant release of H2O throughout the plumbing system of the volcano during impulsive ascent of deep-seated magmas; (2) the upward acceleration of magmas feeding gas-dominated, sustained explosive eruptions; (3) the physicochemical changes of gas-fluxed magmas ponding at shallow crustal levels; and (4) the huge gas emissions measured at the summit craters and flank vents which result in a persistent volcanic gas plume.</jats:p>"

Hence, traditional SC philosophies are being restructured nowadays to fulfill different business goals. Articulation of lean, agile, green and resilient SC strategies could amply be found in the literature; however, integration of those in various modes may definitely improve overall SC’s performance. Past researchers have focused on the integration of lean, agile and green paradigms together to ensure an efficient SC construct. But the integration of green and resilient paradigm has been rarely reported in the literature. To deal with the unexpected situations/disturbances in the SC management along with embedded environmental consciousness, the purpose of this paper is to integrate the resilient SC and green SC philosophies; thereof to evaluate of an overall SC “g-resilient”/“ecosilient” index for a case automotive company.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A consolidated list consisting of supply chain practices (combining green and resilient performance indices) have been articulated in this study. A decision-making group has been assumed; where, the role of the decision makers is to provide individuals’ judgment (subjective opinion) toward determining the weight and the rating (performance extent) of various performance indices. The overall g-resilient SC performance has been determined by computing a unique ecosilient (g-resilient) index. The concepts of fuzzy performance importance index along with Degree of Similarity (DOS) adapted from fuzzy set theory (FST) have been applied to rank various performance indicators. In addition to that, the interrelationships amongst various g-resilient indices (performance indicators) have also been established through interpretive structural modeling.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>By exploring the concept of fuzzy DOS, outlined in the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers set theory, various SC performance indicators have been classified into three distinct performance categories/levels (namely regretful, tolerable, and satisfactory).

After 87 days, fish fed with supplemented diet, regardless of frequency (100% and 25%), showed an increase in the total lactic acid bacteria count of 7.99±0.15 log CFU mL-1 and 7.04±1, 29 log UFC mL-¹ respectively, in the intestinal tract and decrease of Pseudomonas spp. in both 100% and 25% (4.09±0.84log UFC mL-1 and 4.00±1.12log UFC mL-1, respectively) in relation to the control treatment (6.74±1.04log UFC mL-1). Fish fed with 100% of diets supplemented with probiotics had a higher leukocyte count (47.7±6.7x103μL-1), lymphocytes (36.0±2.6x103μL1), monocytes (12.0±4.2x103μl-1), as well as higher mean final weight (10.60±0.89g) and weekly growth rate (0.80±0.08g.week-1) than the other treatments (25% of probiotic offered and control). Probiotic (Lactobacillus spp.) offered in 25% of feeds (or more) alters the yellowtail lambari microbiota (A. bimaculatus); however, must be offer in 100% of feeds to improve the hematology profile and productive performance.</jats:p>"

In this study, an optimal controller that considers demand as control variable is designed to dampen propagated inventory fluctuations for each node throughout the supply chain network. The model proves to be very useful in revealing the dynamic characteristics of the chain and provides a proper interface to study decisions taken into account at each node of the supply chain in different periods by decision makers (DMs). In the proposed approach, two feedback loops and online updated values of net stock quantities are used for calculation of the orders. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real case of bicycle industry is conducted. The acquired results justify the efficiency of the proposed approach in controlling and dampening the bullwhip effect and reducing inventory levels, net stock quantities and inventory attributed costs throughout the supply chain network layers.</jats:p>",

Whereas underground cabling is expensive for the distribution system operator (DSO), an alternative microgrid investment could benefit the DSO and consumer, provided the necessary changes were made in the network regulation. A rural detached house customer microgrid is analysed in comparison to underground cabling, considering the uncertainties in the calculation parameters through a sensitivity analysis. Adequacy of the microgrid power supply during unexpected network outage for a reasonably long duration is assessed, as well as the economics of the feasible microgrid setup consisting of variable generation, controllable generation, and electric storage. The total costs and benefits for the DSO and consumer/prosumer are considered. A microgrid would likely be a more cost-efficient option overall, but not as-is for the consumer. The battery energy storage system (BESS)-related cost-sharing strategies are suggested in this paper in order to assess possible break-even investment solutions for the related parties. The sensitivities of the microgrid and cabling investments were considered in particular. Cost-sharing strategies under network regulatory framework would need to be developed further in order for both the consumer and DSO to benefit from the solution as a whole.</jats:p>"

Product counterfeiting is a worldwide business issue which effect firm’s supply chain (supply chain sustainability) directly or indirectly. The study used a quantitative research design technique where categorical and numerical variables are used to determine relationships among variables where a survey is used as a main research method. Futuristically, the developed instrument using EFA would lead to the CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) to answer questions regarding validity of the instrument in the concerned population subgroups. This empirical study is done after conducting Initial Survey where pilot testing procedure of Initial instrument was followed to make sure that questions asked were good enough (reliability analysis) to capture the impacts of ANCT-INT (Anti-Counterfeiting Strategies Initiative) on the FSP (Firms’ Supply Performance). The Pilot test process of Initial Survey Instrument is conducted prior to an actual data collection (confirmatory survey) stage that can helps researcher in refining the confirmatory survey instrument. The pilot test is conducted under the patronage of PAAPAM (Pakistan Association of Automobile Parts and Accessories Manufacturers) secretariat in Lahore. The participants involved are the Automotive Engineering firms practicing as the permanent PAAPAM member firms.</jats:p>",

This study was a cross sectional community survey marked by field survey involving mapping, discharge measurement, potable water samples collection (springs, streams, rain, wells and boreholes) and laboratory analysis. Twelve pipe born water supply schemes and thirty-eight water sources were appraised within two intervals (March-July 2015 and October 2017-March 2018). Chemical analysis was done using an Ion Chromatography and microbial analyses using the presumptive test method and standard plate count. Hospital registers were reviewed on prevalence of water borne diseases. The results showed that major challenges of water supply included; dilapidated pipes, spring inputs and climate variability. Hydro chemical faces were sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride water types. A total Coliform count of 43 to &gt;1100 per 100ml was recorded for March and July 2015 and 0-236Tcfu in March 2018. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi were probably responsible for high rate of water borne diseases. There is need to develop standardize integrated water management plan in this area.</jats:p>"

A hybrid approach based on the Markov process and mathematical programming techniques is presented to design the distribution network of a supply chain in an integrated manner. In the first phase, the Markov process derives some performance features of inventory policy. In the second phase, using outputs of the Markov process, the location-inventory problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. Moreover, a robust possibilistic programming approach is utilized, which is able to provide a more stable supply chain structure under almost all possible values of imprecise parameters. Since the proposed problem is complicated to solve by means of exact methods, we develop a simulated annealing algorithm in order to find near-optimal solutions in reasonable computational times. The obtained computational results reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution approach. Finally, some insights are provided and the performance of the proposed robust optimization approach is compared to traditional possibilistic chance constrained method.</jats:p>",

The main reason is the high costs of straw collection and transportation because farmers are scattered across the country and farming in a small-scaled method for self-support. This study aims at solving the issue with the introduction of China’s rural official organizations to collect agriculture straw in a centralized way and to share benefits with farmers. We apply the approach of multi-agent modeling and simulation to analyze the farmer’s participation behavior within a co-opetition supply strategy after the rural official organizations are incorporated. The results demonstrate that farmers’ participation is positively affected by the cooperative enthusiasm of rural official organizations. In addition to those basic factors, such as straw price, transportation cost, and shipping distance, the benefit sharing policy has a significant impact on the equilibrium percentage of the cooperative farmers. We recommend that the Chinese central government encourage and support rural official organizations to participate in the agriculture straw supply chain, and the benefit sharing policy should be implemented with the precaution against free rides.</jats:p>"

In this research, all hydrometeorological variables were investigated and four to six appropriate variables were selected for each sub-basin and probability distributions applicable for each variable were estimated. As a result of verifying KSWSI results, the accuracy of KSWSI showed better drought phenomenon in drought events than MSWSI. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification of KSWSI calculation procedure was also carried out using the maximum entropy (ME) theory. Estimating appropriate probability distributions for each drought component in the flood season is crucial because ME values and standard deviations of KSWSI are huge, implying that large uncertainty occurs in the flood season. It is confirmed that the accuracy of KSWSI may be affected by the hydrometerological variables selection, station data obtained, used data length, and probability distributions. Furthermore, monthly probabilistic drought predictions were calculated based on the ensemble technique using KSWSI. In 2006 and 2014 drought events, the accuracy of drought predictions using KSWSI was higher than those using MSWSI, demonstrating that KSWSI is able to enhance the accuracy of drought prediction.</jats:p>",

The model intends to propose superb restoration plans by performing sensitivity analyses using several restoration scenarios. The developed model was applied to an actual metropolitan waterworks system currently operating in South Korea and successfully suggested the most efficient restoration approaches (given seismic damage) to minimize the complete recovery time and suspension of water service.

Retail buyers and retailers will operate in Iran’s electricity market in the foreseeable future when smart grids are implemented thoroughly across Iran. As a result, there will be very much larger data of the electricity market in the future than ever before. If certain methods are devised to perform quick search in such large sizes of stored data, it will be possible to improve the forecasting accuracy of important variables in Iran’s electricity market. In this paper, available methods were employed to develop a new technique of Wavelet-Neural Networks-Particle Swarm Optimization-Simulation-Optimization (WT-NNPSO-SO) with the purpose of searching in Big Data stored in the electricity market and improving the accuracy of short-term forecasting of electricity supply and demand. The electricity market data exploration approach was based on the simulation-optimization algorithms. It was combined with the Wavelet-Neural Networks-Particle Swarm Optimization (Wavelet-NNPSO) method to improve the forecasting accuracy with the assumption Length of Training Data (LOTD) increased. In comparison with previous techniques, the runtime of the proposed technique was improved in larger sizes of data due to the use of metaheuristic algorithms.

Further, a procedure for estimation of DC supply voltage based on inverter's current and open‐circuit battery voltage is proposed. A sliding mode observer is then used to obtain the actual value of open‐circuit battery voltage, required by the modelling algorithm. Consequently, an open‐circuit fault in a DC supply circuitry is determined based on the analysis of discrepancy between the estimated and measured DC supply voltage. Detection algorithm has been tested on a laboratory setup and its functionality is confirmed by experimental results.</jats:p>",

Using organizational information processing theory (OIPT), we study demand visibility and supply visibility as foundational resources for analytics capability, and organizational flexibility as a complementary capability. We further examine relationships among these factors under varying conditions of market volatility, a type of environmental uncertainty. The results from our analysis of data from 191 global firms indicate that both demand and supply visibility are associated with the development of analytics capability. In turn, analytics capability is shown to be more strongly associated with operational performance when supply chain organizations also possess organizational flexibility needed to act upon analytics‐generated insights quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that analytics capability and organizational flexibility are more valuable as complementary capabilities for firms who operate in volatile markets, rather than in stable ones. These findings extend OIPT to create a better understanding of contemporary applications of information processing technologies, while also providing theoretically grounded guidance to managers in the development of analytics capabilities within their firms. </jats:p>",

They are of great significance in order to prevent ischemia during a myocardial infarction. Surgeries such as Konno's and Ross' procedures implies in knowledge of these vessels anatomy. The coronary arteries of 50 human hearts were injected with latex and subsequentely dissected with the purpose of identifying the arterial branch that supplied the septomarginal trabecula. The trabecular branch arose from the second anterior septal artery in 38% of cases, and the branch arose from the first anterior septal artery in 26%. One of the hearts had its septomarginal trabecula supplied by the conus arteriosus arteryliterature. Anastomoses between the right and left coronary arteries were found inside the septomarginal trabecula. The right branch of the atrioventricular bundle is subject to a great number of clinical conditions and is often manipulated during surgery, thus, the study of the septal branches of the coronary arteries and the trabecular branch is essential.</jats:p>"

We address the extent to which traditional wisdom and standard conceptual and empirical models that have girded thought about market power in the food chain for decades apply in modern food-market contexts and examine recent work on competition in the food chain to gauge the most promising paths forward. A key conclusion is that considerations that go beyond the bounds of standard models likely cause market power to be less than would be predicted based on the highly concentrated structures of many modern agricultural and food markets. These considerations include downstream buyers who rationally internalize long-run implications of their pricing decisions to farmers, powerful food manufacturers and retailers who countervail each other's market power, and the complex pricing decisions of multistore and multiproduct food retailers. </jats:p>",

Through field monitoring, the reduction rate of each pollutant per unit length of river reach and its correlation with the corresponding sinuosity were analysed. The results show that river sinuosity has different degrees of positive correlation with the growth rate of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the reduction rates of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP). River sinuosity needs to be above 1.42 to ensure the river's basic self-purification capability. We also discuss the mechanism of river sinuosity on water body self-purification and propose the increase in river sinuosity to improve the river's capacity to purify water from pollutants. This measure could enhance the growth rate of DO, the longitudinal hyporheic exchange flow, and the action time of other basic self-purification factors of the river. This study could help scientific decision-making in river reconstruction planning in the process of urbanization in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China.</jats:p>",

The results indicated that significantly higher grain (948 and 971 kg ha-1), stover (2433 and 2525 kg ha-1), biological (3381and 3496 kg ha-1) yields of blackgram were observed with the application of soil test based NPK+10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha-1 + 1 kg Mo ha-1 over rest of the treatments.With regards to soil fertility after crop harvest, soil test based application of NPK + 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha- 1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 resulted in the highest soil available N (223 and 228 kg ha-1), P (21.17 and 22 kg ha-1), K  (244 and 247.60 kg ha-1), S (19 and 19.78 kg ha-1)  and Mo (0.30 and 0.33  mg kg-1) over other INM treatments.  Similarly, soil test based application of NPK + 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha- 1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 recorded maximum gross returns (Rs.38584 and 50576 ha-1), net returns (Rs.20624.52 and 32415.09 ha-1) and benefit: cost ratio (2.15 and 2.78) over other nutritional treatments. Hence, study suggested that grower should follow soil test based application of NPK along with 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha- 1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 for fetching higher profitability from black gram cultivation in Eastern part of Indo Gangatic plains.</jats:p>"

This research develops an innovative sustainable supply chain performance measurement model for SMEs. Prior researches predominantly use balanced score card (BSC) approach that presume causal relationship of criteria and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which derive efficiency of units from a few input and output criteria. While DEA is effective for policymakers, BSC is more suitable for individual SME. The proposed method that uses structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to derive the relationship of criteria and criteria weights formulates regression-type models for a specific region as well as for specific SME. The SEM-based supply chain sustainability performance measurement model is beneficial to policymakers as they can determine means for improvement at a regional level. The proposed method could also facilitate managers/owners of individual SMEs with measures for improving their supply chain sustainability performance. The method has been applied to three varied geographical locations in the UK, France and India in order to demonstrate its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Reducing energy consumption during manufacturing is considered one of the most important strategies in contributing to the green supply chain. In this context, the authors propose a new predictive-reactive approach to control energy consumption during manufacturing processes. In addition to forecasting the energy needs, the proposed approach controls the uncertainty of energy volatility and limits energy waste during manufacturing processes. With the integration of this economic-environmental manufacturing efficiency in supply chains, and controlling uncertainty, this approach positively contributes to green and agile supply chains. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-2) is proposed as a predictive method, and a new reactive method is developed to dynamically control the energy consumption throughout the peak energy consumption in real time. The approach was tested on the AIP-PRIMECA benchmark, which reflects a real production cell.</jats:p>",

Malfunctions in ER‐related processes are responsible for the genesis and progression of many diseases, such as heart failure, cancer, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders. To fulfill many of its vital functions, the ER relies on a sufficient energy supply in the form of adenosine‐5′‐triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy source. Despite landmark discoveries and clarification of the functional principles of ER‐resident proteins and key ER‐related processes, the mechanism underlying ER ATP transport remains somewhat enigmatic. Here we summarize ER‐related ATP‐consuming processes and outline our knowledge about the nature and function of the ER energy supply.</jats:p>",

I explore the effect of two types of laws on the supply of NPs and PAs: occupational licensing laws that limit the practices of NPs and PAs and caps on noneconomic damages. Relaxing licensing laws to allow NPs to practice with less physician oversight increases the supply of NPs in areas with few practicing physicians by 60 percent—though the size of this increase decreases as the supply of physicians grows. I find similar, but weaker, evidence for granting PAs more autonomy. Noneconomic damages caps increase the supply of both NPs and PAs by about 60 percent at the lowest levels of physician supply. Examining the effects of these laws on the prevalence of health professional shortage areas, I find that licensing laws have meaningful effects on access to care.</jats:p>",

A related supply chain activated by construction activities should be taken into account to improve the sustainability in construction from a material and waste management perspective. However, it is unknown how the supply chain integration could contribute to the sustainable use of materials in construction. Therefore, an empirical investigation is conducted. A research model with eight latent-constructs is designed through a comprehensive literature review, and 70 completed survey questionnaires are received. Using PLS-SEM (partial least squares-structural equation modeling), sample data is analyzed and seven research hypotheses are examined.

As a method of reducing the return delivery water temperature, using heat absorption transformers (HAT) at central heat supply stations operating as absorption heat-exchange facility was considered. The exergetic efficiency was chosen as an evaluation criterion, because, given the difference in kinds of energy in the system, it allows to perform both relative and absolute estimates of thermodynamic effectiveness as well as takes into account the losses from non-equilibrium of processes in the system. Results are given of HAT multiparameter analysis that were obtained on the basis of a developed mathematical model, the reliability of which was experimentally tested. During analysis of the heat supply system, one should take into account the influence of return delivery water temperature on consumption of heat-transfer agents and power consumptions on driving the recycling pumps in the heating network and pumps in the consumer network. Additional components are inntroduced into the equation for determining the exergetic efficiency of CHPP. The traditional heat supply system is compared to the central heat supply station and the new system with an absorption transformer AT (central heat supply station) for different temperatures of delivery water in the flow line. The relative correspondence method proposed by V. P. Motulevich was used for the comparative analysis. The results are analyzed by the following lines of the heat supply system: Source-AT (central heat supply station), SourceConsumer. In the Source-Consumer line, a considerable increase is shown of exergetic efficiency in the new system at a rather high temperature of delivery water in the flow line. This is due to variation of power consumption on driving the recycling pumps and the generator unit capacity gains. Turbine-generator set T-100-130TMZ is selected as a source.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to examine the intent of investors/manufacturers of Bangladeshi RMG to engage in supply chain management practices. Bangladeshi garment industry is the leading export earner as well as main sources of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for Bangladesh over the decade. Development of the garment industry in Bangladesh was driven by the structural economic reforms of the 1980s, which opened the Bangladeshi economy towards foreign investment, deregulation of markets and privatization. Nowadays Bangladesh is well known across the globe for its vigorous success in the arena of readymade garment industry. On time deliverance, short lead time and desired quality product determines the criteria to gain the orders from international buyers. Thus, involve in supply chain management practices (SCMP) treated as compulsory requirement for these industries. To discover the absolute motive of RMG Investors/Manufacturers, the descriptive study was associated on 10 companies that are presently practiced SCM activities in Bangladesh. Standard questionnaires were utilized to accumulate the data. Research result showed 14 variables of Investor/Manufacturer motives are comprised in SCMP. Each variable was interconnected in nature. Four fundamental motivational factors stand as operational, economical, environmental &amp; ethical, and social &amp; behavioral. Shield motives of Investors/ Manufacturers can easily have recognized by these factors. This will assist the respective authority to control the RMG companies and acknowledged the forthcoming action steps to advance the supply chain management (SCM)system of this industry at Bangladesh. Rank order data interpretation represented that environmental motive and ethical motive are strong portent of Investor/Manufacturer motives to incorporate in Supply Chain Management practices.</jats:p>",

This paper describes a food-supply system in Galapagos that is mainly controlled by population growth, weak local agriculture, imports from mainland Ecuador and the influence of a growing tourism industry. We use system dynamics (SD) as a modeling technique in this paper to identify the main driving forces operating on the Galapagos food system to create a series of future scenarios and to examine the subsequent implications across the supply system structures. We model the supply side of the food system using secondary data collected from governmental and non-governmental sources. We find that the consumption profile of the local inhabitants of the Galapagos is on average higher than consumption in the Ecuadorian mainland. This fact, plus rapid growth of the local population fueled by the tourism industry, has created a decrease in per capita local food production and an increase on food import dependence that now, challenges the sustainability of the archipelago. Imports are the largest source of food in the archipelago. Approximately 75% of the agricultural food supply was transported from the mainland in 2017. Our model projects that this fraction will increase to 95% by 2037 with no changes in food policy. Moreover, any plan to increase tourism arrivals must be accompanied by a plan to address the subsistence needs of the new population that the tourism industry attracts. Policies to promote local agricultural growth should be central to the development strategy implemented in the Galapagos.</jats:p>",

The study extends the focus of sustainable packaging design to the collective of all supply chain actors. Decision criteria are identified via a literature review, and current product‐package alternatives are collected via interviews. With the inputs of these criteria and the alternative designs, a multi‐criteria decision‐making problem is formulated and solved using Best Worst Method (BWM). BWM finds the weights of the criteria. Using these weights, the ranking of the alternatives is found. The implementation of the analysis took place for three selected products of the Kraft Heinz Company. Data on the preferences of the supply chain members of these selected products were collected, and the optimal package designs were selected. It is shown through sensitivity analysis that modifying the weights that decision makers assign to the preferences of the supply chain members and the importance of the dimensions of sustainability have an effect on the selection of the optimal design.</jats:p>",

The waters analysed are chloride-sodium, sulphide, iodide (Cl–Na, S, I) or chloride-sodium, sulphide (Cl–Na, S) and are especially associated with deep circulation systems (Jurassic limestones) or shallow circulation systems mostly connected with Cretaceous formations (Senonian marls and limestones and Cenomanian sands and sandstones). The aim of this research is to evaluate the similarities or differences between samples of curative water taken from different geological formations and locations. Principal component analysis was used to assess the similarities between samples of curative waters collected from the intakes being examined. Two principal components were extracted. The analysis indicated that there is a difference between the chemical composition of waters taken from different stratigraphies. Water samples from Cretaceous formations of Cenomanian and Senonian age are similar. There is a small difference observed for waters abstracted from the Neogene and Cretaceous. However, these differences mostly resulted from SO42− and Ca2+ concentrations.</jats:p>",

With the approach described to determine a characteristic moisture content value for aeolian transport, we obtained surface moisture values of 1.2% to 3.2% for wind average and wind gust respectively, implying that we need a quite dry beach. This indicates that the main area for aeolian transport corresponds to the upper part of the intertidal source, most likely the region between mean high tide line and spring high tide line.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the world’s largest oligotrophic marginal seas. Increases in biomass and primary production in the surface layer of the northern SCS are affected by anthropogenic aerosol use among north Asian peoples. The seasonal variation of dry deposition and its contribution to new production in the ocean are vital to determining the effect that such dry deposition has on the biogeochemical cycle of the SCS. This study collected 240 samples of total suspended particles at Dongsha Island in the northern SCS from April 2007 to March 2009; the major ions and water-soluble nitrogen species in the samples were analyzed. The analysis results indicated that the concentration distributions of major water-soluble ions and nitrogen species in total suspended particles exhibited significant seasonal (source) variation. The north-east monsoon seasons (autumn to spring) brought relatively high concentrations because most air masses during this period arrived from the northern continental region. We found that the concentration of nitrogen species shows a latitude distribution, gradually decreasing from north to south. In addition, this study also discovered that the ratio of organic nitrogen to total dissolved or water-soluble nitrogen also varies in a similar manner, resulting in a concentration of &lt;20% for locations north of 30° N and &gt;30% for those south of 30° N. Aerosols at Dongsha Island mainly comprised sea salt; however, significant chloride depletion was observed during the north-east monsoon season. The molar ratio of NH4+ to non–sea salt (NSS) sulfate (nss-SO42−) was 0.8, indicating that the amount of artificially produced NH4+ in the region was insufficient for reaction with nss-SO42−. Therefore, NH4+ was mainly present in the form of NH4HSO4. The fluxes of water-soluble inorganic nitrogen (WSIN) and water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) within the region were 23 ± 13 and 27 ± 15 mmol m−2 y−1, respectively. The new production converted from atmospheric water-soluble nitrogen species in the northern SCS was estimated to be 0.52–0.81 mmol C m−2 d−1. This flux made about 5.6–8.7% (the global average was about 3.5%) contribution to the primary production (9.24 mmol C m−2 d−1) of the SCS surface water. This result indicates that the ocean’s external nitrogen supply, provided by anthropogenic aerosols, is vital for the biogeochemical cycle in Asian marginal seas, particularly the northern SCS.</jats:p>"

Chlorination, UV254 irradiation and ozonation are the main disinfection methods used in water treatment processes. Although studies have shown that triclosan could react with free chlorine and ozone, and undergo photolysis under UV irradiation, few of them focused on the effects of disinfection processes on the biotoxicity of triclosan. In the present study, the potential risk of triclosan in water before and after laboratory-scale disinfection processes, including chlorination, UV254 irradiation and ozonation, was evaluated by bioassay. The results showed that both acute toxicity and genetic toxicity of triclosan was increased by chlorination and UV254 disinfection but decreased by ozone disinfection. In other words, ozonation would be a preferential disinfection method for triclosan-containing surface waters. This finding will help us to choose an appropriate disinfection method for water treatment. Furthermore, it is proved that bioassay could be a feasible way for risk evaluation when concentrations of antibiotics in surface waters or drinking waters are very low.</jats:p>",

HM Sampoerna Tbk Indonesia, a leading Indonesian tobacco company, and examined its potential and constraints. The program was intended to develop cooperation between the company and its tobacco suppliers to get a sustainable supply of tobacco from farmers with quantity, quality and price set according to the companyâ€™s standards. This study employed an interpretive research design, following a post-positivist paradigm. The data were collected by means of in-depth interviews, observation and document study and were analyzed using the key tenet of Martin Heideggerâ€™s interpretive phenomenology. The interpretive process was achieved through hermeneutic circle to understand how individuals involved in the program interpreted the program including their own experiences as well as their interactions with other parties. The results of the study indicated that the created contract farming partnership was capable of providing the company with a sustainable supply of tobacco and increasing its production volume. Nevertheless, it was unable to improve the quality of the farmersâ€™ lives as it was chiefly intended to meet the companyâ€™s commercial needs. The results from the study have direct relevance to policy makers in Indonesia, especially those that have been implemented contract farming and to agribusiness companies seeking contractual relationships for commodity production.Â Â Â </jats:p>"

A variety of cost management techniques requires the identification of their relationship with the requirements of operations management. Identified seven key concepts of operations management, analyzed their essence, information requirements. Systematized cost management techniques accordance with modern concepts of operations management such as: standart-costing, break-even analysis, direct-costing, life-cycle costing, target costing, value analysis, functional analysis, activity-based costing, sensitivity analysis, JIT-costing, kaizen costing, activity-based cost management, value-chain analysis. The aim of the article is the establishment relevance of costing methods with the key concepts of operations management companies.The article deals with the problems of formation of innovational and investment security and its influence on the economic development of Ukraine and the macro-environment favorable for business development. For this purpose the integral indicator of Ukraineâ€™s economic security and its components are calculated: investment-innovation, production, demographic, energy, foreign economic, macroeconomic, food, social, and financial.Significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment in Ukraine during 2014 â€“ 2017 yrs. was accompanied by a decline in its competitive position at the global level and the ability to compete with other major investment-friendly countries for foreign investors in the world. The main attention is paid to the identification of modern factors of influence that promote or hinder the development of innovation and investment activities. There are revealed the reasons for the formation of negative trends in the development of innovation activity in the system of ensuring economic security of the state, which is amplified by the low level of its investment attractiveness as a whole, as well as the limited investment opportunities for further development of the country.The conceptual model of the mechanism for providing innovative and investment security at the state and regional levels, aimed at technological modernization of the economy, is proposed. It is argued that the effectiveness of this mechanism is ensured through the commercialization of the results of innovation activities. The approach to assess the effectiveness of the mechanism of commercialization of innovations and their impact on the formation of innovation and investment security of development in the regions of Ukraine, which takes into account the intensity of the production of new knowledge; the speed of transforming new knowledge into specific technologies, products, services; the effectiveness of innovation and investment activity; the level of perception of changes or the readiness of enterprises for the implementation of innovative technologies; network technological readiness of the region, etc. This approach is important from the point of view of implementing of the European methodology of a reasonable specialization of the regions of the country.Â Â </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water scarcity is still a major problem in many rural communities in Nigeria. In this study, a rain water harvesting system was designed for Ogbekpen, a rural community in Edo state, Nigeria. A conceptual model for rainwater harvesting was developed using the storm water management model (SWMM), Arcmap 10.1 software and daily rainfall data (2000-2016) obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET). Runoff, rainfall intensity and change in elevation of three designated catchment zones were taken into consideration. The results revealed that the total amount of rainwater that could be harvested annually (water supply) was 14,314,351.70 L (14,314 m3) from an overall effective rooftop area of 6025.9 m2. This was three times the annual water demand (4,317,965.60 L (4318 m3)), thus demonstrating the capability of the system to meet annual water demand.  The required tank capacities for zones 1, 2 and 3 were 870,412.76 L (870 m3), 955,319.4 5L (955 m3) and 788,629.88 L (789 m3) respectively. Comparative physicochemical and microbial analysis of water from rooftops in the three zones and an existing storage well showed that the latter did not comply with drinking water quality guidelines, thus highlighting the importance of a proper conveyance and storage system to improve water quality and availability in the area.</jats:p>",

For high current regulation, the stray inductance will cause high noise and surge voltage that may damage the power electronics. In addition, it is difficult to ensure both a fast response and a steady evolution. In this paper, a power supply based on a buck converter for high current regulation in an inductive load is described, in which insulated gate bipolar transistors are used as switches and two capacitor banks are used for energy storage. The first stage capacitor bank at a higher voltage ensures the fast current growth rate at the beginning of discharge and plays the role of wave filter later to reduce the noise. The second stage capacitor bank at a lower voltage provides the main energy required during discharge. A microcontroller is used to regulate the current by a feedback mechanism. This power supply can regulate the high current in an inductive load with low noise and fast response, which has been applied to the poloidal field coils and the ultrafast reciprocating probe system in the SUNIST (Sino-UNIted Spherical Tokamak) spherical tokamak.</jats:p>",

To minimize the uneaten feed, many systems have been developed. Nevertheless, current systems can be improved by considering the fish position in the tank and the falling feed. In this paper, we propose a system based on fish presence sensors set at different tank heights and a feed detection sensor located in the drainage tubes. The fish presence sensor is based on light-dependent resistor (LDR). The calibration of these sensors is shown. When the output voltage is higher than 1.467 V, we can consider that fish are present. On the other side, the falling feed sensor is based on a CMOS sensor. The calibration process is performed with 40 pictures. The summation of pixels, with brightness value between 0 and 15 in the blue histogram, is used as an indicator of feed presence. If this value is higher than 520 pixels, we can consider that there is feed in the picture. Moreover, a verification process of both sensors is done. The results of the verification confirm the calibration. Finally, the operation of the system is shown.</jats:p>",

Therefore, fouling mitigation is one of the most important aspects in the field of membrane separation developments. In the present study, solely TiO2 and TiO2/carbon nanotubes (CNT) composite modified PVDF membranes were prepared and used to purify oil-in-water emulsions. Achievable fluxes, reversible and irreversible filtration resistances, fouling models, filtration efficiencies and photocatalytic activities were compared in case of different nanomaterial covered and unmodified PVDF membranes. Applying either solely TiO2 or solely CNT coating resulted in the significant reduction of total filtration resistance in both cases, but the combination of the two components (TiO2 with 1 wt% CNT) resulted in by far the highest flux and lowest resistance, meanwhile, the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the composite was also achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this study demonstrates the beneficial effects of the combination of TiO2 and CNT nanomaterials for the first time in the field of membrane separation of oil-in-water emulsions.</jats:p>",

The supply chain of agricultural products as its carrier has always been a research hotspot in academia and business circles. Applying the Internet of Things and NFC technology to the agricultural product supply chain area will play an important role in the intelligent management and traceability of agricultural product supply chains. The intelligent management and traceability of agricultural products supply chain are the management of data information. How to collect, store, process, analyze, and visualize the data information during the flow of agricultural products from the source to the table is an important issue which needs urgent research. This paper proposes and validates the NFC technology assumption of the application value of agricultural product supply chain. The communication interface between the agricultural product supply chain data acquisition terminal and the collection terminal module and peripheral equipment based on BD, GSM, and NFC module is designed. The physical storage structure of the NFC tag is then planned, and the DES and RSA encryption algorithms of the NFC tag are implemented. According to the theory of Internet of Things, the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain is divided into four levels: physical layer, service layer, data layer, and application layer. The three major areas of enterprise management, user query, and government supervision are designed to trace the information flow and system. Finally, this paper analyzes the hardware resources needed for the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain and uses the resources of the cooperative supply chain enterprise to implement the system application and deployment. The experiment verifies that the real‐time traceability monitoring system for agricultural product supply chain proposed in this paper is effective in practical application.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Flow of liquid melt in the crystallizer is a little-studied process. Analytical solutions of melt flow in general case refer to complex mathematical problems, therefore numerical methods are used to model it. The purpose of this work is to use numerical method proposed by Professor V.I. Odinokov, based on finite-difference representation of the initial system of equations. This method has been successfully used in mechanics of continuous media, in foundry industry in mathematical modeling of strained deformed state of shell molds on investment models,as well as in other technological works, which indicates its universality. In the present study, the object of research is hydrodynamic flows of liquid metal during steel casting into a rectangular section mold when fed from a submerged nozzle with eccentric holes, and the result is a spatial mathematical model describing the flows of liquid metal in the crystallizer. To simulate the processes occurring in the crystallizer, the software complex “Odyssey” was used. The theoretical calculation is based on fundamental equations of hydrodynamics and approved numericalmethod. Solution of differential equations system formulatedin the work was carried out numerically. Investigated area was divided into elements of finite dimensions, for each element the resulting system of equations was written in the difference form. The result of the solution is velocity field of metal flow in crystallizer volume. To solve the system of algebraic equations obtained, a numerical scheme and a calculation algorithm were developed. Based on developed numerical scheme and algorithm, a computation program was compiled in Fortran-4. Mathematical model makes it possible to vary geometric dimensions of the crystallizer and cross-section of metal exit openings from the immersion nozzle, and it can also help to understand the flow pattern of the cast metal that affects heat dissipation of crystallizer walls and to find the optimal parameters for liquid metal outlet from the gravy glass at various casting modes. As an example it is given calculation of steel casting into a rectangular mold with a height of 100 cm and a section of 2000×40 (cm) in plan. Casting was carried out from immersion nozzle eccentrically in both sides in a horizontal plane. The calculation results are presented in graphical form. The movement of liquid metal flows is shown, their magnitudes and intensity are determined. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Evaluating the performance of watershed models is essential for a reliable assessment of water resources, particularly in Pacific island watersheds, where modeling efforts are challenging due to their unique features. Such watersheds are characterized by low water residence time, highly permeable volcanic rock outcrops, high topographic and rainfall spatial variability, and lack of hydrological data. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for hydrological modeling of the Nuuanu area watershed (NAW) and Heeia watershed on the Island of Oahu (Hawaii). The NAW, which had well-distributed rainfall gauging stations within the watershed, was used for comparison with the Heeia watershed that lacked recoded rainfall data within the watershed. For the latter watershed, daily rain gauge data from the neighboring watersheds and spatially interpolated 250 m resolution rainfall data were used. The objectives were to critically evaluate the performance of SWAT under rain gauge data scarce conditions for small-scale watersheds that experience high rainfall spatial variability over short distances and to determine if spatially interpolated gridded rainfall data can be used as a remedy in such conditions. The model performance was evaluated by using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the percent bias (PBIAS), and the coefficient of determination (R2), including model prediction uncertainty at 95% confidence interval (95PCI). Overall, the daily observed streamflow hydrographs were well-represented by SWAT when well-distributed rain gauge data were used for NAW, yielding NSE and R2 values of &gt; 0.5 and bracketing &gt; 70% of observed streamflows at 95PCI. However, the model showed an overall low performance (NSE and R2 ≤ 0.5) for the Heeia watershed compared to the NAW’s results. Although the model showed low performance for Heeia, the gridded rainfall data generally outperformed the rain gauge data that were used from outside of the watershed. Thus, it was concluded that finer resolution gridded rainfall data can be used as a surrogate for watersheds that lack recorded rainfall data in small-scale Pacific island watersheds.</jats:p>"

The inventory policies considered are the (r,Q) and (s,S) policies. In the (r,Q) inventory policy an order for Q units is placed every time the inventory level reaches level r, while in the s,S policy the inventory is reviewed in predefined intervals. If the inventory is found to be below level s, an order is placed to bring the level back to level S. Additionally, to address demand uncertainty four safety stock formulations are presented: (1) proportional to throughput, (2) proportional to throughput with risk‐pooling effect, (3) explicit risk‐pooling, and (4) guaranteed service time. The models proposed allow simultaneous optimization of safety stock, reserve, and base stock levels in tandem with material flows in supply chain planning.

Supply chains provisioning the public sector, incorporating a vast array of materials used in public services such as education, health, social housing and transportation, have been under‐researched and under‐theorised in the geographical and wider social science literature on Global Production Networks, Global Value Chains and consumption ethics. Against this backdrop, the paper evaluates the emergence of ethical trading programmes involving labour standards in<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>public sector sourcing, drawing on examples from the health, higher education, construction and transportation sectors and a methodology combining interviews with participant observation. Findings show that ethical public procurement is shaped, and often constrained, by: the relatively low profile of many materials used in public services, which challenge effective campaigning and advocacy work; the consequent limits to reputational risk for state departments and first‐tier suppliers if labour issues are encountered in their supply chains; and the significant role of<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EU</jats:styled-content>and<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>procurement law, which until 2014 rendered social responsibility in public sector sourcing a legal risk to specify. Through a practice‐orientated approach and adopting the notion of responsibilisation inspired by governmentality perspectives, the paper grasps how these challenges for ethical public procurement are encountered and negotiated by procurement managers and those influencing them in a neoliberal environment. It is shown that ethical sourcing is significantly less advanced in the<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content>public sector than it is in consumer goods sectors, with implications for social justice in a whole realm of under‐researched global supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The constantly increasing CO2 emissions are threatening the environment tremendously. Facing the pressure of environmental activists and public opinion, businesses and governments are taking action to reduce carbon emissions. Among these endeavors, carbon tax and subsidy policies proposed by governments are widely adopted. Remanufacturing is believed to save manufacturing costs and reduce carbon emissions from the process of enterprise operation, and it is increasingly being accepted by enterprises. However, different consumers’ willingness to pay for remanufactured products and the durability of new products will also affect consumers’ willingness to buy remanufactured products. Therefore, considering the discrepancy between consumer willingness to pay and product durability, we established the trade-old-for-remanufactured (TOR) model for a scenario of carbon tax and government subsidies. Through the analysis of the model, we obtained the optimal pricing and production decisions of manufacturers (remanufacturers) in the case of carbon tax and government subsidies. Our results show that, when there is no carbon tax constraint, the increase in consumer willingness to pay and the adjustment in product durability can stimulate consumers to participate in TOR projects and augment enterprises’ profits. However, it can also lead to a carbon rebound that increases corporate carbon emissions. When there is a carbon tax constraint, the introduction of carbon tax contributes to a reduction in carbon emissions, while enterprises tend to lose profits. In order to achieve a “win-win” between corporate profits and carbon emissions, we considered government subsidy policies. Our numerical examples illustrate that appropriate carbon tax and government subsidies can curb carbon emissions and also increase profits for enterprises.</jats:p>"

Adopting a game-theoretic method, we start the analysis from a simple bilateral monopoly supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer.

The retailers order products to meet consumers' demand in an uncertain market. One retailer has the power to obtain private information. The results show that the wholesale price and the carbon emission abatement level respond positively to the demand signal. We find that the well-informed retailer is better off with low-demand information sharing and worse off with high-demand information sharing in a bilateral monopoly supply chain. However, the well-informed retailer can benefit from high-demand information sharing in a competitive environment. We also find that the uninformed retailer may get hurt from information sharing under certain conditions. Moreover, the manufacturer's expected profit is related to the capability of abating carbon emissions, the information accuracy, and the demand uncertainty.</jats:p>",

It is essential to assess landscape services and multifunctionality from both supply and demand points of view toward sustainable landscape management. This study focused on the spatiotemporal variations of the supply, demand, and budget of landscape services in suburban Shanghai, China, including crop production, nutrient regulation, air-quality regulation, soil-erosion regulation, water purification, and recreation and aesthetical value. A new index landscape multifunctionality budget (BMFI) was developed, integrating the budget status of surplus and deficit with landscape management. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and regression analysis were conducted to identify spatial agglomeration and influencing factors of BMFI. Pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity of landscape services was observed. BMFI was in surplus status in 2005 and 2010, but turned to deficit in 2015. Landscape service budgets generally followed the spatial pattern of positive in the west and negative in the east. Budget deficits covered half of the villages in 2015, which were mainly situated near central Shanghai with high population density, high average income, and a fragmented and less diverse landscape pattern. Rapid urban sprawl and the following land-cover changes are the main drivers for the spatiotemporal variations. Landscape function zoning with effective economic development and ecological conservation policies can comprehensively improve the competitiveness achieving sustainable future.</jats:p>"

A 10 kV to 5 kW plasma power supply has been practically developed based on the proposed topology and experimentally tested and, additionally, excellent output power conversion efficiency is achieved. From these results, the 4T analog MOS control high voltage high frequency (HVHF) plasma switching power supply is verified.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates judgment bias (under‐reaction or over‐reaction) in product recall decisions by firms when they respond to adverse event reports generated by users of their products. We develop an integrative theoretical framework for identifying the sources of judgment bias in product recall decisions. We analyze user‐generated reports (big and unstructured data) on adverse events related to medical devices, using a combination of econometric and predictive analytic methods. We find that (i) noisy signals in user feedback, that is, high noise‐to‐signal ratio, are associated with under‐reaction likelihood; and (ii) user feedback related to adverse events characterized by high severity is associated with high over‐reaction likelihood. We also identify conditions related to the situated context of managers that are associated with under‐reaction or over‐reaction likelihood. The findings of this study are consequential for firms and government regulatory agencies, in that they shed light on the sources of judgment bias in recall decisions, thereby ensuring that such decisions are made correctly and in a timely manner. Our findings also contribute toward improving the post‐launch market surveillance of products (e.g., medical devices) by making it more evidence‐based and predictive. </jats:p>",

We analyze two scenarios in which the supply chain is defined, the integrated one and the decentralized one, respectively. For the integrated, we compare the different supply chain revenue with and without RFID technology and then determine the optimal inventory decisions. For the decentralized, we mainly focus on the coordination mechanism by revenue sharing contract under Stackelberg game. By seeking appropriate contract parameters, the supply chain can finally be coordinated while all partners are better off.

The results presented are different from those from past investigations, because of the addition of a significant mainstream pressure gradient. Main stream flow is provided along a passage with a contraction ratio of 4, given by the ratio upstream flow area, to downstream flow area. With this arrangement, local blowing ratio decreases significantly with streamwise development along the test section, for every value of initial blowing ratio considered, where this initial value is determined at the most upstream row of effusion holes. Experimental data are given for a sparse effusion hole array. The experimental results are provided for mainstream Reynolds numbers of 92,400–96,600, and from 128,400 to 135,000, and initial blowing ratios of 3.3–3.6, 4.4, 5.2, 6.1–6.3, and 7.3–7.4. Results illustrate the effects of blowing ratio for the hot side and the cold side of the effusion plate. Of particular interest are values of line-averaged film cooling effectiveness and line-averaged heat transfer coefficient, which are generally different for contraction ratio of 4, compared to a contraction ratio of 1, because of different amounts and concentrations of effusion coolant near the test surface. In regard to cold-side measurements on the crossflow side of the effusion plate, line-averaged Nusselt numbers for contraction ratio 4 are often less than values for contraction ratio 1, when compared at the same main flow Reynolds number, initial blowing ratio, and streamwise location.</jats:p>",

This research uses the TO–FOR–WITH model based on nine criteria that separate surviving NGOs from transient NGOs. Two Guatemalan NGOs, Corazon de los Nino and Sonidos para la Vida, are used to validate the model. The two NGOs differ on three of the nine criteria in the TO–FOR–WITH model. Corazon meets all nine criteria and is considered a WITH organization using local sources for employment, supplies, and logistics. Sonidos is a FOR organization because it falls short in the three categories of bilateral communication, residual intelligence, and post hoc deployment. The criteria were found to distinguish the two NGOs in meaningful ways. However, two cases are not sufficient for theory building. We distinguish between factor chains and material supply chains, a distinction that is especially salient for humanitarian services, which are the primary offerings of many NGOs. No prior studies have tested this recent model and no previous studies have addressed the distinction between material supply chains and factor chains. Additional research is needed including expanding to other NGOs, other countries, and other settings.</jats:p>",

The use of straight bio-oils for diesel engines entails improving their disadvantages such as high density, high surface tension and kinematic viscosity (tri-physical parameters). There have been some as-used methods for reduction of the above-mentioned negative effects related to straight bio-oil disadvantage, however, the adequately-heating method may be considered as a simple one helping the physical parameters of straight bio-oils to reach stable and highly-confident values which are close to those of traditional diesel fuel. As a consequence, the spray and atomization, combustion, performance, and emissions of diesel engines fueled with preheated bio-oils are improved. In this work, a study of the dependence of the density, surface tension and kinematic viscosity of coconut oil (a type of bio-oils) on temperatures (from 40-110oC) within a wide variety are conducted. In the first stage, the influence study of temperature on tri-physical parameters is carried out on the basis of experimental correlation and as-described mathematical equation. In the second stage, the influence study of tri-physical parameters on spray and atomization parameters including penetration length (Lb) and Sauter mean diameter (SMD), and the influence of tri-physical parameters on fuel supply system are investigated. The optimal range of temperature for the as-used bio-oils is found after analyzing and evaluating the obtained results regarding the physical properties and spray characteristics, as well as compared with those of diesel fuel. The confident level over 95% from the regression correlation equation between the above-mentioned tri-physical parameters and temperature is presented. Additionally, the measured spray parameters, the calculated values of frictional head loss and fuel flow rate are thoroughly reported.  </jats:p>"

On the basis of the theory of a green supply chain, this paper conducted its research through the following steps. First, a multi-level supply chain model was proposed and established, and various sectors, production and management processes, and inputs and outputs of different resources were integrated into the supply chain network, and then divided into multiple levels. Second, a multi-level embodied carbon flow and emissions model was established through the Leontief Inverse. Third, based on the operation data of forestry-pulp and paper companies, the embodied carbon flows and emissions at all levels and sectors were estimated and analyzed. Finally, the dismantling and processing methods of complex carbon network structures were explored, the hot-spot carbon sources and paths were obtained, and the low-carbon innovation and development strategies were proposed. The research results show that: (1) Supply chain is a new idea and carrier to study the spatial and state changes of carbon, and also provides a platform for spatial landscape analysis of carbon; (2) The modeling and calculation of carbon flows and emissions offer a new solution of evaluating the environmental performance of companies with high pollution and emission such as forestry-pulp and paper companies, and provide the government effective technical support to implement environmental regulations and formulate carbon emission reduction policies.</jats:p>"

Geographical and political dynamics of the Central Asian countries help the countries to stand out as a significant stable and sustainable source of energy in the region with great resources of supply and low domestic demand. This study outlines economic and technical analysis of oil and gas resources of central Asia under demand and supply dynamics of world hydrocarbon production. A comprehensive literature review has been carried out to investigate the basins and major oil and gas fields of the region, their development from the beginning, the technologies utilized, types of recovery processes, supply capabilities and potential of future supply are addressed. Real field applications are illustrated with applications in different parts of the region with challenges, advantages and drawbacks discussed and summarized in comparison to other major energy hubs of the world and their major oil and gas fields and basins. Central Asia is a relatively young and dynamic region with growth potential of harnessing the great and relatively new resources. Due to the political and geopolitical dynamics of the region, Central Asia serves as a strong and stable provider of energy obtained from fossil fuels. Low domestic demand in the region makes it more attractive in terms of the amount of export potential. There is no recent up-to-date study that investigates and outlines not only the technical characteristics of fields, reservoirs and basins in the region but also the demand/supply dynamics of the resources in the regions as they compare to the other major energy hubs in the world. This study comparatively outlines the key elements of successful applications in the region along with the lessons learned from challenges as well as the current and near-future potential of Central Asia as an energy hub in the world.</jats:p>",

We conducted inductive research on three supply networks in the automotive, electronics, and consumer product/pharmaceutical industries.

The successful development of forecast‐based policies should integrate uncertainty from modern forecast products to create unambiguous rules that can be tested on out‐of‐sample periods. This study investigates the potential for such operating policies to improve water supply efficiency while maintaining flood protection, combining state‐of‐the‐art weather hindcasts with downstream conjunctive use to transfer surplus flood releases to groundwater storage. Because available weather hindcasts are relatively short (10–20 years), we propose a novel statistical framework to develop synthetic forecasts over longer periods of the historical record. Operating rules are trained with a recently developed policy search framework in which decision rules are structured as binary trees. Policies are developed for a range of scenarios with varying forecast skill and conjunctive use capacity, using Folsom Reservoir, California, as a case study. Results suggest that the combination of conjunctive use and short‐term weather forecasts can substantially improve both water supply and flood control objectives by allowing storage to remain high until forecasts trigger a release. Further, increased conjunctive use capacity reduces the importance of forecast skill, since surface storage can be moved to groundwater during the flood season without losing water supply. This analysis serves the development of forecast‐based operating policies for large, multipurpose reservoirs in California and other regions with similar flood hydroclimatology.</jats:p>",

Diets are the main source of K supply to humans and can contribute to both K deficiency (hypokalemia) and excess (hyperkalemia). While global attention is currently devoted to K deficiency, K excess can be even more dangerous and deserves equal attention. The objectives of this paper were to (i) estimate the K intake of Ghanaian population using food supply and food composition data and (ii) compare this estimate with the WHO-recommended requirement for K in order to assess if there is a risk of inadequate or excess K intake. Food supply data (1961–2011) were obtained from the Food Balance Sheet (FBS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to derive trends in food and K supply. The average food supply in the FBS for 2010 and 2011 was used in assessing the risk of inadequate or excess dietary intake of K. The K content of the food items was obtained from food composition databases. Based on 2010-2011 average data, the K supply per capita per day was approximately 9,086 mg, about 2.6-fold larger than the WHO-recommended level (3,510 mg). The assessment suggests a potentially large risk of excess dietary K supply at both individual and population levels. The results suggest the need for assessing options for managing K excess as part of food security and public health strategies. The results further underscore a need for assessment of the K status of staple food crops and mixed diets, as well as K management in food crop production systems in Ghana.</jats:p>",

Besides its risk on human health, groundwater Nr loading also affects the carbon (C) and N cycle of associated ecosystems. For a temperate grassland in Germany, the long-term (12 years) annual average exports of Nr in form of harvest exceeded Nr inputs via fertilization and deposition by more than 50 kgN ha−1. We hypothesize that the resulting deficit in the N budget of the plant-soil system could be closed by Nr input via the groundwater. To test this hypothesis, the ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC was used to simulate the C and N cycle of the respective grassland under different model setups, i.e., with and without additional Nr inputs via groundwater transport. Simulated plant nitrate uptake compensated the measured N deficit for 2 of 3 plots and lead to substantial improvements regarding the match between simulated and observed plant biomass and CO2 emission. This suggests that the C and N cycle of the investigated grassland were influenced by Nr inputs via groundwater transport. We also found that inputs of nitrate-rich groundwater increased the modelled nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, while soil water content was not affected.</jats:p>"

The ideal “dual‐purpose cultivar” would have high yield of grain and straw. In addition, the straw should be easy to process in a biorefinery: It should have good degradability, high concentration of carbohydrates, and low concentration of ash. Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient important for plant growth, crop yield and grain quality. However, N production and application comes with a high cost and high environmental footprint. The N application should consequently be based on an economical optimum. Limited knowledge exists on how N application affects the potential of straw for biorefining, <jats:italic>for example,</jats:italic> straw yield and quality. This study, conducted over three cropping seasons, investigated the effect of N supply on the biorefining potential and included 14 wheat cultivars and one triticale cultivar. The N supply directly affected the yield of straw and grain. In addition, the protein concentration in grain and straw increased, but the composition of the straw with respect to carbohydrates and lignin was largely unaffected by N supply. The only significant change was a lower silicon concentration at increasing N application rate, which could be beneficial for lignin valorization in biorefineries. Likely due to the negligible changes in cell wall composition, the effect of N application rate on straw degradability was not significant. N application should therefore primarily be optimized with respect to grain quality and overall yield of grain and straw. Differences between cultivars were also minor with respect to their performance in a biorefinery process. From a breeding and agronomic perspective, focus should therefore be put on maximizing the biomass output from the field, <jats:italic>that is,</jats:italic> selecting the cultivar with highest grain and straw yield and optimizing the application of fertilizer to get optimum N use efficiency.</jats:p>",

Our empirical analysis documents the gap between older individuals’ desired and observed labour supply at both the extensive and the intensive margins and traces it back to gender, education and family composition. The paper provides useful insights into the potential usefulness of policies such as gradual retirement and part-time work in increasing older workers’ employment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food safety management in short supply chains of fruit and vegetables, controlled by large retailers, has been widely studied in the literature. However, when it comes to traditional long supply chains, which include a greater number of intermediaries and wholesalers who, in some cases, play a dual role as resellers and producers, the mechanisms which promote the use of safety certifications have yet to be clearly defined. The present study intended to fill this gap in the literature and shed light on the food safety level that exists in this channel. In addition, this work attempted to identify the existence of differences between both sales systems. For this purpose, the empirical research studied the most important variables that influence the food safety level of some of the main European fruit and vegetable wholesalers. A survey was thus designed and later applied to Spanish and French intermediaries working in key wholesale markets and in the southeast of Spain, which is the leading commercialization area of these products in Europe. The results revealed the positive influence of specific customers (big retailers) on establishing stricter safety controls within wholesale companies. It was also observed that specific wholesalers also play an important role in the system, namely those dedicated to importing, but which are also responsible for quality and safety inspection of agri-food products exported from third countries into the European Union.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a ramie fiber/starch nonwoven film was prepared, and was used as bedding material, that was covered by cultivated soil as opposed to covering it. The biodegradability and porosity characteristics of the film were analyzed, and its effect on oxygen supply to soil was investigated. Results showed that the prepared film had good biodegradability (65.6% after 72 days), and had a loose and porous structure, with the main pore size being in the range of 250–300 μm. After the soil moisture content was reduced to about 44%, the oxygen concentration in the soil that was in close contact with the film, which padded the bottom surface of the plate, rose sharply and then kept stable at 20.1%, whereas soil directly in contact with the plate remained extremely anoxic (0.2%). It was concluded that use of the prepared film increased the oxygen supply to the soil in contact with it, which sufficiently compensated for the oxygen consumption caused by soil microbial activities. Thus, the prepared film is very suitable in short-term plant cultivation within containers where anoxia often occurs.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, any fault of catenary and negative feeder will cause all subsections power interruption in the whole system. Moreover, due to the nonlinear relationship between the distance and impedance as well as the symmetry of the system, conventional distance protection schemes fail to identify the fault subsection and the fault types. In this paper, a novel segmental power supply scheme is presented, which can switch the catenary and negative feeder at each AT subsection on and off independently. Based on the theoretical analysis of the electrical characteristics of the traction power network, multiterminals synchronous information is applied and a hybrid fault identification method is proposed, which can accurately identify the fault subsection and fault type. Consequently, only the catenary or negative feeder at the fault subsection will be quickly removed from service without the effect on normal operation of other subsections. Therefore, the reliability of all parallel AT TPSS is improved considerably. This method was verified through simulation and laboratory experiments by the case studies.</jats:p>"

Various experiments in both pure diesel and dual-fuel mode under intermediate engine speed are performed with the proposed critical method of excess air ratio control. The experimental results reveal that better excess air ratio is very beneficial for the power output and brake specific energy consumption in dual-fuel combustion under medium and low load conditions. Moreover, the substitution rate can reach as high as 40% under low load conditions with throttle control.</jats:p>"

We utilized whole genome sequencing and Bayesian statistics to analyze the evolutionary history, temporal emergence of resistance and transmission networks of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan (2001–2006). One clade (termed Central Asian outbreak, CAO) dating back to 1974 (95% HPD 1969–1982) subsequently acquired resistance mediating mutations to eight anti-TB drugs. Introduction of standardized WHO-endorsed directly observed treatment, short-course in Karakalpakstan in 1998 likely selected for CAO-strains, comprising 75% of sampled MDR-TB isolates in 2005/2006. CAO-isolates were also identified in a published cohort from Russia (2008–2010). Similarly, the presence of mutations supposed to compensate bacterial fitness deficits was associated with transmission success and higher drug resistance rates. The genetic make-up of these MDR-strains threatens the success of both empirical and standardized MDR-TB therapies, including the newly WHO-endorsed short MDR-TB regimen in Uzbekistan.</jats:p>"

Considering that the market demand is dual-channel priced and sensitive to the degree of greenness and the freshness-level, four game models, under different scenarios have been established. These included a centralized scenario, a decentralized scenario, and two contractual scenarios. The equilibrium solutions under the four scenarios were characterized. From the perspective of a sustainable development, the economic, social, and environmental performance of the supply chain was analyzed. To enhance the supply chain performance, two contract mechanisms were designed and the conditions for a multi-win outcome were obtained. Accordingly, many propositions and management implications were provided. The results showed that, (1) compared to the centralized supply chain case, the performance of the decentralized supply chain case is inferior; (2) in addition to increasing the concentration of the supply chain decisions, the two contracts proposed can effectively coordinate the green supply chain and improve its sustainable performance; and (3) the performance of the supply chain is positively driven by the consumers’ sensitivity to greenness degree and the freshness level of fresh produce. This paper fills a research gap and helps the participants of the channel recognize the operational decision principle of a complex green supply chain, in order to achieve a higher and a long-term sustainable-development performance.</jats:p>"

We present equilibrium conditions for decision‐makers in the network and develop a static model with marketable pollution permits and noncompliant behavior, using the variational inequality theory. We provide qualitative analysis of the model. Then, using the projected dynamical system, we propose a dynamic model. The results show that the set of stationary points of dynamic model coincides with the set of solutions of static model. Finally, numerical examples are proposed. The equilibrium results including production output of new products, the forward and reverse product flows, the prices of product, the prices of license, the number of licenses, and the possible noncompliant overflows and underflows of the waste are obtained.

Mesoscale eddies may be an important component of these horizontal transports; however, previous studies have not quantified the horizontal tracer transport due to eddies across the subtropical gyre boundaries. Here we assess the physical mechanisms that control the horizontal transport of mass, heat, nutrients, and carbon across the North Pacific and North Atlantic subtropical gyre boundaries using the eddy‐rich ocean component of a climate model (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model version 2.6) coupled to a simple biogeochemical model (mini‐BLING). Our results suggest that horizontal transport across the gyre boundaries supplies a substantial amount of mass and tracers to the ventilated layer of both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres, with the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream acting as main exchange gateways. Mass, heat, and dissolved inorganic carbon supply is principally driven by the time‐mean circulation, whereas nutrient transport differs markedly from the other tracers, as nutrients are mainly supplied to both subtropical gyres by downgradient eddy mixing across gyre boundaries. A budget analysis further reveals that the horizontal nutrient transport, combining the roles of both mean and eddy components, is responsible for more than three quarters of the total nutrient supply into the subtropical gyres, surpassing a recent estimate based on a coarse‐resolution model and thus further highlighting the importance of horizontal nutrient transport.</jats:p>",

However, this connection can make reef‐fronted coastlines sensitive to the impacts of climate change, given that any decline in ecosystem health (e.g. decreasing sediment supply) or changes to physical processes (e.g. sea level rise, increasing wave energy) could drive the sediment budgets of these systems into a net erosive state. Therefore, knowledge of both the sediment sources and transport mechanisms is required to predict the sensitivity of reef‐associated landforms to future climate change. Here, we examine the benthic habitat composition, sediment characteristics (composition, texture, and age), and transport mechanisms and pathways to understand the interconnections between coastal morphology and the reef system at Tantabiddi, Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Benthic surveys and sediment composition analysis revealed that although live coral accounts for less than 5% of the benthic cover, coral is the dominant sediment constituent (34% on average). Sediment ages (<jats:sup>238</jats:sup>U/<jats:sup>230</jats:sup>Th) were mostly found to be thousands of years old, suggesting that the primary sediment source is relic reef material (e.g. Holocene reef framework). Sediment transport across the lagoon was quantified through measurements of ripple migration rates, which were found to be shoreward migrating and responsible for feeding the large shoreline salient in the lee of the reef. The derived sediment fluxes were comparable with previously measured rates of sediment production by bioerosion. These results suggest that sediment budgets of systems dependent on old (&gt;10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> years) source materials may be more resilient to climate change as present‐day reef health and community composition (i.e. sources of ‘new’ carbonate production) have limited influence on sediment supply. Therefore, the vulnerability of reef‐associated landforms in these systems will be dictated by future changes to mechanisms of sediment generation (e.g. bioerosion) and/or physical processes. © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In an attempt to detect scale effect on ES supply from a comprehensive perspective, this study developed a framework for integrating scale effect in three aspects, including individual ES patterns, pairwise ES interactions, and ecosystem service bundles (ESB). The framework was tested in Xilinhot, a prairie landscape city of Inner Mongolia, at four different levels of spatial scale. The results indicated that, most ES showed a decreasing clustering at coarser scales in terms of spatial pattern. At the same time, coarser scales resulted in fewer trade-offs and stronger synergies between pairwise ES. The identification of ESB varied greatly with scale, and this change reflected in the composition of ES variables and spatial distribution of bundles. We attributed the scale effect of the above three aspects to differences in social-ecological factors and their driving mechanisms at different scales. This comprehensive framework could support local managers to coordinate the management of multiple ES at different scales.</jats:p>"

Supply chain finance is a hot topic in theoretical and practical circles. Financial institutions transform materialized capital flows into online data under big data scenario, which provides networked, precise, and computerized financial services for SMEs in the supply chain. By drawing on the risk management theory in economics and the distributed hydrological model in hydrology, this paper presents a supply chain financial risk prediction method under big data. First, we build a “hydrological database” used for the risk analysis of supply chain financing under big data. Second, we construct the risk identification models of “water circle model,” “surface runoff model,” and “underground runoff model” and carry on the risk prediction from the overall level (water circle). Finally, we launch the supply chain financial risk analysis from breadth level (surface runoff) and depth level (underground runoff); moreover, we integrate the analysis results and make financial decisions. The results can enrich the research on risk management of supply chain finance and provide feasible and effective risk prediction methods and suggestions for financial institutions.</jats:p>",

We first consider a deterministic model where the supply chain manager has complete information about the restoration of damaged services. We extend this model to a stochastic programming model involving several different recovery scenarios. We present computational results for a realistic case study developed with an extensive literature survey. We compare results of the stochastic model with average deterministic results, and show that the average deterministic results do not produce good solutions for an uncertain setting. We conclude with general remarks on how supply chain managers should consider restoration decisions under uncertainty. </jats:p>",

In this study, we developed a rapid method for detecting Cyanobacteria using a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method coupled with lateral flow (LF) strips. After releasing cyanobacterial DNA from cells using a freeze-cracking method, DNA was amplified using the RPA method. Next, the RPA products were detected using the LF test. LF-RPA successfully amplified the DNA of eight cyanobacterial species and detected their presence in the sample with high specificity, distinguishing them from five non-cyanobacterial species. The method could detect cyanobacterial DNA in water samples containing as low as 0.01 cell/mL Cyanobacteria, making the method more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which required cell densities of at least 104 cell/mL. LF-RPA could amplify and detect cyanobacterial DNA at any temperature in the range 30–45 °C in just 30 min and without the need for a thermal cycler. The method developed in this study is simple, rapid, and effective for on-site testing of Cyanobacteria, which may become a routine measurement in efforts to detect and treat harmful algal blooms.</jats:p>",

Among many prediction models, the combined model (CM) is widely used because it can combine the prediction results of multiple single models and make full use of the information provided by various methods. CM is an effective method to improve the predictive veracity but the weight of single model estimation is the key to the CM. Previous studies take errors as the objective function to calculate the weight, and the uncertainty of the weight of the individual model cannot be considered comprehensively. In order to consider the uncertainty of the weight and to improve universal applicability of the CM, in this paper, the authors intend the Markov chain Monte Carlo based on adaptive Metropolis algorithm (AM-MCMC) to solve the weight of a single model in the CM, and obtain the probability distribution of the weight and the joint probability density of all the weight. Finally, the optimal weight combination is obtained. In order to test the validity of the established model, the author put it into the prediction of monthly groundwater level. The two single models in the CM are time series analysis model (TSAM) and grey model (GM (1,1)), respectively. The case study showed that the uncertainty characteristic of the weight in the CM can be obtained by AM-MCMC. According to the study results, CM has obtained a least average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.85, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.61, and a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.97 for the studied forecast period.</jats:p>",

However, the problem of whether high Ca2+ in Karst calcareous soil could increase drought tolerance in calcicole plants has not been solved. We investigated the ecophysiological responses of Cyclobalanopsis glauca (Thunb.) Oerst. cuttings to short-term drought stress and Ca2+ application. Drought stress (10% PEG-6000) markedly reduced relative water content (RWC) and water potential (WP), and enhanced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (H2O2 and O2•−) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in C. glauca leaves. Under drought treatment, exogenous Ca2+ application (20 mM CaCl2) markedly increased the RWC and WP, and reduced the H2O2, O2•−, and MDA content. Furthermore, water deficit induced a significant increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and increased the accumulation of osmoregulation substances. External Ca2+ alleviated drought-induced oxidative stress and osmotic stress with further increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, and enhanced the accumulation of osmoregulation substances. In addition, exogenous Ca2+ treatment alleviated the reduction of the photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), and chlorophyll content (SPAD), and further increased water use efficiency (WUE) under drought stress. This study confirms that exogenouos Ca2+ application induces improvements in the water status, osmotic adjustment, antioxidant defense, and photosynthesis efficiency of C. glauca under drought stress.</jats:p>"

It had been shown that supply of low amounts of concentrate after transition to full-time grazing caused energy deficits, resulting in a lower milking performance and changes in a variety of variables indicative for energy metabolism. The present study aimed to investigate how a moderate concentrate supply (4.5 kg dry matter cow/day) after transition to pasture influences health and production indicators. Over a 12-week trial period dairy cows were observed during transition from confinement to pasture (pasture group: PG) and compared to cows fed TMR indoors (confinement group: CG). On average, the PG consumed less feed and energy than the CG and mobilized body reserves, which is mirrored in a decrease of body condition and various fat depots. These effects were paralleled by elevated serum concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and ketone bodies as well as an increase in liver fat content. The physical activity (elevated walking, eating, decreasing rumination time) of the PG was significantly higher than that of the CG, which intensified the energy deficiency and resulted in a lower milk yield. In conclusion, the moderate concentrate supply was insufficient to counterbalance the lower energy intake from pasture during transition.</jats:p>"

Firstly, Rough number is used to integrate data from different evaluation matrix. Secondly, rough number improves a new method, BWM, to get RBWM criteria weight methods.
