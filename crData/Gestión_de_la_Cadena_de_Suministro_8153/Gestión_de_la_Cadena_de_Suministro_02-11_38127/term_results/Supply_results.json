Current research has deeply investigated factors, such as dependence of firms on bank credit, that amplify the impact of monetary policy impulses on aggregate demand exerting strong but temporary effects on output and employment. We present an intertemporal macroeconomic equilibrium model of a competitive economy where current production is financed by bank credit, and then we use it to identify supply–side effects of the credit transmission mechanism in data drawn from the Italian economy. We find evidence that the ‘credit variables’ identified by the model – the overnight rate as a proxy of monetary policy and a measure of credit risk – have permanent effects on employment and output by altering credit supply conditions to firms.</jats:p><jats:p>To save on space, mathematical proofs, statistical tests and data sources have been gathered in two separate appendices that can be examined on request.</jats:p><jats:p>(J.E.L.: E2, E5).</jats:p>",

Each customer class may have a different backorder cost, so stock allocation arises as a key decision problem. We model the supply system as a multi customer make-to-stock queue. Using dynamic programming, we show that the optimal allocation policy has a simple and intuitive structure. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm to compute the parameters of this optimal allocation policy. Finally, for a typical supply chain design problem, we illustrate that ignoring the stock allocation dimension—a frequently encountered simplifying assumption—can lead to incorrect managerial decisions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management (SCM) emerged in the early 1980s as a result of the rapidly changing and challenging business environments in many industries. SCM is a consequence of the increased necessity for holistic considerations in, between and across companies’ business activities and resources in and between marketing channels, in order to improve the overall performance towards the ultimate consumer in the marketplace. SCM’s generic theoretical foundations are derived from time‐, functional‐, and relationship‐dependencies in, between and across companies’ business activities in marketing channels. There are major similarities and minor differences in the theoretical boundaries between SCM and Alderson’s interpretation of a functionalist theory of marketing. The author argues that the theoretical origin of SCM is derived from, and underpinned by, a part of this functionalist theory of marketing. Furthermore, there is a need for a generic re‐definition and expansion of the theoretical boundaries of SCM towards the incorporation of horizontal dependencies between marketing channels in the marketplace.</jats:p>",

Groundwater has remained to be a major water supply source for a population of 1.5 million at present in the valley. The focus of this study was to evaluate the extent and sources of groundwater contamination. Water sampling was carried out in selected deep wells and shallow sources. The level of pollution was evaluated by comparing the water quality results with WHO guidelines. The major problems with the dug wells, hand pumps and spouts were found to be the elevated nitrate and mercury contents. The deep wells located on the central aquifer were found to have a serious threat of ammonia pollution. Deep wells were also found to have iron, manganese and mercury concentrations exceeding the guideline values. Multivariate statistical analysis was carried out to cluster the sampling sources and identify the common factors describing the potential sources and possible mechanisms associated with the contaminants. The results suggested that disintegration of the sediment organic matter under strong reducing environment leads to the origin of the unusual water qualities at the central confined aquifer. This process may be microbially mediated and occurs with the simultaneous reduction of species such as arsenic, iron, manganese and sulfate. Both natural and anthropogenic water quality problems were observed in the groundwater system of Kathmandu valley. Attention should be focused to consider distinct strategies to address these problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the manufacturing industry, there are a large number of small and medium‐sized manufacturers (M‐SMEs) which provide specialty manufacturing and support services to large corporations. M‐SMEs form the biggest group of manufacturing entities in many newly industrialized economies. The needs and operating requirements of these M‐SMEs are very different from those of large companies. Much research has been carried out in the area of mechanisms, techniques, heuristic designs, modeling, and usage of fuzzy logic in production planning, scheduling and production control. However, most research only addresses a particular area of the enterprise planning process. In addition, the majority of the large‐scale enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems created for large corporations’ manufacturers are sometimes ineffective in M‐SMEs. This research highlights the organizational, structural, operational and supply chain related interdependencies impacting the planning and management of the internal supply chain in M‐SMEs in the Southeast Asia region. Similar to the deployment of management and manufacturing information systems, the need to fully comprehend the operational dynamics of M‐SMEs is crucial for the successful implementation of ERP systems to manage the internal supply chain. The deployment of ERP systems in M‐SMEs is simpler in some aspects compared to large corporations, but can be more complicated in others.</jats:p>",

The problem for business is that the return on investment (ROI) for technology is unpredictable and frequently impedes improved business performance for a period of time; costs go up, service goes down, and inventory gets out of control.The problem for many human resource development (HRD) professionals is that their role in the implementation of technology is either nonexistent or limited to only organizing the software-training schedule. The opportunity for both improved technology ROI and getting HRD to play a larger role in overall performance improvement requires business teams and HRD professionals to gain a deeper understanding of supply-chain processes.This chapter presents a supply-chain framework that has had helped improve business performance and directly supports technology ROI. </jats:p>",

Currently these operations utilize surface water and shallow groundwater for supply. An alternative source of water is the brackish groundwater from basal aquifers which exist in the lower portion of the Mannville Group and below the heavy oil horizons. Hence, the term \"basal aquifers\" is used to describe these water bearing sediments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Due to corrosion and precipitation concerns, source water must have acceptable salinity and Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) levels. Salinity and TDS of groundwater can be conveniently estimated from electrical logs using empirical formulae.</jats:p>",
