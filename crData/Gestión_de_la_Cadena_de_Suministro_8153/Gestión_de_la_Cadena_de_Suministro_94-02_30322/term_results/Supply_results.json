      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data from a national survey of new mothers are linked to data from a survey of their pre-birth employers in order to investigate the importance of employer characteristics and policies, relative to women's individual characteristics and circumstances, in determining labour supply outcomes after childbirth. Three labour supply outcomes are examined: returning to work after childbirth, hours of work after returning to work, and choice of employer after the birth. Over the period of time between the birth and whether the mother returned to work (8-9 months), it appeared that women's own characteristics, and the local rate of female unemployment, exerted a stronger influence on drawing women back into employment than did employers' policies. However, employers' retention policies appeared to give women the choice of remaining out of the labour market for longer periods, without risking the penalties usually associated with changing jobs after childbirth. The study finds no evidence to support a suggestion derived from labour market segmentation theory that there will be a distinct patterning in terms of industry or size of the relationship between employers' policies and women's labour supply decisions after childbirth. However, further support is given to the importance of employers' policies in relation to the segmentation of the labour supply.<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> </jats:p>",

The first approach is labelled the pure portfolio approach, and corresponds to the orthodox approach to the money supply. The second approach is labelled the pure loan demand approach, and corresponds to the Post Keynesian accommodationist view of endogenous money. The third approach is labelled the mixed portfolio‐loan demand approach, and corresponds to the Post Keynesian structuralist view of endogenous money. The critical theoretical difference between the latter two models is identified in terms of the importance of the private initiatives of banks in accommodating expansions of loan demand. The paper then provides Granger‐causality evidence on the three approaches, and concludes in favor of the mixed portfolio‐loan demand approach.</jats:p>",

Optical emission intensities (OEIs) of O (or Ar) atoms and O (or Ar) ions over the lower cathode were increased with each rf power. By increasing the upper cathode rf power (UPRF), a remarkable increase of OEI was observed at approximately 180° of the phase difference of two synchronous rf powers supplied to two cathodes, but there was a slight increase observed at approximately 0°. A lot of negative self-bias voltage was observed at about 180°, but there was little positive voltage observed at approximately 0°. The etch rate of the photoresist was increased with UPRF at 150° without increasing the self-bias voltage of the lower cathode. Highly uniform etching of ±5% was obtained in a 5-in.-diam photoresist wafer etching using a stationary magnetic field. 0.4 μm photoresist lines were etched vertically by using an upper cathode covered by a carbon plate.</jats:p>",

Metabolic burden associated with product formation in these bioprocesses may lead to growth advantage of a nonproducing mutant leading to a loss of the producing population over time. A simple population dynamics model demonstrates the extreme sensitivity of population stability to the engineered productivity of a strain. Here we use flux balance analysis to estimate the effects of the metabolic burden associated with product secretion on optimal growth rates. Comparing the optimal growth rates of the producing and nonproducing strains under a given processing condition allows us to predict the population stability. In order to increase stability of an engineered strain, we determine processing conditions that simultaneously maximize the growth rate of the producing population while minimizing the growth rate of a nonproducing population. Using valine, tryptophan, and lysine production as specific examples, we demonstrate that although an appropriate choice of oxygenation may increase culture longevity more than twofold, total production as governed by economic criterion can be increased by several orders of magnitude. Choice of optimal nutrient and oxygen supply rates to enhance stability is important both for strain screening as well as for culture of engineered strains. Appropriate design of the culture environment can thus be used to enhance the productivity of bioprocesses that use engineered production strains. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The perception of women on the mode of transmission and treatment of selected water and sanitation related diseases were the criteria used to assess health related improvements. Comparison of the results in the programme and non‐programme communities indicates that the water and sanitation programme has achieved some degree of success in the areas of water use and water and food storage for the beneficiaries. However, little has been accomplished in changing people's attitude towards the disposal of household, animal and human waste.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Seventy similar bungalows constructed between 1968 and 1970 in the same suburban area of Stockholm were investigated regarding the content of house dust mite allergen, absolute indoor humidity, type of ventilation and basement construction. Houses with mechanical exhaust and supply ventilation had an indoor humidity above 7 g/kg less often than houses without this type of ventilation (Odds ratio 0.1, 95% confidence interval 0.0‐0.2). Furthermore, only five of the 24 houses with exhaust and supply ventilation contained mattress dust mite allergen concentrations exceeding the median value (98.5 ng/g) compared with 30 of 46 hours which did not have such ventilation (odds ratio =0.1, C.I. 0.0–0.5). Houses with both natural ventilation and crawl space basement harboured significantly less mattress mite allergen than houses having the same type of ventilation, but with a concrete slab basement. In a cold temperate climate, type of building construction and ventilation seem to be important for the occurrence of house dust mite allergens in dwellings. Our results indicate that modern energy‐efficient houses should be equipped with mechanical exhaust and supply ventilation to reduce indoor air humidity during the dry winter months and the risk of mite infestation.</jats:p>",

Significantly greater numbers of bacterial colony-forming units were recovered on the dilute peptone medium than on the enriched media, blood agar or trypticase soy agar. Lower incubation temperatures yielded greater numbers of colony-forming units on all media. The bacterial population in dental unit water supply following stagnation in the supply lines and flushing of the lines was studied using dilute peptone incubated at 25 °C. No significant differences in the numbers of colony-forming units were found in stagnant water versus fresh water. Flushing the water lines for 10 min did not significantly reduce the numbers of colony-forming units.Key words: dental unit water, water contamination, bacterial contamination. </jats:p>",

Using a fluctuating temperature gradient bar seeds buried in sand were exposed to various amplitudes of diurnal temperature fluctuation over an extended period of time and seed germinability was examined at intervals. Germination percentage increased considerably in most species as a consequence of treatment with marked effects occurring at temperature fluctuations greater than 20°C and becoming detectable after 45 days. In several species the effect of applying wetting and drying cycles was to lower the amplitude of temperature fluctuation necessary to soften the seeds. Species can be grouped into physiological groups on the basis of differences in seed response to temperature fluctuations. It is suggested that these differences may help to explain the mechanisms distinguishing the different colonization patterns observed in tropical sand dune systems.</jats:p>",
