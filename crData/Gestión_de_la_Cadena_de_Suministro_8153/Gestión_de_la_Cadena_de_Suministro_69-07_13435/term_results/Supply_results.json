The arrangement of the musculature was found to be essentially the same as that described by Low in 1907. The portions of the crural musculature passing to the right and left of the esophagus did not decussate anterior to the esophagus as these fibers insert into the central tendon. The right and left phrenic nerves divided into three to five divisions at the pericardiodiaphragmatic angle. Most commonly, these divisions are: anterior, posterior and lateral. If there are more than three divisions involved, there is usually a medial division present and/or a subdivision of one of the other divisions. It is the posterior division or its posteromedial branch which contributes to the innervation of the crura. None of the other divisions contributes to the innervation of the crura. Secondary branches of either the posterior division or the posteromedial branch do not cross to the contralateral side.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Secretion can be produced from the salt gland of the duck by electrical stimulation of nerves reaching the gland and by the administration of parasympathomimetic drugs; the latency of this response is similar to that of the secretory response produced by intravenous salt loading and is similarly inhibited by atropine. The salt gland contains both acetyl‐ and butyrylcholinesterase; the former appears to be associated with nerve fibres which originate in cells occurring along the gland's secretory nerve and in its ganglion. There is no obvious difference in cholinesterase content of secreting and resting glands. Denervation of the salt gland, by an operation which includes removal of the ganglionic portion of the secretory nerve, abolishes secretory response to salt load and leads to disappearance of cholinesterase. Such denervated glands may be caused to secrete by administration of carbachol; this response is potentiated by concurrent salt loading. Section of the secretory nerve central to its ganglionic region, however, fails to abolish secretion in response to salt loading and does not alter cholinesterase content. Hexamethonium in large doses fails to influence the establishment or course of a secretory response to salt loading. These findings, coupled with the demonstration that cholinesterase staining in the secretory nerve is only seen in and distal to its ganglion cells, suggests that the cholinergic nerve supply to the gland is unusual. The findings support the concept that a cholinergic secretomotor mechanism can produce salt gland secretion. They also imply that any associated hormonal control of secretion cannot operate in the absence of intact peripheral nerve supply. The possibility is discussed that the ganglion cells of the secretory nerve may have an osmoreceptive function.</jats:p>",
