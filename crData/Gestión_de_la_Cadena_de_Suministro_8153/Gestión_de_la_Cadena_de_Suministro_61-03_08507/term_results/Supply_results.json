However, national financial support of this nature is not able to keep up with rapid growth in demand, and few water systems in Peru are self‐supporting in operating costs alone. The author describes his experience where, during the summer of 1960, he spent 5 weeks in Peru as a short‐term consultant to the International Cooperation Administration (ICA), activities of which are known as the Point Four program. The consultation was a part of the Community Water Supply Development Program of ICA. Under this program, and in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization, ICA is assisting cooperating countries to develop or strengthen business‐type, self‐sustaining national institutions that will plan and aid financing, construction, and management of water supply systems at the community level.</jats:p>",

The conflict over water poses fundamental issues of states' rights. The alarm of the few owners of water rights first confronted with demands of the U.S. has spread across the nation. The actions of the federal government and court rulings have awakened many leaders to the urgency of preserving state water rights, and not all federal courts have supported the federal position. The article presents various cases as examples of the threat to state water rights.</jats:p>",

Water requirements under southern Illinois average temperature conditions were determined for corn at different stages of development. The water requirements were compared with the amount and pattern of rainfall for the previous 21 years in order to estimate irrigation needs for maximum corn yields.</jats:p><jats:p>A requirement in excess of 3 to 4½ inches of soil‐stored water resulted in reduced corn yields. The use of two 2‐inch irrigations 10 to 14 days apart during the tasseling and shooting stages of growth resulted in economically desirable corn yield increases 3 out of 4 years. Irrigation other than the 4 inches during tasseling and shooting stage resulted in no yield increases or only slight increases.</jats:p><jats:p>Lack of easily available moisture apparently lowers the corn yield potential on this soil in over one‐half of the years. Water stored below 2 feet was of very limited direct value to the corn crop. A high state of soil fertility was conducive to efficient water use.</jats:p>",
