      "abstract": "<p>Supply chains can be disrupted at both local and global levels. Just-In-Time (JIT) companies should be particularly interested in managing supply chain failure risk as they often have very little inventory to buffer themselves when their upstream supply chain fails. We develop previous research further and present a strategic framework to manage supply chain failure in JIT supply chains. We identify two dimensions along which the risks of failure can be categorized: location and unpredictability. We go on to identify strategies which companies can use either before (proactive) or after (reactive) the failure to manage supply chain failure. We support our framework with examples of actual responses to supply chain failures in JIT companies. It is also hoped that our strategic framework will be validated empirically in the future leading to specific guidance for managers.</p>",

This study examines different structures of e-networks (i.e., virtual supply chains linked via electronic information and communication technologies) and their maximum capabilities to gain e-network benefits. Further, this research explores four levels of e-network integration based on a 2x2 e-network technology and transaction integration matrix. Of the four levels, an e-network with high e-technology/high e-transaction integration appears to be most desirable for the companies that aspire to achieve the maximum benefits from their IT investments. Finally, this study identifies three alternative transformation paths toward a powerful high e-technology/high e-transaction integration network and discusses strategic implications of selecting those paths, in terms of e-network structures, availability of financial and technical resources, supply chain members’ collaborative planning, e-security mechanisms, and supply chain size.</p>",

Transaction costs and collective action are found to be significant in determining farmer participation in the SSC. Contrary to the findings of other studies, human capital and farm characteristic variables are not significant, suggesting that small‐scale farmers can be included in new supply chains under certain conditions, especially if incentives to farmers, trust‐based relationships between buyers and sellers, risk reduction practices and new forms of collective action are put in place.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that rising property taxes have induced elderly homeowners to increase their labor supply. This paper uses 1992-2004 panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) as well as a newly collected dataset on state-provided property tax relief programs to investigate the effect of property taxes on the labor supply of elderly homeowners. It is the first rigorous study on the link between property taxes and elderly labor supply. I examine both the extensive margin - whether elderly homeowners delay retirement or reenter the labor market in the face of rising property taxes, and the intensive margin - whether elderly homeowners work longer hours when property taxes increase. A simulated IV approach is used to address the potential endogeneity problem associated with property taxes. I find little evidence that property taxes have a significant impact on elderly homeowners' decisions to retire, to re-enter the labor force, or to increase working hours.</jats:p>"

As a result, non-conventional resource plays, such as Alberta's oil sands, are experiencing heightened global interest. Bitumen extraction and upgrading is an energy intensive process. This article focuses on gasification as a fuel alternative to natural gas for oil sands operation, reviewing current trends in oil sands reserves, energy requirements, the gasification technology and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A supply cost methodology is employed to analyze the outlook of lower natural gas consumption and higher emission penalties for oil sands projects that integrate gasification.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results of the supply cost analysis illustrate that an integrated oil sands extraction, upgrading and gasification project is less susceptible to operating cost pressures amidst rising natural gas prices due to its lower natural gas requirements.

Social research has provided useful insights into the factors that influence public attitudes to IPR and guidelines for engaging the public. Recent IPR developments in Australia demonstrate that clear democratic processes for decision making are yet to be devised. The distinction between technology and society which underpins work in this field does not adequately reflect the nature of IPR and limits possibilities for more robust decision making processes. IPR is not simply a technology to be accepted or rejected by society. IPR is a complex socio-technology which cannot exist unless its technologies become embedded in social, institutional, infrastructural and ecological networks. Reconsidering IPR as a complex socio-technology provides a new grounding for devising processes and institutions for decision making. Based on the formulations of Bruno Latour for bringing the sciences into democracy such processes will include four main tasks: 1) Perplexity—identifying propositions to be taken into account; 2) Consultation—evaluating the strength of the propositions; 3) Hierarchy—ordering the propositions into relative merit and importance; and 4) Institution—stabilising the outcomes through appropriate institutions.</jats:p>",

In order to reach this aim, an advanced control scheme to suitably drive the injection of both active and reactive power into a MV radial distribution grid has been developed. Such algorithm allows a decoupled control of active and reactive power by properly adjusting the modulating signals of a PWM interface converter with the grid. A closed loop regulation scheme has been derived and guidelines for the choices of the reference quantities and for the design of the regulators are provided. The control algorithm has been applied to a real MV grid-connected PV power plant, which has been simulated in the PSCAD  EMTDC electromagnetic environment, in order to represent, with high detail, every system component and to thoroughly analyze the occurring electromagnetic transients. The positive effect of reactive power support to the grid from the PV unit has been highlighted, showing benefits on the grid current and voltage profiles with respect to the classical configuration, where the DG system behaves as a sole active power source.</jats:p>",

After analysing the driving characteristic of giant magnetostrictive material and requirement of driving power, a design method of wide range and high precision NC constant-current source has been put out. The output circuit is composed of serial 12-bit DACs Max531, low-noise high-speed precision operational amplifiers OP27 and driving circuit. It provides current from 0 to 2.048A with 0.5mA step value. Two fully differential input channels 16-bit, sigma-delta ADCs AD7705 collects output current in feedback loop. Current ripple is controlled under 0.25mA through using homemade high-performance linear power. The result shows that the driving power with characteristic of high stability and fast response meets the needs of driving of Giant Magnetostrictive Accurate-motion.</jats:p>"

Additionally the effect of pressure on fouling indices was analysed. It was concluded, that there is a need to define more boundary conditions in the ASTM standard (exact type of filter holder, exact type of membrane, start conditions) for the SDI to achieve a parameter with reliable and comparable values. But in comparison to MFI, SDI seems to be a more robust parameter for a use in practice pertaining to the influence of a feed pressure level and the effective membrane area. The MFI gives more insights in acting mechanisms and offers advantages for research. It shows a correlation to a concentration of particulate or organic foulants. Like the SDI, it is necessary to define and standardize exact boundary conditions for the MFI tests (classified by the use of MF, UF or NF filter media).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the impact of strategic customer behavior on supply chain performance. We start with a newsvendor seller facing forward-looking customers. The seller initially charges a regular price but may salvage the leftover inventory at a lower salvage price after random demand is realized. Customers anticipate future sales and choose purchase timing to maximize their expected surplus. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium, where we find that the seller's stocking level is lower than that in the classic model without strategic customers. We show that the seller's profit can be improved by promising either that quantities available will be limited (quantity commitment) or that prices will be kept high (price commitment). In most cases, both forms of commitment are not credible in a centralized supply chain with a single seller. However, decentralized supply chains can use contractual arrangements as indirect commitment devices to attain the desired outcomes with commitment. Decentralization has generally been associated with coordination problems, but we present the contrasting view that disparate interests within a supply chain can actually improve overall supply chain performance. In particular, with strategic customer behavior, we find that (i) a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale price contract may perform strictly better than a centralized supply chain; (ii) contracts widely studied in the supply chain coordination literature (e.g., markdown money, sales rebates, and buyback contracts) can serve as a commitment device as well as an incentive-coordinating device; and (iii) some of the above contracts cannot allocate profits arbitrarily between supply chain members because of strategic customer behavior. </jats:p>",

Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is currently promoted as one option to augment existing supplies and in many jurisdictions is assuming increasing importance in the portfolio of urban water management strategies. Consistent with trends in international water policy development, Australian water reform has emphasised institutional and governance approaches promoting voluntary transfers of water through market exchange. The reform process has made substantial advances in addressing the constraints and tensions associated with mature rural water economies, with limited influence in urban water systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>What remains unclear is the degree of alignment of new water management technologies such as ASR operations with explicit water reform directives of market development and the capacity of subsequent urban water legislation to provide consistent and coherent ASR guidelines.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper describes a systematic approach to align the hydrological characteristics of an aquifer with economic and policy interpretations central to the development and management of ASR.

The main criteria used are: reliability-based network performance; present value of construction, upgrading, failure and repair costs; and social and environmental issues. The AHP has been applied elsewhere on various problems, but not on the long-term upgrading of water distribution networks as proposed in this paper. The pipes are sized to carry maximum entropy flows using linear programming while the best upgrading sequence is identified using dynamic programming. The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the AHP as a systematic tool for assessing pareto-optimal designs based on the trade-offs between multiple criteria. The results demonstrate that the cheapest option is not necessarily the best when other factors e.g. performance and socio-environmental concerns are considered in an explicit way.</jats:p>",

Some important challenges such as false read, data overload, real-time acquisition of data, data security, and privacy must be dealt with. Good quality data is needed because business decisions depend on these data. Other important issues are that business processes must change drastically as a result of implementing RFID, and data must be shared between suppliers and retailers.

It focuses on digital inverted plasma arc cutting power and studies strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of power. The neural network is also introduced to decouple cutting parameters variables in the multi-parameters coupling cutting process. This algorithm avoids complex nonlinear system modeling and realizes real-time and effective online control of cutting process by combining advantages of fuzzy control and neural network control. Furthermore, the optimized fuzzy control improves steady-state precision and dynamic performance of system simultaneously. The experimental result shows that this control improves precision, ripples, finish and other comprehensive index of work piece cut, and plasma arc cutting power supply based on fuzzy-neural network has excellent control performance.</jats:p>"

Its maximum capacity is about 7,000 m3/h of drinking water. Furthermore, a secondary UF stage with a capacity of about 630 m3/h has been used to treat the backwash water of the first stage. The innovative plant design results from an intensive preliminary pilot period, during which several advanced concepts were investigated. The paper reflects the long-term experience with operation and monitoring of the plant over a period of about two years. Up to now, expectations regarding performance in terms of permeability, retention, and reliability have been exceeded. The predicted specific treatment costs of about 10 €Ct/m3 drinking water were achieved or even reduced.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bromate is a carcinogenic disinfection by-product formed from bromide during ozonation or advanced oxidation of drinking water. We previously observed bromate reduction in a hydrogen-based, denitrifying hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). In this research, we investigated the potential existence of specialized bromate-reducing bacteria. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we compared the microbial ecology of two denitrifying MBfRs, one amended with nitrate as the electron acceptor and the other with nitrate plus bromate. The DGGE results showed that bromate exerted a selective pressure for a putative, specialized bromate-reducing bacterium, which developed a strong presence only in the reactor with bromate. To gain further insight into the capabilities of specialized, bromate-reducing bacteria, we explored bromate reduction in a control MBfR without any primary electron acceptors. A grown biofilm in the control MBfR reduced bromate without previous exposure, but the rate of reduction decreased over time, especially after perturbations resulting in biomass loss. The decrease in bromate reduction may have been the result of the toxic effects of bromate. We also used batch tests of the perchlorate-reducing pure culture, Dechloromonas sp. PC1 to test bromate reduction and growth. Bromate was reduced without measurable growth. Based on these results, we speculate bromate's selective pressure for the putative, specialized BRB observed in the DGGE was not growth related, but possibly based on resistance to bromate toxicity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> The purpose of this paper is to describe a decision support tool based on various types of contracts in a two‐level supply chain. A supply chain (SC) consists of disparate but interdependent members, dependent on each other to manage various resources (inventory, money and information). The conflicting objectives between these members may cause uncertainties in supply and demand, which can be managed by adopting coordination with the help of contracts (such as buyback, revenue sharing and quantity flexibility). <jats:bold>Design/methodology/approach:</jats:bold> A decision support tool for SC coordination using contracts (DSTSCCC) has been developed to explore the applicability of contracts and to compare different types of contracts in various situations. The DSTSCC is comprised of an analytical module, which is an extension of the classical newsboy problem and a simulation module. <jats:bold>Findings:</jats:bold> DSTSCCC helps in determining decision variables for different scenarios of contracts in the best interest of all SC members as well as whole SC. <jats:bold>Practical implications:</jats:bold> DSTSCCC is a simple‐to‐use and easy‐to‐implement decision making tool which helps in taking decisions prior to the actual start of SC activities. The prior decisions may help to handle future exceptions. SC members may jointly select the most profitable contract to share risks and rewards. <jats:bold>Originality/value:</jats:bold> DSTSCCC comprised of analytical module and simulation module presents an Integrative framework which cannot be dealt in isolation. The output of analytical module becomes input for simulation to quantify performance measures. The improvement in performance measures after satisfying the objectives of all SC members helps in realizing coordination in SC.</jats:p>",

Individuals respond to lower hourly earnings with an increase in the quantity supplied of work hours. This behavior would help to explain the increasing trend in average work hours in Peru (this average for male workers in Lima, the capital city, rose from 50.5 to 53.9 weekly hours between 1985 and 2000; meanwhile, 33.4% of workers had weekly schedules above 60 hours in 2002). Another finding is the increase in hours supplied due to pressure from the more numerous cohorts recently entering the Peruvian labor market.</jats:p>",

A technology-organization-environment framework of the contextual influences on technological innovation adoption is used to inform an analysis of three companies’ adoption and use of mobile data solutions for sales automation, freight tracking, and service support. Analysis of the three case studies found that the relative advantage of the technological innovation and the information intensity of the company were the most important factors influencing adoption. Other factors that appeared to influence adoption included the compatibility of the technology with the company’s business approach, the presence of top management support, and the degree of organizational readiness. Environmental factors such as competition within the industry or business partner influence seemed less influential for these pioneers of mobile technology use in supply-side activities.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plant-production is determined by many production-factors. Each of these factors became subject of research-works through the years, still we state, that studying their interaction is even more important. For studying these interactions we set up a potexperiment, within that the direct effect and the interactions of four factors was inspected: soil, nitrogen-supply, nickel-loading and liming. Experiments were carried out on two soil types with extremely different characters: one was a chernozem soil with good fertility and buffering capacity, the other was a shifting sand soil with low humus-content and buffering capacity. Nitrogensupply and liming was added on two levels, while nickel on three within 12 combinations on each soil types. Plant production was cut two times within the vegetation period. The amount of production and dry matter was weighted, fractured and their element-content was measured by an ICP-detector.Ca-content on the shifting sand soil was determined by all three factors, however the interaction between nickel-loading and liming was also significant. Nitrogen and liming increased Cauptake, that is due to appropriate nutrient-supply and improvement of a better pH-value. On the chernozem soil nitrogen and CaCO3 also increased the Ca-content. This is caused by a better nutrient supply and a higher amount of available Ca-ions.On the shifting sand soil nickel content was increasing parallel to higher nitrogen-dosages. In presence of higher nickelamount the nickel-content of plants was also increasing, still according to liming, this increment was different. On the chernozem soil nitrogen a nickel increased Ni-uptake. However, liming also had a positive effect on Ni-content, that can be explained by the high amount on colloids in the soil, the adsorption of Ni-ions on them and in presence of liming material the replacement of Ca-and Ni-ions. The potassium-content on the shifting sand soil was different in each liming-combination. In combinations without nickel the potassium-content of limed and not limed combinations was on the same level. In not limed combinations by adding nickel potassiumcontent was increasing, while in limed combinations no change was observed. On the chernozem soil by adding liming material the amount of uptaken potassium was decreasing, that is due to the antagonism between Ca- and K-ions. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A model has been developed, based on the finite element method (FEM) of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), for the description of the complete flow field and concentration distribution inside a membrane capillary, driven in inside-out and dead-end or ‘slow’ cross-flow mode, sometimes referred to as ‘bleed flow’. Particle or floc transport and deposition have been described by trajectory analysis, i.e. superimposing the calculation of forces and torques acting on the particles or flocs, based on the previously modelled fluid flow field. The model is used to give an overview of deposition behaviour and fouling layer formation of particles and flocs of a certain size in dead-end and cross-flow filtration. Example results are shown for different sized flocs. It is shown that the choice of dead-end or cross-flow operation is more significant if small floc aggregates have to be filtered by the membrane. Small flocs will be deposited more or less homogeneously along the membrane wall after some significant distance to the capillary inlet, leaving the first part of the membrane area unused for deposition. A ‘slow’ cross-flow could be used to transport small flocs out of the capillary which entered the capillary cross section area in the neighbourhood of the axis. The faster the chosen cross-flow velocity, the larger the area. Larger flocs will be ‘accumulated’ in one resulting equilibrium trajectory and are transported to the rear end of the capillary, independent of their starting radial position at the inlet and operation conditions. It was calculated, that larger flocs will not be significantly transported out of the capillary lumen by introducing ‘slow’ cross-flow velocities at the capillaries outlet only.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper proposes a novel current‐source multilevel inverter, which is based on a current‐source half‐bridge topology. Multilevel inverters are effective for reducing harmonic distortion in the output voltage and the output current. However, the multilevel inverters require many gate drive power supplies to drive switching devices. The gate drive circuits using a bootstrap circuit and a pulse transformer can reduce the number of the gate drive power supplies, but the pulse width of the output PWM waveform is limited. Furthermore, high‐speed power switching devices are indispensable to create a high‐frequency power converter, but various problems, such as high‐frequency noise, arise due to the high dv/dt rate, especially in high‐side switching devices. The proposed current‐source multilevel inverter is composed of a common emitter topology for all switching devices. Therefore, it is possible to operate it with a single power supply for the gate drive circuit, which allows stabilizing the potential level of all the drive circuits. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed circuit is verified through experimental results. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The resulting articles were sorted by topic and mapped to one of the other remaining three functional disciplines.

Another limitation that arose was in terms of language. Since the research team consisted of researchers from different functional areas, it had to address semantics issues as the study was conducted. The authors also limited the initial endeavor to mapping only as a dyad and only using dichotomous variables. Future work on this model may include an ordinal ranking system or multi‐function mapping.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This work presents a useful model for determining an interdisciplinary research agenda in marketing.

Values of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> can be used to: (1) characterize the efficiency of the wind to move sand by saltation for different soil textures and aggregations; and (2) to make practical predictions of sand movement based on the condition of the surface soil. Values for <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> in a range from 1 to 10 are usually associated with supply‐unlimited saltation and are usually associated with loose, sandy‐textured soils. Values for <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> in a range from 0·25 to 1 are associated with finer soils that contain more silt and clay. The range of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> values between 0 and 0·25 usually reflects finer textured soils that are packed, aggregated, or crusted. A decrease of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> to a smaller value is a sign of supply limitation and usually to the soil changing from a looser state to a more aggregated state or more depleted state. Likewise, an increase of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic> usually corresponds to soil changing from an aggregated state to a looser state. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Indicator and pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed in pipe biofilm samples, as well as in storage tanks biofilm and sediments, by using cultural methods and PCR, to assess risks.

Raw water was processed through flocculation-sedimentation modules in a pilot plant with a capacity of 45 m3/day. Alum was the primary coagulant. Normal coagulation removed 10–60% of THM precursors. Kranji Reservoir, which has a watershed with thick vegetation, had relatively higher levels of dissolved organic matter with correspondingly higher potential for the formation of THM than Pandan Reservoir; Pandan is largely an urban catchment. Land-use pattern and proximity to seashore seem to influence THM formation. UV254 and SUVA were found to be better surrogates than DOC for THM. A benchmark criterion (UV254&amp;lt;0.08 cm−1) for on-line monitoring of THM was deduced from SDS-THM data and this criterion would vary slightly among the water works.</jats:p>",

Using three data sets for Germany, two for Britain and one for the United States, I simulate the change in relative wage rigidity (wage compression) in all three countries during the early and mid 1990s, this being the period when unemployment increased in Germany but fell in Britain and the US. I show that in this period, Germany experienced wage compression (relative wage rigidity), whereas Britain and the US experienced wage decompression. This evidence is consistent with the Krugman (1994) hypothesis.</jats:p>",

The increased interest in labour conditions of global supply chains has driven companies to integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) into supply chain management (SCM) practices. Companies face legal requirements as well as voluntary social requirements. This paper focuses on the empirical part of labour condition auditing at selected factories during 2003 and 2004. Findings from these audits include non‐conformances in health and safety, remuneration, working hours and disciplinary practices. Based on the experiences of the case studies, labour condition auditing is seen as a beneficial tool for inducing continuous improvement in supply chain management, but it requires a new set of skills from the auditors.

Organizations require agility in their supply chains to provide superior value as well as to manage disruption risks and ensure uninterrupted service to customers. Thus the cultivation of agility is approached as a risk management initiative that enables a firm to respond rapidly to marketplace changes, as well as anticipated and actual disruptions in the supply chain. Agility is of value for both risk mitigation and response.</jats:p><jats:p>This research investigates the impact of two cultural antecedents, market orientation and learning orientation, and three organizational practices, all aimed at augmenting the supply chain agility of a firm. A firm’s supply chain agility (FSCA) is defined as the capability of the firm, both internally and in conjunction with its key suppliers and customers, to adapt or respond in a speedy manner to marketplace changes as well as to potential and actual disruptions, contributing to the agility of the extended supply chain.</jats:p><jats:p>The two cultural antecedents of market and learning orientations are posited to affect the organizational practices of internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility, and eventually impact the firm’s supply chain agility. The external flexibility elements considered are volume and mix flexibility. In addition, the specific organizational characteristics and practices exhibited by firms with high levels of supply chain agility are also investigated.</jats:p><jats:p>Through the use of the structural equation modeling technique, partial least squares (PLS), it is shown that strong linkages exist among the cultural antecedents, the three organizational practices considered, and the firm’s supply chain agility. All three organizational practices, internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility are shown to have significant positive impact on the firm’s supply chain agility.</jats:p><jats:p>Market orientation is shown to significantly impact both internal and external supply chain integration, along with the two elements of external flexibility. Learning orientation, on the other hand, is shown to have a strong and direct influence only on the level of internal integration. Firms with high levels of external integration are also shown to have high levels of internal integration, consistent with past research. Internal and external integration efforts are also seen to be unrelated to the levels of external flexibility present. The results serve to establish a set of key drivers for augmenting supply chain agility as a risk management initiative.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It examines how environmental requirements are reaching smaller companies in the electronics supply chain, especially in the light of recent legal changes such as enforcement of the RoHS Directive. It is based on qualitative interviews with environmental and purchasing managers of 21 small and medium‐sized companies. The results point out a lack of significant drivers for these companies to implement proactive measures when dealing with environmental issues, owing to limited customer pressure. RoHS and legal compliance are the only environmental customer criteria to be met, while ISO 14001 works as an optional supplier selection criterion. In consequence, companies are not focusing on environmental work within their supply chains, and the potential of influencing the environmental profile of suppliers by shaping their ISO 14001 is not used.

Often, the investments in these destinations are directed to wilderness areas without significant initial infrastructure. Thus, the surroundings provide better possibilities to build and direct the experiences of tourists in contrast to city tourism where the surroundings are not especially designed for tourism. In this paper we apply an SCM framework to the Levi Fell resort in northern Finland. By identifying some special characteristics of tourism destinations and region‐based tourism production, we further develop the traditional SCM framework in the context of tourism.

Sourcing this material raises questions related to provenance selection, seed quality and harvest sustainability. Restoration guidelines strongly recommend using local sources to maximize local adaptation and prevent outbreeding depression, but in highly modified landscapes this restricts collection to small remnants where limited, poor quality seed is available, and where harvesting impacts may be high. We review three principles guiding the sourcing of restoration germplasm: (i) the appropriateness of using ‘local’ seed, (ii) sample sizes and population characteristics required to capture sufficient genetic diversity to establish self‐sustaining populations and (iii) the impact of over‐harvesting source populations. We review these topics by examining current collection guidelines and the evidence supporting these, then we consider if the guidelines can be improved and the consequences of not doing so. We find that the emphasis on local seed sourcing will, in many cases, lead to poor restoration outcomes, particularly at broad geographic scales. We suggest that seed sourcing should concentrate less on local collection and more on capturing high quality and genetically diverse seed to maximize the adaptive potential of restoration efforts to current and future environmental change.</jats:p>",

A model of the use of PGMs in Europe has been developed, and this is combined with a model of environmental pressures related to PGM production.</jats:p><jats:p>Seven industrial sectors and product groups form the main users of PGMs in Europe, comprising the chemical, petroleum, and glass industries; jewelry, dentistry, electronic equipment, and car catalysts. Most relevant environmental impacts of secondary production in Europe and primary PGM production in South Africa, Russia, and Canada are taken into account, including emissions of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide and total material requirement.</jats:p><jats:p>The article quantifies the PGM flows to, from, and within Europe in 2004. The automotive industry is the single largest user of primary PGMs, and catalytic converters represent the major PGM end use. The chemical and glass industries also require large amounts of PGM but rely mostly on secondary metals. The environmental impacts of primary production exceed those of secondary production by far. An analysis of the use of car catalytic converters shows that as a result of efforts to reduce air pollutant emissions in Europe, other negative environmental impacts, such as point‐source pollution and mining waste, are occurring elsewhere—for example, at extraction and refining sites in Siberia and South Africa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In order to increase efficiency and probability of success, firms can now no longer focus solely on managing satisfactory relationships with customers. In an increasingly complex and dynamic economic context it is necessary to identify and manage appropriately all the activities capable of generating value throughout the complete business cycle. For example, there is growing interest in appropriate management of the relationships that companies establish with their suppliers, as the first step towards ensuring that the product complies with the desired standards.This work therefore focuses on the analysis of firm—suppliers relationships, specifically on their temporal orientation.We consider that the context of SMEs differs from that of larger firms, and that, for this reason, it is necessary to analyse their specific situation in depth. So, by means of an exploratory study we identified that generally, these relationships tended to have a long-term orientation, although motivations differed depending on the size of the firm. Subsequently, by means of a confirmatory study we tested an explanatory model of the aforementioned temporal orientation. The implications derived from our study are discussed in the final part of this work. </jats:p>",

Urban planning and development are becoming more compelling due to the fact of growing competition for water, which has lead to an increasing and conflicting demand. As such, investments in water supply, sanitation and water resources management is a strong potential for a solid return. A pilot project of greywater ecological treatment has been established in Kuching city since 2003. Such a treatment facility opens up an opportunity of wastewater reclamation for reuse as secondary sources of water for non-consumptive purposes. This paper aims to explore the potential of the intended purposes in the newly developed ecological treatment project. By utilizing the Wallingford Software model, InfoWorks WS (Water Supply) is employed to carry out a hydraulic modeling of a hypothetical greywater recycling system as an integrated part of the Kuching urban water supply, where the greywater is treated, recycled and reused in the domestic environment. The modeling efforts have shown water savings of about 40% from the investigated system reinstating that the system presents an alternative water source worth exploring in an urban environment.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a monitor named membrane fouling simulator was developed. In a comparison study, the same feed channel pressure drop development in time and the same fouling accumulation was observed in spiral wound membrane elements and membrane fouling simulators. Chemical dosing to the membrane fouling simulator feed water showed that a biofouling inhibitor was not inhibiting biofouling, but was even contributing to biofouling. It is shown that other chemicals such as acid and antiscalants may contribute to biofouling as well. It was found that the feed spacer presence strongly influences the feed spacer channel pressure drop increase caused by biofilm accumulation: in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis systems biofouling is a feed spacer problem. A new set of monitors for membrane fouling studies and methods for biofouling monitoring are described. A state of the art on global membrane fouling simulator use is given.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A range of major risks associated with a rapidly changing United Kingdom (UK) electricity sector have been identified and quantified with the aid of various stakeholder groups (academic researchers, civil servants, electricity companies, ‘green’ groups, power system engineers, and various others), who completed an online internet questionnaire. Each stakeholder ranked potential risks according to the perceived ‘severity of impact’ and ‘likelihood of occurrence’ using a three-point scale. The data were then used to perform a ranking of the risks by multiplying scores for impact and occurrence. There was some variation between the different stakeholder groups, but similar risks were ranked highly by each group. The main risks were identified as being energy security issues (the highest score), lack of investment in new infrastructure, the closure of old coal and nuclear plants leading to reduced network capacity, severe weather events, and inadequate spare capacity margins generally. The trial illustrates the potential of using risk assessment techniques to evaluate developing risks to the UK power landscape. Clearly such an exercise would need to be carried out periodically if it were to maintain its value to the industry, its stakeholders, and to policy makers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Cardiac nerve sprouting and heterogeneous reinnervation after myocardial infarction (MI) lead to arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death. Despite its importance, little is known about the contribution of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system on reinnervation. We previously reported that neural crest stem cells (NCSC) reside in the heart, and can differentiate into neuron, glia, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes. The present study scrutinized the developmental origin of intrinsic cardiac adrenergic (ICA) cells, and investigated whether NCSC supply ICA and contribute to reinnervation after MI. (1) We analyzed two distinct double transgenic mice, encoding protein 0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP (P0-EGFP) and dopamine\n            <jats:italic>β</jats:italic>\n            -hydroxylase-Cre/Floxed-EGFP (DBH-EGFP), to map neural crest-derived cell fate and catecholaminergic cell fate, respectively. ICA cells, demarcated with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, catecholaminergic marker)-immunopositive cells within ventricles, co-expressed EGFP in both P0-EGFP and DBH-EGFP mice. Most ICA cells were nucleated and round-shaped, although 5% of the cells extended nerve fibers. (2) NCSC were marked with EGFP in P0-EGFP mice, expressed nestin, musashi-1 and p75 nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, and showed sphere formation. They frequently resided in the outflow tract, but also existed in all parts of the heart. (3) ICA cell number and TH mRNA expression within ventricles were increased in transgenic mice overexpressing NGF in the heart. (4) P0-EGFP mice were subjected to MI by coronary artery occlusion. EGFP-positive cells were markedly increased after MI, and more so in the border zone area than in the non-infarcted area. (5) Similarly, DBH-EGFP subjected to MI revealed an increase in EGFP-positive cells at the border zone area, and some of them extended neurites among the sprouting nerves. (6) TH and EGFP mRNA were increased in DBH-EGFP ventricles, concomitant with cardiac NGF upregulation. These findings demonstrated that ICA cells were derived from neural crest cells, and dependent on NGF synthesized in the heart. NCSC were mobilized to the infarcted myocardium, differentiated into TH-positive nerves, and contributed to reinnervation after MI.\n          </jats:p>",
