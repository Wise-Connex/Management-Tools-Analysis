To meet future water needs, San Antonio may eventually have to tap supplementary sources. The Texas State Water Plan may be of assistance in realizing this goal. The city of San Antonio and its water board firmly support the plan and are working tirelessly for it.</jats:p>",

Land developers had built 12 different hydrapneumatic water systems in Oakland County, Michigan. Waterford Township officials decided to consolidate these 12 separate water systems into one complete integrated water system, which was incorporated into the master plan for water supply in 1960. It was decided to manage the system with supervisory control, and equipment was installed to control thirteen pump stations, nine distribution pressure points, three storage tanks, and altitude valve chambers with a control panel and desk.</jats:p>",
