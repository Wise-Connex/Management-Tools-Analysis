The analysis reveals the relative importance of military and political factors in the state's progress towards a nationalized and over-centralized supply administration. This chapter suggests that centralization and rationalization were natural by-products of modernization and that they facilitated a more efficient transfer of resources from civilian to military ends. This process led to the growth in state elites' control over all aspects of military administration during the period between 1792 and 1794.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a dramatic decline in transfusion-associated AIDS, increased safety of the national blood supply, and voluntary efforts to find alternatives to homologous blood sources, Americans remain fearful about the possibility of acquiring AIDS through a blood transfusion. Numerous states have initiated legislative efforts that would require explicit warnings about blood safety and that would direct patients to alternative sources of blood. These proposed laws—known as MANTRA bills, for “mandatory notification of transfusion alternatives”—would require physicians to advise patients of blood transfusion options prior to any surgery. Many would mandate the development of new informed consent documents and involve health departments in the implementation of new regulations regarding transfusions. This article concludes that MANTRA legislation is primarily a symbolic attempt to reassure the public about AIDS. It mandates practices that are being adopted voluntarily; it will not make the blood supply safer; it will increase the cost of health care to individuals and in the aggregate; it may diminish the number of donors to the voluntary blood supply system; and it is likely to intensify public fear about the risk of a blood transfusion.</jats:p>",

Surface mining of browncoal and its utilization for power generation is economic, while the domestic hard coal industry is maintained for reasons of security of supply despite high costs of the underground operations. Over past decades, however, the size of the industry has been declining sharply. Long-term energy-political agreements guarantee sales of subsidised hard coal to the electricity and steel sectors up to 2005, but on a smaller scale than today. Brown coal use in eastern Germany is also set to decline further from its present level for structural and environmental reasons, while the use of brown coal in western Germany will remain constant. Hard coal imports, on the other hand, are likely to rise. The background of these developments is described in detail, as is the German coal policy. Coal supply is forecast up to the year 2000. </jats:p><jats:p> The current energy supply structure in Germany as well as its future development are determined by a number of conditions, three of which will be discussed here as relevant to the topic of this paper. A more specific analysis of the hard coal industry, its development and political setting will be presented, followed by a forecast of the coal supply in 2000. The three basic conditions are as follows: </jats:p><jats:p> Germany is, apart from coal, a country poor in energy resources.

But the reliability of U.S. vaccine supplies has received far less attention, despite several recent interruptions in vaccine production and supply. Moreover, the increasing producer concentration in the U.S. and global vaccine industries raises the possibility that more and more important vaccines will be produced by a single firm, often in a single production facility. Is a federal policy for vaccine supply assurance necessary, and what form should it take? Are sole-source suppliers a weak link in the U.S. vaccine supply chain? Are the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Emerging Infections for a publicly owned “standby production capacity” of critical vaccines feasible or cost-effective? We consider these and other issues in our discussion of the U.S. vaccine industry, the potential role of foreign vaccine suppliers, and the use of existing federal facilities and policies to address a possible interruption in critical vaccine supplies.</jats:p>",

An allowance of 33·957 kg of a feed with 12·76 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) and 189 g crude protein (N × 6·25)/kg feed was given to Large White × Landrace (LW ×) and Chinese Meishan (CM) female pigs over three different periods of time: (1) <jats:italic>ad lib</jats:italic>. (AL) with the time taken by individual pigs to consume the allowance being a variable, (2) over a period of 7 weeks (H) and (3) over a period of 9 weeks (L). In addition, in a fourth treatment, pigs of both breeds received the same allowance but supplemented with starch also over a period of 7 weeks (HS). The performance of the pigs on treatment AL was affected by pig breed, with CM pigs gaining protein at a slower, and lipid at a faster, rate than LW × pigs. On treatments L, H and HS the average amounts of protein retained were 2·693 and 2·655 kg for the LW × (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 15) and CM (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 15) pigs respectively (SED 0·106 kg). There was a statistical indication that the LW × pigs may have been more efficient on L, and less efficient on HS, than the CM pigs but we have been unable to propose any biological reason for such an effect, if it was in fact a real one. Thus, the efficiency with which ideal protein was utilized was close to being constant, and apparently at its maximum, for the two breeds. However, although CM pigs had the same protein gain, and the same live weights, on the same feed allowances as the LW × pigs, they gained significantly more lipid. This was attributed in part to their digesting their feed better and in part to their having a lower energy requirement for maintenance through a lower level of physical activity. Given that these two very different kinds of pigs use limiting protein with the same efficiency, it is suggested that it is safe to make the assumption in models of pig growth that the material efficiency of using limiting protein is constant across genotypes of pig.</jats:p>",

It suggests that significant progress towards the World Summit for Children's goal of universal access to water supply and sanitation can be made if a combination of strategies is adopted. On the cost side, significant cost reductions should be possible through efficiency in resource use and reduction of system management costs. On the financing side, it suggests restructuring the financing of the sector with improved efficiency and greater cost recovery in urban services; full recovery of operation and maintenance costs; cost sharing through community contributions in kind such as local labour and financially in rural and peri‐urban water supply for basic levels of service depending on willingness and ability to pay and full cost recovery for higher levels of service; a high degree of cost recovery in rural and peri‐urban sanitation; development of institutional structures for both collection and management of revenues; development of alternate financing mechanisms such as rural credit schemes and revolving funds, adapted in specific country contexts, including the required institutional mechanisms; and additional allocations from governments and external support agencies. Additional government or external financing alone, while critical, will not of itself lead to effectiveness in the use of resources. Equally, cost recovery alone cannot lead to universal access and sustainable solutions. A composite set of actions is needed within which building capacities of institutions and people is necessary for sustainability</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Plants were grown in sand culture with a wide range of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations, and the impact of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the demand for nutrients was determined using isotopic root bioassays. Plants grown with the smallest concentrations of N and P showed typical foliar symptoms associated with deficiency of these elements. However, even when supplies of N and P were limiting to growth, additional CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (250 ppm above ambient) influenced neither total N nor total P in above‐ground tissues, nor nutrient demands as indicated by the bioassay. The estimates of the demand of the plants for K from the <jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Rb bioassay indicated an appreciable increase when plants were raised in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. For plants of the same size with the same nutrient supply, those grown in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consistently displayed an increased internal demand for K. Uptake of K was not however, enhanced by elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> even in non‐limiting conditions and it might therefore be limited by a factor other than K supply. The overall conclusion from the experiments is that when <jats:italic>A. capillaris</jats:italic> is grown in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, uptake of N, P and K fails to increase proportionally with dry mass.

The objective of this study, carried out in Aberdeen, 1992, was to examine whether PD concentrations in spot urine or plasma samples vary diurnally during a given feeding regime and if they reflect differences in daily PD excretion induced by varying feed intake. Sixteen sheep were offered <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic> one of four diets (fresh weight basis, the rest of each diet being minerals and vitamins): (1) 99·9% lucerne (pelleted); (2) 50% hay, 30% barley, 9% fishmeal and 10% molasses; (3) 72% straw, 7% molasses and 20% molassed sugarbeet pulp; and (4) 97% barley. Measurements were made for 1 week after a 2-week adaptation period. Urine was collected daily on days 1–4 and hourly on days 5–7. Hourly urine collection was achieved using a fraction collector. Plasma samples were collected hourly from 09·00 to 17·00 h on day 4. Feed intake varied considerably (347–1718 g DM/day) between diets and between animals. Daily excretion of PD (7·1–22·6 mmol/day) was linearly related to DM intake (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·85, <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 16), and so was the microbial N supply (3·9–19·5 g N/day) estimated from daily PD excretion (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·87). In hourly urine samples, the ratio of PD:creatinine concentrations showed no significant difference between sampling times, and was linearlycorrelated with the daily PD excretion (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·92). Similarly, plasma PD concentration also showed little diurnal fluctuation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased with feed intake. Plasma PD was not well correlated with daily PD excretion in urine (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·57). The tubular load of PD (plasma PD × GFR) was better correlated with the daily excretion (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0·80). It appears that when sheep are fed <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic>, PD in spot urine may provide a practical indicator of microbial protein supply status.</jats:p>",
