With over 40% of its population neither British nor French and ethno‐cultural groups expressing desires to preserve their heritage, a multilingual library service programme was instituted in Alberta to provide reading materials in languages other than French and English. The service's collection encompasses thirty languages with holdings being notified to local libraries via printed catalogues and libraries requesting titles to satisfy local needs. The service is seen as constantly evolving in line with changing user needs, utilizing consultation to assist libraries in analyzing and identifying ethnic requirements and undertaking studies to ensure satisfactory service development.</jats:p>",

The London and South Eastern Library Region (LASER), recognizing the needs for simplified schemes, surveyed all its member libraries and set up a scheme, the Co‐operative of Indic Language LASER Authorities (CILLA), using mother‐tongue speakers to catalogue and select material in their own languages. CILLA developed cataloguing and transliteration standards based on consistency, ease of use and accuracy, and the production and publication of a printed quarterly booklist has extended the reach of the scheme. The need is seen to provide similar, easily digestible aids for non‐Indic language speakers, while self‐help and co‐operation, proved to work by CILLA, will enable UK libraries to utilize available stock.</jats:p>",

Some of these problems pose particular difficulties and are given general consideration: bibliographic peculiarities, format, publishing patterns and the international nature of the material involved. The nature of use is seen as being particularly important with factors such as a user's requirements for performance or study purposes, and the library's need to preserve or bind material, sometimes in conflict with UAP. A review of the current situation highlights a variety of national patterns of supply and provision presently in operation, few of which can be seen as adequate. General trends in music availability are discussed based on a number of recurrent themes arising from the national studies: developments in central and distributed methods of provision; perspectives on different categories of material; co‐operative against central acquisition; economic factors; new technology and the influence of publishers. General improvements in access and availability are dependent on those involved adopting a higher profile and recognizing all requirements of specialist materials.</jats:p>",

These two treatments were examined for their ability to affect corpora lutea (CL) function when 10, 20, 40 and 80 cm (12 sows/group) of the ipsilateral uterine horn remained intact. Sows with only 10 cm of uterine tissue failed to return to oestrus when observed until day 40. When 80 cm of uterine tissue remained, all the sows recycled between days 20 and 24. As the length of uterine horn increased from 10 to 80 cm the contralateral ovary became susceptible to luteolysis. At these lengths (20–40 cm), increased blood supply to the contralateral ovary afforded the luteal cells resistance to luteolysis (uterine length × blood supply interaction, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05). An additional four sows received <jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I-labelled microspheres for purposes of determining CL blood flow following these alterations of blood supply to the isolated ovary.

Respiratory quotient measurements indicated that the increase in metabolic rate produced by BRL 26830A in rats was fuelled wholly by lipid. BRL 26830A also produced a marked reduction in the lipid content of total dissectable brown adipose tissue. The energy content of this lipid lost during the 4-h period after dosing was equivalent to approximately 50% of the thermogenic effect of the compound over the same period, suggesting that lipid stored in brown adipose tissue is a major initial fuel for BRL 26830A induced thermogenesis. However, marked depletion of brown adipose tissue lipid prior to administration of BRL 26830A had no effect on the subsequent thermogenic response to the compound. Oral administration of glucose altered the pattern of fuel utilization for resting metabolism, but thermogenesis was still fuelled mainly by lipid. Administration of methyl palmoxirate, which inhibits oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, completely prevented the thermic effect of BRL 26830A, suggesting that lipid is a necessary fuel for this process. These results do not support suggestions that carbohydrate is quantitatively important as a fuel for nonshivering thermogenesis. </jats:p>",
