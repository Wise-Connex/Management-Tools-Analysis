      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soon after the beginning of the 1939–45 war the Services became aware of the vital necessity of studying the behaviour of stores and materials in tropical climates. In consequence the Army established in Nigeria two special units known as the West Africa Tropical Testing Establishment and the Signal and Radar Tropical Testing Establishment. Both were operated from Port Harcourt with activities centred there and at Victoria Beach and other stations near Lagos. The work tended to concentrate on radio and optical equipment—that is, the stores in connection with which tropical deterioration had been particularly disastrous in the early stages of the war. In 1947 the two units were amalgamated and control of the combined establishment known as the Tropical Testing Establishment passed from the War Office to the Ministry of Supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Field study revealed great differences in the biological productivity of two adjacent areas of a Michigan trout stream resulting from the entrance of domestic sewage into the stream between the two areas. Monthly samples were collected from the two areas to determine the seasonal cycles in abundance of bottom fauna, feeding habits of the trout, and coefficient of condition of the brown trout. In the less productive area upstream, a paucity of food of aquatic origin caused a sharp decline in condition of the fish, a reduction in the quantity of food per stomach, and a shift to a diet containing a considerable portion of terrestrial organisms. In the more productive area downstream (which, throughout the year, had a greater volume of bottom fauna than the unproductive area) trout maintained a significantly higher and much less variable coefficient of condition, their stomachs contained more food in midsummer and did not show the increase in terrestrial foods.</jats:p>",
