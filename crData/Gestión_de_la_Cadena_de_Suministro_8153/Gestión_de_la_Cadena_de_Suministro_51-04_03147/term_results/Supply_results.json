      "abstract": "<jats:p>The, concept of “safe yield” is analyzed, and it is shown that, instead of having a single value in any given hydrogeologic situation as has been assumed, it has many possible values; hence, it is not a useful concept. As an alternate approach to the problem of perennial ground‐water supply, the functions of aquifers are stated, the tasks of the science of hydrogeology are outlined, and it is shown that by means of hydrologic engineering based on permissive legislation, legislation which is compatible with the doctrine of appropriation, withdrawals of ground water can be increased to almost any desired extent without danger of aquifer depletion.</jats:p>",
