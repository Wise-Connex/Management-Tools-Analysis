      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Despite it being integral to them, manufacturing is all too frequently forgotten when defining the size and shape of supply chains. Optimisation efforts typically focus on warehousing, sourcing and transport; however, that is changing. New manufacturing technologies are giving supply chain decision makers far greater freedoms than they have ever had, led by the emergence of 3D printing from being a tool for design and prototyping to making items destined for end uses. Now over 30 years old, this group of technologies enables established supply chains to radically increase their flexibility, to reduce lead times and costs, and to offer their customers far higher service levels in terms of what they provide and how it is provided. This paper will look at the impact of 3D printing on the individual elements of the supply chain, examining the benefits that it brings, balancing those with the constraints and current broader considerations that decision makers need to consider. It will then describe how organisations can go about evaluating whether it is right for them and, where there is a case to be make, how to go about identifying which approaches to take in deciding what to use it for and how to adopt it.</jats:p>"

They want innovation for today. This paper discusses Kenco’s revisiting of this topic in order to see if supply chain leaders have changed their tune, or if the technologies they define as ‘proven and reliable’ have shifted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Today’s complex and dispersed supply chains create significant challenges for supply chain managers. ‘Organic’, ‘non-GMO’, ‘fair trade’ and ‘conflict free’ are just some of the claims that require a transparency in the supply chain to maintain and verify. Product origin and authenticity are similarly at risk from a lack of transparency in supply chain data. Traditionally, supply chain managers use cumbersome and unreliable auditing to validate supply chain data to substantiate product information and provenance. But errors and fraud in supply chain information remain and threaten the brand reputation of affected products. Supply chain data is no stranger to technological enhancement. Enterprise resource planning systems have expanded the volume of real-time actionable data available. The reliability of that data is, however, still in question from its susceptibility to errors and falsification. Distributed ledger technology, best known as blockchain, offers the promise of greater transparency and reliability of supply chain data. Ultimately, that reduces the risks associated with product claims and provenance based on supply chain data. This paper examines the operation of blockchains and their resistance to falsification by looking at the mechanics of the bitcoin blockchain. The paper explores private blockchain alternatives to the bitcoin blockchain that can facilitate distributed data in a closed supply chain. The paper then describes several supply chain challenges where blockchain technology is being used to improve the reliability and integrity of the underlying supply chain data. Finally, the paper looks to the blockchain regulations that may have an impact on the adoption of blockchain in the supply chain. At the end of the day, substantiating supply chain product claims, minimising counterfeiting and enabling product recall all rely on the traceability and integrity of supply chain information, for which blockchain solutions are well suited.</jats:p>"

Visibility enables a company to know exactly where their product is in the shipment process and can be a significant driver for a company’s improved profitability and relationships with its trading partners. While SCV is a standard expectation for e-commerce orders, adoption of visibility capabilities for non-e-commerce companies is surprisingly low. Improved visibility provides companies numerous benefits by lowering costs and reducing inventory while increasing efficiency and accountability. Business investment in new technology, increased collaboration and higher maturity levels lead to full visibility for all trading partners, while utilisation of data aggregation technology provides a single version of the truth. This paper analyses the substantial value derived through supply chain visibility, and discusses how more companies could benefit from implementing SCV capabilities.</jats:p>"

The optimization of halal food supply chain can support its sustainability. Therefore, study about halal food supply chain optimization is required. This paper try to develop a mathematical model, entitled as Balance Halal Supply Chain (BHSC) model. This model propose a distribution strategy for halal food supply chain from limited halal slaughterhouses to several halal markets so as the total cost of distribution becomes minimize. It is assumed that all halal market demands must be fulfilled, so the lack ness cost becomes zero. The model try to fulfill all the halal market demands and minimize the oversupply and transportation costs. BHSC is modeled as MILP. Numerical experiment is performed to validate the model and it is solved by CPLEX Solver Version 12.6.3. Based on the experiment result, it is shown that the model can be used by halal supply chain decision maker as the decision making tool to design the best strategy for distributing the limited number of halal meat to many halal markets for its supply chain sustainability. The BHSC model can minimize the total cost of distribution that consists of oversupply and transportation costs, in the case of all halal market demands must be fulfilled. In conclusion, the proposed model becomes an alternative method to support the halal food supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

To this end, a case study was carried out with the representatives of the supply chain members in CMR, which included coffee producers, cooperatives and a development foundation. It was verified the predominance of practices focused on environmental issues, followed by social and, finally, economic ones. It is also highlighted that the data identified allow us to understand that the development of sustainable strategies can bring positive effects to the agents studied. Considering that these aspects, evidently, improve the relationship of supply chain members, making it more collaborative.

Rainwater collecting from roofs of buildings was simulated in two cities with cold and semi-arid climate, namely Qazvin and Sanandaj. Rainfall statistics, information on the storage tank size, building roof areas and water demand (non-potable) were obtained. Buildings with roof areas of 100 m2 to 300 m2 were considered for the present study. It can be concluded that for cities located in cold and semi-arid climates, at least 60% of non-potable water can be supplied from roofs with a large area, a minimum 16% and maximum 70% for a low roof area, a minimum 8% and maximum 44% of the days per year from harvested rainwater. It is also found that for cities located in cold and semi-arid climates, it is possible to achieve at least 70% of non-potable water from large surface roofs. For the studied cities, with increasing tank size (1,000 to 5,000 L) rainwater saving was tangible for the same roof areas.</jats:p>",

In this regard, it is important to consider the empirical knowledge of the interface among the variables of factors in the supply chain governance structure choices, the chain actors’ choice of governance models, and the effects of these on the supply chain performances. The aim of this study was to empirically verify the relationships between factors existing in the business scenarios, the chain actors’ governance structure choice, and supply chain performances of dairy chains in Ethiopia. The chains were assessed using the survey data that were collected from 215 chain actors and analyzed using structural equation modelling and IBM SPSS and IBM AMOS of version 24 software. The data collected were tested for the Cronbach’s alpha reliability test for the internal consistency and using the different model goodness of fit measure tests. The results showed that the transaction cost, trust, and uncertainty significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001) predicted the chain actors’ supply chain governance model choice. On the other hand, uncertainty, willingness to collaborate, and collaborations advantages explained trust significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001). The correlations analysis among the factors showed that there existed negative significant correlation between transaction cost and willingness to collaborate. The correlation between willingness to collaborate and collaborative advantages was found positive and significant. Similarly, the correlation between uncertainty and transaction specific investments was found positive and significant. Moreover, chain actors’ supply chain governance structure choice significantly explained the supply chain performances, such as efficiency, flexibility, level of dairy losses, and level of integrations in the dairy chains. Promoting established dairy chain governance system, either through dependable relational governances or through formal contractual structure has been found improving the performances of the studied dairy chains.</jats:p>",

However, the role of marketing function to achieve competitive advantage is still a question of improving business performance. Empirically, there is a need to explore marketing and operational capabilities by involving the supply chain in marketing strategies. Through the views of Dynamic Capability (DC) and service logic, we combine it in a conceptual model that produces several hypotheses. A total of 250 MSME (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) are involved to answer the questionnaire. Respondents' perceptions reveal that the supply chain has essentially opened itself into an engagement for mutual value creation and sustainability. Our findings also reveal that supply chain engagement can improve business performance and positively mediate employee engagement, but it is unable to mediate customer engagement. In contrast, supply chain engagement is insignificant when market knowledge, customer engagement and employee engagement are directly linked to business performance. In addition, our findings also resulted in an insight for management in optimizing the firm's ability to perform its marketing functions</p>"

While male and female student interns are required to do the same work as other employees, their intern labour is devalued. With the loss of their capacity to control the timing, location and training content of the internships, student-workers vent their pent-up anger and grievances in the capital accumulation process, in which their fundamental rights to labour and education are scarified.</p>",

One year later, in 1949, Bill graduated from the Winnipeg Normal School. As requirements for the practice of the profession of teaching steadily increased from the 1960s onwards, Bill found himself back in the classroom as a student for quite a number of years, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) from the University of Manitoba in 1958.

The goal of the paper was to identify the types of supply chain models in this sector. The research methods were interviews and direct observations of manufacturing and logistics processes in clothing companies. Four types of supply chains models were characterized on the examples of supply chains of various companies. The criteria taken into consideration when characterizing the models included but were not limited to: the supply chain leader, the manufactured products (mass or individualized), the material flow strategy (push, pull), and the geographical location of the supply chain nodes. The factors differentiating these models were related to competitiveness – first of all, the price, the quality of products and services, the time of delivery, the accessibility of products, the extent of the product range.</jats:p>"

The private nature of commercial relations means that freedom of information requests are not available. One way for researchers to study forced labour in global supply chains, therefore, is to use information made available by the corporations themselves. This Chapter draws on empirical legal research methods to explore the value of publicly available documents on how companies address CSR issues. It argues that, despite some limitations, it is possible to use data that is available on company websites such as codes of conduct, terms and conditions of purchase and nonfinancial reporting to assess business practices. These documents can complement both traditional doctrinal legal research of cases and statutes and research from other disciplines, thus providing new opportunities for research on forced labour in global supply chains.</p>",

Because of this, complaints about inadequate supply are usually blamed on insufficient production. However, a recent study by the author indicated that the water distribution and supply network is equally important. A water network modelled in EPANET2 hydraulic solver was subjected to various conditions and constraints, and its responses analyzed. For water to be supplied efficiently, and in addition to augmenting production, greater emphasis must be put on the distribution system. This must be designed and optimized appropriately, to deliver water at the required pressure and discharge. In particular, higher pressures can be obtained when larger diameter pipes are used because friction losses are reduced, thereby reducing pumping costs. One way to improve pressure is by limiting demand.</jats:p>",

Based on trust, companies at present have created formal and informal network structures in which cooperation between them plays a special role. In the present times, the economic importance of supply chains can be observed in almost every industry regardless size: multinational companies and even small and medium-sized enterprises are actively involved in global value-creating chains. More and more business leaders recognize that when consumers are about to decide on their purchases, not just performance of a company is evaluated but that of the entire supply chain and supply network. Forms of cooperation in the supply chain affect the companies in several ways: we can investigate its impact on growth, operation and thus, on the effectiveness of the supply chain and competitiveness. Both cooperation between and within companies are important in creating the ultimate value added. This paper aims to explore the functional fields in which companies cooperate with each other, i.e. how and in what manner they are connected to each other. Results and conclusions are based on in-depth interviews and a questionnaire filled in by companies in Hungary.</jats:p>",

The article also presents the way in which the blockchain technology works and the possibilities of using it. Projects in which the blockchain technology will be used and which will refer to information management within the supply chains are also presented. An already existing application tool using the blockchain technology is also discussed. Owing to this, benefits derived from using tools based on the blockchain technology to improve information management within supply chains are identified.</jats:p>"

Keynes  menjelaskan bahwa  volume kesempatan kerja dan pendapatan nasional ditentukan oleh keseimbangan antara Agregat Demand  (AD) dan Agregat Supply  (AS).  Jika AD lebih besar dari AS maka ada rangsangan bagi para produsen memperbesar produksinya pada volume kesempatan kerja yang lebih tinggi yang menghasilkan pendapatan nasional yang lebih tinggi. Jika AD lebih besar dari AS maka produsen akan menurunkan produksinya sehingga volume kesempatan kerja dan pendapatan nasional menurun. Pada saat AD sama dengan AS terjadi keseimbangan dan keseimbangan tersebut belum tentu berada pada volume kesempatan kerja penuh. AD pada tingkat keseimbangan itu dinamakan efektif demand. Dalam perspektif permintaan aggregat, terdapat  dua komponen yang berhubungan dengan perdagangan internasional yaitu: Ekspor barang/jasa dan Impor barang/jasa.  Dalam perspektif  teori perekonomian internasional keberadaan teori klasik dan modern sebagai basis dari teori perekonomian internasional mengalami pergeseran paradigma yaitu teori klasik disarkan paradigma negara, yang kemudian bergeser ke teori modern  yang di dasarkan paradigma perusahaan.  Karena itu, Teori keynes, teori perekonomian internasional baik teori klasik maupun modern berupaya untuk menciptakan kesejahteraan masyarakat suatu negara, maka komponen seperti konsumsi, investasi modal, pengeluaran, ekspor dan impor termasuk produksi menjadi penting untuk diperhatikan.</jats:p>"

Aiming to support organizations in this sustainable development challenge, this paper explores the strategic management principles of ISO 9001 and supply chain integration from the lens of triple bottom line sustainability. Derived from theoretical synergies, a conceptual framework for integration, measurement, and improvement of triple bottom line sustainability is constructed and a business diagnostic tool introduced to facilitate the implementation of the framework. The developed conceptual framework and diagnostic tool are verified through an expert panel-based Delphi study and positive relationships formulated between the management principles of ISO 9001, supply chain integration and sustainability management. The facilitating and catalyzing role of quality management and supply chain management principles for integration and improvement of organizational sustainability is outlined.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a renewable building’s energy supply chain model based on LCA is proposed. Based on the definition of planned supply chain, procurement, construction and delivery process, the operation reference model of renewable green building’s energy supply chain is analyzed. According to the analysis of LCA, the life cycle stage set of renewable green building’s energy supply chain is obtained. A renewable green building’s energy supply chain model with economic and low-carbon comprehensive objectives is obtained by combining the economic goal-oriented model with the low-carbon goal-oriented model and introducing the life cycle stage set. The experimental results show that the modeling complexity of the model is low and the time-consuming is less. The model fits the actual situation well. The pollution coefficient of the model is smaller than that of the current model. It is practical and provides technical reference for the field of green building.</jats:p>",

IoT devices can be installed in manufacturing facilities, warehouses, distribution centers, transportation equipment, and retail establishments, as well as throughout the entire ecosystem. The supply chain's numerous elements, such as inventory levels, product conditions, equipment performance, and transportation routes, may be tracked, monitored, and analyzed with the ease of these IoT devices. Supply chain managers can achieve a level of visibility and management over the operations never before possible by utilizing IoT capabilities. Real-time data gathering and analysis support proactive decision-making, enabling quicker reaction times to anticipated interruptions, inventory level optimization, and enhanced demand forecasting precision. IoT-enabled supply chain management also improves traceability and transparency, giving businesses the capacity to comply with regulations, reduce risks, and guarantee the quality and safety of the products. Additionally, IoT-driven supply chain management encourages coordination and integration among a range of stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, and clients. Enhanced coordination, shorter lead times, and better customer service are all made possible by the supply chain's smooth data and information flow. IoT devices can help automate repetitive processes so that staff members can concentrate on more value-added activities.</jats:p>"

Menurut Lu (2011: 8), \"rantai pasokan pada dasarnya adalah sekelompok organisasi independen yang terhubung bersama melalui produk dan layanan yang mereka berikan secara terpisah dan / atau bersama-sama untuk memberikan nilai pada konsumen akhir\". Di Industri perikanan  air  tawar,  manajemen  rantai  pasok  diperlukan  untuk  memastikan proses produksi  berjalan  lancar  dan  bisa  memasok barang  sesuai  kebutuhan pasar. Namun seringkali perusahaan yang bergerak di industri perikanan tidak dapat memasok barang sesuai dengan permintaan yang ada, salah satu faktor penghambatnya adalah karena minimnya kapasitas produksi yang menghambat pertumbuhan perusahaan. Penelitian ini akan dilakukan berdasarkan metode kualitatif dalam pengumpulan dan abstrak data. Temuan penelitian menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar petani memiliki masalah yang sama yaitu mereka memiliki kekurangan kapasitas produksi sehingga tidak dapat memasok barang sesuai dengan permintaan yang ada. Penelitian lebih lanjut juga membuktikan bahwa prinsip integrasi adalah variabel yang paling mudah dipahami oleh petani antara variabel orientasi lainnya.Keywords—Recruitment; Supply Chain Management, Production Capacity, and Fishing Industry</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnesium components offer an enormous potential to achieve considerable weight savings in the automotive industry. As with any innovative construction material, (e.g. carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, ultra-high-strength steel) a rigid quality management system needs to be established along the supply chain. For this purpose, the concept of the supply chain quality management is to be introduced for the special case of magnesium components, using the example of the magnesium strip production. By the implementation of the widespread ISO 9001 norm, opportunities can be leveraged by both the creation of upstream, downstream linkages and the defined internal processes to achieve the required and stable quality for the automotive industry. The paper suggests procedures and instructions for process control during the magnesium strip production according to the twin-roll casting technology, giving feedback to the respective production system to avoid insufficient quality. The results serve as a basis for the development of all stages up to the assembly of magnesium components. The individual process stages dependent on the manufacturer should be considered during the procedure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The retail industry is seemingly one that is at odds with itself. It is an industry that seeks to deploy cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition, Artificial Intelligence, data analytics, and hand-held devices to improve the customer experience. However, the retail industry still relies upon 40 year-old technologies — namely barcodes and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) — as the backbone of its vendor-supported supply chains. Inasmuch as the science behind these technologies has advanced, (eg faster laser scanners, Internet connectivity versus dial-up modems), the technologies themselves remain essentially unchanged. What also has stayed effectively the same are retailers’ supply chain vendor compliance programs. This paper explores how abusive vendor compliance programs are a contributing factor to the current state of disenfranchisement between retailers — both brick-and-mortar and online — and the vendor community today. The paper highlights how, in an era where brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling with their business models against their online competitors, vendor compliance programs are an overlooked opportunity. It provides real examples of how retailers’ abuse of vendor compliance standards and best practices only serves to drive up both their own and their vendors’ operating costs, extend compliance timelines, and delay order fulfilment. Using various industry study statistics, this paper showcases how vendor compliance has worked to contribute to supply chain disruption, not supply chain collaboration, which reduces retailers’ ability to collect and analyse critical data. As the paper concludes, for the overall good of the retail industry, retailers — as the industry leaders and authors of their vendor compliance programs — must take immediate improvement action as the results will enhance the supply chain partnerships they have with their vendors in key beneficial ways.</jats:p>"

Underestimating and not including the discontinuity in the managerial concept makes the supply chain homomorphic with respect to reality, thus, it is reflected only approximately (Jędralska, 1992). In other words, the situation of discontinuity is caused by the unreliability of the current management model. The answer to the discontinuity may be the formation of resilient supply chains that are aimed at developing specific patterns of adaptive behaviour. The aim of the article is to recognize the adaptive behaviours of a resilient supply chain in light of the assumptions of triple-loop learning in an organization. In the first part of the paper, the issue of a resilient supply chain is discussed, highlighting its adaptive capability. Next, the mechanism of preadaptation – adaptation of the supply chain based on triple-loop learning is explained. The final part of the paper presents the basic components of a resilient supply chain determining the adaptive behaviour consistent with triple-loop learning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This case study focuses on a gigantic iron ore mining operation with a large geographic footprint and located some distance inland in the outback of Western Australia. The mining company also owns and operates an ore shipping port on the coast. The mine management asked for quotes to build new larger inventory warehouses at the mine and port to house the stock stored out in the open and also to house the returned ‘squirrel’ stock from dispersed workshops. (Stock was illegally ‘squirrelled away’ to safeguard stock availability.) On investigation, it was found that the ‘squirrel’ stock of conveyor belt idlers, valued at a cost of about AUD$10m, contained a high percentage of ruined idlers due to inadequate outside storage at the mine workshops. On further investigation, it was found that the ‘squirrel’ stock was really a symptom of the lack of trust in the central store’s inventory management methodology and product availability. Inventory modelling results showed that improved risk-responsive stock levels could both increase confidence from workshop management, thereby reducing the desire to ‘squirrel away’ stock, and also affect the new warehouse space requirements. Risk-responsive stock levels turned out to be very capital-efficient and reduced many reorder points. Returning ‘squirrel’ stock would now need no increase in warehouse space and the new risk-responsive stock levels would, in fact, lead to a decrease in many stock levels. As a final outcome the risk modelling simulations showed that risk-trimmed stock levels removed the need to build new facilities. Furthermore, through more risk-appropriate stock levels, customer service and parts availability could be significantly improved. As a consequence, the desire to ‘squirrel away’ stock could also be reduced or eliminated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Many higher education institutions have begun offering opportunities to earn credit for in-person courses through massive open online courses (MOOCs). This mixed-methods study examines the experiences of students participating in one of the first iterations of this trend: a blended professional master's degree program that admitted students based on performance in MOOC-based online courses. We found that the blended master's program attracted a cohort of highly educated mid-career professionals from developed countries who were looking for more flexible alternatives to traditional graduate programs. Success in the online courses was correlated with higher levels of prior formal education and effective use of learning strategies. Students who enrolled in the blended graduate program reported being academically prepared for their coursework and had higher GPAs (3.86, p&amp;lt;0.01) than students in the residential program (3.75). The findings of this study suggest that the technological affordances of MOOC-based online and blended degrees will neither transform higher education nor solve its most stubborn equity challenges, but there may be particular niches where they provide a valuable service to learners in particular programs and contexts.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article is devoted to working capital management and its optimization on an inter-organizational level when supply chain members operate collaboratively. We aim to develop and validate a model of collaborative approach to working capital management in supply chains for cases of constrained liquidity and imposed return requirements using supply chain finance (factoring, reverse factoring and inventory financing). As such, we suggest a tool of working capital optimization using financial terms and cash flows verified on Russian supply chain data. Mathematical modeling is suggested as a method to modify an existing working capital management model on the grounds of collaborative financial cost minimization under industry specific liquidity constraints. These liquidity constraints are constructed in such a way as to eliminate possible violations from companies, because their violation will lead to the inverse relation between liquidity and rate of return. The results of the optimization provide recommended values for cash conversion cycle elements – days of inventories, days of accounts payable, days of accounts receivable – that guarantee the coordinating effect of collaborative working capital management. Calculation, further optimization and monitoring of cash conversion cycle values sustain effective working capital management on an inter-organizational level while meeting the liquidity and return levels for each company in a chain. The suggested model can be implemented for a day-to-day decision making process by companies oriented to stay competitive in the long run. Besides, the results obtained show the potential for further coordination among the key members of the supply chain in terms of aligning financial, product, and information flows. Despite the fact that the model provides a static solution to the problem of collaborative working capital management, it has potential for the further development of a dynamic algorithm. Future research should seek to investigate the possible imputation options for gained costs reduction values on the grounds of cooperative games with a coalition structure.</jats:p>"

Different from a traditional media supply chain, they can easily operate their own direct distribution channels in the Internet era. In the digital video supply chain, it is not clear whether commercialization of the direct distribution channel would be beneficial for the media publisher because it would decrease profits from advertisements. The choice about commercialization should be investigated thoroughly because it is closely related to the media publishers’ sustainability as a public medium in a digital environment. In this study, we analyze the impacts of commercializing the direct distribution channel based on a game-theoretic approach. Specifically, we compare the profits of a media publisher with and without the commercialization of the channel from analyses of sequentially defined games. Our results show that media publishers prefer to use a free service on their direct channel if the content they provide is not highly valued. They can also choose not to provide their content to the media aggregator with a paid service.</jats:p>"

The quality of electricity generated by ground sources and their compatibility have a direct impact, among others, on the calibration of aircraft avionics systems during the ground flight preparation, which directly contributes to the safety of air operations.

The effect of individual preference on the evolutionary dynamics for supply chains is studied by employing replicator dynamics. Each firm has three behavior preferences: selfishness, fairness, and altruism. Firstly, the case that the strategy set of manufacturers and retailers including two pure strategies is considered and the effect of preference parameter on the equilibrium outcome in the short-term interaction is discussed. Secondly, the equilibrium state in the short-term is always disturbed because the change of the environment, firm’s structure, and so forth. Using the replicator dynamics, the evolutionary stable strategies of manufacturers and retailers in the long-term interaction are analyzed. Finally, the extend case that the strategy set of manufacturers and retailers include three pure strategies is investigated. These results are found that the strategy profile in which both manufacturer and retailer choose fairness or altruism, or one player chooses fair or altruistic strategy and the other player chooses selfish strategy may be evolutionary stable, the stability of these equilibria depends on the the preference parameters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article covers the process of statistical observation in agricultural statistics of Ukraine. It is established that the sta-tistical data are based on the reporting of agricultural enterprises and is the basis for the compilation of 19 statistical forms, namely 9 year, 1 semester, 2 quarter, 7 months.\nIt has been found that product balances are calculated for the most important products annually, quarterly and monthly at the country level. Balances in terms of agricultural enterprises and households are in the regions. In product balances, an assessment is made of output, intermediate consumption and value added. Different methods have been formed on the basis of calculations of the basic statistical indicators of production of crop and livestock production.\nIn the analysis of statistical reporting, a list of shortcomings in the objectivity of the reflection of transformational changes in the domestic agricultural sector of Ukraine is distinguished. When conducting the All-Ukrainian Agricultural Census, it is necessary to allocate from the whole set of farms of the corporate sector of the agrarian economy a group of subsidiaries with the use of an expanded system of indicators that will allow them to assess the state of their resource potential and development prospects, to conduct a comparative analysis with other subjects of agribusiness that are not part of agroholdings and other agro-industrial associations.\nIn the course of the research it was discovered that agroholdings and other agro-industrial associations are not subject to statistical study, but their activity plays an important role in agricultural production. We consider it necessary to develop the legal regulation of the activities of all members of the agroindustrial association for the analysis of their activities as legal entities on the basis of consideration of consolidated financial statements submitted by them to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine.\nIt has been established that the agricultural census is an indispensable element of agrarian statistics, since it is not possible to obtain the most complete and detailed information on the current state and prospects of the development of agricultural business entities, the availability and use of their resource potential without end to end, which will eventually allow them to form an effective agrarian and food policy.\nThe study found that the structural indicators of gross output and gross value added of agriculture is affected by the fact that the level of current prices used in calculations of household products by 30-40% higher than the price level for similar products of \"non-financial corporations\" of agricultural purpose . At the same time, differences in current prices in the regions of Ukraine also lead to inequality of physical volumes of production and value added; therefore, it is necessary to improve the work of the national accounting system for the formation of common comparable prices for agricultural products and to evaluate the volumes of production and value added on the basis of special calculations.\nWe believe that in order to avoid problems arising when calculating cross-sectoral comparative analysis, it is necessary to improve the informational and methodological support of dynamic characteristics of gross value added in comparative prices.\nThe priority directions of improvement of the current methodology of food balance production in accordance with inter-national standards have been formed, namely: further work on the methodology of calculating the level of consumption based on the balance of food resources in accordance with international standards, including determining the level of consumption in terms of nutrition elements; revision of the coefficients of conversion of food products into agricultural products, taking into account changes in the technology of its production; Expansion of the existing system of balance of food resources, etc.\nWe believe that the lack of necessary opportunities in the development of statistical support for the functioning of the agro-food sector of the economy is due to the lack of financial resources for the collection of primary data.\nThe main reasons for the weakness of the development of agricultural statistics are established. We believe that it is ne-cessary to establish a systematic assessment based on the use of the system of identical international criteria, which would help to carry out a detailed diagnosis and analysis of current statistical opportunities for each country.\nWe have proposed the need to create an analytical center under the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, which will ensure the integration of all state information resources about the country's agroindustrial complex, the creation of a single automated system for collecting and detailed analysis of data on the state of the domestic agricultural sector and agri-cultural infrastructure, forecasting the development of agricultural markets.\nKey words: agro-industrial associations, infrastructure, food balance, added value, information database, analytical center.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Concerns about the functioning of food supply chains have been raised by the European Commission over past years, calling for more effective and coordinated action by National Competition Authorities (NCAs). To fill this knowledge gap, an equilibrium displacement model is used to screen conduct along the supply chain, combining the advantages of asymmetric price transmission (APT) studies and structural models. The test was carried out on the Italian fluid milk supply chain following market monitoring action by the NCA. Three periods (1996–2003; 2000–2008 and 1996–2008) have been examined, finding imperfect competition over 1996–2008 and 2000–2008, while no conclusions may be drawn over the time span 1996–2003. In the testing process, the model’s peculiarities and certain limitations emerged, and related suggestions for its improvement are discussed. This approach may be used as a preliminary “fast” test for competition policy screening, as a complement to other methodologies. However, further theoretical and empirical model validation is necessary.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A large number of natural and man-made emergencies occurring on the territory of Ukraine, and not only that cause deforestation of buildings, structures, objects and cities and whole districts, require the provision of fire protection systems for sources of electricity that are independent of Electricity supply of certain areas or cities and objects.&#x0D;\nRegardless of the control mode, elements of automatic fire protection systems are elements that take part in a single technological process (notifying people of danger, feeding, water, removing smoke, etc.).&#x0D;\nAll systems of fire protection (SPPZ), as the main power source use a common grid (220 / 380V AC). In this unchanged form, the electric power is fed to supply power executive elements (asynchronous actuators of water pumps, fans, etc.). To control the operation of fire protection systems, 12-24V DC is used. This requires the use of additional transducers in fire control systems to form the voltage of the corresponding form.&#x0D;\nSimultaneous exhaustion of tens and hundreds of settlements, as evidenced by the reports of the DNS of Ukraine and other operational services, affects the provision of fire protection of objects and the safety of people [5]. Taking into account the unpredictability of the occurrence of events, it is necessary to apply methods of providing backup power supply independent of power supply and climatic conditions of operation of fire protection systems.&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the work is to propose the optimal way of forming the supply voltage and adjusting its parameters for the backup power of electric consumers of automatic fire protection systems powered by an autonomous power supply, which consists of a unit of battery and autonomous voltage inverters. Such a backup power scheme allows simultaneous control and regulation of the voltage, frequency, and the ability to determine the parameters of the autonomous source elements.&#x0D;\nIn the process of reviewing and assessing the reliability of power supply of electric consumers of automatic fire protection systems, previously noted ways to increase the reliability of the operation of automatic fire protection systems by reserving power supply from autonomous sources with the use of accumulator batteries and autocompressor voltage inverters were taken into account. For comparison, from all known electricians of fire protection systems, the most common and most powerful electric consumer is used - an asynchronous motor.&#x0D;\nThe probabilistic method for calculating the functioning of the backup power supply system for an internal fire-fighting water supply system using generator sets and accumulator batteries with autonomous inverters of voltage, taking into account the accidental nature of the disconnection of power lines, proved that the proposed reservation scheme, both with K2AIN-AD and with 2K2AIN-AD increases the reliability of functioning systems for fire protection. An increase in the number of similar items led to an improvement in the quality characteristics of the power supply, but had a negative impact on reliability, albeit slightly compared to the backup from the two-transformer substation.</jats:p>"

RGB LED lighting fixtures offer convenient options of color changes to enhance our environment. The forward characteristics of Red, Green and Blue LEDâ€™s indicate the region of control to produce acceptable level of light intensities. As the intensity of light produced by an LED is proportional to its forward current, a suitable region is identified to obtain distinctive colors and to explore the energy saving options. The objective of the paper was to provide a suitable control for dimming in the linear region as well as in the nonlinear region of the diode graph. The RGB LEDs have been powered from three push pull converters. Different control methods have been explored and simulated in PSPICE to switch the LEDs as to produce distinctive colors. Every method seems to have its pros and cons. Eventually Voltage mode control is adopted to provide control over the entire region of the diode graph which includes both linear and nonlinear regions which will serve the purpose of dimming. Accordingly, a multi-colored lamp source using RGB LEDs has been designed and the hardware has been developed.Â Â Â </jats:p>"

This study precisely examined the effects of collaboration and supply chain design on customers’ satisfaction at the downstream end of the chain using Ekiti State as study area. The study employed descriptive survey design with the use of structured Likert scale questionnaire administered to 381 retailers of noodles in Ekiti State. The research hypotheses were analysed using simple linear regression as statistical technique with the aid of SPSS version 22.0. At the end of the study, it was observed that both collaboration and supply chain design were significant predictors of customers’ satisfaction of instant noodles in Ekiti State. However, collaboration among supply chain partners emerged as stronger determinant of customers’ satisfaction than supply chain design.

I choose supplier selection theory because the supply chain of raw materials from suppliers strongly influences the good name of a company. Therefore, Mcdonald needs a supplier which must be consistent about the quality and quantity that are providedso that Mcdonald is able to satisfy their customers.</jats:p>",

Initially, the study classifies the FSCP and further examines the partner relationships in sustainability-oriented food supply chain (FSC). To do so, the study proposes and formally tests a five-stage performance measurement model. The present research mainly focuses on the Indian food industry. Results highlight significant direct and indirect positive performance relationships between the different FSC stages. The structural equation modeling analysis highlights that producer’s performance positively impacts supplier’s performance, processor’s performance, and distributor’s performance. Moreover, supplier’s performance positively impacts processor’s performance, distributor’s performance, and retailer’s performance, and also processor’s performance positively impacts both distributor’s performance and retailer’s performance. Lastly, distributor’s performance positively impacts retailer’s performance. The study suggests that regular performance improvement at each FSC stage would improve the performance of the next stage players. Most importantly, the direct impact of each partner’s performance is comparatively high on its immediate next partner’s performance. Furthermore, this study will assist practitioners to understand various FSCP measurement issues and make significant improvements in their sustainable and energy-efficient supply chain practices.</jats:p>"

At the same time, transportation is a source of uncertainty of logistics operations performance in the supply chain. Obviously, the development of a new approach for evaluation of the duration of delivery “Just-In-Time” (JIT) will improve the efficiency of supply chains in accordance with one of the major criteria, namely customer satisfaction. One of the basic approaches to make effective management decisions in transportation and other logistic operations is the JIT concept. In the majority of examined sources the JIT concept is described on the verbal level without any usage of calculation dependences. The paper is devoted to the formation of analytical and simulation models, which allow obtaining the probabilistic evaluation of the implementation of unimodal and multimodal international transportation JIT. The first model where the order of the operations implementation does not affect final result is formed on the basis of the probability theory: distribution laws composition, theorems of numerical characteristics of random variables, formula of complete probability. The second model accounts the impact of operations implementation order in transportation and their interconnection and is based on the simulation (the method of statistic experiments) and shown as a corresponding algorithm, which allows to consider different limitations (technical, organizational and so on). Considered analytical dependences give the possibility to obtain the necessary estimations of the transport operations implementation according to JIT: mean transportation time, delivery implementation probability by the set moment or the delivery time with the set probability. To carry out some comparative calculations and clarify the algorithm, two international routes have been chosen: the first one is a unimodal road transportation, the second one is a multimodal transportation (road and marine transport). All the data, which is necessary for calculation has been collected on the basis of official information (in particular, the data of tachograph, special questionnaires filled in by the drivers, the survey results of the managers). For unimodal transportations analytical dependences and modelling results give close results. For the combined multimodal transportations taking into account various limitations the preference must be given to the simulation. The modelled indexes take into consideration their intercommunication and definitely estimate the supply chains reliability, and this allows decreasing the uncertainty of the logistic system.</jats:p>",

The aim of the article is to develop a conceptual model of the mechanism of balancing supply and demand for freight transportation services by road and the justification of the influence of external and internal environment. Methodology. In the process of research, the following methods were used: theoretical and empirical research, analysis and synthesis of indicators; statistical and analytical data processing to identify trends in the types of economic activity that use road transport services for transportation. Results. The article proves that for most companies the gap between supply and demand is now a serious problem. Road transport companies are no exception, the supply of transport services by which exceeds the solvent demand aggravates intra-industry competition. It is determined that supply adapts to changing demand and makes it impossible to have a long-term deficit. At the same time, supply forms and stimulates demand for existing goods and services in the market. The definition of the mechanism of balancing the supply and demand for freight transportation services by road transport as a dynamic system containing the following elements: the process of collecting, processing and analyzing information about the demand and supply of freight transportation services, assessment of their balance and the directions and measures to stimulate demand and regulate the supply of freight transportation services has been justified. The factors influencing the development of demand for road transportation in Ukraine were determined. These are growth of production volumes, development of retail and wholesale trade, increase of real incomes of population, reduction of inflation level and consumer prices, corruption, condition and quality of transport infrastructure, safety level of road traffic and cargo transportation, investments in the industry, risks of economic activity, emergency situations, prices for fuels and lubricants. Submitted a quantitative characteristic of domestic enterprises in the international road transport market, as well as the total number of cars in the market of transport services. It highlights trends in the development of economic activities that use road transport services for transportation, including agriculture, forestry and fisheries; extractive industry; processing industry; construction; wholesale and retail trade. The author presents a conceptual model of the mechanism of balancing supply and demand for freight transportation services by road, which identifies the sources of information support for the mechanism operation and directions and measures of balancing supply and demand for freight transportation by road. Practical meaning. According to the results of the study indicated the need to organize the activities of business entities that provide freight transportation services by road transport, based on the concept of marketing. In particular, the choice of the most effective for the entrepreneur-carrier types of transportation and services; analysis of transportation needs in the transportation of goods and the ability of enterprises to meet them; development of rational technologies and systems of goods movement; planning the development of transportation and services. Prospects for further research. On the basis of the study identified the prospects for further development of both scientific and practical component of the organization of cargo transportation services by road, based on the concept of marketing.</jats:p>"

Adaptation strategies implemented in disaster management are thought to be influential factors in the success of disaster risk reduction.This study aims to examine in depth the pattern of adaptation applied in the cycle of disaster management in Sitiarjo Village. This study aims to examine in depth the adaptation strategy adopted in the cycle of disaster management in Sitiarjo Village. The research method is qualitative with case study approach. The subjects of research are the elements directly involved in disaster management consisting of Puskesmas Health Workforce, Village Government Officer, Disaster Volunteer, and Community.The results show that the community adaptation strategy has been running well in the context of disaster preparedness which includes: modification of house design, supply of drinking water and clean water, closet closure and air pit in latrines. While in the context of emergency response, each sector has taken the necessary tasks such as medical action and quality recovery of dug wells.The duties of disaster volunteers such as SIBAT and SBH are very important in empowering the community to create a resilient community.There is still a gap in access to information and tools for the recovery of dug wells in some areas.The conclusion that can be drawn is that most people have adopted a good adaptation strategy in the field of water supply and sanitation to face the health impact of flood disaster. To improve the quality of disaster management still needed additional materials and supporting equipment for Puskesmas and community, and capacity building for disaster volunteers.</jats:p>"

Identifica-se com os resultados que (1) há falta de comunicação entre os membros da cadeia; (2) a logística reversa tem ocorrido de forma limitada quanto as questões ambientais, assim como a gestão de resíduos; e (3) não há integração estratégica entre os membros desta cadeia produtiva. Com esta pesquisa consegue-se contribuir para o entendimento de uma cadeia de suprimento em diferentes níveis, algo ainda pouco desenvolvido no Brasil. Além disso, com a análise do fluxo direto e reverso do Coco é possível entender como ações podem ser desenvolvidas com o intuito de melhor contribuir com a sustentabilidade.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies producing or importing articles (or parts thereof) as well as retailers are facing new challenges coming from societal demands and expectations directed at transparency of (problematic) substances in articles (SiA), and the overall “sustainability” of supply chain operations. Legislation on chemicals in the EU (e.g., REACH) and beyond stipulating legal SiA requirements reflect these developments. In addition, with a view to eliminating problematic substances in material circles, the recently amended Waste Framework Directive requires, from January 2021 on, companies placing articles on the European Economic Area (EEA) market to report to authorities the presence of substances of very high concern (SVHC) above a certain threshold in such articles. ´\nChemical compliance management is not part of the core business for many companies. Many actors perceive related challenges as an overwhelming task. IT-based solutions offer opportunities to establish a systematic approach to transparency and traceability of SiA within complex global supply chains. In order to “be prepared” for future legislation, the long-term vision of a Full Material Declaration (FMD) is a promising approach. This way, firms can meet their present requirements from law as well as from sectoral or company specifications, and can prepare for future requirements. \nThis article compares supply chain communication requirements and needs on the one hand and actual practice on the other in order to subsequently identify the respective delta. The article also introduces FMD as a strategy to overcome the delta and shows development perspectives for existing approaches. Finally, after drawing conclusions, the article formulates recommendations for EU policies.</jats:p>",

The type of credit policy being offered to the retailers is decided on the basis of their past profiles. Hence, the whole seller puts forth full and partial permissible delays to his old and new retailers respectively. This study considers bad debts from the portion of new retailers who fail to make up for the delayed part of the partial payment. The analysis shows that it is beneficial for the whole seller to make shorter contracts, particularly with new retailers, along with the fetching of a higher fraction of initial purchase cost from them. In addition to the above-described scenario, the lot received by the whole seller from the manufacturer is not perfect, and it contains some defects for which he employs an inspection process before selling the items to the retailers. In order to make the study more realistic, Type-I, as well as Type-II misclassification errors, and the case of out-of-stock are considered. The impact of Type-I error has been found to be crucial in the study. The present paper determines the optimal policy for the whole seller by maximizing the expected total profit per unit time. For the optimality of the solution, theoretical results are provided. Finally, a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis are done to validate the model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ns5:p><ns5:bold>Background</ns5:bold>: Tumor cells often show altered metabolism which supports uncontrolled proliferation. A classic example is the Warburg effect: high glucose uptake and lactate production despite sufficient oxygen supply. Remarkably, tumor cells can transiently take up glucose even an order of magnitude faster when glucose is reintroduced after depletion. Regulation and significance of this high glucose uptake are investigated here.</ns5:p><ns5:p><ns5:bold>Methods</ns5:bold>: A new computational model was developed which reproduces two types of experimental data on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells: measurements by Otto Warburg of the average aerobic glycolytic rate during one hour (Warburg effect), and fast metabolic responses measured by others during the first minutes after reintroducing glucose. The model is subsequently extended with equations for glucose and O<ns5:sub>2</ns5:sub> transport to predict the role of metabolism during fluctuations of blood flow in tumor tissue.</ns5:p><ns5:p><ns5:bold>Results</ns5:bold>: Model analysis reveals dynamic regulation of the head section of glycolysis where glucose uptake and phosphorylation occur. The head section is disinhibited slowly when concentrations of glycolytic intermediates fall, causing glucose uptake rate to considerably exceed that found by Warburg. The head section is partially inhibited in about a minute when sufficient glucose has been taken up. Simulations predict that tumors greedily take up glucose when blood flow resumes after periods of low flow. The cells then store glucose as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and other glycolytic intermediates. During subsequent periods of low flow that cause O<ns5:sub>2</ns5:sub>and glucose depletion these stores are used for ATP production and biomass.</ns5:p><ns5:p><ns5:bold>Conclusions</ns5:bold>: The powerful glycolytic system in tumors not only synthesizes ATP at high steady rates, but can also store glycolytic intermediates to buffer temporary oxygen and nutrient shortages for up to 10 minutes. The head section of glycolysis in tumor cells, disinhibited during glucose shortages, becomes very efficient at stealing glucose from other cells, even at low glucose concentrations.</ns5:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A survey was conducted with different supply chain actors of chemical fertilizers for studying the supply chain of chemical fertilizers in Nepal in 2018. Chemical fertilizers in Nepal are imported from different manufacturing countries like Turkey, China, Egypt and India by global tender and by government to government negotiation especially from India. Potential demand for fertilizer in Nepal is about 7,00,000 MT of which actual supply in the year 2016/17 was 3,24,977MT. Average subsidy on chemical fertilizer in Nepal since 2008/09 is estimated to be NRs. 3,73,42,27,780 (43.78%). Procurement, shipping, warehousing at port, inland transportation, inland warehousing, local transportation, distribution and consumption are major supply chain functions of chemical fertilizer specific to Nepal. Final sell price of urea, DAP and MOP in Sindhupalchhok in the year 2016 was found 37, 15 and 23% respectively higher than entry point sell price. Non-conducive policy environment, ineffective regulation, lack of fund and poor infrastructure are major problems of fertilizer supply in Nepal. Illegal trading from open border of India and selling of subsidized fertilizers by unauthorized agro-dealers are other problems of this sector.Though government has been investing large revenue in fertilizer subsidy, expected results in productivity enhancement has not been met. Assured supply of quality fertilizer in time is more important even than the price of fertilizer. Therefore, emphasis is to be led on implementation of conducive policy, strict regulation and infrastructure development focusing on timely supply, judicious application, checking illegal trading along with the promotion of use of organic manures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the aim of delivering goods and services to customers, optimal delivery channel selection is a significant part of supply chain management. Several heuristics have been developed to solve the variants of distribution center allocation and vehicle routing problems. In reality, small-scale suppliers cannot afford research and development departments to optimize their distribution networks. In this context, this research work develops a model for an online to offline (O2O) supply chain management network of a small-scale household electric components manufacturer for delivering goods to its distribution centers and retailers. Retailers are acquired by the company through investment in the O2O channel of e-commerce. Electric power transmission and distribution is considered as representative of the product distribution network. A model is developed using a combination of the supply chain management technique and power transmission terminologies. The constrained linear programming model is solved through the linear programming tool of the LINGO optimization software and the global optimum results for the proposed quantity allocation problem are achieved. A numerical experiment is provided to illustrate the practical applicability of the model and the optimal results are analyzed for model robustness.</jats:p>"

No “fechamento do ciclo” da cadeia, materiais em seus finais de vida são trazidos de volta ao sistema para serem recuperados, sendo a Logística Reversa somente parte do conceito de GSCM. A literatura indica os benefícios da implantação de práticas do GSCM, mas o meio empresarial ainda tem muitos desafios para estabelecer cadeias de suprimentos verdadeiramente sustentáveis, tendo que lidar com barreiras de implementação. As empresas precisam remover essas barreiras, mas se observa que ainda há pouca avaliação sistematizada da literatura sobre essa questão. Diante dessa lacuna de pesquisa, o objetivo do artigo é levantar na literatura, por meio da Revisão Bibliográfica Sistemática, as barreiras para a implementação efetiva da Logística Reversa e do GSCM. Através deste método, foram encontradas 59 barreiras à implementação da LR e/ou GSCM, enquadradas em sete diferentes categorias: gestão, financeiras, stakeholders, infraestrutura e tecnologia, ciclo de vida, conhecimento e cultura, revelando a grande variedade de fatores que podem dificultar a implementação de ações ambientalmente sustentáveis nas organizações.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents the experimental research results for the horizontal-axis wind turbine with coaxial wind rotors. It is assumed that such coaxial layout of the wind turbine can be used for designing of the wind energy systems with relatively low capacity and limited location area since the coaxial systems have advantages in overall dimensions and maximum using of the swept area. Possibility of coaxial horizontal-axis wind turbines usage is determined by positive or negative effect of turbines on each other. Literature review shows that closely spaced wind turbines can generally improve flow characteristics under certain conditions and consequently increase wind energy system efficiency. We have carried out the experiments in T-5 wind tunnel with two coaxial model two-bladed wind turbines which rotate in opposite directions. The generator of the first turbine and first turbine itself are located on the same shaft in the test section of wind tunnel. The second generator is in a lower compartment of the experimental setup and is connected by the transmission. We have measured the dynamic, energy and frequency characteristics of wind energy systems based on created experimental setup. A Pitot tube and automatic metering devises have measured the dynamic parameters and energy performance respectively. A frequency counter has saved all of the data obtained with the laser frequency measurement technique. The experiment has some specific technical features so the data received need to be corrected. The coaxial wind turbine power has decreased in comparison to isolated wind turbine at low wind speed. The return flows reinforce turbulence so wind speed falls. If wind speed increases, the impact of the return flows decreases, the coaxial wind turbine capacity significantly grows and exceeds isolated turbine capacity. The possibility of using wind turbines with coaxial wind rotors for autonomous power supply is shown. Such wind turbines are perspective and require more detailed analysis.</jats:p>"

Such a “win–win–win” situation is not only good for the supply chain, but is also beneficial for the overall economy. The economic rationale for this surprising result is rooted in how piracy interacts with double marginalization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the current highly competitive and fast-changing business environment, in which the optimisation of all resources matters, creating an efficient supply chain is crucial. Earlier studies on supply chains have focussed on aligning product/services and information flows while neglecting the financial aspects. Due to this, in recent times, importance has been given to align financial flows with the other components of the supply chain. The interest in supply chain finance rose after the financial crisis when the bank loans declined considerably, as the need for better management and the optimisation of working capital became obvious. This paper reviews the articles on supply chain finance based on three themes—factors, outcomes, and solutions—while at the same time providing directions for future research on supply chain finance. This article is unique, as it investigates the factors affecting supply chains according to the existing literature. It also sheds light on the outcome of the supply chain without limiting the discussion only to the benefits. Further, it addresses the question: what are the solutions constituting supply chain finance?</jats:p>"

However,  a  recent  study  suggests  that  even  though  several  studies  have  been completed to compare DB and DBB, there are few statistically significant comparative results. Comparative analyses of highway projects of the same scope, size, and type could provide the basis to make the argument for the use of either DB or DBB on highway projects. The objective of  this  research  is  to  compare  DB  to  DBB  on  highway projects.  The  basis  of  comparison includes project cost, contract duration, number and type of contract change orders. Projects used for this research were obtained from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The projects were subsequently selected based on project scope,size, and type, and then analysed using quantitative methods. The research found that there is enough evidence to support the use of DB over DBB on highway projects. The findings of this study have significant implications  for  practitioners  and  policymakers  on  highway  projects  and  should  inform decisions on the choice of project delivery method. The main limitation of the research is that the study used only 14 projects due to the difficulty of finding matching projects,and as such the  results  could  not  be  generalized.  However,  the  findings  add  to  the  body  of  research  on criteria for comparing DB to DBB. To enhance understanding of how project scope, size, and type  might  affect  or  be  affected  by  project  delivery  methods,the  research  recommends  the standardization of project types classification for highway projects</jats:p>"

This is happening against the backdrop of significant mergers and acquisitions, as well as the entrance of a bevy of new players. This constantly shifting hyper-heterogeneous media landscape calls for a top-down, comprehensive approach that borrows from best practices in supply chain management. To accomplish this, media must look to other industries and adopt similar approaches to system management and integration. These include adhering to the principles of service-oriented architecture (SOA), and adopting specific technologies to enable this approach, including middleware integration and automation platforms such as enterprise service bus (ESB). This paper describes the supply chain challenges, how adopting SOA and related technologies can solve them, and how this will help meet the challenges that will undoubtedly arise in the coming years.</jats:p>"

This converter is mainly used to feed back the regenerative braking energy to the grid. However, passive filter is desired to mitigate the current and voltage harmonics. Therefore, this paper investigates the possibility to use a seven-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) converter as the recuperating converter without additional filtering. The proposed converter is modeled with MATLAB/Simulink simulation software. It is then simulated with two potential modulation schemes, namely Phase-Shifted PWM (PS-PWM) and Phase-Disposition PWM (PD-PWM). The quality of AC waveforms produced by these two modulation methods is compared and studied. The results show that PS-PWM technique is preferable for this application as it offered a clean AC current waveform with less than 5% harmonic distortion. However, a twenty-one-level CHB was predicted to comply with the 8% voltage harmonic requirement.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

This economic point corresponds to the break-even point for which the marginal benefit of increasing the frequency of the apparent losses’ reduction activities equalizes the marginal cost of their implementation. For this calculation, each apparent loss component, as defined by the International Water Association, has been subdivided into two additional categories. These categories have been established depending on how periodic activities conducted by the water utility to reduce apparent losses—namely water meter replacement and customers’ connection inspections—may affect their magnitude. It has been found that the ELAL is influenced by intervention costs, the degradation rate of the accuracy of water meters and water tariffs. In addition, this work defines a set of performance indicators to benchmark the apparent loss’s performance relative to the minimum achievable and optimum levels of the losses. Finally, two case studies on how the proposed calculation should be applied have been added to the appendices.</jats:p>"

In addition, given that the labor choice for regular and overtime hours is made in succession, the insurance market for overtime needs to open once the insurance market has closed. This segmentation and sequentiality of insurance markets operation is a new result in the literature and a direct consequence of the sequential nature of the overtime labor decision.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The segment of Muslim consumers in Indonesia currently has a high sense of concern for the halal goods and services they consume. This consumer segment, in addition to wanting high-quality products, also demands that the products they consume comply with the rules set by Islamic law. This segment has a tendency to be able to recommend to other parties the products they perceive are halal, they even want to pay a more expensive price if there are no alternative products of the kind they perceive halal. Instead, they can provide incorrect information which results in a viral effect and leads to encouragement to boycott the consumption of goods and services. This study aimed to examine the effect of halal supply chain knowledge on Muslim and non-Muslim consumers on the motivation and purchasing behavior of halal chicken meat. The halal supply chain knowledge tested includes halal feed dimensions, halal slaughtering processes, halal storage and logistics, and halal packaging and logistics. The research was conducted with a quantitative approach through multivariate multiple regression statistical tests. The population in the study was all consumers of halal chicken meat in Klaten City. Sampling using purposive sampling as many as 102 respondents. The final stage of the study found the findings of the four antecedent variables, three supply chain knowledge variables in the form of halal slaughter process, halal storage and logistics and halal labeling packing had a significant influence on purchasing motivation. Halal slaughter process had the highest influence on consumers because the halal perception that is most familiar to them is the slaughter process. One variable had no significant influence in the form of halal feed. In the motivation variable, the findings of this dimension had a significant influence on behavior.===========================================================================================Rantai Pasok dan Perilaku Pembelian Daging Ayam Halal. Segmen konsumen muslim di Indonesia saat ini memiliki rasa kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap kehalalan barang dan jasa yang mereka konsumsi. Segmen konsumen ini selain menginginkan produk yang berkualitas juga menuntut produk yang mereka konsumsi mematuhi aturan-aturan yang ditetapkan oleh syariat Islam. Segmen ini memiliki kecenderungan bisa merekomendasikan ke pihak lain produk yang mereka persepsikan halal, bahkan mereka mau membayar dengan harga yang lebih mahal jika tidak terdapat alternatif produk sejenis yang mereka persepsikan halal. Sebaliknya, mereka dapat memberikan informasi yang tidak benar yang mengakibatkan efek viral dan berujung anjuran memboikot konsumsi barang dan jasa tersebut. Penelitian ini bertujuan menguji pengaruh pengetahuan rantai pasok halal pada konsumen muslim dan non-muslim terhadap motivasi dan perilaku pembelian daging ayam halal. Pengetahuan rantai pasok halal yang diuji meliputi dimensi halal pakan, halal proses penyembelihan, halal penyimpanan dan logistic, serta halal pengepakan dan logistik. Penelitian dilakukan dengan pendekatan kuantitatif melalui uji statistik multivariat regresi berganda. Populasi dalam penelitian adalah seluruh konsumen daging ayam halal di Klaten, Indonesia. Pengambilan sampel menggunakan purposive sampling sebanyak 102 responden. Tahap akhir penelitian diperoleh temuan dari empat variabel anteseden, tiga variabel pengetahuan rantai pasok berupa halal proses penyembelihan, halal penyimpanan dan logistik, serta halal pengepakan labelling berpengaruh signifikan terhadap motivasi pembelian. Halal proses penyembelihan memiliki pengaruh paling tinggi pada konsumen karena persepsi halal yang paling familiar bagi mereka adalah kegiatan proses penyembelihan. Satu variabel tidak berpengaruh signifikan berupa halal pakan. Pada variabel motivasi diperoleh temuan dimensi ini berpengaruh signifikan terhadap perilaku.</jats:p>"

We use the South Korean setting, in which the population is rapidly aging, but where, despite their high educational attainment, women and young adults are still weakly attached to the labor market. We find that engineering majors have an advantage in various outcomes such as likelihood of being in the labor force, being employed, obtaining long-term position, and earnings, while Humanities and Arts/Athletics majors show the worst outcomes. We then conduct a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the impact of the recently proposed policy change to increase the share of engineering majors by 10% starting in 2017. Our calculation suggests that the policy change may have a positive but small impact on labor market outcomes. </jats:p>",

Considering the impact of information asymmetry on the performance of low-carbon supply chain, we therefore analyze a chain system with a single product designer and a single manufacturer. The manufacturer owns information on carbon reduction efficiency, whereas the product designer only knows that the carbon reduction efficiency of the manufacturer is either high or low. To induce the manufacturer to reveal his true private information of carbon-reduction efficiency to the product designer, we devise the pooling and separating equilibrium models to compare the impacts of these two models on supply chain performance, respectively. We find that the high-efficiency manufacturer gets his first-best choice at the equilibrium decision in the separating model, and obtains the information rent in the pooling model. The information rent increases in the efficiency difference between the two emission-reduction types. Additionally, we examine how the probability of the high (or low)-efficiency manufacturer being chosen impacts on both the profits of chain members and carbon-reduction levels. The research provides a reference for companies about how to cooperate with partner who possess private information of carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

There seems to be an association between changes in the supply of jobs in the labor market and shifts in the demand for higher education. Examination of two case studies in the Israeli economy shows a bidirectional interaction between the labor market and the system of higher education. In one case, the growing supply of jobs in the field of computers and engineering was found to result in an increasing demand for academic education in this discipline. In the second case, the growing demand for academic education in law resulted in a flooded labor market in this industry with bad effects for the industry. The public policy formed in Israel to regulate the labor market and the system of higher education is aimed at the short term and makes do with examining actual circumstances retrospectively and attempting to improve them by directing students to various disciplines in order to meet the needs of the labor market or correct its failures. It does not, however, examine future trends and try to identify prospective needs and faults that can be predicted in the present.</jats:p>"

Using the “1 + M + N” complex network model with BA scale-free characteristics, this paper studies the credit risk diffusion in a supply chain finance network, where the credit risk diffusion process is simulated by the SIS epidemic model. We examine the impacts of various key factors, including the general financing ratio, cure time, network structure, and network scale on the credit risk diffusion process. It is found that credit risk diffusion rarely occurs in a network with a low average degree. When the average degree of the network increases, the occurrence of the credit risk diffusion becomes more frequent. Besides, the degree of the initially infected nodes with credit risk does not affect the density of the infected nodes in the steady state, while a higher degree of the cure nodes helps restrain the diffusion of credit risk in the supply chain finance network. Finally, the simulation result based on the supply chain finance network with a core node indicates that the diffusion of the credit risk diffusion in sparse supply chain finance networks with low average degrees is unstable. The results provide better understandings on the credit risk diffusion in supply chain finance networks.</jats:p>"

In this paper, 33 samples were collected from eight cities' drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) along the Yangtze River to analyse the occurrence and removal of ACE and SUC. These two compounds were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry. The limits of detection for ACE and SUC were 1.75 ng/L and 0.03 ng/L, respectively. The results showed that ACE and SUC existed widely in DWTPs along the Yangtze River. The concentration of ACE was 13–320 ng/L and the concentration of SUC was 200–1,592 ng/L. In general, the concentrations of ACE and SUC increased from upstream to downstream but decreased after water treatment procedures at every DWTP. In most DWTPs, a 9–30% removal of ACE and SUC was achieved using traditional chlorination disinfection technology. Ozonation combined with granular activated carbon filtration techniques had a high removal efficiency (63.8% for ACE and 50.2% for SUC).</jats:p>",

However, this algorithm might be stuck in stagnation (the solutions do not enhance anymore) or possibly fall in premature convergence (fall into the local optimum) in searching space. It seems that both issues could be connected to exploitation and exploration. Excessive exploitation leads to premature convergence, while excessive exploration slows down the convergence. In this study, the classical firefly algorithm is modified such that make a balance between exploitation and exploration. The purposed modified algorithm ranks and sorts the initial solutions. Next, the operators named insertion, swap and reversion are utilized to search the neighbourhood of solutions in the second group, in which all these operators are chosen randomly. After that, the acquired solutions combined with the first group and the firefly algorithm finds the new potential solutions. A multi-echelon supply chain network problem is chosen to investigate the decisions associated with the distribution of multiple products that are delivered through multiple distribution centres and retailers and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</jats:p>"

Process-arranged exercises in the Supply Chain, for example, capability, receipt and guarantee administration and back situated exercises, for example, administration of working capital, valorization and capital allocation and request discharge working capital packaged in the Supply Chain. This is acknowledged by a decrease in Days-Sales-Outstanding, which therefore abbreviates the Cash-to-Cash Sequence. Subsequently prompting higher liquidity and expanded investor esteem.

We construct a unique data set by merging the data sets containing characteristics of projects and developers with the data set of new private nonlanded residential sales in Singapore. The study covers the period from January 1995 to March 2009. The supply functions for unit area and floor level are concave with developers’ building experience, and convex with developers’ business age. Developers enjoy marginal cost reductions on the two attributes after they have developed 1,000 or more units; and young developers have steeper “learning curve” than other developers. Old and experienced developers demonstrate less elasticity in their supply functions than young and inexperienced developers. This study provides new empirical evidence on corporate learning curve and knowledge diffusion processes with regard to the supply of real estate attributes.</jats:p>",

More and more consumers tend to buy non-polluting and environmentally friendly green products, and many manufacturers and retailers are beginning to produce or sell green products to enhance their competitive advantage in the market. Considering the green preference attributes of consumers, the altruistic preference is introduced into the supply chain, and we establish four models: two cooperative manufacturers and one retailer are completely self-interested, one retailer has altruistic preference, two cooperative manufacturers have altruistic preferences, and two cooperative manufacturers and one retailer have altruistic preferences. We address the optimal greenness and pricing decisions of supply chain members, and analyze the impact of altruistic preferences on supply chain decision-making and profits. The results show that the altruistic preference coefficient can significantly affect the decision-making and the profits of supply chain members, and when two manufacturers and one retailer consider altruistic preferences, the altruistic preference coefficients adopted by the three parties are in the certain ranges, the supply chain members’ altruistic preference coefficients can increase the whole supply chain profit. Through analysis, in the three cases where the retailer has altruistic preferences, two manufacturers have altruistic preferences, and two manufacturers and one retailer have altruistic preferences, two manufacturers should adopt higher altruistic preference coefficients, and the retailer should adopt a lower altruistic preference coefficient, and the product greenness under the three altruistic preferences is higher than the product greenness when there is no altruistic preference.</jats:p>"

High power consuming current and voltage monitors are indispensable in conducting maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in traditional PV energy wireless sensor nodes. This paper presents a sensor node system based on Neural Network MPPT with cloud method (NNwC) which utilizes information sharing process that is specific to sensor networks. NNwC uses a few sample sensor nodes to collect environmental parameter data such as light intensity (L) and temperature (T) to build the MPPT regression model by Neural Network. Then all other functional sensor nodes implement the model with their environmental parametervalues to conduct MPPT. As a result, the new sensor node system reduces energy consumption as well as the size and cost of the harvester. Then, this paper provides a SPICE simulation to estimate the percentage of power consumption reduced in the new sensor node system and also estimates the percentage of loss in neural network MPPT power generation compared with the perfect MPPT.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Copper pipelines are widely used while designing modern heating systems, water and gas supply of residential buildings and these pipelines have a number of advantages in comparison with steel and plastic pipelines. The main reason for limited use of copper pipes is their cost which is practically twice as much as cost of steel pipes, and four times higher than the coat of polypropylene pipes. Modern design standards in Belarus do not contain specific requirements for calculation of copper pipelines. Therefore hydraulic calculation of heating systems has been considered and analyzed on the basis of norms of Russian Federation. The drawback of all theoretical calculations presented in Russian standards is their abstraction from general laws of fluid and gas mechanics. For this reason theoretical foundations of hydraulic calculations for all pipelines have been considered and expressions have been given for determination of pressure loss due to friction and in local loss. Main flow regimes have been considered on the basis of I. Nikuradze’s experiments in order to determine linear losses and dependences for determination of friction coefficient in laminar, transient and turbulent modes have been presented in the paper. Values of local loss coefficient for main pipeline elements are given for calculation of pressure loss and the paper also shows determination of value z with due account of equipment capacity. An analysis of nomograms presented in Russian norms and researches has been carried out; shortcomings have been revealed and the ways directed on their perfection have been found. Nomograms for calculation of specific pressure losses in heating systems and internal gas supply have been constructed on the basis of natural gas and propane with due account of dependences presented in the paper. Nomograms for finding equivalent length of a single local loss have been constructed for calculation of internal gas supply systems.</jats:p>"

This paper consists of two parts. The first one presents the concepts of local food systems and short supply chains based on the analysis of literature data. The sec- ond part describes the results of a quantitative study on the young consumers’ perception of and willingness to buy local food. Based on an indirect technique, the study was carried out with a group of 155 Polish students. The questionnaire survey demonstrated that when characterizing local food, young consumers invoked the socioeconomic benefits relat- ed to its production. They paid less attention to the specific attributes of food products and to environmental benefits of their production and distribution, which might suggest that the initiatives undertaken to promote those products were poor- ly effective. The research results provide a useful source of knowledge for small local food businesses and policymakers engaged in supporting local food systems (especially public sector bodies and researchers).</jats:p>"

It is established that balanced development of the mineral base of individual regions is complicated by the uneven distribution of studied and forecast mineral resources within the limits of separate territories, as well as the peculiarities of distribution of consumers of mineral raw materials. The main disadvantages in the regional structure of the mineral base were identified and the main directions of their optimization were determined in order to achieve balanced development indicators. The state of national programs development of mineral base of Ukraine for period to 2010 and 2030 was adopted for the balanced development of Ukraine’s mineral base. But this program does not include the issue of the regional nature of the development of a mineral base in the conditions of decentralization, which is provided for by the Concept of reforming local self-government and territorial organization of power in Ukraine.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is one of the highest volume surgeries performed annually. We hypothesized that there is a statistically significant intradepartmental cost variance with supply utilization variability amongst surgeons of different subspecialty. This study sought to describe laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost of care among three subspecialties of surgeons. This retrospective observational cohort study captured 372 laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases performed between June 2015 and June 2016 by 12 surgeons divided into three subspecialties: 2 in bariatric surgery (BS), 5 in acute care surgery (ACS), and 5 in general surgery (GS). The study utilized a third-party software, Surgical Profitability Compass Procedure Cost Manager and Crimson System (SPCMCS) (The Advisory Board Company, Washington, DC), to stratify case volume, supply cost, case duration, case severity level, and patient length of stay intradepartmentally. Statistical methods included the Kruskal-Wallis test. Average composite supply cost per case was $569 and median supply cost per case was $554. The case volume was 133 (BS), 109 (ACS), and 130 (GS). The median intradepartmental total supply cost was $674.5 (BS), $534 (ACS), and $564 (GS) (P&lt;0.005). ACS and GS presented with a higher standard deviation of cost, $98 (ACS) and $110 (GS) versus $26 (BS). The median case duration was 70 min (BS), 107 min (ACS), and 78 min (GS) (P&lt;0.02). The average patient length of stay was 1.15 (BS), 3.10 (ACS), and 1.17 (GS) (P&lt;0.005). Overall, there was a statistically significant difference in median supply cost (highest in BS; lowest in ACS and GS). However, the higher supply costs may be attenuated by decreased operative time and patient length of stay. Strategies to reduce total supply cost per case include mandating exchange of expensive items, standardization of supply sets, increased price transparency, and education to surgeons.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that money supply (M1 and M2) increases the aggregate investment in Pakistan. Other variables such as GDP growth rate and saving also showed a positive and significant association with aggregate investment. However, foreign direct investment remained insignificant.

While a very large lithium battery is a technically capable solution, today’s battery technology is not cost effective; even as wind and solar generation costs become increasingly competitive with fossil fuel alternatives. To explore alternative storage technologies this comparative study utilizes the established hybrid optimization model for multiple energy resources (HOMER) techno-economic modeling tool to perform an application-based high-level comparison of an efficient but costly lithium battery technology solution with a much less efficient but lower-cost thermal-storage with steam-turbine concept; both capable of enabling a 100% wind and solar powered electricity supply for the island. Interestingly, the thermal storage turbine concept is shown to be competitive, at least in principle, with projected cost reductions in lithium battery technologies while also offering a number of distinct practical advantages.</jats:p>"

Waste management is connected to supply chain decisions as it involves waste generation, collection, separation, transportation, processing, and disposal. Accordingly, this article develops a mixed integer linear programming model for the optimal planning of a waste management system in a multi‐echelon supply chain network, which aims to find a trade‐off between supply chain costs, depletion of waste, and efficient use of generated waste while considering the environmental impacts. Various recycling and waste‐to‐energy technologies are used to convert plastic and mixed waste into value‐added products including fuel, electricity, and heat. Although recycling is preferable from an environmental point of view, it is shown that the waste‐to‐energy option is more economically efficient. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 65: e16464 2019</jats:p>",

Ectopic thyroid refers to the presence of thyroid tissue in locations other than the normal in anterior neck region between the second and fourth tracheal cartilages. Abnormal organogenesis of the thyroid gland leads to morphological variations, such as thyroid dysgenesis, hypoplasia, hemiagenesis and agenesis. The ectopic or accessory thyroid being the most common form of thyroid dysgenesis. Here, we are presenting a case with the accessory thyroid tissue with dual blood supply observed during a routine dissection of a female cadaveric body.\nThe accessory thyroid tissue was in the form of an oval structure about 1.5cm x 3 cm was situated in the midline 2cm above the normally located thyroid gland which was supplied by a branch of lingual artery as well as superior thyroid artery. The accessory thyroid tissue could be asymptomatic or it could present with any disorder affecting\nthe main thyroid gland including malignancy. The significance of this case is to show an anatomical variation in the form of developmental defect during the organogenesis of thyroid along with its clinical implications. Thus, this report highlights the importance of knowing and understanding the normal anatomy of thyroid as well as the anatomical variant that could be immensely beneficial while diagnosing thyroid disorders or carrying out surgical procedures involving thyroid.</jats:p>",

Disinfection was undertaken using chlorine dioxide, ozone and a mixed oxidant solution followed by flushing until no disinfectant residual remained. Results showed that coliforms were not persistent on the aircraft plumbing surfaces, and coliforms were not detected after disinfection and flushing with any disinfectant. The one exception was the aerator installed in the lavatory faucet, which was coliform positive after disinfection with ozone and mixed oxidants. These data suggest that the faucet aerators could be a source of coliform contamination that may result in coliform positive samples. Further experiments conducted on disinfection of aerators with glycolic acid and quaternary ammonia (both commonly used by the airlines) showed no detectable coliforms on coliform contaminated aerators after 30 minutes of soaking in the disinfectants.</jats:p>",

(Research purpose) To develop and study a compact energy-saving grain dryer, with a heat supply system based on both a traditional source and a heat transfer fluid heated by a solar collector or a charged heat storage. (Materials and methods) The authors have carried out experimental studies of the drying process of wheat grain to determine the effectiveness of the developed unit for grain drying; the main condition for saving energy has been taken as the minimization of the total unit cost of the evaporation of one kilogram of moisture. (Results and discussion) The authors have conducted a two-factor experiment to determine the main optimal parameters affecting the grain drying process - the speed of grain movement in the conductive chamber and the temperature of the heating surface of its casing based on the calculated mathematical model. In the first variant, the drying process was carried out only by the conductive method using the heat from a traditional energy source. In the second variant, the drying was carried out by successive use of conductive and convective methods, and the grain was cooled using both thermal energy received from a traditional source and solar radiation heat along with the heat of the spent heat carrier. (Conclusions) The study has revealed that the most effective option in terms of saving thermal energy is grain drying with the consistent use of conductive and convective drying methods followed by grain cooling. The heat supply of the drying unit was partially carried out by using the heat of solar radiation and the heat obtained from the spent coolant recycling. In this optimal variant, the heat consumption for evaporation of one kilogram of moisture from the grain is minimal and amounts to 1.53-2.50 MJ per kilogram with a grain movement speed of in the dryer of 0.007-0.011 m per second and a heating surface temperature of 85-91 degrees Celsius.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The regenerative activity of adult stem cells carries a high risk of cancer, particularly in highly renewable tissues. To guarantee that the correct organ size is attained and to cope with the continual risk of cancer, developing tissues often use programmed cell death (PCD) as an adaptive mechanism to cull excess and abnormal cells. Members of the family of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) inhibit caspases and cell death and are often overexpressed in cancer. Here, we show that Diap1 is expressed in committed progenitor (enteroblast) cells in the adult Drosophila intestine. Blocking endogenous caspases uncovered that more than half of enteroblasts produced by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are actively eliminated by apoptosis in the physiological intestine and also led to tumorigenesis. We find that antagonistic interplay between the Notch and EGFR signaling on Diap1 regulation governs the enteroblast cell death or survival decision via the conserved Klumpfuss/WT1-Lozenge/RUNX axis, which also regulates of differentiation plasticity of enteroblasts. These data provide new insights into how apoptosis drives adult tissue renewal and protection against tumors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increased size and complexity of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, supply-chain management has become a challenging process due to involvements of the remote location of the project site and the multiple stakeholders. The transparency and traceability of the supply-chain are critical as any surpluses or shortages of materials will put the project at risk. Currently, limited research has been conducted on LNG projects considering the total supply-chain perspective, which refers to all stages of materials tracking in off-site manufacturing, transportation, and site logistics. The purpose of this research is to propose a framework of a coordinated approach for supply-chain tracking in the LNG industry. Two focus group studies were organized to develop the proposed framework: One for LNG construction supply chain process development, and another for alternative tracking technologies selection. In addition, two experiments, namely off-site fabrication tracking and site logistics tracking, were conducted in a field to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework. Technology limitations were also discussed in terms of field implementation.</jats:p>"

Remarkably, increased rates of photosynthesis and growth also occur in these plants. The industry strategy is to perform field trials overseas to establish the value proposition for New Zealand. Here, results are presented from preliminary growth-chamber pot trials which reveal the influence of the HME technology on perennial ryegrass growth under different levels of N, H2O and CO2 supply. HME increased perennial ryegrass growth under high N supply, limiting and non-limiting H2O supply, and with ambient and elevated CO2 supply. Possible HME growth mechanisms and their practical implications are discussed. Progress on the 2017 field trial in the USA using offspring from the HME crossing programme is also discussed.</jats:p>"

However, collateral arterial supply to the uterus has been described, predominantly in the context of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for fibroid treatment. This may lead to incomplete embolization, which can impact clinical outcomes. Therefore, identification of potential collateral supply to the uterus is essential for achieving optimal clinical results. The authors report three cases of collateral uterine arterial supply from the ovarian and round ligament arteries in the setting of uterine arteriovenous fistula (uAVF), postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and symptomatic fibroids. Aortography from the level of the renal arteries was performed for initial evaluation of uterine arterial supply in all patients and identified hypertrophied, tortuous ovarian artery collaterals. Selective angiography of the external iliac artery was required to identify round ligament collateral uterine supply. Three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CT) was also used to visualize vascular distribution of bilateral uterine arteries and an ovarian collateral feeding a uAVF. In regard to outcomes, identification of collateral uterine arterial supply allowed for single-session complete embolization in fibroid patients with collateralized round ligament or ovarian arteries and in the PPH patient in disseminated intravascular coagulation with predominantly ovarian artery supply to the uterus. Identification of collateral uterine arterial supply facilitated technical success in all patients. In the setting of various uterine pathologies, identification of collateral uterine arterial supply is essential to optimize clinical success of UAE.</jats:p>",

A 67-year-old woman presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed two saccular aneurysms on the peripheral PICA, which formed an abnormal arteriovenous shunt adjacent to the transverse sinus. The shunt was also fed by the ipsilateral superior cerebellar and contralateral posterior meningeal arteries. The proximal aneurysm was larger and deep seated while the distal aneurysm was smaller and located superficially. The patient underwent coil embolization of the proximal aneurysm followed by microsurgical trap of the distal aneurysm and resection of the arteriovenous shunt lying superficially in the cerebellar hemisphere. The shunt was histologically verified as AVM. Staged approach with coil embolization and open microsurgery can be a treatment option for multiple PICA aneurysms associated with an AVM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is one of the more suitable energy storage technologies to provide bulk storage of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind. Since the main limiting factors to the expansion of this mature technology are environmental and financial concerns, the use of an existing reservoir can help mitigate both types of impacts. In addition, the high number of reservoirs for municipal and irrigation supply in many areas of the world makes the idea of using PHS as a relatively diffuse, open-market, technology for RES management attractive. These arguments in favor of PHS must, however, be convincing for investors and regulators from an economic standpoint. To this end, this paper presents a methodological tool to screen the feasibility of a PHS facility around an existing reservoir based on the principles of cost–benefit analysis, calibrated with data from Sicily, Italy. Each potential plant is characterized by two locational and two plant-specific parameters. Costs and benefits are assessed through a simulation model of the storage–release process on an hourly basis. Costs include both investment, and operation and maintenance expenditures, while the benefits considered include the opportunity cost of the current energy mix substituted by the stored energy, and the avoided CO2 emissions. The evaluation exercise is carried out parametrically, i.e., looking at a large number of combinations of the four parameters, in order to explore a wide range of possible plant configurations and to identify optimal ones under different locational conditions. A sensitivity analysis performed on models’ parameters points out the sensitivity of results to benefit, rather than cost-related, input parameters, such as the efficiency of the generating and pumping system and the opportunity cost of energy.</jats:p>"

Low levels of both European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allowance prices and wholesale power prices fuelled concerns over drivers for decarbonisation and long-term generation adequacy. Whilst some countries have introduced capacity remuneration mechanisms to ensure generation adequacy, reforming the EU ETS has proven to be difficult. This paper proposes a unilateral approach by a state introducing a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levy that internalises and prices CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at a national level. The suggested climate and supply market model thereby incentivises and rewards production from CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-neutral sources during times when it does not cover the targeted share of production. Prior to describing the model in detail, this paper discusses the theoretical policy steering background and the problems associated with current energy policies. For a broader picture, other CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> taxation models are briefly presented. This is followed by a discussion on the legal aspects of the model, its compatibility with international as well as EU law. The model is explored further by using Switzerland as an example, showing that a cross-sector carbon price can be implemented at acceptable costs for consumers. Last but not least, the paper examines varieties of the model and the adaption potential for European countries.</jats:p>"

The assessment criteria of the spare parts set sufficiency have been chosen based on the condition of the sufficient system operation reliability which is based on the estimates of the failure emergence probability during the period of regular element removals. The demand for spare parts and materials is of random nature and it is considered as a stable process which is described by the Poisson’s distribution. The calculation principle comes down to determining the possibility of the fact that all the service channels and waiting spaces in the mechanism will be filled in accordance with the queuing theory. The technique for spare parts amount selection when operating gas supply systems has been developed eventually.</jats:p>"

A study was conducted to access the supply chain, present marketing situation of rice subsector in Dang district during May-September 2017. For this study, rice traders were grouped into 5 categories Producers, seed suppliers, millers &amp; traders, Wholesalers, and retailers. For the study, 105 respondents were selected which includes 75 rice producers, 5 seed suppliers, 5 millers &amp; traders, 5 wholesalers and 15 retailers. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) and Excel were used for data entry and analysis. The findings of the study revealed that about 94.70% of paddy farmers used improved seeds and only 5.30% farmers used hybrid seeds belongs to grain producers for only home consumption. Cooperatives were the major source of seed supplier for 90.90% of seed producers and 45.45% of marketed surplus grain producers and 57.14% of grain producers for only home consumption retained their own seeds for cultivation. The average benefit-cost (B: C) ratio of the paddy farmers was found to be 1.14:1 in the study area. Majority of the paddy selling farmers 87.88% sold their produce from the house and remaining 12.12% sold in the market. The market margin was higher in seeds supply chain NRs 27 per Kg and least was in grains supply chain NRs 25 per Kg. Similarly, producer share was higher in seeds supply chain (50.90%) and least was in grains supply chain, 44.44 percent.&#x0D;\nInt. J. Appl. Sci. Biotechnol. Vol 6(4): 319-326</jats:p>"

Aim: The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic summary and evaluation of the state of research internationally regarding the effects of a reduction in the supply of games of chance on the prevalence of gambling involvement and disordered gambling behavior in the population. Method: A systematic search was made of the databases PsycINFO, Psyindex, Cinahl, Web of Science and Medline using relevant search terms. Results: In total, eight studies were identified that met the criteria for inclusion. The few findings that exist, which are to some extent inconsistent, show that in the period following reduction in supply, there is a decline in participation, in the number of frequent gamblers, in demand for therapy and in the number of problem gamblers. In parallel to this, a few individual studies showed an increase in frequency of participation in other forms of gambling. Conclusions: Possible reasons for the incomplete and inconsistent pattern of findings are discussed and attention is drawn to the limitations of the review. Ultimately, effective prevention should encompass coordinated, broadly based and sustained efforts that cover aspects of both behavioral and situational prevention. </jats:p>",

Results− KPIs are defined, data is collected and KPI’s for each DCs are presented. The DEA model is run and the relative efficiencies for each DCs are determined. A frontier analysis is made and DCs that limit or reduce the performance of the system were analyzed to find options for improving the system.\r\nConclusions: Reverse logistics, brings numerous advantages for companies. The analysis of the indicators allows logistics managers involved to make relevant decisions for higher performance. The DEA model identifies which DCs have a relative superior and inferior performance, making it easier to make informed decisions to change, increase or decrease resources, and activities or apply best practices that optimize the performance of the network.</jats:p>"

The list of ecological problems has recently enlarged by another one: environment pollution, and first of all, of surface water basins, by so-called «emerging contaminants». Based on the findings of research centers in RF, European countries and in the USA an independent class of human-environment pollutants of anthropogenic origin named «Pharmpollutants», was identified. Discussion. It can be related to the growing scale of world pharmaceutical production output (average annual growth about 4.6 %), to the development of up-to-date technologies in animal and poultry breeding, as well as to increased use of pharmaceuticals among the population. Systematization and analysis of data on the effect of unsanctioned and uncontrolled medical product disposal on quality of surface sources of drinking water supply, development of recommendations for health risk minimization among population exposed to potential intake of pharmaceutical traces contained in surface water basins and drinking water, based on available findings, and defining priority areas for the development of statutory-regulatory and procedural documents, - were the objectives of our study. Development of the recommendations can improve regulatory and procedural base and will contribute to the development of specific measures to prevent the transfer of medicinal products into the environment. Conclusion. National and foreign research findings on the topic of interest are reviewed, and potential routes of pharmaceuticals transfer into environmental objects are described. The scope of problems is outlined, ways of coping with problems of water reservoir pollution by pharmpollutants and health risk minimization for population exposed to pharmaceuticals present in drinking water, are suggested; recommendations for minimization of population health risks caused by environmental pharmaceuticals have been prepared.</jats:p>"

A model for future applications and empirical analyzes in the health service area is proposed. In the current hospital scenario, the systems are characterized by the individualistic attention of the closed business models, hampering the promotion of the business models, the innovation, and the sustainable transitions as the sustainable supply chain (SSC) enablers. The survey evaluates the private hospital chain in Brazil. The model was evaluated by seven specialists indicated by the main private Brazilian hospitals that are accredited by Joint Commission International and Public Ministry. The discussion presented seeks to advance the observation and the understanding of the relationships among the business models, the innovation, the sustainable transitions, and the sustainable supply chains in the health socioeconomic context through the lens of the service provider, without exhausting these themes separately. The main results are the issues related to the difficulties of sustainable transition to promote the SSC in the hospital context, showing the elements into which the hospitals are inserted and helping to close the gap in the literature on the subject. Sustainable transitions, along with the SSC, present themselves as rich and challenging themes, but are beneficial for conducting dialogues between approaches.</jats:p>"

It is difficult to remove it using traditional processes. The reduction of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) has proved to be an effective method to remove bromate in water. In this study, we designed and prepared a new kind of nanocomposite by loading nZVI into ordered mesoporous silica materials (nZVI/MCM-41), which avoided nZVI oxide and increased adsorption at the same time. The removal efficiencies of bromate by MCM-41, nZVI, and nZVI/MCM-41 were evaluated respectively. The result indicated that nZVI/MCM-41 showed the highest removal efficiency for bromate at pH 6.5, with an appropriate dose of 25 mg when initial bromate concentration was 0.2 mg/L. In the removal process, adsorption and reduction exist at the same time and reduction was the leading role. Kinetic studies showed that the removal of bromate by nZVI/MCM-41 followed pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics. Finally, bromine mass balance demonstrated that bromide was the only product for bromate reduction, suggesting that bromate was ﬁrst adsorbed onto nZVI/MCM-41 and reduced to innocuous bromide by nZVI subsequently.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of shale gas resources is subject to technical challenges and markedly affected by volatile markets that can undermine the development of new projects. Consequently, stakeholders can greatly benefit from decision‐making support tools that integrate the complexity of the system along with the uncertainties inherent to the problem. Accordingly, a general methodology is proposed in this work for the evaluation of integrated shale gas and water supply chains under uncertainty. First, key parametric uncertainties are identified from a candidate pool via a global sensitivity analysis based on a deterministic optimization model. Then, a two‐stage stochastic model is developed considering only the key uncertain parameters in the problem. Moreover, the merits of modeling uncertainty and implementing the stochastic solution approach are evaluated using the expected value of perfect information and the value of the stochastic solution metrics. Furthermore, the conditional value‐at‐risk approach was implemented to evaluate different risk‐aversion levels and the corresponding impacts on the shale gas development plan. The proposed methodology is illustrated through two real‐world case studies involving six and eight potential well‐pad locations and two options of well‐pad layouts. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 65: 924–936, 2019</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article aims to leverage the big data in shale gas industry for better decision making in optimal design and operations of shale gas supply chains under uncertainty. We propose a two‐stage distributionally robust optimization model, where uncertainties associated with both the upstream shale well estimated ultimate recovery and downstream market demand are simultaneously considered. In this model, decisions are classified into first‐stage design decisions, which are related to drilling schedule, pipeline installment, and processing plant construction, as well as second‐stage operational decisions associated with shale gas production, processing, transportation, and distribution. A data‐driven approach is applied to construct the ambiguity set based on principal component analysis and first‐order deviation functions. By taking advantage of affine decision rules, a tractable mixed‐integer linear programming formulation can be obtained. The applicability of the proposed modeling framework is demonstrated through a small‐scale illustrative example and a case study of Marcellus shale gas supply chain. Comparisons with alternative optimization models, including the deterministic and stochastic programming counterparts, are investigated as well. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 65: 947–963, 2019</jats:p>",

VSM is used as an instrument to enhance comparative advantage in wildly industries. VSM in chili pepper involves operation system such as 6S, Volkswagen production system, visual workplace, quick changeover system, and Hiejunka Kanban system.

The method includes a comprehensive assessment of the current literature body, including scholarly journals, conference proceedings, and reliable web sources to obtain pertinent data and insights. The significance of incorporating uncertainty into decision-making procedures, the adaptability of stochastic optimization models for diverse supply chain functions, and their function in augmenting supply chain resilience via proactive risk mitigation and sound decision-making are among the principal discoveries. The policy implications indicate that investments in data analytics capabilities, capacity building, training programs, and regulatory frameworks are required to facilitate the implementation of stochastic optimization models in supply chain management.

In this sense, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for the purposes of this study, as it quantifies the wake of environmental impacts associated to the production and supply chain from its inputs and outputs of the product system. Therefore, the impact categories studied were carbon, energetic, and water footprints. The cultivation phase led to global contributions between 61% and 67% in magnitude for energy and carbon footprints, respectively; meanwhile, the coffee benefit process was the phase with the most contributions to the water footprint (54%). The residual biomass from the product system used as the energy supply within the coffee drying sub-phase represented energy savings of around 41% in comparison to the use of conventional fossil fuels, thus reducing the global impact associated to the system’s product.</jats:p>"

This study has developed and empirically tested the relationship between IoT capabilities, energy consumption behavior (ECB), supply chain integration, green training (GT), and supply chain practices. Such a multidisciplinary relationship has not previously been established in the literature. The proposed study can fulfill the literature gap and opens new horizons for interdisciplinary research. Data used in this study are collected through offline and online survey methods. A total number of 250 out of 400 respondents participated in the survey. Data has been analyzed through partial least square—structure equation modeling (PLS—SEM) technique. The results of this study empirically test the developed model. IoT has a positive effect on supplier integration (SI), and customer integration (CI). Furthermore, SI and CI have a mediating role between IoT and GSCP, and GT has a positive impact on GSCP. It is concluded that the implementation of IoT can integrate CI and SI to increase GSCP. GT and ECB can ultimately improve GSCP. Additionally, the use of technology and GT can motivate employees to save energy and protect the environment to increase GSCP.</jats:p>"

Indeed, this paper focuses on the supply side approach to bridge the research gap in understanding the financing lacuna, which has often been overlooked due to the tendency to analyse financing gap from the demand side only. The paper discusses the nature of the decision-making process from interviews with bank loan officers utilising verbal protocol analysis to give insights into the decision making of bank loan officers in the processing of bank funding proposals. To achieve the objective of the study, we used a qualitative research approach characterised by the collection of information through semi-structured interviews with loan officers responsible for small and mediumsized enterprises of four (4) commercial banks in Cameroon. The information resulting from the transcription of interviews was analysed using content analysis. The result derived from the analysis revealed that confidence is the paramount issue urging commercial banks to grant loans to SMEs. Indeed, from existing embedded relationship overtime, commercial banks obtain valuable information about the behaviours of SMEs. Based on this information a certain degree of confidence and trust emerges causing banks to supply loans to SMEs. From the aforementioned analysis, we formulate: “The theory of confidence lending decisions of commercial banks.”</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measuring carbon emissions is an essential step in taking required action to fight global warming. This research presents a computational method for measuring transport related carbon emissions in a healthcare supply network. The network configuration significantly impacts carbon emissions. First, a multi-objective mathematical programing model is developed for designing a healthcare supply network in the form of a two-graph location routing problem under demand and fuel consumption uncertainty. Objective functions are minimizing total cost and minimizing total fuel consumption. In the presented model, the demand of each customer must be completely satisfied in each time period, and backlog is not permitted. The number and capacity of vehicles are determined, and vehicles are heterogeneous. Furthermore, fuel consumption depends on traveling distance, vehicle and road conditions, and the load of a vehicle. The centroid method is applied to face demand uncertainty. Next, a multi-objective non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (M-NRGA) is proposed to solve the model. Then, a Monte Carlo based approach is presented for measuring transport-related carbon emissions based on fuel consumption in supply network. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the case of a healthcare supply network in the Fars province in Iran. The obtained results illustrate that the proposed approach is a practical tool in designing healthcare supply networks and measuring transport-related carbon emissions in the network.</jats:p>"

So the PV plant can participate in frequency regulation of the system. Through simulation analysis in power systems computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including DC (EMTDC), PV plant realises the function of frequency regulation when load changes, so the variation of system frequency can be reduced and the frequency stability of power system can be improved, and the effectiveness of the strategy is verified.</jats:p>",

Interdependency between schematic and design-topological aspects of precision power supply temperature assurance is shown. In theoretical part of the paper, the concept of electronic component local group arranged on isothermal line of the supporting structure plane is introduced. The local group characteristics and conditions for ensuring topological thermocompensation are formulated. The authors propose the solution for two basic applied problems that provides temperature stabilization of electronic devices output parameters by topological temperature compensation using regression analysis. The experimental part of the paper provides the analysis of the output voltage temperature stability for two design versions which differ by availability of topological thermocompensation. The reason of foreign element base use for the purposes of the experimental part of the study is explained. It is shown that the global mathematical model for providing topological thermocompensation for a design option with improved temperature stability is the temperature error equation. A comparative analysis of the two construction options shows 8 % improvement of output voltage temperature stability due to topological thermocompensation. The obtained result may prove to be satisfactory under technical assignment for the use of a different element base and / or other methods of thermal stabilization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the urban rail transit has a great development in many cities of China. It is important to keep the DC transit grid strong and the power transmitted/power transmission high quality. During the process of rail operation, braking energy leads to a wide range of load oscillation for the traction and city grid, which cannot be absorbed inside the rail transit system. In this study, a novel architecture of urban rail transit power supply based on power electronics transformer braking energy feedback is put forward. Based on the circle grid, the topology adds an inverter to LLC series resonant converter to carry the power from 1500 V DC traction grid to 1180 V AC. Analysis together with simulation on the topology and control strategy is made on the basis of MATLAB/Simulink. Process of braking energy feedback and transmission of energy are illustrated with simulation. By paralleling the three‐phase H bridge and braking energy feedback device, double direction of the power flow is ensured. As a consequence, the power quality increases and harmonics reduce. The energy can be used more efficiently to achieve better effects on energy conservation.</jats:p>",

Then we examine the model with game theory. The results have shown that fairness and risk aversion change the optimal pricing strategy, which affects the expected profits of retailers and manufacturers. The impacts of two (relatively irrational) behavioral factors on the wholesale and retail prices of new products, the recycle price and recycle transfer price of the waste products, are not the same. For new products, the wholesale price is most affected by behavioral factors and the sales price scores second. For waste recycling products, the transfer price is most affected by behavioral factors and the recycle price scores second. When considering fairness and risk aversion in retail, fairness concern is good for both manufacturers and retailers. This innovative pricing strategy model adds implications for sustainability in supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Development of forward osmosis (FO) membranes became one of the alternative methods for drinking water supply in an emergency. In this research, drinking water bags based on FO membrane  have been developed using chitosan as the basic material of membrane. The chitosan membrane used for the manufacture of drinking water bags has a thickness of 0.043 mm, 30.3% porosity, tensile strength 28.83 kgf / mm2, swelling degree 43.5% and elongation of 7.16%. Drinking water bags are made with a combination of Polypropylene Plastic (PP) and aluminum foil with FO membrane inside. This drinking water bag can be applied for brackish water purification to be energy drinking water as one of the solutions for the drinking water supply in emergencies. FO process testing is done by using variation of sugar solution as the draw solution, that are glucose, fructose, sucrose and mixture. The concentration of applied draw solution is 1, 2 and 3M within 1 hour treatment. The highest water flux was obtained in 3M sucrose solution with a flux value of 5.25 L/m2hour. The results of drinking water quality parameters  analysis  in the form of pH, Total Dissolve Solid (TDS), salinity, conductivity, heavy metals and Escherichia coli (E. coli) contents showed that the FO water produc meets drinking water quality standards based on  Indonesian government regulation of drinking water quality. FO-membrane-based drinking water bags are potentially used as an alternative solution for the energy drinking water supply in an emergency.</jats:p>"

In Russia development of high-speed railway service is associated with the solution of a number of problems, including infrastructure. Authors propose to use earth connection of the railway catenary with the help of an artificial earthing switch on currently designed high-speed line Moscow—Kazan for 2×25 kV power supply system. Taking into account requirements for electrical safety conditions for maintenance of the track and earthed catenary supports, paper justifies method for calculating allowable voltages of rail—earth points and supports of catenary. Methods takes into account structural features of ballastless track superstructure used for high-speed lines. It is estimated that the voltages admissible under the electrical safety conditions are random in nature and distributed logarithmically normal. When calculating probability of safe operation, one should take into account random nature of both permissible stresses and those actually occurring on the track. It is estimated that the probability of safe operation in traction networks of sections with ballastless track superstructure does not exceed a similar value in electrified sections with the conventional structure of a ballast prism. Feasibility of using a 2×25 kV earth system using an artificial earth connection is confirmed, recommendations on its use are given. Authors substantiate allowable values of the rail—earth voltage and catenary supports, which practically exclude the occurrence of hazardous situations for personnel maintaining the track in sections with ballastless track superstructure.</jats:p>"

Stall feeding of buffalo is common in Chitwan with occasional grazing. This raises questions about status of nutrients supplied to maintain productivity as feed resources varied in forest and crop land according to the season. A study was carried out in Chitwan from April 2015 to March 2016 to find out the status of nutrient supply in relation to the feeding system of buffalo. Total fifteen farms were selected from three villages, the amount of feedstuff fed to the animals was measured every month and the nutrient contents of the feed were analyzed. The mean concentrations of DM, CP, TDN, Ca and P were 641g/kg, 75.0 g/kg, 462 g/kg, 4.9 g/kg and 4.2 g/kg. A significant difference of CP contents among the villages was observed (72.0 g/kg, 70.7 g/kg and 81.2 g/kg (P&lt;0.01), and the highest content of CP, TDN, Ca and P were found in July (P&lt;0.05)). The study showed variation in nutrient supplied, irrespective of the status and condition of buffalo in the farms which need to be considered to maintain productivity of the animals.</jats:p>"

The authors considered the ingenious technical solutions aimed at providing the necessary quality power supply for the first category receivers in the emergency operation modes of the aircraft power supply systems for the safe completion of flight and landing. The research analysis and generalization of data on the technical characteristics of units and devices developed by the world's leading manufacturers of aviation equipment and used as emergency sources of electrical power on board modern civil aviation aircraft has been completed. The advantages and disadvantages of each technical solution are determined, as well as limitations to the area of their application are formed. The analysis of perspective emergency sources of the electric power including those, which previously were not applied in aviation because of their insufficient technical perfection, for example, hydrogen electrochemical generators is carried out. Based on the performed analysis, a solution which allows improving the operating modes of the electrical batteries is proposed. The offered solution makes it possible to increase the reliability and durability of electrical batteries, as well as the power supply duration of the first category receivers from them.</jats:p>"

Because these systems are built for a minimal duration of 30 years, it is relevant to assess the availability of wood resources according to the potential impacts of global warming on five tree species mainly used in such a supply chain. The assessment of the potential spatial distribution of the suitable areas of these trees in 2050, by using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) RCP6.0 scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway), shows an average decrease of 22% of the plots in comparison with the current situation. The results also point out that mountain areas would maintain a high probability of the development of four tree species. The assessment of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) underlines a potential decrease for 93% of the plots in 2050, and an increase of this parameter in mountain areas. According to these assumptions, the proposed ecosystem based methodology can be considered as a prospective approach to support stakeholders’ decisions for the development of the wood energy supply chain.</jats:p>"

On the basis of one-dimensional equation of adiabatic gas frictional flow in cylindrical pipe, the problem of determination of maximum achievable power by nonautonomous pneumatic drive at fixed hydraulic properties of supply system has been solved. The obtained dependences make it possible to calculate minimum allowed pipeline diameter of supply system providing preset maximum power of pneumatic drive. It is proved that the coefficient of total pressure conservation corresponding to maximum drive power is precisely determined by available pressure drop and does not depend on hydraulic properties of the system, and in order to achieve maximum drive power, strictly determined portion of available flow energy should be consumed for overcoming of the system hydraulic resistance not depending of reduced pipeline length.Â </jats:p>"

Typical challenges faced by SAFSC development are unfair pricing of produce, yield uncertainty caused by adverse weather, as well as conflict and cooperation between stakeholders and sustainable activities of SAFSC. In this paper, we establish a two-echelon decision-making model consisting of a loss-averse farmer and a loss-neutral company. A guaranteed price mechanism is contrived to mitigate the effects of uncertain procurement price on the farmers’ profit. It is found that this mechanism can improve the sustainable investment level but fails to reach the optimal level of the SAFSC system. Thus, a risk–reward contract taking into account the weather index (temperature) and the degree of loss aversion is designed. Results show that this contract can settle the distortion of the sustainable investment level and effectively motivate farmers to participate in the sustainable agricultural practice. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the contract parameters under which both the company and the farmer are motivated to exert efforts to stand by sustainable agricultural practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study was to design a small-scale photovoltaic system to support electricity supply to a rural village in the Republic of Congo. A simple impedance-matching system and an innovative panel-tilting system were implemented as adaptive technologies to increase the power output of the system and reduce its capital and running costs. The experimentally obtained results showed that the daily energy output of a four-panel, 400 W photovoltaic system could be increased by 15% through a series parallel impedance match configuration, and by 36% from 3.3 kWh per day to approximately 4.5 kWh per day through implementing an automated panel tilting system with always normal incidence of solar irradiation on the panels in an equatorial environment. Implementing these technologies accordingly reduced the cost of energy supplied by the same percentages, with an eventual electricity cost of about ZAR 3.60 per kWhr, as calculated over an operation time of ten years, and an initial capital outlay of ZAR 37 per watt. These costs are much lower than for installing power grid lines to the village, and the technology also ensures complete autonomy of power supply to the community. The study also identified the potential to generate many new business and job opportunities locally in this community, as well as in the rest of Africa. </jats:p>"

A Cockcroft-Walton (C-W) circuit is employed to generate DC high-voltage from AC 100 V plug power for the compact, easy handling and high safety use in the hilly and mountainous area. The C-W circuit is connected to high-voltage coaxial cable which works for high-voltage transmission and for charging up as energy storage capacitor. The output voltage is around 50 kV with several microseconds pulse width. The dimension and weight of the developed power supply are 0.4 × 0.47 × 1 m3 and 8.1 kg, respectively. The effect of the high-voltage stimulation on enhancement of fruiting body formation is evaluated in cultivating L. edodes and Lyophyllum deeastes Sing. mushrooms using the developed compact high-voltage power supply. The conventional Marx generator is also used for comparison in effect of high-voltage stimulation for fruiting body formation. L. edodes is cultivated with hosting to natural logs and the pulsed high voltage is applied to the cultivated natural logs. The substrate for Lyophyllum deeastes Sing. cultivation consists of sawdust. The results show that the fruiting body formation of mushrooms of L. edodes for four cultivation seasons and that of Lyophyllum deeastes Sing. for two seasons both increase approximately 1.3 times higher than control group in terms of the total weight. Although the input energy per a pulse is difference with the generators, the improvement of the fruit body yield mainly depends on the total input energy into the log. The effect for promotion on fruiting body formation by the developed compact high-voltage power supply is almost same that by the conventional Marx generator.</jats:p>"

Photography was used in an observational study conducted among five separate retail market chains all located in this city. In which ways are the applications of the developed food safety labelling techniques among three separate retail food markets similar and dissimilar being accounted for? The results show that the packaging and labelling in Big C, Aeon Citimart, and Giant using the symbols of food safety build trust for their customers. The Big C indicates guidelines for VietGAP and green labelling. Aeon Citimart indicates the name of the good, expiration date and instructions for use as well as guidelines for the government factor (VietGAP) to the food safety practices in the Vietnamese food retail sector.</jats:p>",

Within this scope, citrus waste management represents a major issue for citrus processors. However, it also represents a potentially unexploited resource for rural sustainable development. This study focuses on analyzing the current management of citrus waste in South Italy, and on identifying the determinants and barriers that may affect an entrepreneur’s choice in the destination of citrus waste. This study investigates the preferences of citrus processors regarding the contract characteristics necessary to take part in a co-investment scheme. Both analyses are preliminary steps in designing an innovative and sustainable citrus by-product supply chain. Results show that the distance between the citrus processors and the citrus by-products plant is one of the main criteria for choosing alternative valorization pathways. Moreover, guaranteed capital, a short duration of the contract, and reduced risk are contract scheme characteristics that improve entrepreneurs’ willingness to co-invest in the development of a citrus waste multifunctional plant. The overall applied approach can be extended to other contexts for designing new and innovative by-product supply chains, thereby enhancing the implementation of bioeconomy strategies.</jats:p>"

We consider a wholesale-price contract and a shortage penalty contract as a coordination mechanisms in an inventory replenishment system. The demand process is described by a Brownian motion with drift, and this inventory model can be formulated as an impulse control problem with uncertain replenishment quantities. We show that under some assumptions, there exist optimal ordering and production policies. We also provide some numerical examples to investigate the effect of these coordination mechanisms on the expected costs and the optimal policies. The computational experiments reveal that (i) the production quantity in decentralized case is higher than that in the centralized case, (ii) the centralized approach strategy results in the lower joint total cost as compared with independent decision approaches, and (iii) the shortage penalty contract has a beneficial effect on the total cost to the entire supply chain in decentralized system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we consider the decision-making and coordination mechanism of a seasonal product supply chain channel over a period consisting of a low season and a high season, where the price of the final product is strictly regulated, and the raw material is subject to a price cap regulation during the high season. The optimal decisions and profits under decentralized and centralized cases are derived for the low season and the high season. Our research indicates that, under the double price regulation, the manufacturer’s raw material order in the channel usually is not completely fulfilled during the high season and the order during the low season is usually small. Based on the results, we propose a mutual subsidy mechanism, in order to encourage the supplier to supply more raw material during the high season and to encourage the manufacturer to order more raw material during the low season.The theoretical results indicate that the mutual subsidy mechanism can effectively coordinate the seasonal product supply chain channel under the double price regulation, which is further verified by a numerical example. Moreover, the negotiation skills of the supplier and the manufacturer are also considered under the mutual subsidy mechanism, so that the spillover profit can be allocated on a win–win basis for both sides. </jats:p>",

The initial set of factors was identified in the literature, namely, information quality and content, performance metrics, and information technologies. The construct was then tested empirically using the sample of 200 Polish companies. Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) were based on a structured questionnaire, then, data exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. The conducted EFA determined four main factors for information management and integration in the supply chain that should be considered, namely, information characteristics, ICT used in information management, the scope of information and shared performance metrics. Results confirmed the importance of some of the factors related to information management in the supply chain, however having a different set of variables than indicated in the literature. Additionally, research introduced new factors, namely, information characteristics and the scope of shared information, instead of information quality and information content. Moreover, findings suggested that the key role in SC information integration was related to established technologies, focused on transport, customer, and ERP management, while emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and data mining were not of the top importance among the surveyed companies.</jats:p>",

The supply of vegetables in the EU has decreased since 2005 while that of fruits, pulses and sugar &amp; sweeteners, as well as energy and fat have not changed significantly. The 313 voluntary commitments of Platform members, aimed at promoting healthier food choices and life styles in the region do not seem to have had a significant impact on food supply at population level. Firmer policy measures, incl. fiscal regulations are needed to support these voluntary actions. Sustainability issues should be included in the health-oriented initiatives as food choices contribute not only to the health of individuals but also of the environment as a whole.</jats:p>"

These problem/target groups were created after an analysis of SFSCs by involvement of several farmer’s organization and consumers in the Western Transdanubia region.

The parallel implementation of the method of characteristics (MOC) on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips is a promising approach for accelerating the simulations, because GPU has a great parallelization ability for massive but simple computations, and the explicit and local features of MOC meet the features of GPU quite well. In this paper, we propose and verify a GPU implementation of MOC on a single chip for more efficient simulations of hydraulic transients. Details of GPU-MOC parallel strategies are introduced, and the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by simulating the benchmark single pipe water hammer problem. The transient processes of a large scale water distribution system and a long-distance water transmission system are simulated to investigate the computing capability of the proposed method. The results show that GPU-MOC method can achieve significant performance gains, and the speedup ratios are up to hundreds compared to the traditional method. This preliminary work demonstrates that GPU-MOC parallel computing has great prospects in practical applications with large computing load.</jats:p>"

It proposed that the flow rate of an injection well could be calculated referring to pumping theory and method. A mathematical model of the rising curve of water level around a radial well was established and the equation for calculating the rising curve was given. The calculation equations selected for the water absorption capacity of injection wells were explained and examples were verified and compared. The results indicated that, under the same injection conditions, the water level value calculated by the analysis method was slightly larger, but the error between the analysis method and the semi-theoretical and semi-empirical methods was small. In the processes of steady flow injection and unsteady flow injection, there was a small difference of water absorption capacity, and the former was slightly larger. The measured values of water absorption capacity were only about one-third of the calculated values based on pumping theory. Overall, the analytical solution method for predicting the rising curve of water level has priority in well injection. The semi-theoretical and semi-empirical equation for calculating water absorption capacity sifted first has priority in steady flow injection, the equation sifted second has priority in unsteady flow injection.</jats:p>",

Backscattering coefficients were derived from four ERS-1 (European Remote-Sensing Satellite-1) images acquired between 31 March and 12 April 2011 and were compared with the irrigation water invoices database. The analysis showed that there were significant changes in backscattering values caused by irrigation, with average values ranging between 0.11 and 3.11 dB. A reference level of 0.52 dB was established for differentiating between (recently; up to 4 days) irrigated and non-irrigated plots. We also set an interval of 5 days for the acquisition of SAR images in order to ensure continuous monitoring of the irrigated wheat plots over time. The study showed that radar data contain important information for the assessment of irrigation supplies during the cropping season, which could help regional decision-support systems to monitor and control irrigation supplies over large areas.</jats:p>"

The results confirm the long-run relationship between the variables while using broad money supply as a response variable. However, in the price and income modeling, the variables do not support the cointegration relationship between the variables. The causality results confirmed the unidirectional relationship running from income to money supply, which implies that income do causes money supply in the short run, whereas money supply leads to inflation to support Monetarist view of inflation in a country. The results conclude that economic growth is imperative to stabilize money supply and price level through sound economic policies in a country.</jats:p>",

This paper analyses the leakage rate, leakage components and leakage reduction potential. A minimum night flow (MNF) analysis was carried out on a district metered area (DMA) in an intermittent supply system in Zarqa, Jordan. Leakage was modelled and leakage reduction policies were analysed. Results show that MNF occurs at night or during day time depending on the water levels in customer tanks, implying that one-day MNF analysis cannot be carried out in intermittent supplies and the estimation of the legitimate consumption during MNF is more influential. The potential water savings of the different leakage reduction measures (pressure management; leakage detection; response time minimization) are separately analysed in the existing models in the literature, leading to significant overestimation of the total leakage reduction potential, while these measures are influencing each other. Pressure reduction lowers the failure frequencies but limits the potential of leakage detection surveys, as leaks will become harder to hear and detect. Investigating the inter-dependency relations of these measures is therefore essential for reasonable leakage reduction modelling and planning.</jats:p>"

The main group included newborns who received infusion with sodium succinate (n = 66) as a part of integrated therapy; the control group included the newborns who were not administered the above mentioned medication (n = 44). At the beginning of the study we observed a tendency towards the formation of lactate acidosis in the examined newborns, while no significant correlation was established between the severity of the gastrointestinal insufficiency syndrome and the indicators of cell energy supply. At the end of the study, the cell energy supply indicators varied in both groups by reducing the level of lactic acid, its ratio regarding pyruvic acid and increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in newborns, who received amber acid in addition to the standard treatment. At the same time we observed a direct significant correlation between the severity of the syndrome of gastrointestinal insufficiency and the level of lactic acid. Thus, the examined newborns with gastrointestinal insufficiency syndrome are found to start developing cell energy disorders that is reflected in the progression and severity of the syndrome. Administration of amber acid medications helps to improve the state of cell energy supply, reducing the manifestations of lactate acidosis and declining the severity and progression of gastrointestinal insufficiency syndrome.</jats:p>"

The lowest Se dose (1.30 mg Se kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) had a positive effect on shoot and root biomass production as well as on the contents of chlorophyll <jats:italic>b</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Chl-b</jats:italic>), total chlorophyll, and carotenoids (just for the hybrid). Chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Chl-a</jats:italic>) was reduced with increasing Se doses, whereas chlorophyll <jats:italic>b</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Chl-b</jats:italic>) and total chlorophyll further increased with medium Se doses. The highest Se dose strongly reduced biomass and the contents of photosynthetically active pigments. <jats:italic>Chl-a</jats:italic> and carotenoids positively correlated with shoot (for both genotypes) and root (for the hybrid) biomass, whereas no correlation was observed between <jats:italic>Chl-b</jats:italic> and biomass.

The paper examined the use of social media marketing strategies by indigenous construction firms in  Nigeria;  a  tool  for  sustainable  growth.  The  study  used  quantitative  data  through  a questionnaire survey instrument at company-level. A total ofseventy-nine (79) questionnaires at firm level were utilised. The data collected were presented using stacked bars, radar charts and matrix correlation. The study identified the social media platforms mostly utilisedby ICFs and the major barriers resisting the adoption of the innovative marketing strategy in Nigeria. The perceived benefits accrued to ICFs in the use of social media as a marketing tool differs across the type of social media platforms in use by the ICFs. ICFs need to be concerned about image  and  trust  building  through  a  concerted  effort  in  client  engagement  on  social  media platforms to improve their brand and reputation. Social media marketing strategies should be integrated with the traditional marketing plans of construction firm.</jats:p>"

The INFORMAS (International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring and Action Support) framework for monitoring the composition of the food supply was used. The Law’s initial (2016) and final (2019) limits were used to evaluate if foods would receive a “High in” warning for Calories, Sodium, Sugars and/or Saturated Fats (initial/final, solids: &gt;350/275 kcal; &gt;800/400 mg; &gt;22.5/10 g; &gt;6/4 g; liquids: &gt;100/70 kcal; &gt;100/100 mg; &gt;6/5 g; &gt;3/3 g respectively). Foods were excluded if they required reconstitution, had missing information or if total labeled energy was estimated as incorrect (n = 942). In February 2015 and 2016, fieldworkers photographed a purposeful sample of packaged food and beverage products (n = 5421 and n = 5479) from 6 different supermarkets in Santiago, Chile. Seven percent of foods had no added critical nutrients (n = 720). Two-thirds of products had critical nutrients exceeding at least one initial limit indicative of a “high in” warning. Under the final phase limits, only 17% of foods would have zero warning labels. By 2019, 10 of the 17 food and beverage categories studied are predicted to have less than half of their products without a high in sodium warning label. While 8 of the 17 categories studied are predicted to have less than half their products without a high in total sugars or a high in total calories warning label, respectively; while even fewer food and beverage categories are predicted to be without a high in saturated fat warning label. Most products will have to be reformulated to avoid at least one front-of-package warning label.</jats:p>"

As a result of the Caspian campaign of Peter the Great (1722–1723), the Seaside Dagestan, including the Kumyk regions (the Shamkhalate of Tarki and the Zasulak Kumyk lands) entered the jurisdiction of the Russian Empire. To protect the new territories, a system of military fortifications was built. The Fortress of the Holy Cross was founded by Peter the Great in September, 1722, in the estuary of the Sulak River. It gradually became one of the economic, administrative, and political centers of the Caucasus.The main information source on the matter remains the archive of the garrison headquartered in the Fortress of the Holy Cross. It includes numerous warrants, official reports, and other military documentation. The authors use the data to draw a complete picture of the military supply system invented by Peter the Great. The system provided both combat troops and regular garrisons with everything they needed to protect the borders of the Russian Empire. In fact, the system was based on logistic support (intendance) of imperial troops in peace and war time with ammunition, arms, food, medicines, finance, fuel, etc. </jats:p><jats:p>The last-in first-out system of supply made it possible to reserve food and fodder in the country in advance and systematically bring them to the combat troops. </jats:p>"

One of the main tasks in the area of public health in Russia is the adequate quality of drinking water supply, i.e. its sound chemical composition and epidemiological safety. The latter is provided among others, by proper wellhead protection activities which aim to ensure sanitary protection of water intakes, water supply and distribution facilities and sites of their location from anthropogenic influence. The aim of the study. The analysis of most common errors revealed during the expertize of wellhead protection (WHP) plans for groundwater intakes. Material and Methods. laws and regulations related to wellhead protection plan development, particular WHP plans, related technical papers. The study is methodologically based on common scientific approaches to investigate social interactions in the field of drinking and domestic water supply such as analytical, comparative, structured system analysis. Results. It is shown that a great deal of uncertainty exists in practical assessment of parameters necessary to estimate wellhead protection area that makes wellhead protection area delineation rather approximate. To enhance the reliability of estimates it is necessary to account for a minimal set of estimation indices and increase the requirements to the quality and scope of project documentation. Conclusion. Authors set forth a complex of additional investigations to refine parameter estimates for wellhead protection plan development, and several new requirements for the project design regarding both the textual part and graphics. Some recommendations to amend current regulations related to wellhead protection are also suggested.</jats:p>"

Venturing into new markets, however, could bring forth issues in logistics and supply chain such as transportation, packaging, documentation and warehousing. This study is conducted with focus on the moderating effects of logistics and supply chain issues on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational innovation, on the market orientation of SMEs. This study used a combination of both the qualitative and quantitative research design. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews and survey questionnaires. The population of the study were SMEs in Kedah, Perlis and Penang. A total of 5 companies were interviewed and 106 mail survey questionnaires were collected. Data gathered from survey questionnaires were analysed using SPSS and Partial Least Square Regression technique. Findings indicate that there is a mix of logistics and supply chain issues faced by the SMEs’ with most common issues being customer service and inventory management. Quantitative data analysis indicates that both entrepreneurial orientation and organisational innovations do influence the level of market orientation. In addition, logistics and supply chain issues are found to significantly moderate the relationship between both independent variables and the dependent variable.</jats:p>"

The current order of drug supply to certain categories of citizens attached to military medical organizations results in an unjustified expenditure of resources and an increase in the burden on healthcare, which indicates the irrationality of the existing mechanisms of drug supply. In this regard, it is necessary to develop rational economic and pharmaceutical mechanisms, as a set of methods for managing and interacting the entities that determine the order of drug supply for certain categories of citizens, while optimizing the financial, information and material resources of military and civilian healthcare. Theoretical approaches to the formation of rational economic and pharmaceutical mechanisms of drug supply are presented. Rational economic and pharmaceutical mechanisms of drug supply of certain categories of citizens attached to military medical organizations have been substantiated and developed. The characteristic of integration and coordination mechanisms of interaction of military and civil health on drug supply of certain categories of citizens in a single legal space is given. As the basic mechanisms of coordination of interaction are given: information exchange; standardization; direct supervision. The results of an assessment of sound and developed rational economic and pharmaceutical mechanisms of drug supply in the areas of organizational, social and economic efficiency are presented. It is noted that the implementation of the mechanisms of drug supply in the system of preferential drug supply can contribute to the formation of a system of drug supply balanced with the available resources of the country’s population; the formation of economic and social responsibility at each level of decision-making; the optimization of transparency and controllability of financial flows; the optimization of the financial burden on the federal, regional and departmental budgets; the equal access to medicines for all categories of citizens; guaranteed drug supply to socially vulnerable groups of the population.</jats:p>"

Elemental analysis of 60 samples by laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) confirmed that the glasses were imported from the Eastern Mediterranean. A majority of the glasses correspond to the HIMTa primary production group, which originates from Egypt. The statistical evaluation of published data of 589 HIMT glasses further revealed differential distribution patterns of the HIMTa and HIMTb subtypes between the Eastern and Western Mediterranean, suggesting chronological trends that are linked to wider geopolitical changes. This demonstrates the need for systematic large‐scale approaches to identify supply patterns and possible factors underlying geographical differences and/or chronological developments.</jats:p>",

Logging generates forest residues – low‐quality feedstock – and additional operations that also incur additional costs, such as biomass sorting and treetops processing (BSTP), micro‐chipping, and screening, which are required to improve the feedstock's quality. Considering recent developments in technologies and BSTP to generate high‐quality feedstocks, economic models were developed in this study to estimate various forest‐residue logistics operational costs and to analyze the economics of delivering feedstocks to biomass conversion technology (BCT) sites near woods or power plants located far away in the form of chips, hog fuel, and bales. The results show that the cost of BSTP can vary between $30 and $82/ODMT (oven dry metric ton) based on the biomass sorting intensity. The most economical way to deliver forest residues was transporting processed stem‐wood from landings to near‐wood BCT sites and comminuting it into woodchips there (~$20/ODMT, assuming a one‐way (32 km) road distance and no cost of BSTP at landings). Grinding slash at the landing and transporting ground‐biomass (i.e., hog fuel) to a plant (&lt; 22 km away) was more economical than transporting bales from landings and grinding at the plant. The economic feasibility of baling and BSTP requires a substantial productivity improvement or recognition and incorporation of benefits including reduced wildfire risk and improved forest health. High bulk density and strong shape of forest residues/slash bales compared to hog fuel may provide additional cost benefits during storage, for example through lower handling costs, which can be studied in the future. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

The vulnerability of power supply network in the face of events has been one of significant concerns. This study presents a new methodology and framework for “dose-response” vulnerability assessment of urban power supply network. This framework can explore the vulnerability of power supply network under two types of events: random type and intentional type. It also integrates a new metric that calculates the vulnerability of power supply network in both structural dimension and functional dimension. Taking the power supply network of a city in east China as an example, network vulnerability under different types of events was assessed, and the “dose-response” interrelationships between network performance and event scale under different types of events were thoroughly discussed. The results demonstrated that power supply network was more vulnerable to intentional events in both dimensions. For intentional events, power supply network was more vulnerable to degree-based attack than to betweenness-based attack. After that, the redundancy coefficient <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> of power supply network was optimized. The conclusion and some suggestions for future research were given in the end.</jats:p>",

Among the N-DBPs, the haloacetonitrile (HAN) precursor contents were 9.83 ± 0.59 μg/L while precursors of halonitromethanes, particularly trichloronitromethane (TCNM) were not detected. Similarly, precursors of HKs as carbonaceous DBPs were also not detected in raw water. Ozonation alone and the H2O2/UV process with a lower UV dose maximally decomposed HAN precursors (about 70%) while during O3-based AOPs, HANFP varied significantly. Application of UV photolysis and H2O2/UV processes with increasing UV dose doubled the HANFP. Ozone alone, O3/UV and H2O2/UV slightly increased HK formation potential, particularly 1,1-dichloro-2-propanone FP (0.93 ± 0.21 to 2.01 ± 0.37 μg/L). None of the investigated treatments influenced the formation of TCNM precursors. The effect of the applied treatments on bromide incorporation was most evident for HANs.</jats:p>",

При формировании периодического патологического дыхания в микрососудах ствола мозга возникают характерные периодические колебания кровотока и оксигенации нервной ткани, которые соответствуют дыхательным движениям. Кроме того, в этих условиях увеличивается кровенаполнение и величина венозного оттока крови от мозга. Полученные данные позволяют предположить, что характерные колебания кровоснабжения мозга в ритме дыхательных движений появляются не только в стволе мозга, но и в других отделах.

Under these conditions, both blood supply to and venous outflow from the brain were augmented. The study suggested that the characteristic oscillations of blood supply to the brain at the respiration rhythm emerge not only in the brain stem but also in other cerebral regions. Probably, they are caused by oscillations of venous outflow induced by the suction effect of the chest cavity during inspiration.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the chapter examines the terms of access to and social control over public and sacred spaces used for gardening. Apart from urban gardening, urbanites draw on personal networks of rural-urban food supply to ensure food safety.

The paper attempts to explain the nature and reasons of the bargaining power imbalances that may lead to hold-up relationships in the farming sector in the light of the Transaction Costs Theory (TCT). In order to provide a certain focus, the theoretical discussion is illustrated by an empirical example of backward vertical relations between farmers and input (feed) suppliers. The article investigates the reasons for long-term and stable relationships between farmers and feed suppliers and whether these may be partly explained by an imbalance in bargaining power, trapping farmers in the specific monopolistic (hold-up) relations with their contractors.Overall, the picture that emerges from the analysis does not support the assumptions that farmers are experiencing a large imbalance in bargaining power with regard to their input contractors, and are trapped in a specific monopolistic (hold-up) relationship with them. Despite that there is no written contract between the farmers and their suppliers, relations are based on unwritten, privately enforced terms. The parties tend to respect the mutually agreed relationship rather than breaching it ex-post in order extract the holdup quasi-rents. In this case a binding written supply commitment may increase transaction costs, limit the freedom to change supplier and reduce the farmer’s bargaining power over the feed producer by adding additional inter-dependency.</jats:p>"

Paradoxically, during whole body energy deficit including calorie restriction, the intestine grows in size. To understand how and why this happens, we reviewed data from several animal models of energetic challenge. These were bariatric surgery, cold exposure, lactation, dietary whey protein intake and calorie restriction. Notably, these challenges all reduced the adipose tissue mass, altered hypothalamic neuropeptide expression and increased intestinal size. Based on these data, we propose that the loss of energy in the adipose tissue promotes the growth of the intestine via a signalling mechanism involving the hypothalamus. We discuss possible candidates in this pathway including data showing a correlative change in intestinal (ileal) expression of the cyclin D1 gene with adipose tissue mass, adipose derived‐hormone leptin and hypothalamic expression of leptin receptor and the pro‐opiomelanocortin gene. The ability of the intestine to grow in size during depletion of energy stores provides a mechanism to maximize assimilation of ingested energy and in turn sustain critical functions of tissues important for survival.</jats:p>",

This paper studies the short-term and long-term vulnerability of the platform leading fresh agricultural product supply chain under the influence of logistics capital flow and information flow, defines its structure and the meaning of its vulnerability, analyzes the vulnerability of each link, and finds out the existing weak links in the supply chain through empirical research. The probability of accident is quantitatively analyzed by using the Bayesian Network. Firstly, the bow-tie model is used to identify the cause and consequence of the accident, and then it is transformed into the Bayesian Network model; then, the “Precursor Incident” information and prior probability are introduced to derive the posterior accident occurrence probability, and the probability of accident occurrence changing with time is quantitatively analyzed; finally, the dynamic risk calculation of fresh agricultural product trading center dominated by a certain platform was carried out. The results show that, with the increase of supply chain operation time and Precursor Incident, the probability of short-term supply chain vulnerability and accident risk present a significant increase trend, while the probability of long-term supply chain vulnerability and accident risk present a significant decrease trend. Therefore, it is suggested that enterprises should establish a dynamic risk evaluation system to monitor and predict the probability of event vulnerability, pay attention to “Precursor Incident,” and take measures to reduce it, such as effective integration of supply chain principal information, timely improvement of information integrated technologies, and comprehensive training on food safety and moral credibility.</jats:p>",

We consider this practice in this paper and build a new LIRP‐CL system. To minimize the total costs of the system, this paper determines the locations of distribution centers and remanufacturing centers, the inventory level of the system, and the delivery routes from distribution centers to customers and from customers to remanufacturing centers. A mixed integer nonlinear model was developed to solve this problem. To solve the model, a novel hybrid heuristic algorithm based on tabu search and simulated annealing is proposed.

To halt and reverse this loss, conservation practitioners must find ways to change human behaviors which threaten species and ecosystems. Increasingly, it is being recognized that social marketing could be an effective way of achieving voluntary, ethical, and long-lasting behavior change for the benefit of biodiversity. By conducting a global survey of conservation practitioners, the objective of this study was to assess the need for social marketing skills, as well as the demand, supply, and barriers to receiving social marketing training in the conservation sector. From a sample of 322 conservation practitioners from 71 countries, results suggest there is a marked lack of social marketing skills in the conservation sector, with only 16.1% of participants considering their skill level to be expert or advanced. However, 61.5% of participants reported needing advanced or expert social marketing skills to be effective in their current role. In addition, the survey revealed a high demand for training in social marketing, but also that a lack of funds, time, and available courses all present major barriers to conservation practitioners receiving such training. The implications of these results for designing methods of providing conservation practitioners with social marketing skills and removing barriers are discussed. </jats:p>",

From an economic and ecological point of view, flaws such as flattening or heartwood ratio are very important when buying material for production. 40 logs of Scots pine (<jats:italic>Pinus sylvestris</jats:italic> L.) have been selected from wood deposit, from typical wood delivery. The ratios of sapwood and heartwood have been quantified, as well as eccentricity and flattening, in order to determine the suitability of the selected material for processing into floorings. There are two existing methods of log processing: sawing and peripheral cutting. Sawing is the most common one and widely used, although peripheral cutting could be more effective, especially for production of base in multi-layer floorings. The total loss volume for the two methods of manipulation and processing have been calculated. First one is sawing in accordance to schematics used in the sawmill of one of the largest producers of multilayer floorings in Europe. Second one is peripheral cutting with three diameters of peeler roll. Total loss volume for sawing was 55.8 ± 10.5% and for peripheral cutting with peeler roll with biggest chosen diameter of 100 mm was 45.6 ± 9.5%. Therefore, in presented case, peripheral cutting is more efficient than sawing.</jats:p>",

Based on maximizing the profits and the bounded rationality expectation rule (BRE), this paper builds a dynamic game model, respectively, and analyzes the stability of the equilibrium points by mathematical analysis and explores the influences of parameters on stability domain and entropy of the system by using bifurcation diagram, the entropy diagram, the largest Lyapunov exponent and the chaotic attractor etc. Besides, the influences of service level and profit distribution rate on system’s profit are discussed. The theoretical results show that the greater the service level and profit distribution rate are, the smaller the stability domain of the system is; the system will go into chaotic state and the system’s entropy will increase when operators adjust her/his price decision quickly; when the manufacturer or the retailer keeps service level in the appropriate value which is conducive to maximizing her/his profit; the manufacturer should carefully set the service level of OSC to ensure the system’s profit; in Nash game model, the stability of the system weakens than that in Stackelberg game model. Furthermore, this paper puts forward some suggestions to help the manufacturer and retailer in multi-channel supply chain to do the better decision.</jats:p>"

Hydroelectric power plants are key players for grid control thanks to pumped storage power plants. However, this objective requires extending the operating range of the machines and increasing the number of start-up, stand-by, and shut-down procedures, which reduces the lifespan of the machines. CFD based on standard URANS turbulence modeling is currently able to predict accurately the performances of the hydraulic turbines for operating points close to the Best Efficiency Point (BEP). However, far from the BEP, the standard URANS approach is less efficient to capture the dynamics of 3D flows. The current study focuses on a hydraulic turbine, which has been investigated at the BEP and at the Speed-No-Load (SNL) operating conditions. Several “advanced” URANS models such as the Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) SST     k − ω     and the BSL- EARSM have been considered and compared with the SST     k − ω     model. The main conclusion of this study is that, at the SNL operating condition, the prediction of the topology and the dynamics of the flow on the suction side of the runner blade channels close to the trailing edge are influenced by the turbulence model.</jats:p>"

However, in the food processing industry, the supply uncertainty of raw materials is very high, depending on the production site and the harvest season, and further, it is not straightforward to analyze too complex food production systems by using an analytical optimization model. For these reasons, this study presents a simulation-based decision support model to select the right location for a new food processing plant. We first define three supply vulnerability factors from the standpoint of regional as well as seasonal instability and present an assessment method for supply vulnerability based on fuzzy quantification. The evaluated vulnerability scores are then converted into raw material supply variations for food production simulation to predict the quarterly production volume of a new food processing plant. The proposed selection procedure is illustrated using a case study of semiprocessed kimchi production. The best plant location is proposed where we can reduce and mitigate risks when supplying raw material, thereby producing a target production volume steadily.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, how these two pathological phenomena are linked with one another remains unclear, especially in neurons. To address the question, a model of iron overload was established with exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to excessive iron. We first verified that iron overload resulted in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in neurons. Meanwhile, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> was significantly increased after iron overload and consequently triggered an apoptosis signal, as revealed by Caspase 3 cleavage. To explore the potential underlying molecular mechanisms, an unlabeled quantitative proteomics approach was applied to primary neurons. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that 58 mitochondria‐associated proteins were significantly altered, including three subunits of mitochondrial complex I and optic atrophy 1(OPA1). Increased NADH‐ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit and decreased NADH‐ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10 levels were further validated by a western blot, and more importantly, complex I activity markedly declined. Iron‐induced down‐regulation on the OPA1 level was also validated by a western blot, which was not reversed by the anti‐oxidant but was reversed by the iron chelator. Moreover, an OPA1‐associated key downstream effect, mitochondrial fragmentation, was found to be aggravated in neurons exposed to excessive iron, which is consistent with the down‐regulation of OPA1. Furthermore, the protein level of PTEN‐induced putative kinase 1, an important protein closely related to complex I activity and mitochondrial fragmentation, also significantly declined in neurons by iron overload. Thus, our findings may shed new light on the linkage between iron toxicity and mitochondrial impairments, such as energy supply deficiency and mitochondrial fragmentation, and further expand the toxic repertoire of iron in the central nerve system.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:label/><jats:p>\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/jnc14621-fig-0009-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p><jats:p>Cover Image for this issue: doi: <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"doi\" xlink:href=\"10.1111/jnc.14205\">10.1111/jnc.14205</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Against this background it is important to strengthen the bargaining power of workers along the supply chain. Establishing direct relationships among workers along the supply chain could be one way to achieve this aim. This paper builds on extant literature on transnational solidarity and highlights the specific challenges of understanding solidarity in a transnational social space by looking at the empirical context of global garment supply chains. It hereby seeks to go beyond treating “solidarity” as a mere metaphor for any form of transnational union or worker cooperation, and instead engages with the cultural-normative dimensions of the concept as referring to mutual bonds among groups of workers. By looking at the case of the ExChains network, this paper examines some of the opportunities and challenges involved in establishing and maintaining transnational worker solidarity. The paper concludes by discussing the transformative potential, but also the limits of transnational labour solidarity regarding substandard working conditions in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, enhancing coordination and collaboration between the chains’ members has taken a vital role in increasing their efficiency and profitability. Thus, managers tend to employ/design marketing and coordinating incentive mechanisms using the revenue optimization method, as the most influential tools, to motivate the purchasers to order more and subsequently increase their market share. Here, this issue is studied in a two‐echelon supply chain by designing incentive contracts in order to evaluate the profit of organizations and enterprises and assess the best contract, which causes the highest profit, as the main goal of the businesses. In this study, a pricing‐inventory model is developed for a single‐item two‐echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer in the presence of three different scenarios. In the first scenario, a credit payment (delay‐in‐payment) contract is considered between the chain members. In the second scenario, we studied a market segmentation policy in which the market demand is divided into price and quality oriented customers’ demand while a quantity discount contract is assumed as the third one. The profit of supply chain under these new conditions is computed by some numerical examples and then the effects of cost parameters on the decision variables and the profit are analyzed.</jats:p>",

The pH of the nutrient solution affected neither the ion activities nor the root accumulation of both Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. At higher pH values (7.5 and 8.5) the interactions of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Si at high Si supply led to a decrease of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> activity and, hence, an increase of Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> : Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> activity ratio in the external root solution. Concomitantly, despite the elevated exchangeable apoplastic fraction of both Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, the total and cell sap concentrations were remarkably decreased for Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and increased for Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> by the addition of 4 mM H<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>SiO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>.

Moreover, the results show that the proposed hybrid power supply can effectively improve the impact of high‐proportion renewable energy access to the grid and provide a new design scheme for the green data centre.</jats:p>",

Measurement results of the space electric field are dramatically affected by the size and the potential of the sensor. In addition, the battery‐powered solution of electric field sensor (EFS) is not feasible, for the reason that in the high‐voltage electric field environment, the replacement of the battery will bring security risks to the power system and workers. The wireless energy supply solution not only solves the problem of potential isolation of the sensor, but also ensures that the sensor can work continuously. Various wireless power transmission systems (WPTSs) were compared. Microwave wireless power transmission system (MWPTS) was selected as the power supply of EFS. The key boundary conditions of MWPTS were determined. Two microstrip receiving antennas were designed in this article. A good performance antenna with high permittivity substrate was designed, realising 4.26 dB gain with the area of 1 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> at 5.8 GHz.

Area sources of pollution, including agriculture, are considered the main contributors of biogenic compounds. The Bay of Puck as an inner part of the Baltic Sea is particularly sensitive to eutrophication caused by nutrient inflow from agricultural lands. Rivers and streams inflowing to the Bay of Puck transport nitrogen and phosphorus compounds washed out from fields. The article discusses concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds measured during annual research (VII.2017 – VI.2018) at three watercourses: Płutnica, Reda and Błądzikowski Stream inflowing to the Bay of Puck. The concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.13 mg/L N-NO2, from 0.39 to 7.55 mg/L N-NO3, from 0.03 to 0.58 mg/L N-NH4, from 0.44 to 9.51 mg/L TN, from 0.05 to 0.45 mg/L P-PO4 and from 0.03 to 1.89 mg/L TP. Seasonal changes of nutrient concentrations were observed, with maximum concentrations of nitrates in August and September after application of fertilizers to arable land.</jats:p>",

Our paper focuses on a horizontal competition with respect to both rebate and leadership between two manufacturers selling substitutable products through a common retailer to consumers who are heterogeneous in their price sensitivity. Furthermore, we investigate the impacts of leadership strategy on profits and study rebate decision under different strategies. Our research indicates that Bertrand-Nash game benefits the retailer, but hurts manufacturers, while Stackelberg game benefits manufacturers but hurts the retailer, which shows no difference from previous studies. In addition, the sequential-move Stackelberg game could eliminate the classic prisoners’ dilemma in rebate decision, which is also influenced by fixed cost control.</jats:p>",

A coopetition evolutionary game model based on evolutionary game theory was developed to obtain their common and evolutional collection strategies. The pure-strategy Nash equilibriums of this model were obtained which showed their collection strategy choices of perfect competition or cooperation. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium was obtained which revealed evolution trends and laws. In addition, the optimal RPM was obtained in the sensitivity analysis of related parameters. The example of WMPs in China was taken to examine the simulation of the RPM. Results show that (i) although the manufacturer and the collector may change their strategies of cooperation and competition over time, cooperation is their best choice to increase payoffs; (ii) the optimal RPM is beneficial to propel their cooperation tendency and then to increase their payoffs.</jats:p>"

The research method is the double case study of two Brazilian waste sorting plants. The research techniques were the analysis of reports, interviews, participant observation, and statistical analysis of historical series of production. The qualitative part of the study concluded that the main roles of waste sorting plants are the supply of local industry with recycled low-cost raw material or to recover energy as fuel, environment development by reducing the use of controlled landfills, and social support to the municipality by reducing public health liabilities and generating jobs and income for vulnerable communities. The quantitative part of the study observed two systemic behaviours. In the first sorting plant, external elements reacted to an expressive increase of the production and limit the current outcome. The second sorting plant is a bottleneck. Despite the availability of waste and demand for recycled material, the sorting plant does not achieve increased production. Owing to the economic, environmental, and social importance of sorting plants to the region, further research should focus on these two systemic behaviours. The main contribution of the study is the integration of elements observed in supply chains and in waste management studies to form a plausible basis of hypotheses for a further survey. Another contribution is to offer information to practitioners on the importance of recycling in the reverse process of the supply chains. </jats:p>",

The optimal strategy for production allocation and supply is derived. Subsequently, an approximate algorithm for solving the optimal total production amount is presented. The optimal allocation and supply strategy, the minimum total production amount, the minimum allocation strategy, and the discount pricing strategy are obtained for the single cycle. Finally, with the sales data of a food DCE, numerical results corroborate that adopting different production and supply strategies reduces the risk of expected losses and increases the expected return.

Here, a modular design scheme is introduced, which adopts a three‐layer combined structure, and finally realises the DC/DC combined power supply with a total power of 15.6 kW in the total height of 105 mm. The heat design of the power supply is reasonable, the rectangular liquid cooling channel is arranged inside the cooling plate of the chassis, the rectangular heat exchanger fin is added inside the liquid cooling channel with concentrated heat source, and the series‐parallel technology is used in the liquid cooling channel inside the plate. The series reliability prediction model can meet the requirements of radar overall design. The project is difficult to implement, and more precise process is needed in practical engineering to strictly control it.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past two decades, the demands of nature-based tourism have been rapidly growing worldwide, yet it is not clear how tourist demands for water, food, and infrastructure influence the ecosystem services (ES), which are often the bedrock of an area’s economic, cultural, and natural wealth. With a general conceptual model that applies the telecoupling framework, this study identifies complex interrelationships between the demand for nature-based tourism, which is a type of cultural ES, ES supply, and the economy simultaneously, using China’s Qinghai Province as a demonstration site. The province is the origin of three rivers, making it crucial for water retention and prime for tourism. The results indicate that there is a strong spatial interaction between the number of tourism attractions and water retention. The southern Qinghai region’s natural resources are protected by the Sanjiangyuan (three rivers headwater) National Park. From 2010–2014, tourists in the Sanjiangyuan region spent more money than those in the northern Qinghai region, which has accelerated the development of tourism infrastructures. The Sanjiangyuan region may face the unexpected degradation of its natural habitats due to rapid tourism development. Our findings suggest that new management plans are needed to minimize the negative impacts from the demands of distant tourists, and preserve the region that supports both the environment and the economy.</jats:p>"

Higher education institutions aim to equip new generations of students with skills and expertise relevant to workforce participation for decades to come, but their offerings sometimes misalign with commercial needs and new techniques forged at the frontiers of research. Here, we analyze and visualize the dynamic skill (mis-)alignment between academic push, industry pull, and educational offerings, paying special attention to the rapidly emerging areas of data science and data engineering (DS/DE). The visualizations and computational models presented here can help key decision makers understand the evolving structure of skills so that they can craft educational programs that serve workforce needs. Our study uses millions of publications, course syllabi, and job advertisements published between 2010 and 2016. We show how courses mediate between research and jobs. We also discover responsiveness in the academic, educational, and industrial system in how skill demands from industry are as likely to drive skill attention in research as the converse. Finally, we reveal the increasing importance of uniquely human skills, such as communication, negotiation, and persuasion. These skills are currently underexamined in research and undersupplied through education for the labor market. In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand for “soft” social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase with greater demand for “hard” technical skills and tools.</jats:p>",

Feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG) and Ca:P ratio deposited in the dry defatted tibia (TibCa:TibP) were quadraticaly increased by the increasing nPP concentrations, regardless of the Ca supply regimen adopted (p&lt;0.01). The nPP levels tested also influenced FCR and TibAsh, which presented a quadratic and linear response when CaF and CaV diets were used, respectively, and TibP and TibCa, which presented a quadratic response with both Ca supply regimen, CaF and CaV diets. Also, CaV diets provided a 2.86 and 5.02% higher FCR (p&lt;0.05) and TibCa (p&lt;0.01), respectively, when compared to CaF diets. Therefore, nPP nutritional requirement for male broilers reared at thermoneutral conditions from 8 to 21 d of age that provided better performance and bone mineralization were, respectively, 0.480 and 0.459% with CaF and 0.550% with CaV diets, indicating that, under thermoneutral conditions, CaV diets negatively affected growth performance of broilers, while positively affecting bone mineralization especially when low nPP levels are applied.</jats:p>"

When the fault occurs, it is difficult to determine where the fault occurs. Moreover, the existing literature ignores the impact of faults, which creates many problems for SOFC system control. Therefore, a state observer‐based fault detection method, which is used to detect the input flow sensor fault and the fuel input fault, is proposed. Their advantage is that they do not need data processing. To realize the fault detection, the observer is used to track the changes of SOFC stack chamber temperature. To obtain the observer estimation parameter, an approach from the actual stack structure parameters is employed to approximate the observer parameters. The results show the proposed fault detect method can judge fuel input fault type quickly and shield the disturbances signals from the sensor effectively. The proposed method also can be used to other operating points or air input fault.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The deceased‐donor kidney allocation system suffers from a severe shortage of available organs. We illustrate a mechanism which can increase the supply of cadaveric kidneys in the United States. This supply increase exploits the fact that under the current organ allocation policy, some kidneys remain unprocured in some procurement areas but would be highly sought in other areas. The current kidney allocation policy procures within a donor service area (DSA) and offers these kidneys first to patients in the DSA; if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered within the region (a cluster of DSAs); if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered nationally. A deceased‐donor organ is procured if there is the belief that the offered organ will be transplanted (known as “intent”). We conduct an empirical analysis of the donor and recipient data (at the DSA level) which reveals that the intent increases significantly with organ quality, the median waiting time for a transplant, and higher competition. In particular, it shows that lower quality organs are likely to be procured at a higher rate in DSAs with longer waiting times. Motivated by a new kidney allocation system, we conduct a counterfactual study which shows that geographically broader sharing the bottom 15% quality kidneys leads to stronger intent for the organ, thus increasing the supply of procured organs available for transplantation. The expected increase in procured organs ranges from 58 (an increase of 0.4% of all procured kidneys) to 174 (an increase of 1.2%), depending on regional or national sharing. </jats:p>",

The present study reflects the authors’ experience of triple arthrodesis for correction and stabilization of foot multicomponent deformities of varying severity in 75 patients (136 feet) with cerebral palsy (IIIV level by Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)) treated in the Ilizarov center in the period from April 2012 to December 2016. The average age of the patients was 16.4±4.3 years (from 11 years 8 months to 43 years 3 months). All patients included into the study had severe arthrosis of hind and midfoot. The main option of foot fixation in this group of patients was internal fixation (elastic threaded wires, compression screws) together with plaster cast immobilization for 6–8 weeks. All patients underwent average of 4.59 surgical elements during a procedure as part of simultaneous multilevel interventions. The blood supply at the surgical site was evaluated by laser and high-frequency Doppler flowmetry before and after all stages of the surgery.Results. Long-term outcomes were evaluated at the average of 19 months after the surgery in 56 (74.7%) patients. 37 patients (66.1%) demonstrated good treatment outcomes and 19 patients (33.9%) — satisfactory outcomes. No unsatisfactory outcomes were observed. The clinical outcome of foot surgery was evaluated using the Angus-Cowell criteria. The obtained significant x-ray enhancement was maintained at the control stages of the follow up. Despite large simultaneous correction of foot deformity, there was no decrease in the parameters of microcirculatory blood supply of the skin, muscles and subcutaneous fat of the foot. The authors observed a stabilized or an increased perfusion of soft tissues.Conclusion. Triple arthrodesis for correction of foot deformities in patients with cerebral palsy and severe arthrosis in hind and midfoot is an efficient method which allows to correct and stabilize gained position of segments. The data of physiological research testify the sparing approach of such procedure and a possibility of an earlier weight-bearing on operated limb. </jats:p>"

However, it is easily liable to direct current (DC) oscillation or even instability due to the interaction between the rectifier and inverter stations. In order to solve this problem, this paper analyzes the stability of the VSC‐HVDC system caused by DC capacitors based on VSC impedance modeling and impedance stability criterion. Besides, an adaptive virtual impedance control strategy to suppress the DC oscillation is proposed. The impedance models of the VSC in the rectifier and inverter stations are constructed and verified. Then, the influence of the DC capacitors on the system stability is analyzed based on impedance stability criteria. The analysis shows that the decrease of DC capacitors will cause DC oscillation, and the DC virtual impedance is used to damping the oscillation. Finally, this paper presents a simple but effective adaptive fuzzy segmented virtual impedance control strategy to suppress the oscillation. Electromagnetic transient simulation and hardware‐in‐the‐loop (HIL) test results show that the proposed adaptive virtual impedance is more effective and has better robustness than the conventional virtual impedance. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

As a result, building a sustainable supply chain has now become a part of social corporate responsibility as well as a challenge for firms, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Taking a chemical enterprise (called enterprise C, in this paper) as an example, this paper uses quality function deployment (QFD) techniques and sets up a house of quality (HOQ) to investigate how a SME can achieve sustainable supply chain management. Specifically, in this paper we build a performance measurement system focusing on economic performance, environmental performance, and social performance. These three types of performance measure, in turn, include fifty-nine secondary indicators. Furthermore, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been adopted to calculate the weight of each indicator. Benchmarking has also been used, to determine how much the enterprise should improve on each indicator. Based on the HOQ model, we conclude that avoiding waste, recycling resources, and sustainable exploitation are most important internal abilities of enterprise C.</jats:p>"

At 50 days of age, twenty cross‐bred pigs (gilts) were randomly allotted to four groups: the control (C) group fed a standard diet, and three experimental (D1, D2 and D3) groups fed a high‐fat diet rich in SFA. Moreover, pigs from the groups D2 and D3 consumed an extra inulin supply (7% of daily feed intake) from 85 to 120 days of age (for 5 weeks) and from 50 to 120 days of age (for 10 weeks) respectively. The addition of inulin to the diet reduced meaty odour and flavour significantly, improved tenderness and overall sensory quality of pork and additionally influenced ultimate pH, L* colour parameter, lactate level and protein content in meat. The diets also affected the profile of sarcoplasmic proteins. Significant effects were observed for the following enzymes—PK/PGI (pyruvate kinase/phosphoglucose isomerase) and ALD (aldolase), which are related to the intensity of post‐mortem glycolysis. Presented data indicate that long‐term inulin supply to high‐fat diet has a positive effect on technological and sensory quality as well as protein profile of pork.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to study the seasonal effects on the energy supply of immunocompetent blood cells (IBC) in pregnant women living in different conditions of the Amur region, and to substantiate additional methods of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the identified disorders, a study of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by flow laser cytometry was conducted in 198 subjects. The data of different types of IBC (lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes) at early gestation of women living in urban (Khabarovsk) and rural (Jewish Autonomous region) areas of the Amur region were analyzed. Eight (8) groups were formed according to seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn. The results of a comprehensive survey indicate some features of intracellular bioenergy processes of IBC depending on the environmental conditions in different seasonal periods. Conditions of women from urban areas are characterized by a significant increase in lymphocytes with reduced MMP which was more pronounced in winter, and by a tendency to increase monocytes in spring-and-summer season. The state of low energy supply of IBC in rural residents differs significantly by means of granulocytes in all presented periods of a year, combinations of various types of IBC in winters and tendency to simultaneous increase in the number of all IBCs with the reduced MMP. The number of IBC with optimal MMP content in urban environment was observed in pregnant women in autumn (23.3%), in rural areas in summer (57.1%). Thus, the study has shown the need to expand the range of diagnostic methods for the formation of pregnancy complications risk groups. Determination of the substrate-energy value in the cells of the immune system is an indication for the individual selection of complex vitamin and mineral medications taking into account seasonal changes. MMP studies allow to monitor the dynamics and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic prescriptions.</jats:p>",

The pilot system was designed to include a series of processes, such as aeration, sedimentation, sand filtration, and adsorption, using the iron-rich adsorbent and activated carbon from coconut shells. The pilot system was tested with three operated modes. The results demonstrate that the treatment efficiency of the overall treatment processes was significantly higher than that of the traditional treatment system used by local people. After aeration, sedimentation, and sand filtration, the water quality was discovered to respond substantially in reducing iron by over 96% (from 8-12 mg/l to less than 0.3 mg/l) arsenic by 55 to 60%, but after iron-rich adsorbent, the concentration of arsenic decreased to less than 10 μg/l, which fulfills Vietnam National technical regulations concerning drinking water quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of the Internet, many brand name manufacturers including Apple, Lenovo, and Canon offer remanufactured products through their official website. Confronting the competition from remanufactured products that are available from the manufactured-owned channel, more and more retailers have recognized that customer service level is one of the most important performance metrics and have aggressively attempted to obtain larger market shares by providing high levels of post-sale services. Although numerous researchers have studied various competitive strategies in remanufacturing, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research highlighting whether and how economic performance and sustainability issues related to remanufacturing operations are affected by the retailer’s service levels. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing two models for the closed-loop supply chain where all remanufactured products are available from the manufactured-owned channel, while the equilibrium behavior of the retailer can be characterized under two possible scenarios: (1) Confronting the cannibalization from direct channels where the retailer only responds on prices (i.e., Model P); or (2) on providing competitive prices and high service levels for new products (i.e., Model S). Our analysis suggests that, from managers’ perspective, if the manufacturers care more about economic benefits, encouraging the retailer to provide higher levels of post-sale services is a beneficial strategy. If they are more concerned with environmental performance, Model P is preferred. However, from the angle of environmental groups and agencies, if the level of eco-centrism is too pronounced, though Model S has a greater profitability for both parties, a more significant welfare loss due to environmental hazard is perceived by the society. As a result, besides avoiding indulging in overproducing on new products, environmental groups and agencies should take emissions trading or taxation into consideration to stimulate remanufacturing operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Río de la Plata estuary (RdlP) and adjacent continental shelf exhibit complex hydrological processes as a result of a highly variable fluvial discharge and associated terrigenous supply, which are primarily controlled by regional climatic forcing in interaction with the oceanographic system. Previous hydrological studies indicate that Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly resulted in increased/decreased river runoff due to an enhanced/weakened precipitation regime. This study aims to analyze the cyclicity in the runoff-related continental supply and the associated climatic oscillation behind it over the past 1,000 cal yr BP. To achieve this, we used a 10-m-long sediment core retrieved from the RdlP mud depocenter, which exhibits an extremely high and fairly constant linear sedimentation rate of 1.1 cm yr-1. We performed continuous 1-cm XRF element intensity scans and performed time series analysis on Fe/K, Ti/Al, Fe/Ca, Ti/Ca and Si/Al ratios, considered as regional proxies for inferring fluvial supply. The most significant cyclicities occur at 215, 192, 115, 100, 49, 47, 37, 35, and 2.5-8 yrs recurrence times. The long-term cyclicity is persistent throughout the whole record for all ratios, and it is probably related to solar forcing, i.e., the 200 yr Vries/Suess cycle, which determines the activity of the South American Monsoon System activity. The shorter climate-related cyclicities (˂100 yr) are probably related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Niño Southern Oscillation climatic modes, and were registered only for Ti/Al, Fe/K and Si/Al ratios. We further identified an intensification of such shorter climate-related cyclicities over the past 500 yr BP. This study provides new evidence that both tropical Pacific and Atlantic SSTs and solar forcing are the main drivers of changes in rainfall over Southeastern South America on interannual to decadal, multidecadal and centennial scales, and thus modulates the RdlP river discharge. ResumoO estuário do Río de la Plata (RdlP) e a plataforma continental adjacente exibem processos hidrológicos complexos, controlados principalmente pela forçante climática regional em interação com o sistema oceanográfico, o que resulta em grande variabilidade da descarga fluvial e do fornecimento de materiais terrígenos ao sistema oceânico. Estudos hidrológicos anteriores indicam que a Pequena Idade do Gelo e a Anomalia Climática Medieval resultaram no aumento / diminuição do escoamento do rio devido a um regime de precipitação aumentado/ enfraquecido. Este estudo tem como objetivo analisar a ciclicidade no fornecimento continental condicionada por oscilações climáticas nos últimos 1.000 anos e com mudanças no caudal do RdlP. Com este objetivo, foi estudado um testemunho de sedimentos, com 10 m de comprimento, obtido no depósito lodoso do RdlP. O testemunho apresenta uma taxa de acumulação extremamente alta e razoavelmente constante de 1,1 cm ano-1. Foram efetuadas análises elementares de XRF, com resolução de 1 cm, das razões Fe/K, Ti/Al, Fe/Ca, Ti/Ca e Si/Al, consideradas como proxies regionais para inferência de suprimento fluvial. As ciclicidades de recorrência mais significativas ocorreram há 215, 192, 115, 100, 49, 47, 37, 35 e 2,5-8 anos. A ciclicidade mais longas, persentes ao longo de todo o registro, estão provavelmente relacionadas com o forçamento solar, ou seja, com o ciclo de 200 anos de Vries/Suess, que determina a atividade do Sistema de Monção Sul-Americana. As ciclidades mais curtas (˂100 anos) estão provavelmente relacionadas com a Oscilação Multidecadal Atlântica, Oscilação Decadal do Pacífico e fenômeno El Niño-Oscilação Sul, tendo sido registrados por mudanças nos valores das razões Ti/Al, Fe/K e Si/Al. Além disso, identificámos uma intensificação de tais ciclicidades, relacionadas com o clima, nos últimos 500 anos BP. Este estudo fornece novas evidências de que tanto as temperaturas superficiais do oceano Pacífico e Atlântico tropicais, como o forçamento solar, são as causas principais responsáveis pelas mudanças na precipitação no sudeste da América do Sul, á escala interanual a decadal, multidecadal e centenária, e modulam a descarga do Río de la Plata.</jats:p>"

Then, a hierarchical planning model was established. This model did not consider the starting efficiency of the WPP, but it did consider the layout of the energy storage in the WPP and the balance of the terminal voltage when starting the WPP. Finally, the feasibility and value of the proposed method and model were verified in a 49.5 MW WPP with an ESS (a power rating of 2.24 MW and energy capacity of about 1.68 MWh). The result suggests that configuring an ESS with a small capacity on the side of the turbine can achieve black-start for a WPP with an ESS as the power source.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a new framework of crowdsourcing supply chain for fast fashion industry. First, a basic multiperiod order model is established in a crowdsourcing supply chain system, where a garment maker chooses the best one among available solutions submitted by online designers (i.e., crowdsources) in each period, then transforms it into finished product, and sells to consumers through a retailer. Second, we extend this model by integrating the factors of capital turnover, the retailer’s risk-aversion, and the garment maker’s minimum production quantity. Moreover, utilizing wholesale price, buyback, and profit-sharing scheme designs a mixed contract for coordinating crowdsourcees, retailer, and garment maker of crowdsourcing supply chain for achieving Pareto optimality. The models help the garment maker determining the optimal production quantities of crowdsourcing designed products and enable the retailer placing the optimum orders and setting the reasonable risk level. In addition, we also find that the incentive policy for crowdsourcing designers can be fulfilled by using a profit-sharing scheme with a piecewise function of order quantity instead of a linear function.</jats:p>",
