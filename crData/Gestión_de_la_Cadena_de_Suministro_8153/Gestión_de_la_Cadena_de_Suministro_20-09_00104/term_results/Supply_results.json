However, recent developments in healthcare render this understanding too narrow. This chapter broadens the definition of supply chains in healthcare ecosystems by using concepts from traditional supply chains and supply chain management. The chapter groups healthcare supply chains into four main categories: health services, pharmaceutical, special health services, and health humanitarian supply chains. Next, the chapter discusses the key strategies, challenges, and risks as well as the existing research for these categories. The chapter concludes with a short discussion on future research.</jats:p>"

It also introduces some commonly used empirical methods and databases, and provides the corresponding financial theoretical basis for the conclusions of these studies. Finally, the chapter suggests a new angle to fully utilize the supply chain structure to identify the competitor relationship and the competition intensity. The chapter indicates that higher supply chain overlap increases the correlation of the competitors’ economic performance, suggesting that sharing supply chains reduce competition. This conclusion is helpful for entrepreneurs to better manage firm competitions.</jats:p>"

To better understand these phenomena, we discuss the rationale behind the increase in cyberattacks carried out through supply networks, along with common attack methods and common archetypes. The chapter also discusses how supply managers can modify their sourcing strategy to stymie these attacks. This will involve a discussion of supplier selection, supplier scorecards, basic cybersecurity standards, and working in cross-functional teams.</jats:p>"

However, ignoring the problem is likely to have the effect of encouraging counterfeiters to go unchecked. A multilayered strategy that adopts several approaches and engages the entire organization is needed to address the counterfeiting problem. This chapter provides a set of recommendations to address the issue of counterfeiting. Initially, the size of the problem must be estimated and the return on investment approximated. This can help define the need for a team of experts to work in this area, leading to a set of performance metrics that are aligned with business objectives and outcomes. Next, the key focal product segments should be targeted and a system for identifying products through product trademark registration with customs authorities should be completed. In the end, combating counterfeiting is not a supply chain problem, it is not a legal problem, nor is it a packaging and covert marking problem. It is a global problem—one that impacts all organizations, large and small. All business functions need to be part of the discussion, not just a single brand security function. Failure to approach counterfeiting in this manner will simply allow the problem to continue to grow.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interplay between informal and formal mechanisms has frequently been analyzed in the general management and supply chain management disciplines. The same is true for linkages between past and present events. However, the extant supply management literature largely conceptualizes formal cross‐functional sourcing collaborations as free from influences emanating from prior encounters. This compartmentalization is in sharp contrast to sociology and social psychology research, which demonstrates that overlooking previous interactions limits our understanding of team dynamics. Boundary‐spanning supply managers continually engage in formal and informal interactions with colleagues from other functions both before and during formal collaborations in sourcing teams. Our research focuses on the effects of <jats:italic>informal</jats:italic> exchanges that have taken place <jats:italic>prior to</jats:italic> the formal establishment of the sourcing team. We investigate how a colleague from another function reacts to a supply manager’s rejection of informal advice, and how the supply manager can mitigate the potential negative effects of this reaction on future formal sourcing collaborations. We use social exchange theory and impression management theory to derive hypotheses, a scenario‐based experiment to test the hypotheses, and a sequential explanatory strategy based on interviews to delve more deeply into the experimental findings. The results suggest that previous informal advice‐rejection reduces both an advisor’s willingness to provide formal advice to the advice‐receiving supply manager in an ensuing cross‐functional sourcing team and the expected cohesion of such a team, as compared to when the advice was heeded. We differentiate between five types of advisees’ mitigation strategies and find that the negative implications can be mitigated but that the degree of mitigation effectiveness partly depends on the advisor’s expertise level.</jats:p>",

This chapter proposes the addition of one more function to that list—to fund. As a result of technology supporting financial firms, such as banks and financial technology firms, the supply chain has become the least expensive source of capital available to a firm. Corporate executives increasingly rely on the supply chain as a source of capital. A typical supply chain has three major flows: product, information, and finances. These three flows can vary in importance depending on the environment and supply chain structure. Most of the supply chain management literature focuses on products and information flows and pays minimal attention to the financial side of supply chain management. This chapter views supply chain financing as a bigger concept than the concept commonly known as supply chain finance. Supply chain financing focuses on how to use the supply chain to fund the organization and how to use the organization to fund the supply chain. The goal of supply chain financing is to ensure liquidity within supply chains by helping the buyer and supplier organizations conserve their own capital by injecting liquidity from sources that previously were not known or available.</jats:p>"

The overall aim of the research described in this paper is to generate fresh insights into the impacts of digitalisation on the design and management of global supply chains. It focuses on understanding the current adoption rate of new technologies in global supply chains, identifying perceived opportunities and challenges and clarifying the critical factors driving (and inhibiting) their deployment. The authors administered an online survey with a global sample of respondents from various supply chain functions, resulting in a sample of 142 responses. Significant differences emerged in adoption patterns between companies of different sizes. Moreover, the study pointed to a widening gap (or a ‘digital divide’) between leaders and laggards in terms of technology adoption. Perceived benefits and challenges also differ notably between companies of varying sizes. Adoption patterns are very diverse across specific technologies. The results further suggest that there is a significant correlation between adoption of digital technologies and different dimensions of company performance.</jats:p>"

It argues for the use of technologies such as radiofrequency identification to realize the full potential of tracking every product and component in the supply chain, from its origin to its manufacture, use, and disposal on a real-time basis. The inherent advantages of blockchains remove the need for a central authority and promote decentralization of record keeping, hence increasing the integrity and security of the data. Blockchains by themselves are a platform that enables the transmission and sharing of data across the supply chain in a secure, fast, and robust manner. The technology works best when used with other data-capturing devices such as radiofrequency identification, which are already in use at different echelons of a supply chain. The chapter concludes by arguing that emergent technologies like the Internet of things work best by incorporating blockchains, because that would prevent the abuse of data by centralized systems and authorities and at the same time reduce the critical points of failure that centralized systems are prone to.</jats:p>"

For decades, gender inequity in supply chains was a “hidden” problem in several sectors, but in the early twenty-first century it is an overt challenge for supply chain management. Gender inequity exists in supply chains when there is low participation of women-owned businesses in supply, a clear wage inequity along the supply chain, and the identification of modern slavery or forced labor related to gender in any tier of a supply chain. A future agenda for gender issues in supply chains should address a range of issues, from the increase in the number of women-owned suppliers and its impacts, to equalization of income among genders throughout supply chains, to complete eradication of modern slavery in local and global supply chains.</jats:p>"

Being able to have sight and scope of the performance of each area of the supply chain at any given time is key to an efficient successful functioning supply chain. This paper reviews how we implemented a control tower structure within the supply chain at Dormakaba UK. Dormakaba is a worldwide organisation manufacturing access solutions with presence in over 130 countries. Within the UK, the company employs over 500 across two main sites and eight satellite sites, with a turnover of over £85m. Understanding data flow within all areas and getting engagement with operational team members and supervisors is very important. Supervisors need to deal with operational data on a day-to-day basis, yet at the same time interact with managers and organisational goals, which makes their engagement paramount. The operational data is managed and viewed on a departmental control tower by each separate supervisor, which automatically feeds a manager and director level control tower, so that all people at all levels can view relevant performance and predicted performance against agreed key performance indicators (KPIs) in all supply chain areas. Regular meetings to review control towers invariably drive discussions on improvement ideas and projects, so an additional tool for collaboration was required. We adopted Microsoft Teams as a tool to log and review improvement ideas, task management and to chat to our teams across sites and departments. Obviously, there are always options to improve the structure and the ongoing challenge is to drive automated data across all departments at source, while always seeking to improve fast adoptive collaboration across the supply chain in order to be as proactive as possible in continuous improvement.</jats:p>"

This shift requires that the current human resource management (HRM) practices change in accordance with the future role of the worker. To date, HRM has been focused on identifying workers who are well suited for performing tasks that improve efficiencies of the firm. Instead, new HRM practices need to focus on acquiring and managing the workforce that leverages Industry 4.0 technologies. This chapter identifies the changing landscape of work with respect to supply chain management. Specifically, it identifies the changes that will be ushered in for operations, procurement, logistics, and customer management as a result of Industry 4.0 technologies. Next, the chapter identifies the skills gap, reorganization of work, and changing role of blue- and white-collar workers involved in Industry 4.0 technology usage in daily work. Finally, it provides a framework that can be used by HRM professionals to acquire and reskill their workforce using the ability–motivation–opportunity framework.</jats:p>"

IWS causes several adverse consequences on the network operation, resulting in ineffective supply and demand management. This paper presents a survival analysis of the network elements, including water mains, service connections, and valves using the Kaplan-Meier approach to determine the survival probability and the probability of failure rates of events of interest. The objective is to explore the changes in failure rates of network elements after implementing an IWS scheme. The non-parametric survival method is applied to the large zone (Zone-5) of the WDN in Tehran (Iran) based on the frequency of failures before, during, and after the implementation of an IWS regime. The results show that the probability of failure rates significantly increase after implementing the IWS scheme, and can remain for several years after, even when the network returns to continuous water supply (CWS). The results of this study can assist utility managers to understand the detrimental effects of IWS systems on increasing failure rates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Today, McDonald’s The Netherlands runs 80 per cent of the supply chain in a different way from three years ago. That qualifies as a transformation — a radical 180-degree change. This paper is about how supply chain management can earn a seat at the table. It describes how change came about in McDonald’s — and the efforts it took. It is about the transition of supply chain management moving away from the ‘serving’ role of (just) getting the necessary things done to keep the restaurant business operation going. It is about learning how to be a driving force, playing a central role in the organisation. The paper presents a new approach to supply chain management: the idea, the practice, with the pros and cons, and the current outlook. This approach is based on three key steps: 1) creating strong alignment on shared goals between all stakeholders connected to supply chain, the balancing act of ‘the doughnut of stakeholders’; 2) building a new skill set for supply chain professionals to take a central role in this balancing act, geared towards seamless cooperation and better results; and 3) fully utilising and empowering all internal and external stakeholders within the supply chain system. Over the past three years, the supply chain department of McDonald’s The Netherlands has moved towards a new position as facilitator and manager of a dialogue-style process of innovation, development and progress. In this position, supply chain management drives meaningful change while taking into account the needs and interests of all stakeholders ‘in the doughnut’. In the new approach, no stakeholder gets told what to do; supply chain management is the neutral and respected facilitator of change and innovation. It has led to a new way of working, a new positioning internally and, most importantly, a more future-proof supply chain organisation that yields better results, both commercially and in terms of sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic is causing risks and disruptions in most supply chains. As supply chain managers are responding to these risks, several theories may inform those efforts. In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed.</jats:p>"

After consulting with external entities, a team of cross-functional internal stakeholders assessed the needs of the procurement organisation and designed a structured plan to build and roll out the learning academy. Careful planning and design resulted in a robust curriculum to address the needs of all levels in the organisation. Many forms of training are provided through the academy, including classroom training led by both internal and external instructors and customisable online self-led courses. The success of the academy will rely on on-going support and prioritisation from the organisation’s management. The academy is in its relative infancy but initial internal feedback is positive. The results of the programme implementation will continue to be assessed over time. Plans are in place to continue to grow the programme by expanding the scope of its offerings. The benefits of attraction, engagement and retention are expected to be enjoyed by both the employees and the organisation for years to come. This paper intends to relay the process that was followed to innovate and implement the procurement academy at Bombardier Aviation and share the keys to success and lessons learned along the journey.</jats:p>"

Restaurants and other food service operations closed almost overnight, leaving farmers with millions of dollars of excess lettuce. Because of the rigid value chain, farmers were forced to decide whether to harvest their crops for donation, try to find new customers, or plow their crops under. Close working and living conditions increase farmworkers’ risk of contracting COVID-19. Though many operations have implemented safety measures to protect farmworkers from COVID-19 in the short-term, larger structural changes must be made to provide workers with fair wages, access to health insurance and paid time off, and affordable housing. This review outlines the current value chain of lettuce in the U.S. and the disruptions caused by COVID-19, analyzes the impacts on farmworker health and safety, and offers recommendations for a more resilient lettuce value chain.</jats:p>",

The COVID-19 has progressed rapidly throughout United States. Vulnerable communities including the African American and other social communities have been particularly affected by the virus. As medicines are being developed as a possible cure and preventive medicines, the challenge is how to get these important medicines to the communities that are most at risk, especially in the under-represented minority (URM) community. This study aimed to create a supply chain that prioritizes geographic sections that house vulnerable communities to prevent and minimize the impacts of COVID-19. We collaborated with the Houston Department of Health and Human Services to capture the data needed to model a community that has these challenges. We created a supply chain model for the city of Houston that prioritizes geographic sections in the city that house vulnerable communities. We defined the “COVID-19 Community Health Index” (C-19 CHI) which we used to parameterize the supply chain mixed integer program (MIP). The outcome of this study helped us in prioritizing those communities that need the medicinals the most. This information can be used in our healthcare supply chain model to ensure timely delivery of medicines and supplies to COVID-19 patients that are the most vulnerable and hence the overall impact of COVID-19 can be minimized.</jats:p>"

Entscheider in Unternehmen der Lebensmittelproduktion und -logistik im deutschsprachigen Raum wurden in einer Online-Umfrage zu den Themen Resilienz, Digitalisierung, Transparenz und Produktrückverfolgung sowie Chancen und Risiken von Blockchain-Technologie befragt. Der vorliegende Beitrag präsentiert die Ergebnisse der Online-Umfrage zur Resilienz und erweitert diese um bivariate Analysen zur Resilienz im Hinblick auf die Digitalisierung. Resilienz wird hier verstanden als Komplex aus Robustheit und Anpassungsfähigkeit und flexible Reaktion auf Störungen und disruptive Veränderungen. Bisher ist wenig über das Thema Resilienz in kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen der Lebensmittelproduktion und -logistik bekannt. Der vorliegende Beitrag füllt diese Lücke und analysiert Faktoren der Resilienz (Unterbrechungen in der Wertschöpfungskette, Störungen im Unternehmen, Verwundbarkeit und Bewältigungskapazitäten), Indikatoren der Resilienz sowie die Zusammenhänge mit dem Digitalisierungsgrad in diesen Unternehmen. Ziel der Analyse ist ein Lagebild der Resilienz und der Digitalisierung in Lebensmittelproduktion und -logistik und eine Grundlage zu schaffen, um mögliche Auswirkungen voranschreitender Digitalisierung auf die Lebensmittelversorgung abschätzen zu können.</jats:p>",

We examine the intensity of these relationships in a green supply chain context. This study aims to figure out the effects of green market orientation (GMO), green supply chain relationship quality (GRQ), and green absorptive capacity (GAC) on green competitive advantage (GCA) in a supply chain. We find a significant positive association between these constructs. It highlights the importance of antecedents such as GMO, GRQ, and GAC on improving GCA. We jointly investigate the effects of GMO, GRQ, and GAC on green supply chain competitive advantage. This study uses Process Macro 2.15 to test the mediation effect between GMO and GCA. The result shows that GRQ and GAC completely mediate the relationship between GMO and GCA and that the effect sizes are 0.11 and 0.20, respectively. This study also reruns the model to clarify whether competing models are better than our model. However, the performance of such a competing model is poor. Finally, we accept our model instead of the competing model. GMO and GRQ among team managers and employees appear to contribute positively to GCA. Although GAC does not directly influence GCA, GMO has a significant total effect on GCA when intervened by GRQ and GAC. The key contribution is that green market orientation, i.e., the employee culture and the emphasis on being environmentally responsible, is a key antecedent to GRQ, GAC, and GCA. Managerial implications of the findings are listed.</jats:p>"

While previous studies mainly focused on preventing or mitigating conflict, this study examines the micro‐processes of buyer–supplier conflicts and the mechanisms that facilitate functional conflict processes. Specifically, we examine how a buyer’s conflict expression in the way disagreements are conveyed influences a supplier’s willingness to adapt its internal processes in favor of the buyer. By means of a multi‐method, sequential research design, combining insights from a case study and a scenario‐based experiment, we found that expressions of entrenchment by the buyer negatively affect supplier adaptation. In addition, a buyer that is direct, while at the same time expressing openness to the supplier’s position, is shown to positively influence supplier adaptation. We also demonstrate the mediating effects of the supplier’s emotions in these relationships. Our findings contribute to the supply chain literature by demonstrating the relevance of conflict expression in enabling adaptive processes. In addition, our insights into the interplay between different expression dimensions extend conflict expression theory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Many governments are aiming to extend working lives by raising the age at which people can claim retirement pensions. This makes it vital to understand how these policies affect retirement decisions. In this paper, I revisit the labor supply effects of a major Australian reform that increased women’s pension age from 60 to 65. Atalay and Barrett (2015) studied these effects using repeated household surveys and a differences-in-differences design in which male cohorts form the comparison group. They estimate that the reform increased female labor force participation by 12 percentage points. Using earlier data, I show that the parallel-trends assumption did not hold before the reform because of a strong female-speciﬁc trend in participation rates across the relevant cohorts. Accounting for this trend, the estimated effect on female participation falls by two-thirds and becomes statistically insigniﬁcant at conventional levels. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing and controlling for trends across cohorts when evaluating pension reforms, which are typically phased in across cohorts.</p>"

Based on the literature on the subject, one defines the entrepreneurial management concept showing the influence of entrepreneurial management on company operation. Moreover, the paper also outlines the most important concepts of the project supply chain and presents the functioning scheme. Theoretical considerations concerning contemporary theories of entrepreneurial management and project supply chain are the prelude to presenting the concept of entrepreneurial management. The presented approach can be found helpful for the effective management of the project supply chain, which has not yet been thoroughly defined. It should be mentioned that the designed model of the entrepreneurial supply chain management is an original proposal for the paradigm of project supply chains. Both in a classical and project supply chain, a significant role is given to the flow of material resources between the individual chain components. It determines that the project supply chain is mainly driven by the need for its members’ value increase. It was explained that regarding entrepreneurial competences, knowledge can be transferred to other organizations in the whole supply chain. It was also mentioned that the project supply chain’s entrepreneurial management takes into account the flexibility manifesting itself through the establishment of agile project teams, and by focusing on human relationships. It is the basis for the presented concept of the entrepreneurial management model of the project supply chain.\nAcknowledgmentThe project is financed within the framework of the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education under the name “Regional Excellence Initiative” in the years 2019–2022; project number 001/RID/2018/19; the amount of financing PLN 10,684,000.00.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholars have called attention to the dark side of collaborative buyer–supplier relationships (BSRs). For instance, the loss of objectivity, relational inertia, and redundant knowledge bases emerging from too much collaboration may result in declining performance. We extend this line of research by investigating the feasibility of potential mitigating mechanisms. Drawing from the literature on governance in inter‐organizational relationships and the interviews with practitioners that have experienced the dark side, we have identified three mechanisms: challenging goals, contractual explicitness, and expectation of continuity. We examine these mechanisms empirically through two consecutive studies. The first study collected data on 132 buying firms and 28 matched suppliers from two sources (survey and archival database). The results provide support for challenging goals and contractual explicitness but offer mixed results for expectation of continuity. The data also allow us to identify buyers suffering from excessive collaboration with their suppliers. In the second study, we gathered qualitative data on five pairs of such buyers and their matched suppliers. Different pairs show different behaviors. Some buyer and supplier firms seem unaware of their predicament, while others are grappling with fighting back the dark side. This qualitative study also offers additional manifestations of the dark side and mechanisms beyond the ones examined in our first study and explains why expectation of continuity received mixed results. This research advances the BSR literature by demonstrating that it is possible to mitigate the dysfunctionalities emerging from too much collaboration and by providing some evidence for its subtle manifestations. It also reveals the managerial complexity surrounding the dark side and provides future research directions for this important topic.</jats:p>",

Blood, like fresh produce, is a perishable element, with platelets having a limited lifetime of five days and red blood cells lasting 42 days. To manage the blood supply chain more effectively under demand and supply uncertainty, it is of considerable importance to developing a practical blood supply chain model. This paper proposed an essential blood supply chain model under demand and supply uncertainty. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. This study focused on how to manage the blood supply chain under demand and supply uncertainty effectively. A stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the blood supply chain is proposed. Furthermore, this study conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the impacts of the coefficient of demand and supply variation and the cost parameters on the average total cost and the performance measures (units of shortage, outdated units, inventory holding units, and purchased units) for both the blood center and hospitals. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. Based on the results, the hospitals and the blood center can choose the optimal ordering policy that works best for them. From the results, we observed that when the coefficient of demand and supply variation is increased, the expected supply chain cost increased with more outdating units, shortages units, and holding units due to the impacts of supply and demand fluctuation. Variation in the inventory holding and expiration costs has an insignificant effect on the total cost. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. The model developed in this paper can assist managers and pathologists at the blood donation centers and hospitals to determine the most efficient inventory policy with a minimum cost based on the uncertainty of blood supply and demand. The model also performs as a decision support system to help health care professionals manage and control blood inventory more effectively under blood supply and demand uncertainty, thus reducing shortage of blood and expired wastage of blood.</jats:p>",

The current study sought to establish the influence of supply risk assessment on the performance of humanitarian supply chains in Somalia with a keen focus on the International Red Cross. The study used a descriptive research design. 102 ICR employees operating in Somalia were the target population. The research adopted a technique of census while using a questionnaire to gather primary data. To guarantee validity and reliability, the questionnaire was pre-tested. Using descriptive and inferential statistics data was analyzed and displayed in tables. Key findings of the study included IRC had developed better dispute resolution mechanisms arising from their strategic partnership with their 3PL providers, the organization had enhanced its procurement processes due to its effective assessment of 3PL providers' capacities resulting in minimal supply risk exposure. From correlation analysis, it was established that there existed a strong and positive correlation between supply risk assessment of 3PL Providers and the performance of the ICR supply chain (r = 0.708**, p=.000). The study concluded that for enhanced performance of the supply chain 3PL providers should deliver requisitions on time and at desired locations as per orders.

It often operates abnormally in an emergent risk situation, resulting in shortage or suspension of water supply, even health risk and economic losses. In order to reduce negative impacts posed by these potential threats, identifying and evaluating possible risks in a water supply system has been becoming more necessary. For this reason, we establish two risk assessment models in accordance with two different situations based on uncertainty theory in the presence of insufficient historical data. In the proposed models, we first discuss emergency in three respects: the possibility of emergency occurrence, the consequence caused by emergency and system vulnerability. Then the risk to a water supply system is defined by the uncertain measure of loss-positive by incorporating a risk tolerance index and loss function contributed by the above analysis.

Emerging markets play a major role in the global economy as sources of raw materials, producers of finished goods, and potential markets for goods and services. The efficacy of logistics and supply chain activities is crucial to facilitating global commerce. Yet, there is insufficient knowledge of the intricacies of logistics and supply chain operations in emerging markets in the mainstream supply chain literature. This chapter draws from various literature sources and case examples to discuss logistics challenges and success stories of logistics operations in emerging markets. We contextualize our investigation within the framework of economic, political, infrastructure, competency, and social–cultural factors as they relate to and influence logistics operations in emerging markets. We conclude the chapter by discussing imminent challenges that are yet to be overcome as well as potential opportunities to improve logistics and supply chain operations in emerging markets in the future.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the agricultural product supply chain based on the Internet of Things has gradually received attention. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of perception data fusion of agricultural products supply chain based on internet of things. In order to study the application of perception data fusion of agricultural products supply chain based on Internet of things, this paper analyzes the status quo of agricultural products industry traceability platform and extracts other product supply modes based on the Internet of things technology. After analysis and comparison, it comes to the perception data fusion mode suitable for the agricultural product supply chain, and uses the information technology based on the internet of things to carry out the agricultural product circulation process Internet of things transformation and process optimization. The results show that the application of data fusion based on the internet of things can solve 69.45% of the agricultural products whose origins are unknown and cannot be traced, improve the supply efficiency of agricultural products by 43%, reduce the health problems of agricultural products by 31.24%, reduce the prices of agricultural products by 13%-20%, improve the logistics efficiency and save about 5 million tons of agricultural products.

Over the 20 years examined, measurement programs produced 3,124 doctoral graduates, and across this time span, the annual production of graduates nearly doubled. This supply expansion can largely be attributed to the increase in the number of international graduates, which outpaced the annual growth rate of domestic PhD recipients by 156%. Moreover, 85% of graduates were found to either self-identify as White or Asian. Less than 10 Hispanic and no more than 20 Black graduates were produced in any of the years examined. Of the 76% of graduates that reported having a job offer or accepted a position upon graduation, most entered the academy despite the overall average starting salary ($59,484) being considerably lower than the starting salary for their counterparts entering industry ($84,918), government ($69,970), or other educational institutions ($81,428).</p>"

The total cost of owner-ship for a drilling campaign can be reduced in the range of 10-30% related to tubulars across the en-tire supply chain. In recent decades, the strategy of OCTG supply has seen an improvement resulting in significant cost savings by employing the integrated tubular supply chain management. Such method integrates the demand and supply planning of OCTG of several wells in a drilling project and synergize the infor-mation between the pipes manufacturer and drilling operators to optimize the deliveries, minimizing inventory levels and safety stocks. While the capital cost of carrying the inventory of OCTG can be reduced by avoiding the procurement of substantial volume upfront for the entire project, several hidden costs by carrying this inventory can also be minimized. These include storage costs, maintenance costs, and costs associated to stock obsolescence. Digital technologies also simplify the tasks related to the traceability of the tubulars since the release of the pipes from the manufacturing facility to the rig floor. Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) risks associated to pipe movements on the rig can be minimized. Pipe-by-pipe traceability provides pipes’ history and their properties on demand. Digitalization of the process has proven to simplify back end administrative tasks. The paper reviews the OCTG supply methods and lays out tangible improvement factors by employ-ing an alternative scheme as discussed in the paper. It also provides   an   insight on   potential cost savings based on the observed and calculated experiences from several operations in the Asia Pacific region.</jats:p>",

It is a demand for some level of co-ordination of activities and processes within and between organization in the supply chain to decrease uncertainties and increase more cost for customers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Industrial coatings are often customer-specific products, which have to be adjusted to the specific application conditions of each application plant. To meet their high specifications, typically more than 15 different raw materials are needed, and the best-fitting supplier is selected. Short lead times and relatively high transport costs require decentralised production. Minimising inventories is therefore difficult. Industry benchmarks show that mid-sized coatings companies typically have a higher ratio of inventories to sales than large companies. Internal benchmarking can reveal optimisation potential if similar-sized and positioned plants are compared on their days of inventory (DOI) as an average of the individual months. By setting DOI targets and introducing regular supply chain telephone conferences with all sites, improvements can be achieved quite easily on excessive inventories. Highlighting the percentage of expired or aged stocks within the total inventory will identify further reduction potential. Here it is important to look at gross values as financially, these expired and aged materials are often already written off. Raw material consignment stocks can be increased in cooperation with procurement while consignment stocks at customers need to be addressed together with sales. Taking these individual measures together, it is possible for even a mid-sized company to achieve a comparable performance to a large company. It is usually assumed that high inventory levels are necessary to achieve a good delivery performance. This is not necessarily true, as the better planning necessary to reduce inventories in a controlled way will also benefit demand planning. Besides, less cluttered warehouses will shorten the time for picking raw materials and increase compliance with first-in, first-out principles. This paper will give an example of how inventories were reduced in Beckers while at the same time lead times were improved. It will be demonstrated that the conventional wisdom about high inventories being necessary for a good delivery performance might be a myth when it comes to non-standardised items that are manufactured from varying raw materials. It thus could help supply chain managers in their argumentation with demanding sales colleagues.</jats:p>"

Sektor jasa di Jawa Timur yang mempunyai kontribusi tinggi dalam PDRB 2019: pariwisata, akomodasi dan makanan minuman; jasa perusahaan serta kesehatan dan sosial. Implementasi supply chain (SC) dan pengukuran kinerja diyakini dapat digunakan untuk menjaga keberlanjutan pertumbuhan industri jasa.&#x0D;\nIndustri jasa yang menerapkan SC dituntut stakeholder untuk berpihak pada masyarakat dan kelestarian lingkungan. Pada sisi lain, sektor jasa dipengaruhi oleh karakter intangibility dalam operasionalnya. Dari fenomena ini, konsep pengukuran kinerja sustainable service SC (SSSC) yang yang memperhatikan aspek ekonomi, sosial dan lingkungan serta karakter intangibility secara simultan dapat diimplementasikan guna menjaga eksistensi dan kontribusi sektor jasa di Jawa Timur. Perancangan kerangka kerja konseptual untuk pengukuran kinerja SSSC di Provinsi Jawa Timur dapat mengadopsi model pengukuran kinerja BSC yang diintegrasikan dengan DEMATEL, dimana BSC digunakan sebagai model utama dalam mengukur kinerja, sedangkan DEMATEL merancang peta strategi dalam BSC.&#x0D;\nDari kajian literatur diketahui bahwa finansial, pelanggan, operasional, informasi serta inovasi dan pembelajaran merupakan perspektif kinerja yang sering digunakan dalam pengukuran kinerja service SC sehingga dapat diadopsi. Perspektif informasi dan perspektif inovasi dan pembelajaran merupakan perspektif yang dapat menaungi indikator kinerja yang bersifat intangibility yang berorientasi pada sumberdaya manusia. Indikator aspek lingkungan yang dapat diadopsi: konsumsi energy dan air, pengelolaan limbah, konservasi alam, emisi CO2, konsep reduce, reuse dan recycle, green service dan material ramah lingkungan.&#x0D;\nPerspektif inovasi dan pertumbuhan merupakan perspektif yang paling berpengaruh karena mempengaruhi capaian kinerja dari semua perspektif.

Our approach consists in studying, respectively the automatic or discretionary nature of monetary policies, through the establishment of non-neutralization/non-sterilization monetary indices (index); and in a second step we test, using co-integration models, the evolution of monetary base in relation of Net External Asset (NFA) and in relation to the evolution of Net Domestic Assets. Our results mainly indicate the existence of a preponderance of the external sector or NFA over the evolution of the monetary base or money supply, compared to the domestic sector. In addition, we observe an automatic adjustment in both WAEMU and CEMAC over the long term. But the return to equilibrium is slower in WAEMU due to a mix of automation and discretion. On the other hand, in CEMAC, the return to equilibrium is almost automatic with a strong dependence on the external sector.</jats:p>",

Experimental tests executed for various shapes of the supply voltage but similar RMS (Root Mean Square) and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) values and for various breaking moments of the load current allowed recognition of the decisive factors for estimating the tested relay’s switching-off capacity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Reverse logistics, of reusable assets, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) or other returns, has sometimes been treated as a tactical afterthought, but not any more. Reaching reverse logistics’ impactful contribution potential is not just a dream or ideal. There is a growing trend of interest in the field of reverse logistics as its world expands beyond these tactical afterthoughts into the areas of sustainability, circular economies, collaboration and strategy. This dream will be worthwhile and influential. It is critically important that the reverse flow of products and materials (for the purpose of returns, repair, remanufacture, reuse, raw materials or recycling) be an integral part of supply chain design. Inefficiencies, capacities constraints, excess spend and shrink are just some of the challenges that can quickly arise with inadequate attention and lack of design involvement. Reverse logistics needs to be defined, measured and managed like all other core processes. But how do we best improve, configure and uplift these workflows, interactions and hardworking, forgotten professionals to solidify the economic influence that the expanded world of reverse logistics will have? Answers can be found through the thought leadership, training and strong professional networks within our trade associations such as the Association of Supply Chain Management (ASCM) which develop and fill the need for knowledge workers skilled in supply chain and strategy. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model provides a framework that also aids in this matter by integrating the four Ps (processes, performance, practices and people). This paper describes different reverse logistics scenarios to highlight the areas where supply chain professionals can add value to the company’s strategic plan. Process frameworks and best practices are incorporated with the theme of collaboration, strategic thinking and sustainability. No longer will reverse logistics just be a support role but from that supportive vantage point will become a very active role in the future strategy of the organisation. Reverse logistics is a strategic contributor to the supply chain solutions at Hillebrand.</jats:p>"

Based on a collection of housing construction data, it shows that the co-cyclical behavior of construction, prices and mortgage credit has been followed by a decoupling of house-price mortgage spirals from the underlying stagnating or declining construction activity since the 1980s. Mortgage debt is nonlinearly associated with new construction: positive up to a threshold, negative thereafter. The article argues that the increasing use of housing as an asset, or housing financialization, can explain why mortgages grow without construction, i.e. through privatization of state housing and supply restrictions as a result of rentier strategies of housing-market insiders and private developers. Private mortgage markets have thus been a less reliable policy alternative to traditional state-led housing construction policies. The article confirms for housing what has previously been found for growth or capital formation: beyond a certain threshold, there is a curse of too much finance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim. The main objective of this investigation is to explore perceived lack of Lithuanian STEM labour force supply. It is often believed that education systems are the bottleneck of economic growth and that by increasing the supply of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates we will get more and better payed jobs. But a growing body of evidence suggests that in many STEM fields there is an adequate supply or even oversupply of STEM majors. Still, technologically advanced capitalist countries advocate for more STEM workforce regardless of an overcrowded market. Echoing foreign neoliberal trends, Lithuanian education policy makers are on the same STEM shortage hype-train, and reforms are full steam ahead.&#x0D;\nMethods. To explore perceived lack of Lithuanian STEM labour force supply an assessment of STEM graduates’ (n=3720) occupational destinations one year after graduation and average salaries in those professions was conducted employing a descriptive statistical analysis.&#x0D;\nResults. Findings show that there is no general shortage of STEM labour supply; the majority (54% n=2023) of all recent STEM degree holders in Lithuania do not work in STEM jobs. The majority of graduates usually do not reach national average income one year after graduation.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Persuasion of students to study STEM degrees based on better labour market outcomes is misleading and possibly unethical. The principal theoretical implication of this paper is the acknowledgment that low STEM graduate employment does not necessarily signify a failing education system. Rather, this is an opportunity to look beyond human capital and labour market discourse which, arguably, prevents STEM education to realize its revolutionary potential.</jats:p>"

The low efficiency of energy transfer is caused by the design of a non-traction power supply line. The absence of bilateral power is typical for non-traction network 27,5 kV which consist of “two wire-rail” lines. This line is outdated technology, which does not correspond to modern requirements on the power quality, but used on AC railways with three-phase traction transformers. The purpose of the article is to investigate the methods of power supply improvements for non-traction consumers in terms of voltage unbalance, harmonic distortions and energy losses. Connection of the phasing device to delta winding traction transformer for bilateral supplying non-traction customers from network 27,5 kV is suggested in the article. The implementation of a method to increase the efficiency of electricity transmission in the non-traction network power supply allows to reduce power losses from 720 MWh / year to 441 MWh / year, the voltage unbalance from 1,9% to 1,3% and the total harmonic distortion from 8 % to 6 % respectively. Additionally, investment attractiveness of the decision was evaluated. Keywords: non-traction customers, two wire-rail line, phase coordinates, AC railway, power quality</jats:p>"

By accounting on an integrated system, warehouses can increase the accuracy and reliability of the processes. This paper analyzes the feasibility of integrated transportation and warehousing platforms from two points of view: infrastructure (e.g. physical place, geographical location) and organizational perspective (e.g. software, data, models). This paper contributes to fill the gap between practitioners and researchers about the needs of both systems. This paper found that transportation and warehousing are two inherently linked systems. However, the current practice lacks substantial improvements in data collection and modeling of these systems. Future directions point towards the use of big data and the implementation of econometric concepts (i.e. choice models), together with a spatial understanding of the impact of warehousing locations (i.e. accessibility concept) in transport costs. E-commerce, big data, and autonomous driving are the future challenges to integrating these two systems of warehousing and transportation. Finally, with the current pandemic of COVID-19, improving freight services is becoming a basic need. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the needs of integrating transportation and warehousing in the current challenging times.</jats:p>"

Thus, investment in rural drinking water points is increasing in Ethiopia. However, little is known about user satisfaction with rural drinking water points. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate determinants of the user's satisfaction with rural drinking water points in Ethiopia by considering Woliso District (Woreda) as a case study. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered with 211 randomly selected households from six rural Kebeles (administrative areas), which were selected using a stratified sampling technique. Focus group discussions (FGD) and key interviews (KI) were also held along with observation. The quantitative data were analysed through descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. The qualitative data were used to augment the results from the regression analysis. The results revealed that location of the water point, availability of guards, queueing time, service reliability, and distance significantly influence the satisfaction of users. Therefore, these significant factors should be addressed when planning water supply projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 6 presents difficulties for small island developing states such as the Kingdom of Tonga, which relies on rainwater and groundwater lenses for freshwater supply. Planning and managing water resources to supply demands in dispersed small islands under variable climate and frequent extreme events is challenging. Tensions between water planning using top-down versus bottom-up processes have long been recognized. Tonga’s overarching national planning instrument is the Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015-2025 (TSDFII). This identifies desired national outcomes and is used to direct and resource Ministries and address international and regional commitments. Water supply was a low priority in the three-month consultations that led to TSDFII. Community Development Plans (CDPs), developed by rural villages throughout Tonga’s five Island Groups over nine years, involved participation from 80% of each village population who ranked local priorities. Analysis of priorities in 117 available village CDPs reveals improvements to village water supply was the highest overall priority in all five Island Groups and ranked within the top three priorities by 76% of all villages, with women, youth and men returning figures of 83%, 66% and 80% respectively. The mismatch between top-down and bottom-up priorities appears to result from an urban/rural divide.</jats:p>"

This could explain why sustainability has been embraced by scholars who study SCM. This bibliometric review was untaken with the explicit goals of updating and extending prior reviews of research on sustainable SCM (S-SCM). The goals of this research were to document the scope and development of S-SCM research; identify influential journals, authors, and documents; analyze the intellectual structure of this field of sustainability inquiry, and highlight emerging topics on the frontier of S-SCM inquiry. By using bibliometric tools, a relatively large and rapidly growing corpus of peer-reviewed research documents concerned with S-SCM were found. Citation analyses of journals, authors, and documents yielded a surprisingly high level of scholarly content for a literature body of such recent vintage. The author co-citation analysis revealed three coherent but closely connected groups of thought that comprise the intellectual structure of this knowledge base. Finally, the analysis identified a constellation of topics concerned with the integration of internal processes (e.g., decision-making, manufacturing, sensitivity analysis, risk assessment, life-cycle assessment) and the organizational environment (e.g., climate change, gas emissions, carbon emissions, greenhouse gases, energy utilization, climate change). The results of this research concluded that SCM practitioners and scholars may have embraced sustainability more than any other field of management.</jats:p>"

Types of cattle were presented in table. Sources of supply of cattle and catchment areas for the market were depicted on maps using ARCGIS software. Based on colour of skin and castration, the major types of cattle supplied into the market are Baki (Ambala), Fari (Bunaji or White Fulani), Ja (Rahaji or Red Bororo), Galare (White-horned), Shodare (breed of white and red species), Nordi (breed of white and black species) and Bartandi (castrated). Cattle are supplied from three main sources: other countries (Niger Republic and Cameroun), other states in Nigeria (Taraba, Adamawa, Jigawa and Yobe) and within Kano State. The catchment areas are three: primary catchment area consisting of buyers within Kano State and neighbouring states, secondary catchment area including buyers largely from northeast (Gombe and Yobe States) and middle belt of Nigeria and tertiary catchment area consisting of all the states in the southern parts of the country. Recommendations given included development of market and transport infrastructure and further study on cattle transport and buyer characteristics</jats:p>"

With regard to what will discuss in this paper, the Internet of Things will increase productivity and efficiency by increasing speed and precision in decision making, reducing risk and increasing productivity and efficiency. In the future, due to the increase in the speed of life and the breadth of the Internet, the supply chain is also required to use the Internet of Things to meet the needs of the community. However, thanks to all the benefits that IOT has given us, we cannot ignore the challenges of implementing this technology. The most important of these challenges is information security. Given that the Internet of Things acts by collecting data from the environment (this information may include personal information of individuals). With these interpretations, the security of this volume of information in a way that does not reduce speed and efficiency is a serious and critical issue.</jats:p>"

This study shows the importance of integrating the two research streams by demonstrating that supply chain position moderates the relationship between TMT characteristics and sustainability and thus establishes boundary conditions for this relationship. By matching 758 corporate sustainability initiatives with control observations, our results show that the size of the top executive team and the average age of its members, two well-known predictors of corporate sustainability, are distinctly moderated by supply chain position. While business-to-business (B2B) companies are less likely to report a sustainability initiative compared to business-to-consumer (B2C) organizations, we found that B2B TMT size has a greater positive effect on sustainability initiative likelihood than B2C TMT size. Conversely, average B2C TMT age has greater predictive power in explaining sustainability initiative likelihood than average B2B TMT age. The implications of these findings in advancing corporate sustainability and organizational change are discussed.</jats:p>"

The results enable to understand if and how different supply systems of irrigation water affect the management of productive factors and inputs. These findings also provide useful information for appropriate policies aimed at preserving groundwater and its externalities, as well as at improving the economic performance of Apulian farms.</jats:p>",

Despite the considerable research on buyer-seller relationships in the marketing and management literature, only a small proportion of this has focused on procurement relationships between producers and buyers in food supply chains. Hence, this paper specifically focuses on examining the impact of relationship quality on supplier performance in the context of food supply chains. The theoretical framework is derived from the tenets of the resource-based view and the relational view of firms. Using this framework, the definition, measurement and structural dimensions of relationship quality is established in the context of food producers and buyers. This construct is then tested in relationship to supplier performance. Utilizing data from a mail survey of 954 red meat producers in New Zealand, the model of supplier-buyer relationship quality and its effects on supplier performance is tested using structural equation modelling. The results demonstrate that relationship quality is an essential factor in procurement relationships with suppliers in food supply chains and shows that, as hypothesized, higher quality relationships lead to positive performance outcomes. The results support the theoretical framework indicating that relationship quality, conceptualized and defined in this context, is indeed a valuable relational resource due to its impact on supplier performance. Managerially, this resource can be manipulated to improve supplier performance, and hence potentially provide firms with competitive advantage that has high replication barriers.</jats:p>",

A novel maize cultivating method, combining drip irrigation under film mulch cultivation and high photosynthetic efficient cultivation, is presented. NUE, WUE, accumulated temperature, plant growth and yield were determined in high photosynthetic efficient cultivation with drip irrigation under mulch and with there being under the mulch transparent and black film, respectively. As revealed from the results, the high photosynthetic efficient cultivation based on drip irrigation cultivation could increase the yield of rain-fed treatment by 53%; high photosynthetic efficient cultivation with drip irrigation under film mulch cultivation could also improve NUE and WUE compared with conventional drip irrigation under film mulch cultivation; transparent mulch could more significantly raise the soil temperature than black mulching, as well as improving the maize yield. The present study presents a novel planting mode in accordance with reliable theory to sustainably develop maize.</jats:p>",

According to various climate change scenarios, it is reported that in the future, Korea's climate is likely to increase in temperature with increasing rainfall. This increase in temperature will have a big impact on evapotranspiration. The occurrence of drought begins mainly with two causes: lack of rainfall or an increase in evapotranspiration. Therefore, in this study, the impact of climate change on future droughts is revealed through the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI). These two drought indices with different characteristics are used to examine the trend of future drought, and a drought Severity-Duration-Frequency (SDF) curve was derived to quantitatively analyze the depth of future drought. Future droughts are projected by applying future climate data generated from various climate models.</jats:p>",

It uses the What, Who, Where, When, How, and Why (5W+1H) pattern to formulate research objectives and questions. The review considers publications since 2015, and it includes 187 papers published in 2017, 2018, 2019, and the early part of 2020, since no significant publications were found in the year 2015 or 2016 on this subject. It proposes a reusable classification framework—emerging technology literature classification level (ETLCL) framework—based on grounded theory and the technology readiness level for conducting literature reviews in various focus areas of an emerging technology. Subsequently, the study uses ETLCL to classify the literature on our focus area. The results show traceability and transparency as the key benefits of applying blockchain technology. They also indicate a heightened interest in blockchain-based information systems for sustainable supply chain management starting since 2017. This paper offers invaluable insights for managers and leaders who envision sustainability as an essential component of their business. The findings demonstrate the disruptive power and role of blockchain-based information systems. Given the relative novelty of the topic and its scattered literature, the paper helps practitioners examining its various aspects by directing them to the right information sources.</jats:p>"

The proposed method is tested on two different water distribution benchmark networks with different sensor placements. For each considered network, a considerable amount of contamination scenarios with randomly selected contamination parameters were simulated and water quality time series of network sensors were obtained. Pollution scenarios were defined by randomly generated pollution source location, pollution starting time, duration of injection and the chemical intensity of the pollutant. Sensor layout's influence, demand uncertainty and imperfect sensor measurements were also investigated to verify the robustness of the method. The proposed approach shows high accuracy in localizing the potential sources of pollution, thus greatly reducing the complexity of the water supply network contamination detection problem.</jats:p>",

Any inappropriate selection of the vendors may lead to severe issues in the supply chain network. Hence, the desire to develop a model that minimizes the combination of transportation, deliveries, and ordering costs under uncertainty situation. In this paper, a multi-objective vendor selection problem under fuzzy environment is solved using a fuzzy goal programming approach. The vendor selection problem was modeled as a multi-objective problem, including three primary objectives of minimizing the transportation cost; the late deliveries; and the net ordering cost subject to constraints related to aggregate demand; vendor capacity; budget allocation; purchasing value; vendors’ quota; and quantity rejected. The proposed model input parameters are considered to be LR fuzzy numbers. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated with simulated data using R statistical package based on a real-life case study which was analyzed using LINGO 16.0 optimization software. The decision on the vendor’s quota allocation and selection under different degree of vagueness in the information was provided. The proposed model can address realistic vendor selection problem in the fuzzy environment and can serve as a useful tool for multi-criteria decision-making in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

A supply chain designed to minimize risks enables firms to establish a competitive position and provides long-term benefits to stakeholders.

Global sales of passenger cars are forecast to fall to 59.5 million units in 2020, down from a peak of 79.6 in 2017. The SCRM system should be structured to manage both routine and extraordinary risks, such as economical crisis, global pandemic issues, or even other unexpected event. The risks should be managed both reactively, by monitoring changes in the chain, the needs of customers, technology and the strategies of suppliers and competitors, among others, to enable quick reaction to events; and proactively, to identify risks and implement actions to prevent them or minimize their impacts. The basic risk management process consists of identifying, evaluating, mitigating and controlling risks. The objective of this paper is to analyze how SCRM could manages the risk factors in Automotive Industry’s supply chain in three different segmentation perspective. To achieve this aim, we performed a qualitative, applied and exploratory field study of the development trend of automotive Industry across the world, Asia, and Indonesia in terms of gaining more insight about the latest development trend of SCRM implementation in various segmentation.

Statistical and econometric analysis was carried out by the method of generalization, grouping, systematic approach, the role and place of factors influencing the growth of product supply in agrarian market. The methodology used is based on econometric analysis of time series. The first step involves the formation of an order of integration of variables included in the model and utilizing several unit root tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests. The cointegration approach is based on the ARDL model and the boundary test. The relative volatility of some indicators, which indirectly depends on oil prices, has led to some limitations in the study. The originality of the research is a complex statistical and econometric analysis of the factors influencing the increase of product supply in the domestic agricultural market, and the scientific novelty is the determination of the dependence of product supply in the agricultural sector on government support, including investment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The formation of money supply is influenced by the policy of \"cheap money\" and the emission of the significant amount of money in the modern world economy. Modification of the money supply mechanism is accompanied by an unprecedented increase of the transactions with derivative financial instruments, accelerated growth of debt in global scale. This modification leads to the global imbalances, including the gap between the financial and the real spheres, increasing risks as to national economies as to world economy.\nThe purpose of the article is to determine the peculiarities of modern modification of the mechanism of money supply in the world economy and the risks, that this modification causes.\nThe study used such methods as analysis, synthesis, scientific abstraction, induction to identify the main characteristics of modern modification of money supply; comparison; generalization to make conclusions relating to the evaluation of modern tendencies and the essence of the process of money supply modification.\nResults. The concept of \"global liquidity\" and its modern structure have been specified. The global liquidity has been considered as the total amount of means of payment in world currencies, as well as financial instruments that can be exchanged for these means of payment in the shortest time and with minimal costs. The changes of structure and volume of global liquidity influence on the modification of money supply, imbalances between real and financial sectors of global economy. The peculiarities of the mechanism of modification of the money supply in the world economy are revealed, among these peculiarities are following: growth of possibilities of money multiplication in the system of credit institutions; increasing trade by structured financial products and thus masking the growth of debts; the geographical, quantitative and qualitative imbalances in the supply and demand of global liquidity; increase of Basel standards role in regulating the multiplication of money in the network of commercial banks, and changing the tools of the state monetary policy. Such modification is accompanied by a singular increase of debt in a global scale, possibilities of transformation of private financial institutions debt into public debt, unpredictable fluctuations in cryptocurrencies market, increasing the value of global liquidity through cryptocurrencies, instability of the global financial system, growth of risks of global financial crises.\nConclusions. Further studies of the modification of the money supply mechanism in the world economy should take into account changes in the composition of reserve currencies due to the growth and strengthening of individual economies, the impact on the volume and structure of global liquidity according to Basel III standards, their effectiveness in reducing risks of global financial instability.\nKeywords: money, money supply, bank, loan, debt, global liquidity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the green supply chain has become an exciting concept in academic societies. This paper focuses on the optimal production decisions of two competing supply chains from the perspective of green degree. The manufacturers in each supply chain have two options—producing a green product or a non-green product. Game theory is applied to study four decision scenarios, which are derived from the difference in the products of the two supply chains. This study investigates the influence of inter-supply-chain competition on the wholesale price, green degree, and profits of the supply chain members. The results indicate that the inter-supply-chain competition has a negative correlation with the wholesale price. The inter-supply-chain competition has a significant impact on green degree in the four decision scenarios. In addition, green products are not always the dominant strategy of manufacturers. Both the competitors’ product decisions and the degree of inter-supply-chain competition should be considered. Finally, weak inter-supply-chain competition is beneficial to the leader supply chain, while strong competition is beneficial to the follower supply chain.</jats:p>"

Besides tapping into entrepreneurial innovations through traditional collaboration models such as corporate venture capital or R&amp;D alliances, firms have increasingly begun engaging with startups upon supplier relationships. These buyer–supplier relationships, which are asymmetric by nature, create opportunities for both sides to access, leverage, and combine a partner’s complementary resources as well as to apply new and valuable capabilities, which may ultimately lead to a mutual competitive advantage. However, many attributes that make startups highly attractive partners for increasing the productivity of processes or the innovativeness of products create substantial challenges for buying firms when collaborating with these young firms. Recent empirical evidence suggests that startups are increasingly considered as a new supplier type, which requires the adaptation of conventional supplier management processes and practices by buying firms to achieve desired relationship outcomes. Against this background, this chapter’s purpose is to elaborate on how firms can use ‘procurement’ processes to benefit strategically from startups and how to manage startups as suppliers. The chapter identifies specific challenges that arise from these asymmetric partnerships and provides insights from an in-depth case study of the BMW Startup Garage, offering firms guidance on how to overcome these challenges. The chapter shows how the automaker establishes buyer–supplier relationships with startups and a fast track into BMW. Finally, the chapter also provides recommendations for future research endeavors.</jats:p>"

We exploit detailed monthly information on individual labour market and marital status from the Labour Force Survey to analyze short-term changes in labour supply and marital decisions before and after the reform in Quebec relative to other provinces that did not experience changes in marital property laws over that time period. We find that the Quebec family patrimony changes reduced the work incentives of married women, with a stronger decline in hours worked among less-educated married women who gained most from the increased economic protection. The change in the Quebec redistributive divorce law increased the likelihood of divorce among relatively less-educated spouses (who have more to gain from the equal sharing of the family patrimony at divorce) and increased new marriages among couples in which wives are relatively more educated than husbands. </jats:p>",

The coffee husk resulting from the processing of coffee beans is usually disposed of in Vietnam or burned inefficiently to dry coffee beans. Small-scale pyrolysis of coffee husk using the PPV300 avoids smoke emissions and local air pollution while providing an energy source for coffee drying and biochar as a by-product. This paper investigates the uncertainties in the “coffee husk to activated carbon” supply chain in Vietnam and discusses the pros and cons of different supply chain setups using a framework derived by Chopra and Meindl (2013). According to the analysis, a number of actors (an intermediary without previous direct involvement in the coffee supply chain, a coffee processor, or a hybrid between farm and processor), each with advantages and disadvantages, would be suitable from a supply chain perspective to attain an efficient strategy that would keep the price of the biochar low. However, in order to be attractive for one activated carbon producer, several PPV300 systems are needed to reach a significant economy of scale. Sufficient husk sourcing and storage capacity is also needed. If the purpose is simply to produce biochar for activated carbon, processors and intermediaries could consider a simpler and cheaper design than the PPV300. In conclusion, supply chain uncertainties and economic viability can be optimized when the PPV300 is used by coffee processors or intermediaries, who are able to make use of the co-products generated (biochar, heat, and wood vinegar). In addition to its financial viability, all of the other co-benefits of this technology should be taken into consideration (reduced smoke and environmental pollution, avoided health costs, greenhouse gas savings, etc.) for a proper assessment of its economic attractiveness.</jats:p>"

However, the existing research on multi-agent green supply chain (GSC) stops on the strategic and tactical levels, failing to implement the relevant supply chain models. To overcome the limitation, this paper designs a multi-agent GSC management system for retailers, with the aim to obtain scientific collaboration strategies among multiple agents and to make effective logistics decisions for the supply chain. Firstly, a 3-layer hierarchical evaluation index system (EIS) was established under the framework of the multi-agent GSC management system. Next, the authors modeled the supply-demand relationship and dynamic game of multi-agent GSC, and discussed the cooperation and negotiation models among multiple agents. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent GSC management model is highly effective. The research findings provide a reference for the application of multi-agent technology in other types of supply chain enterprises.</jats:p>",

When mapped for the entire economy and geographic locations of a country, supply chains form a spatial web of interactions among suppliers and buyers. One way to characterize supply chains is through multiregional input-output linkages. Using a multiregional input-output dataset, we build the multilayer network of supply chains in the United States. Together with a network cascade model, the multilayer network is used to explore the propagation of economic shocks along intranational supply chains. We find that the effect of economic shocks, measured using the avalanche size or total number of collapsed nodes, varies widely depending on the geographic location and economic sector of origin of a shock. The response of the supply chains to shocks reveals a threshold-like behavior. Below a certain failure or fragility level, the avalanche size increases relatively quickly for any node in the network. Based on this result, we find that the most fragile regions tend to be located in the central United States, which are regions that tend to specialize in food production and manufacturing. The most fragile layers are chemical and pharmaceutical products, services and food-related products, which are all sectors that have been disrupted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The fragility risk, measured by the intersection of the fragility level of a node and its exposure to shocks, varies across regions and sectors. This suggests that interventions aiming to make the supply-chain network more robust to shocks are likely needed at multiple levels of network aggregation.</jats:p>",

The power factor shows how effectively uses the consumption of electric energy by certain loads connected to the power distribution system with Alternative Current (AC), which is very critical for the electricity-producing industry. The number of power factors is a dimensionless value that can vary from -1 to 1. Thus, in an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of transferring useful power, which may cause overloading of the power grid and lead to over-expenditure of electricity. Otherwise, designing power factor correction (PFC) into modern switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) has evolved over the past few years due to the introduction of many new controller integrated circuits (IC). Today, it is possible to design a variety of PFC circuits with different modes of operation, each with its own set of challenges. As the number of choices has increased, so has the complexity of making the choice and then executing the new design. In this article, the design considerations and details of operation for the most popular approaches are provided.Â Â </jats:p>"

Additionally, an evidence of both long and short-run causality from government expenditure and money supply to unemployment is found. Practical policy implications indicate that in order to effectively combat unemployment problem in Namibia, the study recommends that there is a  need for policy makers to ensure that the goal of employment creation is mainstreamed in all relevant fiscal and monetary policies responses in the country.

The aim of this presented study was to investigate the suitability of up-flow aerated filters as an upgrading step for the removal of total Fe from groundwater. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was applied as a pollutant carrier and compared with Bio-Pac media (BPM) by conducting a column test to treat synthetic groundwater (SGW). Initially two adsorption kinetic studies were done for GAC. The effect of influent Fe concentration, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and air supply to the system were investigated using a column experiment. The sorption result follows pseudo-second-order kinetics with an adsorption amount of 1.36 mg/g. The column experiment results show that around 99% and 70% Fe removal efficiency can be achieved for the best condition of 3 mg/L influent Fe concentration with seven hours HRT for GAC and BPM respectively. The air supply into the column did not show any improvement in Fe removal efficiency. The performance of GAC is found to be much better than that of BPM. All over, the new combined treatment method of aeration followed by filtration was demonstrated to be an effective technique for Fe removal from groundwater and also satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standard for Fe concentration.</jats:p>",

Based on analyses of four Canadian censuses, the study found that over the 2001–2016 period, only about one‐half of the growth in the supply of university‐educated workers was matched with growth in jobs that required a university degree. Recent immigrants bore most of the brunt of this structural imbalance, becoming more concentrated in low‐ and medium‐skill jobs. In comparison, the prevalence of education‐occupation match of young Canadian‐born workers increased over this period. Consequently, the gap in overeducation between these population groups has widened. To address this gap, immigration policy should use a tandem process that selects immigrants based on human capital and demand‐driven criteria.</jats:p>",

In this paper, novel Data Envelopment Analysis—ratio data (DEA-R) models are used to assess sustainable efficiency in two-echelon supply chains based on endogenous factors. Genetic algorithms are employed to determine optimal productive weights for each echelon and the overall supply chain by taking into account the hidden correlation structures among them as expressed in non-linear multi-objective functions. A case study on 20 firefighting stations is presented to illustrate the approach proposed and its accuracy for decision-making, as long as the issues of pseudo inefficiency and over estimation of efficiency scores are mitigated. Results indicate that the method proposed is capable of reducing efficiency estimation biases due to endogenous sustainable factors by yielding overall scores lower than or equal to the product of the efficiencies of the individual stages.</jats:p>"

Although researchers and practitioners emphasize environmental and economic sustainability in supply chain management (SCM). This is unfortunate because not only social sustainable development plays an important role in promoting other sustainable development programs, but social injustice at one level in the supply chain may also cause significant losses to companies throughout the chain. This article aimed to consolidate the literature on the responsibilities of suppliers, manufacturers, and customers and to adopt sustainable supply chain management (SSSCM) practices in the Pakistani industry to identify all possible aspects of sustainable social development in the supply chain by investigating the relationship between survey variables and structure. This work went beyond the limits of regulations and showed the status of maintaining sustainable social issues. Based on semi-structured interviews, a comprehensive questionnaire was developed. The data was collected through a survey of the head of the supply chain in Karachi, Pakistan. The results of this paper showed that organizational learning was the most important dimension of supplier social sustainability with a value of 40.5% as compared to the effectiveness of the supply chain and the supplier performance with values 37.7 and 9.6%, respectively. In terms of the manufacturer’s social responsibility, the highest score for operational performance was 47%, while productivity was 20%, and corporate social demonstration was 20%. Finally, for the customers’ social sustainability, two dimensions were determined, namely, customer satisfaction and customer commitment with scores of 47 and 40%, respectively. We also solved sustainable social problems from the perspective of suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. The study would help professionals anywhere to emphasize their considerations and would improve the management of social sustainability in their supply chain.</jats:p>"

Treatment at a full-scale treatment plant was successfully modelled, with treated water UV transmittance as the output variable. ANNs could be used to identify operating setpoints that minimize operating costs for effective disinfection during drinking water treatment. However, because of the limited data available to train and validate the distribution system ANNs (i.e. n = 48; 15 years of quarterly measurements), these could not be used to reliably identify operating setpoints that also ensure compliance with DBP regulations.</jats:p>",

A metallic coated plant extract (MCPE) was synthesized and characterized in an unusual characterization set-up to determine the basic properties required for the plasmon technology. The MCPE was found to have band gap of 3.15 eV and possesses the basic properties of electron clouds oscillating about a mean position. This result means that the MCPE is a bio-particulate option that can replace the inorganic nanoparticles in the plasmon experiment.

While formal legal measures for protecting IP exist in many countries, they are by no means perfect. We consider a market‐based approach where the supplier can sell the acquired IP to a third party imitator or can become an imitator if the imitation‐cost is not large. We identify economic‐equilibrium scenarios that discourage excessive misappropriation of IP. We find that IP sell/purchase transactions can happen only if the market potential has a moderate value. It can also motivate the supplier to become imitator. A large market, while attractive to the imitator, causes the principal not to outsource. In a small market, on the other hand, the imitator is unable to compete especially with a high‐quality imitation. Interestingly, we also find that the combined sales of the principal and imitator decreases, if the imitator increases IP purchase. We establish that the principal can benefit from partial outsourcing implying that a proportion of the components are outsourced, if the market potential is large.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper develops a game-theoretic model in a two-echelon supply chain composed of one manufacturer and two retailers to study the effect of pricing structure and cooperative-advertising decisions on the supply chain coordination performance. In the proposed model, different pricing structures are analyzed and then, two types of pricing structure in supply chain coordination mechanisms are presented, in addition to considering four possible scenarios for pricing structure. For the first two scenarios, retailers determine the retail prices, while in the other two ones, the sales price is set by the manufacturer. Therefore, the retailers are obliged to comply with this rule. The manufacturer-Stackelberg and the cooperative games are formulated for each scenario by considering key assumptions associated with advertising expenditures to maintain the potential demand size. This paper also presents some analytical results and determines the equilibrium of the models for each scenario. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted to illustrate the impact of pricing structure on the optimal decision variables and the profit of the supply chain members.</jats:p>",

This could potentially be because a supply chain focused framework is lacking, and therefore it is difficult to measure the true impact of such issues. Why, how, and how much does corruption damage the corresponding firm in the supply chain? Our study takes what we term a supply chain view of corruption, and then estimates the stock price effect of corruption from that point of view. We focus on kickbacks and bribery issues that may damage a target firm's reputation and its market value. In particular, we address firms’ corrupt practices from a sustainability risk perspective with the conceptualization of corruption risk (CR). Using an event study methodology, based on a sample of 315 CR cases in the United States, we find significant market penalties for allegations of the target firms’ CRs (triggers) and its subsequent issues (investigation, regulatory and resolution). However, the market penalties are largely driven by triggers, not by the subsequent issues. We further reveal that the stock market reacts more negatively to CRs that occur upstream with suppliers than downstream with customers. Therefore, target focal firms must be cautious with upstream–trigger CRs.</jats:p>",

The post-harvest losses were estimated using survey data collected during 2016-17 from 400 farmers; 60 households; and 100 traders consisting of wholesalers, commission agents, exporters, processors and retailers and 60 consumers in Tamil Nadu. Six major mango value chains were found in the production catchments through which the mango fruits reached consumers in different forms. Overall, the post-harvest losses at the farm level were estimated at 7.08 per cent. At the primary wholesaler level the losses were estimated at 7.30 per cent and at the processing level at 8.70 per cent. At the secondary wholesaler level the losses were estimated at 10 per cent. Maximum losses were observed at the retail level (14.97%), most likely as a result of improper post-harvest handling, lack of proper storage facilities, and rough handling of fruits by consumers who check fruit quality by squeezing. It is recommended that establishing procurement yards near farms, minimizing transaction points in the mango value chain, establishing value added and processing units near production catchments, initiating farmer cooperatives similar to Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL) in India model, involving collection of fruits directly from the farmers by cooperatives, initiating Farmer Producer Company (FPC) and establishing a refrigerated transport system for well graded fruits right from farm to consumption centres would minimize post-production losses of mango.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon dioxide, as well as ammonia, are widely used in large-scale chemistry for the production of urea. Currently, the most common technology for producing carmabide is according to which liquid NH3 is pumped into the synthesis column by a pump at a pressure of 15 MPa, and gaseous CO2 is supplied by a compressor with the same pressure as ammonia. Gaseous CO2 is compressed in a multi-stage compressor to a pressure of 15 MPa before it enters the urea synthesis unit, in which it reacts with ammonia. The specific energy consumption for compressing carbon dioxide in a compressor unit is 0.13 kWh/kg. Reducing energy for producing CO2 and also urea can be achieved when it is possible to supply carbon dioxide in liquid form under a pressure of 15 MPa to the urea synthesis column. The analysis showed that to solve this problem it is necessary to implement two processes: compression to 1.8–3.0 MPa, and then cooling and liquefaction of gaseous CO2 due to the cold of liquid ammonia. Liquefied CO2 can then be pumped to the urea column. In order to introduce carbamide into production, a new carbon dioxide compressor and pumping unit has been created. The installation scheme for compressing CO2 to a pressure of 15 MPa and its subsequent supply to the production of urea is given. A cold liquid ammonia stream with an initial temperature of –30 °C is used as a source of cold in the installation. The performance and power consumption of the compressor unit depend on the compression pressure of CO2. After the CO2 is compressed to 1.8 MPa, it is possible to cool 2.3 t/h of carbon dioxide with cold liquid ammonia and then direct it to the synthesis of urea using a pump under a pressure of 15 MPa. The specific energy consumption in the installation will be 0.1 kWh/kg. When CO2 is compressed up to 3 MPa, the plant capacity is 8.78 t/h, and the unit costs are 0,108 kWh/kg. Urea production in this case may increase from 1400 to 1680 t/day. Ref. 5, Fig. 3, Tab. 3.</jats:p>"

The Akaki well-field was initially designed for an abstraction rate of up to 35,000 m3/day for 20 years until 2020 though the current abstraction rate is nearly ten-fold. The current developments are only demand driven irrespective of safe and sustainable utilization. What is making things worse is the rise of other water competing demands for irrigation projects in adjacent well-fields. The present water supply coverage of the Addis Ababa city is not more than 50%. The situation in other urban centers in the Upper Awash basin is not different. Conceptual modelling, time series well water level measurements and operational assessments showed that the aquifer systems are not uniform and dotted with many volcanic flow barriers; there is sharp decline of water table (up to 70 meters since 2000) in some well-fields and the decline is propagating upstream of the Akaki well-field. Moreover, the excessive and uncontrolled pumping is impacting regional groundwater table. Topographic and technical issues are hampering upstream water distribution, and the once exemplary hundreds of wells are now abandoned. The frequent tapping of thermal and high fluoride water is another complication. Unless proper intervention is devised, grave environmental problems are likely to come in the near future.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the analysis of monitored high-frequency continuous spring discharge and rainfall data in the contact and fracture type Mathamali spring located in the Garhwal Himalaya. Discharge from the spring and its storage behavior has been studied by analyzing recession components and flow duration curves. Analyzed discharge data revealed that the spring can generate maximum volume during monsoon as compared to winter due to aquifer properties and tendencies to store and transmit water. Springshed intervention practices were implemented in early April 2017. The measured average flow was 16.9 lpm but soon after the interventions, the average flow increased by 2.6 times. The minimum average spring flow was 2.3 lpm which increased by 5 times whereas the average maximum flow increased by 1.8 times. Post-intervention, storage duration has increased by 16%, decaying from 143 lpm (peak flow) to 12.7 lpm (baseflow). The preliminary findings from this spring can be considered as a check for establishing benchmarks for sustainable development of springsheds, climate change adaptation, and development plans to cope up with growing water insecurity in the rural Himalayas.</jats:p>",

Inventory strategies are becoming important but complex when the number of items that must be prepared is increasing. In this regard, it is necessary to analyze the product groupings in several classifications. Prioritized products receive special attention.The same problem is faced by PT PEKA, an import raw material distribution company that has nearly 2000 product items. Based on data demand is known, that the company's demand does not have a fixed pattern. Many products have regular and irregular demand, even the number of regular demand is very volatile. Companies often experience excess stock or vice versa due to lack of stock demand according to predictions, long lead times and product self-life that varies. Related to this, alternative product groupings or classifications are needed in accordance with company conditions. The company currently has frozen and unfrozen products, has items made from natural and non-natural raw materials and has a short and relatively long lead time.PT. PEKA groups products in various stages, which lead to a combination of ABC and XYZ classifications. Demand of priority items generated from the grouping is then forecast according to the model that gives the smallest MSE / MAD. Furthermore, a case study was carried out to calculate the Total Relevance Cost (TRC) from the calculation results to be compared with the real TRC.

Drawing from the open‐economy Goodwin tradition, this model demonstrates that economic activity, income distribution and accumulation of foreign assets dynamically interact, resulting in a pattern of dampened cycles. The study consists in analyzing the characteristics of the model by initially imposing: (I) a constant real exchange rate; (II) a constant net external asset to capital ratio, which is in line with the balance of payments dominance theory and (III) a fixed income distribution. We then (IV) expand the original model by adding an evolutionary supply‐side in which productivity is at the center of the economic dynamic through international technology transfer and the Kaldor‐Verdoorn effect. The results show that (1) the model always converges. (2) The restrictions (I) and (II) remove the cyclical component of the model, which highlights a central difference between La Marca and the original Goodwin model. (3) Fixed income distribution leads to a monotonic trajectory that reduces oscillations. (4) The inclusion of productivity dynamics generates new sources of volatility in the relationship between productivity, capacity utilization and net external assets and is in line with the structuralist argument of structural fragility.</jats:p>",

Based on the calculation of the extension variance, relative sampling errors for the confidence intervals (CI) equal to 68% and 99% were obtained. For the sampled sources, the greater the sampling interval, the greater the values obtained for the extension variance and for the relative sampling error. The greater the confidence interval analyzed, the greater the relative sampling error to be obtained. The results showed a very high global sampling error for collection intervals greater than 32 days (relative error greater than 10%) when the confidence interval was CI = 68%. When the confidence interval was 99.9%, for collection intervals greater than two days, relative sampling errors greater than 10% have already been obtained.

An increasing number of countries therefore employs quantitative approaches in health workforce supply forecasting. However, these models are often of limited usability as they either require extensive individual-level data or become too simplistic to capture key demographic or epidemiological factors. We propose a novel population-dynamical and stock-flow-consistent approach to health workforce supply forecasting complex enough to address dynamically changing behaviors while requiring only publicly available timeseries data for complete calibration. We apply the model to 21 European countries to forecast the supply of generalist and specialist physicians until 2040. Compared to staffing levels required to keep the physician density constant at 2016 levels, in many countries we find a significant trend toward decreasing density for generalist physicians at the expense of increasing densities for specialists. These trends are exacerbated in many Southern and Eastern European countries by expectations of negative population growth. For the example of Austria, we generalize our approach to a multi-professional, multi-regional and multi-sectoral model and find a suboptimal distribution in the supply of contracted versus non-contracted physicians. It is of the utmost importance to devise tools for decision makers to influence the allocation and supply of physicians across fields and sectors to combat imbalances.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Key messages</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The trend of increasing supply of physicians continues in most European countries—stronger for specialists than for general physicians.

Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the supply chain can be achieved through the formation of partnerships that are aimed at organizing comprehensive cooperation of economic entities with its inalienable integration into the logistics chain of their own production. Also, such partnerships are based on the desire of economic entities to concentrate the required resources in the area of the irown competence, whereas to delegate the other functions to the third-party enterprises (for example, outsourcing them). In order to establish a partnership, the parties involved must determine and agree on possible motivators, contributing factors, business process components and expected results, taking into account the balance of power, specialization, readiness for cooperation of stakeholders, possible damage and distribution of risks, importance of the applicant, reasons for withdrawal from the contract and “force majeure” circumstances. This proposed model of partnership in supply chain management allows reducing the production cycle, the maintenance costs and the “money-money” cycle. It also allows improving the performance of the supply chain, optimizing logistics costs, which, in turn, creates favorable conditions for reducing foreign economic costs, increasing profits and focusing the core competencies of the enterprise-manufacturer.</jats:p>",

Sensitivity analysis and logical reasoning with operators identified a feasible operational rule curve for testing using the integrated performance analysis. The reservoir performance for the altered operations was compared to the baseline performance following current operations for both historical and projected future climate and water demand conditions. Key simulation results show that the altered operations strategy tested under historical climate and water demand conditions would increase RRV by 17%, 67%, and 7%, respectively, for the water supply objective and 34%, 346%, and 22%, respectively, for hydropower generation. For projected future conditions, the proposed operations strategy would increase RRV by 7%, 219%, and 11%, respectively, for water supply and 19%, 136%, and 13% for hydropower generation. Synthesis of the results suggests significant benefits for reliability and resilience of water supply and hydropower are possible with slight operational adjustments. Overall, the integrated performance analysis supports the need to develop an optimized operations rule for Tarbela to adapt to projected climate and demand scenarios.</jats:p>"

This presents a challenge, especially for fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) supply chains, which are characterized by a large number of physical contacts between employees in production, physical distribution, wholesale, and retail. One of the ways to comply with the prescribed measures with the smooth functioning of the supply chain is the complete digitalization and automation of all business activities and operations based on the application of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this regard, this paper aims to analyze the setbacks to the digitalization of business processes and the sustainability of the FMCG supply chain based on the implementation of IoT. The research has been conducted among the participants in the standardization chain in the sectors of production, physical distribution, wholesale, and retail of FMCG in the Western Balkans region during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed significant differences between business sectors in terms of the intensity of setbacks to successful IoT implementation. Based on the obtained results, a set of measures and incentives was proposed that the competent institutions and the management of the FMCG supply chain should apply to encourage the digitalization process. Suggestions for future research are given in the paper.</jats:p>"

Combining game theory and time series analysis of dynamic pricing data from on-demand ride-hailing services, we explain this apparent contradiction. We derive a phase diagram demonstrating how and under which conditions dynamic pricing incentivizes collective action of ride-hailing drivers to induce anomalous supply shortages. We identify characteristic patterns in the price dynamics reflecting these supply anomalies by disentangling different timescales in price time series of ride-hailing services at 137 locations across the globe. Our results provide systemic insights for the regulation of dynamic pricing, in particular in publicly accessible mobility systems, by unraveling under which conditions dynamic pricing schemes promote anomalous supply shortages.</jats:p>"

Emitting alpha particles leads to radionuclides decay. The aim of this work is to set up a database for uranium concentrations in groundwater samples collected from Kufa city, Al-Najaf governorate, Iraq. Twenty four samples have been examined for detecting the presence of uranium levels using a CR-39 detector. The measured uranium concentrations were used to determine uranium isotopes with their ingested radiological toxicity risk (annual effective dose of uranium isotopes and excess cancer risk) and chemical toxicity risk (lifetime average daily dose and hazard quotient) from consumption of the water samples in the present study. The results show that the average value of uranium concentrations, uranium isotopes 238U, 235U, and 234U (1.20 ± 0.04) μg/L, (1.48 ± 0.06) Bq/L, (0.069 ± 0.002) Bq/L and (1.49 ± 0.06) Bq/L respectively. Also, it is concluded that the total average annual effective dose and excess cancer risk in all regions under study were (0.10 ± 0.004) mSv/y and (0.31 ± 0.013) × 10−3 respectively. Moreover, the average value lifetime average daily dose, and hazard quotient was 0.0389 ± 0.0016 μg/kg.day and 0.0649 ± 0.0026 respectively. All results of radiological and chemical risk assessment from uranium concentrations in groundwater samples collected from the Al-Kufa area when used as drinking water were within the global limitations of the organization International Commission on Radiological Protection (1.9 μg/L; 1 mSv/y and 0.18 mSv/y) and World Health Organization recommended (0.6 μg/kg/day). Finally, it can be concluded that uranium concentrations do not affect human health according to radiation contents.</jats:p>",

We aim to contribute to the existing supply chain management literature by providing an insight into the connections of supply chain performance with buyer–supplier relationship quality from the relationship quality scholars’ perspective. Through content analysis, frequency and contingency analysis, we evaluated how the three relationship quality dimensions—information, operational, and relational dimensions—and the three types of supply chain performance—financial and market, operational, and relational performance have been reflected in the current interfirm relationship quality papers and how the scholars have tended to link them to each other. The results reveal that relational dimension plays a key role in SC relationship management and influences performance significantly. Information dimension will affect performance indirectly through relational dimension. However, the impact of the operational dimension on performance varies. In addition, buyers’ and suppliers’ perspectives on the relational drivers of their financial performance may differ. Based on the findings, we suggest promising avenues for future investigation of supply chain relationship and performance.</jats:p>",

Sediments transported in irrigation networks that accumulate upstream of duckbill weirs cause problems in operation, and affect the upstream water level. In this paper, submerged vanes and bottom slots are investigated for flushing the sediment downstream of the said weir. The experiments were conducted in a rectangular flume, 12 m long, and 0.6 m wide. The vanes placed in four sections were perpendicular to the sidewall. Flow-3D software was used for simulation of flow and sedimentation patterns. The results showed that submerged vanes create a secondary flow which is very useful for flushing the sediment, especially in the value of (H is head over the sidewall and P is the weir height). Further, the results showed duckbill weir efficiency (which is defined as the ratio of sediment trap to flow capacity of the weir) is as high as 47% (for values of H/P = 0.1–0.5 and total models). Finally, image processing results showed a maximum relative error of 14.4% for the simulation of the sediment pattern with Flow-3D software.</jats:p>",

The majority were in favour of such a project and willing to use recreation areas and purchase local farm products irrigated with treated wastewater. However, we demonstrated the paucity of lay knowledge about treated wastewater. Simple information flyers have a significant effect on attitudes and intended behaviours. Nevertheless 20% of informed respondents said they would no longer buy such irrigated products. Given the lack of confidence in the public authorities' guarantee of food quality, they will be unlikely to change their minds. These unacceptable results to farmers may interest public authorities promoting these projects, still rare in France, in response to the increase in droughts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This study aims to review the previous literature on the topic contained in the title in order to identify gaps in the existing research relating to lean supply chain-related issues within the pharmaceutical industry since limited attention has been devoted to this sector.  Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a systematic literature review that proposes an analysis and classification of the previous literature as falling within one of four categories, namely; the supply chain area, research approach, research objective, and lean supply chain elements.Findings: The results of this study indicate that most attention was focused on manufacturing, while upstream suppliers, downstream activities and the entire supply chain process have received comparatively scant consideration. Similarly, the issues of information technology management, supplier management, customer relations, and logistics management as well as practitioner involvement represent inadequately developed topics. Future research should address these omissions, in addition to the integration of quality compliance and digital innovation as they relate to pharma 4.0.Practical implications: This article serves as a guide to acquiring sufficient knowledge of the pharmaceutical supply chain prior to implementing lean supply chain management. Moreover, it is anticipated that the research it contains will contribute to eradicating the knowledge gap by expanding the existing limited body of literature on the adoption of lean approach in the PSC.Originality/value: This study is one of a limited number of literature analyses potentially helpful in developing a roadmap of lean principle application to the pharmaceutical supply chain</jats:p>"

This paper developed a Computer aided model to address this challenge using Integer programming (IP), by considering profit (Z) as a function of cost and revenue of a machined foundry product. Software was developed to serve as database and the same time analyzed complex mixed – model system where parallel workstation, shift or batch production is allowed. The software was designed to have graphic user interface (GUI), which enable the user to input data like values of product code (identification number for each product), capacity of machine, established unit cost of production, production cycle time, selling cost and the unit cost of production to determine the impact when electricity power from national grid is used, as opposed to  fueling a  diesel-engine generator, for machining foundry products. Costs and production capacity data were collected from Ruthade Foundry Engineering Services, Akure, Ondo State, to validate the model. The results revealed that output per unit time is higher when power from national grid is holistically utilized than when power from generator was used for machining foundry product.  The results serve as genuine guiding tool for foundry operators in selecting a particular course of action on electricity utilization during production and enhance sustainability of production industry. Keywords— Constraint, cycle time, integer programming, Microsoft Visual Basic, model, optimal number </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The search for technical solutions for effective air exchange in the space of deep open-cast mines. Since intensive air exchange is necessary to remove and disperse harmful impurities from the open-cast mines, improvement can be achieved mainly by intensifying natural air exchange based on phase transformations of liquids in the lower atmosphere of the working zones of the open-cast mines by creating a positive or negative temperature gradient. New technical solutions are considered that provide support for the sanitary-hygienic parameters of the atmosphere of the deep open-cast mines at the normative level. The formation of an ascending gas stream by a cascade explosion of a fuel-air mixture has the greatest efficiency. The proposed method allows for the implementation of a pulsed ventilation mode with a power of the outgoing air flow of more than 1010 W with a blasting fuel mass of 30 tons. It has been established by analytical and experimental studies that it is advisable to use pulsed fine irrigation systems to intensify air exchange in a deep open-cast mines, using the double effect, ventilating gaseous working zones and cleaning them from harmful substances with the help of a fine aerosol freely floating in space. It is also advisable to use such facilities to reduce peak loads on emissions of harmful substances from the open-cast mines into the environment and to normalize the composition of the atmosphere of the deep open-cast mines. Significant peak emissions of harmful impurities in open-cast mines include mass explosions and situations involving the creation of internal inversion zones. In a computational experiment, there are two water guns: big gun (the water jet range is 200 m, water volume per one cycle is 1000 dm3) and small gun(the water jet range is 100 m, water volume per one cycle is 200 dm3). The results of the experiment indicate greater efficiency in the use of a large water gun for airing the lower horizons of the deep open-cast mines. The use of pulsed fine irrigation systems will allow for carrying out internal technological work at a depth of more than 500 meters using a motorized ore delivery system to transfer points of cyclic-flow technology.</jats:p>"

The literature recognizes that these systems can reduce response time of managers and enhance a cost-efficient recovery of supply chains. However, there is a lack of methodological frameworks to evaluate the benefits of these platforms. In addition, there is still little understanding of the risks in ocean container transport and their implications for supply chains. This paper proposes and applies a mathematical model for evaluating the impacts of digital platforms, with a focus on solutions to mitigate risks in sea transport operations. The model is based on scenarios and decision tree models to evaluate the impacts of a supply chain digital ecosystem on full containers shipped from Asia to Europe implemented by four companies. Results show monetary savings per scenario in the range from €3448 to €79,242. The most significant savings are expected on unplanned transshipments, cargo damage, export inspections, container detention, and container release.</jats:p>",

However, one area in which the SMEs in the country still need to develop is in their implementation of supply chain management practices, particularly their relationships with suppliers, which could result in either the failure or success of any business enterprise. Majority of studies conducted in this area have focussed on large firms, thereby creating a research gap in this area.Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the influence of supplier integration on supply chain performance in South African SMEs.Setting: This study was conducted in Gauteng province of South Africa.Methods: A quantitative research methodology was employed in this study. A convenient sample comprising 283 owners and managers from SMEs drawn from the Gauteng Province was used in the study. The collected data were then analysed using Pearson’s correlation and regression analysis.Results: Positive correlations were found between supplier integration and both the tangible and intangible sub-dimensions of supply chain performance. Supplier integration also predicted both the tangible and intangible sub-dimensions of supply chain performance.Conclusion: These results imply that to improve the performance of their supply chains, it is imperative for SMEs to ensure that linkages with their suppliers are properly aligned for improved coordination, which leads to better relationships and supply of materials. This study contributes to the literature by proposing and testing the influence of supplier integration on supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

The supply systems of food products that form the consumer basket at the stage of distribution is considered. The conceptual schemes of freight flow distribution with and without distribution center is presented. The field research was conducted to determine and initial data were collected. The paper investigate the functioning of the supply chain in two cases: in a situation \"proposed scenario\" and in a situation \"without a project\". The situation \"existing scenario\" implies that no action to change the parameters of the supply chain during the period specified for the research does not take place. In this case, it is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the logistics chain under existing conditions. An integrated approach to evaluate the efficiency of the functioning of the logistics system and the consumer had been used. The efficiency of existing of the supply chain functioning were analysed. Also, certain measures will be implemented to improve the chain through investments and by bringing logistics infrastructure with the needs. A modelling of the supply chain was made. The effect of parameters of participants on the supply chain efficiency was analysed. The planned effect from the reorganization of distribution channels is calculated.

A sustainable RWSS delivers safe and sufficient drinking water for a longer period to rural people. Community management was viewed as an accepted model that leads to sustainability, even though community management had difficulties and constraints in sustainability of RWSS due to social, technical, institutional and financial constraints. This paper reviews the sustainability factors of community managed RWSS. There is a need to take multi-stakeholder approach, a demand driven and community led approach, which ties these stakeholders like government, community and non-governmental sector for the effectiveness and sustainability of drinking water services. The synthesis evidenced that community management needs modifications, in terms of external factors, like, institutional support that include financial and technical support, trainings and administrative assistance to make RWSS sustainable. The community, like participation in all phases of planning, implementation, operation &amp; maintenance, water tariff, sense of ownership, transparency, leadership and management are essential for the sustainability of RWSS. The participation by the community members in RWSS plays positive role for its sustainability. To conclude, analysis also highlighted commitment to community management should be pragmatic and rational. The scaling up of community management is an effective and efficient model to address the issues of sustainability in RWSS.</jats:p>"

In addition, hydrogeological complexities and the lack of field data in terms of time and space lead to uncertainty in the model. Therefore, the present study linked the groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW) and sequential uncertainty fitting approach (SUFI-2) to the uncertainty-based automatic calibration of the Ardabil groundwater model located in northwestern Iran. Hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, recharge rate, the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed material, and the boundary conductance of the aquifer were considered as the uncertain parameters. Furthermore, the Newton solution method for the unconfined aquifer was used for solving the groundwater flow equation. A Normalized Total Uncertainty Index was defined to evaluate the performance of the SUFI-2 algorithm. According to the MODFLOW-SUFI-2 calibration findings, 60% of observational data was bracketed by a 95% confidence interval, on average. The Ardabil groundwater model was also calibrated with the PSO algorithm. In comparison with SUFI-2, although this method resulted in good coverage of the solution, it obtained irrational values for most parameters since they only aimed to match observational and computational values. Eventually, SUFI-2 showed a small number of simulation runs compared with the PSO algorithm.</jats:p>",

In order to cope with these disruptions, it is necessary to form resilient supply chain networks by pursuing holistic and proactive approaches. In the study, a resilient supply chain network design (SCND) problem is addressed under different disruption scenarios in a fuzzy environment by taking two of the most applied supply chain resilience strategies into account, namely the fortification of suppliers and using backup suppliers strategies. A two-stage integrated approach is proposed to solve the handled problem. The first stage includes the suppliers' evaluation process using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). A fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming (F-MLP) model is developed to design the supply chain network in the second stage. The application of this approach is carried out on a realistic hypothetical problem and the results obtained and applicability of the proposed approach are discussed.</jats:p>"

Since the decay rates of emerging contaminants in piping systems have not been determined, this study determines the importance of decay rate on concentration throughout a distribution system and also determines how the system layout effects concentration. Systems were modeled to determine the time to peak contamination for a clean system becoming contaminated, as well as a contaminated system being cleaned of contamination. It was found that only emerging contaminants with second-order decay at the highest rate observed did not build up to high concentrations. The position of storage tanks in the distribution system affected the rate at which contaminants cleared the system, and systems with a branched layout could be cleared of contamination faster than systems containing loops.</jats:p>",

The greatest amounts of sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, and lithium were 102.88 g L−1, 9.12 g L−1, 8.56 g L−1, 345.8 mg L−1, and 1.62 mg L−1, respectively, during summer. Two-way ANOVA presented a highly significant local and seasonal effect of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton biomass. There were high levels of autumn algal biomass (65.96 mg L−1) and low levels of winter algal biomass (32.28 mg L−1). Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Pyrrophyta dominated in the autumn, whereas Bacillariophyta dominated in the winter. Cyanophyta and Pyrrophyta biomass showed high local variations in contrast to Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. The species diversity index revealed that the study area was mildly to moderately polluted water.</jats:p>",

In this manuscript, I encourage more replications. However, I also assume that such studies will remain rare. Therefore, it is argued that the replication crisis in OSCM can be partially addressed by conducting theory testing and refining research in a more systematic fashion that acknowledges researchers' and journals' incentives to publish new knowledge, while also efficiently helping to ensure that the foundations of that new knowledge are generalizable and not based on idiosyncratic, spurious, or questionable findings. Hence, I focus on ways to conduct a replication within a larger theory testing or refining study in a manner that makes it possible to explain the results, even if they differ from past research. This is achieved via enhanced transparency, designing research to include tests of nomological validity and account for the possibility that the results will not replicate, and more careful consideration of controls. The payoff from this investment in designing replication logic into theory testing and refining research would be that in the course of conducting normal science, we would be able to make much stronger claims about the veracity of our theories, facts, and predictions.</jats:p>",

This article presents a newly developed composite indicator system to assess the status of emergency preparedness planning in the German water supply. Two weighting methods of the indicators are compared: the indicator system was applied to a case study and a Germany-representative data set. The results show that there is a need for action in emergency preparedness planning in the German water supply. This is in particular due to a lack of risk analyses and insufficient crisis management. Numerous water supply companies and municipalities are already well-prepared, however, there is a need for action at several levels, especially in the area of risk analysis and evaluation of measures. In Germany, responsibility for this lies primarily with the municipalities.</jats:p>"

The model analyses and verifies the impact of the uncertain quantity upon the competition intensity, sale and recycling prices, supply chain node companies’ profits and social welfare, recovery rate of the closed-loop supply chain from four dimensions. The research results show that the recycling and repurchase prices are increasing when the quantity of recycled products shows significant fluctuation. The profit of social welfare and sellers are increasing, but manufacturer’s profit is decreasing, which means the uncertainty on recovery quantity directly affects the manufacturers, who play a leading role in implementing remanufacturing.</jats:p>",

The supply chain forms a key process of any construction project; however, on any given construction site, supply chain inefficiencies could arise from many different avenues. Opinions vary, though, on which of these avenues is more important for increasing supply chain efficiencies; whether any problem even exist across the different aspects of the supply chain; as well as what steps should be taken to resolve them. It was therefore studied, here, whether SSM could be employed as a useful tool to systematically apply in the supply chains of a construction project in South Africa, for understanding and targeting the problematic situations that arise. Following thorough cyclical open-ended interviews with 17 workers, supervisors, foremen, site clerks, senior managers, and the CEO of the principal contractor at a new office park construction project in Rosebank, Johannesburg, and a thematic analysis of the data, SSM was performed to understand the existing challenges, and develop a suitable model for improvement. The study found that SSM was a good tool for understanding the ‘messy’ circumstances surrounding the chosen construction project supply chain, as well as actions that could be taken to improve the supply chain’s efficiency on site. The findings add weight to the argument that SSM could be a good tool for project managers to systematically introduce into their project planning regimens</jats:p>"

Another group of experts evaluated these situations with regard to their degree of realism as well as relevance and allocated them to the five constructs (1) employee competence, (2) management commitment, (3) communication between organizations, (4) organizational culture, and (5) regulatory framework.Findings: The findings of the study show that communication appears to be the most frequent reason while regulatory framework seems to be the last frequent reason for critical incidents during outsourcing. Contract giver and service provide show diverging perceptions about the situations’ degree of realism and relevance. Analysis of the interrater agreement shows that the allocation to a single construct is a challenge due to the critical incidents’ complexity and multidimensionality.Originality: The critical incidents database and the presented framework serve as preventive behavioral-based quality management for the pharmaceutical supply chain.</jats:p>"

CSCM integrates the philosophy of circular economy (CE) into supply chain management and offers a new view towards sustainability. However, the implementation of CSCM is an arduous task due to the presence of several barriers. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and prioritize barriers to implementing CSCM practices in Indian plastic industries. It employs a two-phase methodology to identify and prioritize the barriers to implementing CSCM. A total of 24 barriers were identified under five major categories through an extensive literature review and experts’ opinions. A fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology is employed to rank the barriers. The fuzzy framework is considered to handle the uncertainty and vagueness. An empirical case of the Indian plastic industry is taken to illustrate the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of the model. The results indicate that the lack of tax relaxation policies and poor enforcement of rules and regulations to protect the environment are the most prominent barriers. The finding of this study can act as a stepping stone for managers and policymakers to effective implementation of CSCM. </jats:p>",

This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime by predicting the change in both monthly and seasonal streamflow, and identified water supply and demand relations under supply management options and environmental flow maintenance. To reach a better understanding of the consequences of possible climate change scenarios and adaptive management options on water supply, an integrated modeling approach was conducted by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and water evaluation and planning model (WEAP). Future scenarios were developed for the future period: 2060s (2051–2070), using an ensemble of three general circulation model (GCM) simulations: GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC, and IPSL-CM5A-MR, driven by the climate projection for representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 6.0 (medium emission scenario). The results indicated that, firstly, the future streamflow will decrease, resulting in a decline of future water availability. Secondly, water supply under natural flow conditions would support 46,167 ha of irrigation schemes and the water shortages will be more noticeable when environmental flow maintenance was considered. The study concludes that reservoir construction would be necessary for agriculture mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the water resources management options considering both supply and demand management are more effective and useful than supply management only, particularly in dealing with climate change impacts.</jats:p>"

In addition, a tripartite evolutionary model was constructed to examine the impact of command-and-control environmental regulation and market-driven environmental regulation on the diffusion of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises. Finally, the study compared and analyzed the heterogeneous effects of different types of environmental regulation tools on the diffusion of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises using local stability analysis and numerical simulation. The results are as follows: (i) When the government does not implement environmental regulation tools or the regulation intensity is relatively small, the diffusion depth of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises is zero. (ii) When government regulation reaches a certain level, the system of manufacturing enterprises, innovation-supplying enterprises, and potential demand-oriented enterprises will choose to actively promote the diffusion of green technology innovation following a long evolution process. (iii) Increasing the punishment intensity and subsidy rate of green technology innovation can stimulate the diffusion of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises. (iv) The comprehensive use of the two kinds of environmental regulation tools has a heterogeneous influence on the strategic choice of green technology innovation diffusion subjects of manufacturing enterprises, and its incentive effect on potential demand-oriented enterprises is relatively poor.</jats:p>"

For this, three HSSF-CWs measuring 4 m × 1 m × 0.25 m, filling with gneiss gravel # 0 (D60 of 7.0 mm and 48.4% porosity) as substrate, were used. One unit was cultivated with Tifton 85 grass (HSSFT-CW), one with vetiver grass (HSSFV-CW) and one remained uncultivated (HSSFC-CW) as a control. Sewage was applied at a flow rate of 0.53–0.80 m3 d−1, corresponding to an organic loading rate of approximately 350 kg ha−1 d−1 (biochemical oxygen demand – BOD), which resulted in a hydraulic retention time of 0.6–0.9 day. The HSSFV-CW was more efficient than the HSSFC-CW in removing dissolved solids (measured as electrical conductivity) and reducing the total suspended solids (TSS), BOD5, turbidity and sodium concentration, while the HSSFT-CW was not superior in any way. The results indicate that cultivation of vetiver grass provided increased efficiency for removing pollutants from sewage when compared with Tifton 85-grass, in the HSSF-CW.</jats:p>",

This involves consolidating with a new contribution to the development and application of a supply chain collaboration framework between automotive constructor and first-tier equipment suppliers to achieve the synchronous flow of components. The objective is to provide the automotive companies with a decision-making tool for selecting strategic suppliers to collaborate with, examining the collaboration context in terms of motivators, drivers, and barriers and evaluating the collaboration performance. Therefore, our contribution is structured as follows. As a first step, an overview of papers reporting on collaboration, lean supply chain, and synchronous flow is provided to identify the key elements of successful collaboration relationships. As a result, a preliminary framework is elaborated. The second step described the case study of a leading automotive firm “RENAULT” and its suppliers in Morocco. Based on semi-structured interviews conducted with participants from these companies, the preliminary framework was improved. The next section discusses the obtained results as well as the improved framework. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for further works are included.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous studies on supply chains have indicated that vertical strategic interactions usually involve the classical double marginalization problem, leading to a downward distortion in profitability. However, at present, the implications of vertical strategic interactions for green technology investment in a supply chain are not all that clear. In particular, such a vertical interaction not only can translate into profits between different parties, but usually also involves differentiated environmental performance. A question which arises is: who is the right undertaker for green technology investment in a supply chain, the supplier or retailer? To answer this question, we highlight the implications of vertical strategic interaction for green technology investment in a supply chain. To fill this gap, using a game-theoretic approach, we formulate two models: (a) Model M, in which an upstream manufacturer adopts technologies to meet consumer demand; and (b) Model R, where a retailer integrates environmental concerns into their supply chain decisions. We find that the retailer, who is closer to the customer, is the more effective undertaker for green technology investment, as this not only creates higher profitability for both parties, but also achieves a more sustainable scheme for our environment. When green technologies are invested in by the manufacturer, the double marginalization effect not only may downward-distort their economic performance but can also reduce the equilibrium of product greenness.</jats:p>"

Forty-eight percent of respondents (n = 709) indicated that they worked in a vascular access role, 310 (21%) worked in an ED, and 455 (31%) categorized their role as other. Clinically meaningful differences existed in all variables for UGPIV procedures and supplies between departments (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and in all care settings. Using an investigator-constructed overall metric of supplies used, important differences were demonstrated between personnel supply use in vascular access roles and other roles (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and personnel in EDs and other roles (P &amp;lt; 0.0001).</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusions: Use of supplies for UGPIV insertions varies by department. The variability in supply usage for UGPIV insertions revealed by this survey suggests a need for clinical education on guideline application and evaluation of compliance with policies to promote standardization of supplies for UGPIV insertion.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This entails an urgent requirement for appropriate water resources management within water–energy interaction if severe water shortage occurs occasionally. This study evaluates hydropower generation policies of a cascade reservoir system in the Be River Basin in terms of security of water supply and energy production. The Generalized Water Allocation Simulation Model (GWASIM) was applied to simulate the water use of a complex system of hydropower generation and water supply. Two water allocation scenarios and six alternatives defined by varying monthly generating hours were modeled and compared. The results demonstrate that a compromise between hydropower generation and water supply can be negotiated to reduce the severity of water shortages. Different monthly hours of hydropower generation among alternatives show an effect on improving power production and reliable water supply. This study provides overall insight into the performance of a multi-purpose cascade reservoir system. It will provide a foundation for improving future study of reservoir operations in meeting the increasing demands of water and energy in Vietnam.</jats:p>",

This field trail was conducted to investigate the variations in radiation use efficiency (RUE) and harvest index (HI) of four spring wheat cultivars grown on two soil types with two nitrogen (N) fertilization levels. Grain yield (GY) was significantly higher with 200 kg N ha−1 than 100 kg N ha−1 and on clay soil than on sandy soil, and a similar trend was observed for shoot dry matter (DM) at maturity. RUE and HI was neither affected by cultivar nor N-fertilization, but was affected by soil type, with a significantly higher RUE and HI on clay than on sandy soil. The differences of water holding capacity between the two soil types was suggested to be a major factor influencing RUE and HI as exemplified by the principal component analysis. Thus, to achieve a high RUE and/or HI, sustaining a good soil water status during the critical growth stages of wheat crops is essential, especially on sandy soils with a low water holding capacity.</jats:p>"

The rate of glucose to biomass was exceed 55% when the glucose concentration was less than 80 g/L, and the C/N ratio was 44 at urea treatment. The culture was beneficial to lipid accumulation at a C/N ratio between 110 and 130. NaNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> used as a nitrogen source enhanced the lipid content more than urea, and the highest lipid content was 45% of dry weight. We performed RNA-seq to analyze the time-resolved transcriptome of <jats:italic>T. bernardii</jats:italic>. As the nitrogen was consumed in the medium, nitrogen metabolism related genes were significantly up-regulated to speed up the N metabolic cycle. As chloroplasts were destroyed in the dark, the metabolism of cells was transferred from chloroplasts to cytoplasm. However, storage of carbohydrate in chloroplast remained active, mainly the synthesis of starch, and the precursor of starch synthesis in heterotrophic culture may largely came from the absorption of organic carbon source (glucose). With regard to lipid metabolism, the related genes of fatty acid synthesis in low nitrogen concentration increased gradually with the extension of cultivation time.<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: <jats:italic>T. bernardii</jats:italic> exhibited rapid growth and high lipid accumulation in heterotrophic culture. It may be a potential candidate for biomass and biofuel production. Transcriptome analysis showed that multilevel regulation ensured the conversion from carbon to the synthesis of carbohydrate and lipid.</jats:p>"

Over the 20 years examined, measurement programs produced 3,124 doctoral graduates, and across this time span, the annual production of graduates nearly doubled. This supply expansion can largely be attributed to the increase in the number of international graduates, which outpaced the annual growth rate of domestic PhD recipients by 156%. Moreover, 85% of graduates were found to either self‐identify as White or Asian. Less than 10 Hispanic and no more than 20 Black graduates were produced in any of the years examined.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>U-Pb spot ages have been determined on detrital zircons from two samples of volcaniclastic arenites belonging to the Tufiti di Tusa Formation (TTF) outcropping in the Lucanian Apennines (Southern Italy). Many petrographic and geochemical studies have been performed on these sandstones with the aim of defining their detritus source. A new and precise evaluation of the mineralogical composition of metamorphic lithic fragments, together with U-Pb detrital zircon ages, helps to clarify the deposition age of these syn-sedimentary volcaniclastic sandstones and constrains their source areas. Volcaniclastic arenites consist of andesitic fragments and single minerals of plagioclases, clinopyroxenes, and hornblendes, while the metamorphic lithics are mainly fragments of blue amphibole-bearing micaschists, serpentinites, ophicalcites, phyllites, and medium-grade micaschists. Phaneritic plutonic fragments consist of quartz, feldspar, and micas. Carbonate components include biomicritic and biosparitic fragments. Eighty age data collected from 56 zircons reveal a wide age spectrum, ranging from Neoarchean to Rupelian (from 2712 ± 25 to 30 ± 1 Millions of years (Ma)). The age data show that in volcaniclastic sandstones there is evidence of ancient crystalline basements involved in Cadomian and Variscan orogenesis (ages from 2712 ± 25 Ma to ≈260 Ma), whereas the measured ages of 157 Ma testify the events of Pangea fragmentation and the ages between 78 and 67 Ma are related to subduction metamorphism connected to the Alpine orogenesis. Fifty percent of the estimated detrital zircon ages show a mean concordant age of 33 ± 1 Ma, they have been measured on idiomorphic crystals with undisturbed magmatic oscillatory zoning. These data reveal the true sedimentation age of Tufiti di Tusa sandstones at least at the sampled levels, coeval with that recorded in other Rupelian volcaniclastic successions outcropping in the Northern Apennines and in the Western Alps (e.g., Val d’Aveto-Petrignacola Formation, Ranzano Formation and Taveyannaz Sandstone). These data represent preliminary suggestions of the sedimentation age of the Tufiti di Tusa Formation and Rupelian paleogeography in the Western Mediterranean area. During Priabonian-Rupelian times, the volcanic calc-alkaline detritus linked to a widespread syn-sedimentary igneous activity on the hinterland terranes of the foredeep basins in the Apennine-Maghrebian orogen extended from north to south in the Western-Central Mediterranean area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>While literature has noted the presence of a nutrition transition in terms of changing nutrition outcomes in Vietnam, very limited evidence linking changes in upstream food system factors to downstream diet and nutrition changes exists. Combining available data from different sources and analyzing it through a conceptual food systems framework, our study examines different pathways of nutrition transition through food supply, food prices, household food expenditures, diets, and nutrition outcomes in Vietnam. Our findings show that while Vietnam is at the start of its nutrition transition, change is happening rapidly. Undernutrition is falling, obesity is rising, and nutrition-related chronic diseases account for a significant burden of diseases and death. In terms of changes in healthful foods, the supply of vegetables and fruits is plentiful, and expenditure on vegetables remains consistent and small. Notably however, vegetable consumption has dropped, and increasing meat and milk consumption have been double-edged swords for nutrition. In terms of foods associated with the negative sides of the nutrition transition, the availability of sweets and sweetened beverages has risen in recent years, with oils and fats rising less. The expenditure share on food eaten away from home, in many contexts a marker for less healthful diets, has increased over time. While these changes are typical of a nutrition transition, Vietnam is also somewhat of an outlier in some respects: wet markets and daily fresh food purchases continue to dominate food purchasing behaviour, and food eaten away from home means a different thing in a country renowned for its diverse and healthy street food and roadside restaurant culture. While this study brings together important data on the food system drivers of a nutrition transition in Vietnam, it cannot link each of these issues into a standard statistical model of change due to data gaps at different levels, calling for data collection improvement in future diet and food systems research. Vietnamese health policy explicitly acknowledges nutrition transition issues, with targets for obesity reduction. This work on the food system drivers of the nutrition transition points to the need to further adapt policy in other sectors beyond health, however. At the same time as making nutrient-rich foods more accessible, nutrient-poor or ultra-processed foods need to be made less accessible and desirable if additional income is to contribute to a healthy diet in limiting Vietnam’s emerging nutrition transition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Government of Indonesia plans to build 9 gas power plants in South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi and Southeast Nusa Tenggara with a total power capacity of 780 MW with an estimated actual gas demand of 46.56 MMSCFD which are planned to be supplied by the Bontang terminal, DS-LNG, Masela LNG, and Tangguh LNG. LNG-C logistics optimization is needed to get the best transportation scenario regarding  the eastern region which consists of scattered islands and inadequate infrastructure. This study analyzes and evaluates the best-case scenarios by comparing the time and cost variables. The process of planning the supply chain starts from determining the upstream-downstream distribution scheme and then calculates the shipping distance which results in the determination of the quantity, capacity and shipping of the LNG-C. Based on the analysis and calculation of the logistics, it is concluded that there are 3 divisions of clusters of Kalimantan-Sulawesi, NTT and NTB having estimated needs in a row of 18.06, 18.8, and 9.7 MMSCFD with the Milk-Run transportation method. Logistics optimization results show that scenario 1 has an efficiency value of 87% with an LNG-C transport capacity of 0.35 MMSCF, a roundtrip cruise time of 8.6 days and the number of shipments is 36 / year. The detailed analysis of costs in scenario A is 1-2 USD / MMBTU for the milk and run transportation method, 1.49-1.73 USD / MBTU for LNG-C transport costs, and regasification costs which are 1.0-3.7 USD / MMBTU. Based on the above results it can be calculated that the price of gas in the first year of implementation was 13.4 USD / MMBTU, so the total value below this supply chain was Rp.8,812,876,800.00. Therefore, this idea was created as a solution for the initial steps for the utilization of the domestic natural gas distribution</jats:p>",

Manufacturing supply chains have been contemplated but agri-food supply chains and chains related to diversified cropping systems have been also considered. In this way, 54 articles were identified and revised, and were classified according to the three main aspects of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. The classification of articles indicated that more attention has been paid to the environmental aspect in the industry 4.0 (I4.0) context in the literature, while the social aspect has been paid less attention. Finally, reference frameworks were identified, along with the I4.0 models, algorithms, heuristics, metaheuristics, and technologies, which have enabled sustainability in supply chains.</jats:p>"

Cooling air is supplied using a combination arrangement, with cross-flow and impingement together. The louver consists of a row of film cooling holes, contained within a specially-designed device which concentrates, and directs the coolant from a slot, so that it then advects as a layer downstream along the test surface. This louver-supplied coolant is then supplemented by coolant which emerges from different rows of downstream film cooling holes. The same coolant supply passage is employed for the louver row of holes, as well as for the film cooling holes, such that different louver and film cooling mass flow rates are set by different hole diameters for the two different types of cooling holes. The results are different from data provided by past investigations, because of the use and arrangement of the louver slot, and because of the unique coolant supply configurations. The experimental results are given for mainstream Reynolds numbers from 107000 to 114000. Full-coverage blowing ratios are constant with streamwise location along the test surface, and range from 3.68 to 5.70. Corresponding louver slot blowing ratios then range from 1.72 to 2.65. Provided are heat transfer coefficient and adiabatic effectiveness distributions, which are measured along the mainstream side of the test plate. Both types of data show less variation with streamwise development location, relative to results obtained without a louver employed, when examined at the same approximate effective blowing ratio, mainstream Reynolds number, cross flow Reynolds number, and impingement jet Reynolds number. When compared at the same effective blowing ratio or the same impingement jet Reynolds number, spanwise-averaged heat transfer coefficients are consistently lower, especially for the downstream regions of the test plate, when the louver is utilized. With the same type of comparisons, the presence of the louver slot results in significantly higher values of adiabatic film cooling effectiveness (spanwise-averaged), particularly at and near the upstream portions of the test plate. With such characteristics, dramatic increases in thermal protection are provided by the presence of the louver slot, the magnitudes of which vary with experimental condition and test surface location.</jats:p>",

In this study, a 3D fluid flow heat transfer model coupled with turbulence, combustion, heat radiation, and heat exchange models is established to study the combustion and air supply characteristics of a traditional hot blast stove. The results indicate that the nozzle arrangement on the traditional stove causes the flue gas to exhibit a high‐speed swirling flow. Due to the expansion of the flue gas and the centrifugal effect of the swirling flow, the “attachment” phenomenon of the fluid (i.e., a high edge velocity and a low center velocity) occurs in the combustion chamber, resulting in an unreasonable temperature distribution in the combustion chamber and regenerator. Accordingly, an improved design of a top combustion hot blast stove is proposed to solve this problem, and its performance is evaluated and compared with that of the original design via numerical simulations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research explores whether options contract can be used as a mechanism to aid the HO in making procurement of relief material less challenging by addressing two main issues: inventory risk for buyers and over-production risk for suppliers. Furthermore, a contracting mechanism is designed to achieve coordination between the HO and aid material suppliers in the humanitarian supply chain through optimal pricing. The options contract is modelled as a stylized version of the newsvendor problem that allows the HO to adjust their order quantity after placing the initial order at the beginning of the planning horizon. This flexibility helps to mitigate the risk of both overstocking and understocking for the HO as well as the risk of overproduction for the supplier. Our results indicate that the optimal values for decision parameters are not “point estimates” but a range of prices, which can facilitate negotiation between the two parties for appropriate selection of contract parameters under an options contract. The results imply that options contract can aid in the decentralized approach of fixing the prices between the HO and the supplier, which in turn would help in achieving systemic coordination.</jats:p>",

Using mathematics, mechanics, and dam engineering principles, the mathematical expressions of the self-weight component of the dam prior to and following the sealing of the bottom of the arch were derived. The visco-elastoplastic constitutive model of dam concrete during construction was identified and used to develop a stress monitoring model for a super-high arch dam. Based on in-situ stress monitoring data collected during the construction of a super-high arch dam, the stress monitoring model was applied to a super-high arch dam accounting for future impoundment, and the key components of the monitoring model were isolated. The results show that the model has high fitting accuracy and incorporates an appropriate selection of factors affecting dam stress. The hydrograph of each component conforms to the structural characteristics of super-high arch dams during construction. This model overcomes the limitations of applying the complete self-weight of the dam body on the cantilever beam and was validated using data from a super-high arch dam construction project. Thus, this paper provides evidence for a safety monitoring model for super-high arch dams during construction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyses the effects of regional renewable electricity self-sufficiency targets on the power system in Germany. For this purpose, an interdisciplinary approach from social sciences and energy system modelling was chosen, which allows considering qualitative factors such as public acceptance or political stability. Following the concept of context scenarios, consistent raw scenarios are generated by a cross-impact balance analysis (CIB), and the scenarios are quantified by the unit commitment and expansion cost minimisation model ENTIGRIS considering power plants, storages, and the electricity grid. This approach enables an understanding of the system framework conditions and their relationships and allows the combination of qualitative and quantitative scenario descriptors. The most important factors for setting regional self-sufficiency targets were identified through interviews. The main system effects identified are: The regional distribution of generation capacities is strongly influenced by a more demand-oriented installation of generation capacities. This leads to less grid reinforcement, but higher rates of curtailment. In all scenarios, higher utilization of the PV roof potential instead of ground mounted could be observed. The total system costs are increasing only slightly with regional self-supply targets. In general, it was found that the influence of regional self-sufficiency targets is less pronounced in scenarios that already achieve high national RES shares than in scenarios that achieve lower shares, since technology, storage and grid expansion measures are necessary anyway to achieve high RES shares. Overall, the effects here are rather small and the regional objective is not associated with major disadvantages for the system. In a future characterised by stagnation, the system can benefit from regional targeting, as higher renewable shares and lower costs can result. The main conclusion therefore is that regional target setting seem to be beneficial for the overall power system, in terms of system cost, national RE share, acceptance and CO2-emissions.</jats:p>"

By using an oblique/inclined gate, the water transferring capacity of open irrigation canals can be increased. Investigation of free and submerged discharge coefficients for inclined sluice gates is the focus of the present study. First an experimental apparatus incorporating an inclined gate was created. The inclined angle (β) and gate opening (a) were experiment variables, and the five inclination angles include: 0° (vertical gate), 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°. Experimental results showed a greater convergence of flow lines under the gate and increasing the gate angle causes the discharge coefficient to increase. Also experiments showed that increasing the submergence rate (yt/a), decreases the inclined gate discharge coefficient. Performance metrics were created for the experimental results. The metrics utilized Gaussian process (GP) regression, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), random forest (RF) regression and random tree (RT) based models which were used to predict discharge coefficients (Cd) in both submerged and free flow conditions. The model input parameters were the ratio of the upstream water depth to gate opening (y/a) and the inclined angle (β) for free flow and also the submergence rate (yt/a) for submerged flow. The prediction models show that the ANN model in free flow conditions has the following performance metrics: Coefficient of determination, R2= 0.9957, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0044, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.0017. The performance metrics for submerged flow conditions were R2 = 0.9922, RMSE = 0.0079 and MAE = 0.0054. The ANN approach is the most accurate model compared to the others.</jats:p>",

Logistics and supply chain management (SCM) factor prominently in people’s everyday experiences, as consumers of products and logistics services as well as through participation in logistics and supply chain workforces. These everyday experiences can be quite disparate depending on one’s race. As academics, we have a responsibility to peel back the layers of how these issues of race and diversity impact and interact with supply chain phenomena. This editorial is intended to bolster conversation around these issues. We identify compelling themes that merit consideration and, perhaps, deeper investigation, including race as an individual difference variable in our research, race in SCM talent and leadership, and race and racism in SCM execution. We also call for more research that addresses racial inclusion and equal access in other aspects of SCM in light of its far‐reaching influence in the realms of business and society. The time has come to address these pervasive issues affecting organizations and individuals. We also introduce the articles appearing in the current issue of the journal.</jats:p>",

However, the coupling between physical goods and information is often difficult for agri-food items. A solution could be the use of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) systems. Due to its wide reading range, Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) technology is already widely used in logistics and warehousing, mostly for the identification of batches of items. A growing interest is also emerging in Near Field Communication (NFC), as several smartphones embed an integrated NFC antenna. This paper deals with the automatic identification of meat products at item level, proposing and evaluating the adoption of different RFID technologies. Different UHF and NFC solutions are proposed, which benchmark tag performances in different configurations, including four meat types (fatty beef, lean beef, chicken and pork), by using a specifically designed test bench. As avoiding the application of two different tags could be advantageous, dual frequency devices (UHF and NFC) are also considered. Significant differences in tag performances, which also depend on meat type and packaging, are highlighted. The paper highlights that tag positioning should consider the geometry of the packaging and the relative positioning of tag, meat and reader antenna.</jats:p>"

Through the calculation of the risk of carrying dangerous cargoes on an offshore supply vessel in Bohai Sea, the results show that the risk possibility of the supply vessel is medium to low level, the hazard consequence is medium to high level, and the comprehensive risk level is medium. Therefore, the minimum reasonable and feasible ALARP principle should be followed to reduce the risk. The assessment method can judge the risk level of dangerous cargoes carried by offshore supply vessels and provide technical support for emergency response of offshore supply vessels.</jats:p>",

The results revealed that most of the physicochemical parameters were within the permissible limits as specified by FAO, USEPA, and WWF for agriculture water. However, the total dissolved solids, potassium, mercury, nickel, and cadmium were found beyond the recommended ranges. Analysis of variance indicated that the mean values of various constituents differed significantly across the sources.

Constructing heat exchangers with porous metals is an advanced technique of heat exchange increase. A construction of heat exchangers with porous aluminum is described in this paper. The first heat transfer agent (hot water) flows through thin copper tubes installed within the porous aluminum. The second heat transfer agent (freon) flows through the pores of aluminum. Laboratory facility was created to study such a heat exchanger. Series of experiments were carried out. The purpose of the research presented here is to create a mathematical model of heat exchangers with porous metals, to perform analytical calculation of the heat exchangers and to confirm the results with the experimental data. In this case, one can`t use the standard methods of heat exchangers calculation because the pores inner surface area is indeterminate. The developed mathematical model is based on the equation describing the process of cooling the porous plate. A special mathematical technique is used to take into account the effect of tubes with water. The model is approximate but its solution is analytic. It is convenient. One can differentiate it or integrate it, which is very important. Comparison of calculated and experimental data is performed. Divergence of results is within the limits of experimental error. If freon volatilizes inside the heat exchanger, the heat of phase transition has to be taken into account alongside with heat capacity. The structure of the mathematical model makes it possible. The results presented in this paper prove the practicability of using porous materials in heat exchange equipment.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on attribute sensitive products and on attribute sensitive supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reasonable development and creation of any device in which there is an interaction between the fluid flow and the elements of the flow parts (for example, heat exchangers, transport and power machines, main pipelines), is impossible without detailed information about the characteristics of the flow, about the forces on the surfaces that are around, about vibroacoustic phenomena, etc. Among the various methods of obtaining information about the characteristics of the flow, about the forces on surfaces that are flown around, about vibroacoustic phenomena, an important role is played by theoretical methods that rely on the equation of hydrodynamics and numerous ways to solve them. In this case, the main efforts are aimed at solving the system of Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, a general method is described for the numerical solution of the problem of unsteady flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in flat channels of an arbitrary shape of heat exchangers. An effective solution to the problem is achieved by using adaptive networks. The mathematical model of the flow is based on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the variables \"flow function - vortex\" and the Poissonequation for pressure, which are solved on the basis of the finite-difference method. A numerical simulation of the fluid flow in a flat curvilinear elbow is carried out at the Reynolds number Re = 1000. This form reflects the most characteristic features of the flow paths of various hydraulic machines, heat exchangers, hydraulic and pipeline systems. The presentation of the numerical results was carried out on the basis of the VISSIM graphic processing package. One of the main problems (difficulties) in the numerical solution of problems of mathematical physics is the representation of boundary conditions for regions of arbitrary shape. The implementation of various artificial methods that are now used in the approximation of both the curvilinear boundaries themselves and the boundary conditions on them can lead to significant losses in the accuracy of the solution. This is especially evident in problems in which solutions in the boundary region have maximum gradients. An effective method for solving this problem is the use of adapted grids for the computational domain. The essence of this method lies in the fact that such a coordinate system, not necessarily orthogonal, is found in which the boundary lines (surfaces) of the region coincide with the coordinate lines (surfaces). In the flat case, the computational domain is transformed into a rectangular one, and the limit curve is displayed on the sides of the rectangle. In practice, the problem of constructing an adapted mesh is reduced to finding functions that describe the mappings of the canonical (rectangular) region onto the region for which the problem was originally formulated, that is, for the two-dimensional case, the functions x (ξ, η), y (ξ, η) are determined.</jats:p>"

A key novelty of this paper is the use of the Water Diplomacy Framework (WDF) to address supply-demand mismatch using the notion of collaborative problem-solving and joint fact-finding. It builds on innovative applications of game-theoretic approaches and uses equity and sustainability as guiding principles to address the supply-demand mismatch. Five different bankruptcy methods (net benefit ranges between US$17,462M to US$18,201M) and the Nash Bargaining Solution (net benefit ranges between US$18,132M to US$19,216M) are used to resolve supply-demand mismatch in the Indus basin among four provinces within Pakistan. The maximum total benefit generated from the Nash Bargaining Solution is 5.5% higher compared to the best bankruptcy method. Moving from the non-cooperative and rule-based bankruptcy methods to the Nash Bargaining Solutions provided increased benefit for all stakeholders. Reallocation of these increased benefits among the four provinces is done by applying the Nash Bargaining Solutions for homogenous and heterogeneous weights. These findings suggest that aspects of WDF – cooperative problem-solving approaches involving joint fact-finding and exploring different options – has the potential to simultaneously resolve supply-demand mismatch and generate more benefits for all stakeholders.</jats:p>",

However, a systematic network analysis of the literature to understand the development of research over time is lacking. Therefore, this study reviews SCRM modelling and its evolution as a scientific field. We collected 566 papers published in the Scopus database and shortlisted 120 for review. We have analysed the field's performance, mapped the most influential studies, as well as the generative and evolutionary research areas, and derived future research directions. Using bibliometric methods and tools for citation network analysis to understand the field's dynamic development, we find that five generative research areas provide the fundamental knowledge for four evolutionary research areas. The interpretation of gaps and trends in these areas provides an SCRM modelling timeline with 14 future research directions, which should consider adopting a holistic SCRM approach and developing prescriptive and normative risk models. The holistic approach enables more research on key factors—like process integration, design, information risk, visibility and risk coordination—that directly impact industry, decision-makers and sustainability needs. Risk models with evolved prescriptive and normative typology should respect both business model strategies and actual supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The current investigation was carried out with the four chickpea cultivars namely, Fe-efficient (GG-1 and GAG-735) and Fe-inefficient (ICCC-4 and GJG-305). Plant observations were recorded during three different growth stages viz., 20 DAG, 40 DAG and maturity, respectively. The shoot weight and shoot length of Fe-inefficient varieties (ICCC-4 and GJG-305) well responded to the application of Fe as compared to Fe-efficient varieties (GG-1 and GAG-735) with 20 mg Fe Kg-1 application through FeSO4. Lower dose of 20 mg Fe kg-1 was found equally effective in increasing root length and root radius. Root radius (ro) and initial soil solution concentration of Fe (CLi) were found most sensitive parameters influencing Fe uptake, which was followed by maximum net influx (Imax). In no Fe treatment, increasing r0, CLi by a factor of 2.0 times individually caused increase in Fe uptake by 1.60, 1.45 times, 1.36, 1.53 times, 1.16, 1.15 times and 1.05, 1.25 times, respectively in GG-1, GAG-735, ICCC-4 and GJG-305 varieties of chickpea. While, increasing Imax and Km separately by a factor of 2.0 Fe uptake altered in proportions by 1.03, 0.57 times, 0.93, 0.57 times, 0.73, 0.54 times and 0.69 and 0.48 times, respectively in GG-1, GAG-735, ICCC-4 and GJG-305 varieties of chickpea. The ICCC-4 instead of GG-1 and GAG-735 could be rational choice to grow on Fe deficient soil to get with dense Fe content. On the other hand, Fe-Inefficient varieties had 2 times of higher mean Fe-influx at 40 mg Fe kg-1 application than Fe-Efficient varieties.</jats:p>"

While no one will fault any technology that safely and effectively protects and saves lives, many individuals with an array of medical conditions rely on organ donors to provide the liver, kidney, or other organs required to facilitate a life-saving organ transplant. Consequently, one collateral effect of the introduction of driverless car technology will be a reduction in the market supply of healthy organs for transplantation. In this paper, a venture capital lawyer, a medical researcher, and a bioengineer will establish the expected size of this reduction in supply, the associated harm resulting from this reduction, and discuss two promising technological solutions—bioprosthetics and 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs. In the case of both technologies, the authors will discuss the challenges and opportunities presented for institutional investors (private equity, venture capital, angel funds) and medical researchers in tackling the potential reduction in organ donations.</jats:p>"

The Russian Federation bases its geostrategic approach to foreign policy on controlling geopolitical pivots, and endeavors to regain lost influence spheres due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a monopolist in terms of natural gas supply to Central-East European countries, the Russian Federation has strengthened its position by having reach a set of geostrategic goals within the years of 2008-2018. The threat of using natural gas supply shortage as an instrument of foreign policy is one of the biggest challenge for Central-East European countries. The Three Seas Initiative is a popular international policy concept in Central-East Europe.

As the global population continues to increase, we need to feed everyone without irreparably harming the environment. Moreover, the food produced should be affordable, convenient, safe, nutritious and sustainable. This article reviews some of the recent technological advances being employed to design foods to improve their healthiness and sustainability. In particular, emphasis is placed on how processed foods can be redesigned to make them healthier by altering the nature and structural organisation of their constituents to modulate the way they behave inside our bodies. This includes reducing the levels of undesirable food constituents, such as saturated fat, salt and sugar, as well as incorporating health‐promoting ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, bioactive compounds, prebiotics and probiotics. Moreover, foods are being designed to be masticated and digested more slowly or to release their constituents at particular locations along our gastrointestinal tract, which may help to fight obesity and diabetes by reducing appetite. A focus will also be placed on some of the new technologies being developed to create alternatives to animal products, such as meat, milk and egg, which should reduce the amount of meat consumed and alleviate some of its negative impacts on our environment.</jats:p>",

Based on different decision-making perspectives, under different combinations of safety stock factors and demand scenarios, the adjustment coefficients’ decision-making schemes that keep each node in a stable state are obtained.

Besides, studies show that advertising, as one of the major factors, can affect consumer attitudes and has significant effects on demand and profit. On the existing basis, this paper analyzes the advertising strategies under competition between a national brand manufacturer and a retailer with private brand, where the national brand can be sold both through a direct channel and a store channel but the retailer brand can be sold only through a store channel. We study the best advertising investment strategies and the balanced profits of the national brand manufacturer and retailer in the disintegrated system and the integrated system. Specially, in the disintegrated system, we discuss the best decision-making issues for national brand manufacturer and retailer in two special cases which there is only have brand competition or channel spillover effects. We discuss the impacts of the spillover effect and brand competition on the chain members and advertising strategies of different channels. In addition, we design a unilateral advertising subsidy contract to coordinate the supply chain. The results in this paper offer structural and quantitative insights into the interplay between the manufacturer and retailer in the dual channel supply chain and can be used as a reference for choosing the optimal advertising strategy.</jats:p>",

The start-up project was prepared through a profit-sharing partnership between the South Bandung Dairy Cooperative and the owner of the land rights. The harvested whole-plant crop (WPC) was processed to produce packaged silage, further distributed to meet the needs of the member of the cooperative. Data on agriculture input and output as well as their prices were gathered through a field survey. The result of data analysis was examined within a focus group discussion attended by the project authority. The project used hybrid corn that could be planted and harvested twice in a year and yields corn silage on average 78 ton/hectare/year. It required an investment fund of IDR1.5 billion for running the project for over ten years. By using social opportunity cost of the capital of 8% a year, financially it gave a positive Net Present Value. The B/C ratio was 1.34, and the IRR was 28.5%. Three variables have to be controlled by the project management because of the sensitive effect on the project feasibility, it consists of the cost of silage distribution, selling price and WPC/hectare yielded.</jats:p>",

In order to improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting, an attempt was made to use random forest regression (RFR) to model the medium- and long-term runoff forecasting and to further make a verification based on the actual monthly runoff data of Mupo and Chuntangba stations. By comparison with the forecast results attained through a support vector machine (SVM) and an integrated autoregressive moving average model (IARMA), the results showed that the RFR model had the lowest mean square error (MSE) among the three methods. In addition, the coefficients of determination R2 of the RFR for the two stations increased by 0.0261 and 0.0295 compared with the SVM model, and the R2 rose by 0.1134 and 0.1332 compared with the IARMA model. The comparison of the three methods showed that the RFR had higher forecasting accuracy as well as stronger reliability and practicability than the IARMA model and the SVM model, so the RFR provided a new idea and method for the study of runoff forecasting.</jats:p>",

However, these blueprints are only marginally adopted by local agents, and consequently, Ostrom’s design principles do not fully apply. Water shortages are not the immediate outcome of these circumstances as, due to the individual commitment of mostly young men, communal water supply is maintained, especially in emergency cases. By drawing on aspects from the anthropology of ethics and human behavioral ecology, this paper offers an explanation as to why these individuals “volunteer” to keep the pumps running in their communities. It discusses whether rules and sanctions in the Ostromian sense are the only drivers for people to commit themselves to others and the common good. </jats:p>",

We developed a game framework to illustrate how the game can be prepared and played in classrooms. Although the game is primarily developed for classroom teaching, it may be adapted to other training environments. We have provided two examples to demonstrate how the game can be played as a short game in conference environments. Game experiences and feedback are presented with comments from various game participants.

However, the implementation of digital technologies is associated not only with positive effects, but also with risks. When conducting the author’s research, methods of structural and functional analysis, retrospective and comparative approaches, as well as expert assessment were used. Based on this methodology, the authors have identified and considered the main risks of the practical implementation of digital logistics technologies in supply chains. The results have high potential for practical use. It is recommended to take them into account when making management decisions on digitalization of logistics.

We estimate preference heterogeneity using primary data from smallholder farmers and managers of lenders/insurers combined with household socio‐economic survey data in Kenya. We analyse the choice data using maximum simulated likelihood and Hierarchical Bayes estimation of a mixed logit model. Although there are some similarities, we find that there is conflicting demand and supply side preferences for credit terms, collateral requirements, and loan use flexibility. We also analyse willingness to buy and willingness to offer for farmers and suppliers, respectively, for the risk premium for different attributes and their levels. Identifying the preferred attributes and levels for both farmers and financial institutions can guide optimal packaging of insurance and credit providing market participation and adoption motivation for insurance‐bundled credit product.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>На значительной части территории России зима длится более 4 месяцев. Это приводит к образованию речного и озерного льдов, подземных льдов и наледей различного вида, промерзанию почвогрунтов и так далее. Все эти явления в той или иной степени влияют на сток рек. В условиях потепления климата, особенно в зимний период, стокоформирующая роль этих процессов снижается. Так как она до сих пор не оценена, то вопрос о ее значимости в гидрологическом режиме становится все более актуальным. Цель статьи – выполнить оценку совокупного влияния на подземное питание рек России многих криогенных явлений и процессов, формирующихся и происходящих в руслах рек, на водосборах, болотах и заболоченных территориях, в почво-грунтах, трещиноватых и рыхлых горных породах. В основе методики заложено представление о том, что внутригодовая изменчивость емкостных запасов подземных водоносных горизонтов, питающих большие реки, незначительна. Исходя из этого принято, что разница в питании рек подземными водами в зимнюю и летнюю межень определяет влияние всей совокупности криогенных процессов. Определение разницы между зимним и летним меженным стоком рек выполнено по картам летнего и зимнего минимального 30-ти суточного стока 80% обеспеченности. В результате расчетов установлено, что криогенные явления и процессы контролируют 492 км3/год водных ресурсов России. В том числе: на европейской территории – 23; Урале и Западной Сибири – 36; Средней, Северо-Восточной Сибири и Дальнем Востоке – 433 км3/год. То есть в формировании почти 20% суммарного годового стока рек умеренных и северных широт России с устойчивой зимой значительную роль играет температура воздуха. Происходящее и прогнозируемое повышение зимней температуры воздуха на этих территориях может постепенно привести к ослаблению криогенного регулирования стока и к заметным изменениям в водном режиме.

This leads to the formation of river and lake ice, underground ice and ice of various types, freezing of soil, etc. All these phenomena affect the flow of rivers to one degree or another. In a warming climate, especially in winter, the flow-forming role of these processes is reduced. Since it has not yet been evaluated, the question of its significance in the hydrological regime is becoming more and more relevant. The purpose of the article is to assess the cumulative impact of many cryogenic phenomena and processes that form and occur in riverbeds, in catchments, swamps and wetlands, in soils, fractured and loose rocks on the underground nutrition of Russian rivers. The methodology is based on the idea that the intra-annual variability of the reservoir reserves of underground aquifers feeding large rivers is insignificant. Based on this, it is assumed that the difference in the supply of rivers with underground water in the winter and summer periods determines the influence of the entire set of cryogenic processes. The difference between the winter and summer inter-soil flow of rivers was determined using maps of the summer and winter minimum 30-day flow of 80% security. As a result of calculations, it is established that cryogenic phenomena and processes control 492 km3/year of water resources in Russia. Including: in the European territory – 23; the Urals and Western Siberia – 36; Middle, North-Eastern Siberia and the far East – 433 km3/year. In other words, air temperature plays a significant role in the formation of almost 20% of the total annual flow of rivers in Russia's temperate and Northern latitudes with a stable winter. The current and projected increase in winter air temperature in these territories may gradually lead to a weakening of cryogenic regulation of runoff and to noticeable changes in the water regime.

The analysis was performed by using quadratic and power regression equations; the each factor contribution to the productivity value was estimated by the statistical significance of the regression, correlation and determination coefficients. The rice culture sensitivity to the irrigation regime - to the water volume supplied to irrigation systems, and to the temperature regime according to the vegetation months, was analyzed. It was found that only during two months of the growing season - July and September, high temperatures and irrigation water scarcity lack provide a synergistic effect in relation to the high yield formation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dependence of mankind on energy resources only increases with the development of scientific and technological progress. It is clear that the supply of natural energy resources will run out soon. The solution is using new energy generation technologies based on renewable and secondary sources. Due to the presence in Ukraine of operating combined heat and power plants, there is the possibility of producing thermal energy using the secondary heat by absorption heat pumps. At the same time, the thermal energy of flue gases and steam from steam turbines does not heat the atmosphere, but are involved in the generation of thermal energy for heating networks of settlements. Due to the ability of the absorbent solution to absorb and condense water vapor under the influence of low-potential and high-potential heat carriers, it is possible to significantly reduce the consumption of traditional energy resources and increase the overall efficiency of the combined heat and power plants. World experience shows that the use of secondary energy resources can significantly improve the country's energy balance. And the main problem is the availability of these resources. In today's changing climate, the use of renewable energy sources requires additional expences and it is appropriate to pay attention to use of present secondary energy resources, which are not used now. There are a lot of such resources available in heat generating facilities. This is especially noticeable in large cities with central heating networks. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of their work makes it possible to significantly improve the energy balance of the whole country and reduce tariffs for thermal energy for industry and individual consumers, which, in turn, will improve the living standards of citizens.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fundamental analysis of the thermal conductivity and viscosity of quasi-solid capillary-porous bodies (CPBs), which are museum exhibits’ materials, is presented. The air environment parameters change leads to a temperature gradient in the CPBs. Non-uniform heating of the solid medium, in particular, quasi-solid CPB, is not accompanied by convection, and heat transfer is carried out only due to the mechanism of thermal conductivity. In order to create a mathematical model of this process in CPB, a system of partial differential equations in time and space coordinates is obtained. The resulting system adequately describes the thermal conductivity process in quasi-solid CPBs. The anisotropy of CPB’s thermal parameters, especially, its coefficients of thermal expansion and thermal conductivity, is also taken into account. Theoretically, the deformation process during motion in quasi-solid CPB is taken as reversible. In real conditions, the process is thermodynamically reversible only when it occurs at an infinitesimal speed. Then at each point in time, the CPB is able to establish a thermodynamic equilibrium state. Real motion occurs at a finite velocity, the CPB is not in an equilibrium state at any given moment, so there are endogenous processes that try to get it into a balanced condition. The occurrence of these processes causes the irreversibility of motion, which acts, in particular, through the dissipation of mechanical energy, which eventually turns into heat. The energy dissipation is caused by irreversible processes of thermal conductivity and processes of internal friction or viscosity. The dissipative function for isotropic and anisotropic cases was determined in order to analyze the viscosity of quasi-solid CPBs. The viscosity in the equations of motion can be considered by replacing the stress tensor with a tensor, which additionally takes into account the \"dissipative\" stress tensor.</jats:p>"

To explain the immigrant–native representation gap, existing research emphasizes party gatekeepers and structural conditions. But a more complete account must consider the possibility that the representation gap begins at the supply stage. Are immigrants simply less interested in elected office? To test this explanation, we carried out an innovative case–control survey in Sweden. We surveyed elected politicians, candidates for local office, and residents who have not run; stratified these samples by immigrant status; and linked all respondents to local political opportunity structures. We find that differences in political ambition, interest, and efficacy do not help explain immigrants' underrepresentation. Instead, the major hurdles lie in securing a candidate nomination and being placed on an electable list position. We conclude that there is a sufficient supply of potential immigrant candidates, but immigrants' ambition is thwarted by political elites.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is mandatory to analyze the potential risk of automotive systems failure because it could have a significant impact on humans’ safety. This paper proposes a novel, functional safety concept at the power management level of a system basis chip (SBC), from the development phase to system design. In the presented case, the safety-critical application is represented by a powertrain transmission electronic control unit. A step-by-step design guideline procedure is presented, having as a focus the cost, safety, and performance to obtain a robust, cost-efficient, safe, and reliable design. To prove compliance with the ISO 26262 standard, quantitative worst-case evaluations of the hardware have been done. The assessment results qualify the proposed design with automotive safety integrity levels (ASIL, up to ASIL-D). The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how to apply the functional safety concept to a real, safety-critical system by following the proposed design methodology.</jats:p>"

Deciphering sediment routing to the Scotian Basin, offshore eastern Canada, is marred by sedimentary recycling but is critical to understanding the evolution of the Canadian margin in response to the evolving Labrador rift. In this study, Pb isotopes in detrital K-feldspars were fingerprinted in 13 wells across the Scotian Basin to track first-cycle sand supply. Unlike previous approaches, which utilized less labile proxies such as zircon, detrital K-feldspars are unlikely to survive multiple sedimentary cycles.</jats:p><jats:p>The Pb-isotopic data reveal a dynamic seesaw effect between hinterland sources across the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, reflecting the complex interplay between the northward propagation of uplift along the rising Labrador rift flank and the reactivation of fault systems in the lower drainage basin. Pb isotopes in K-feldspar record progressively increasing long-distance supply from eastern Labrador, as early as the Callovian in the central basin, alongside diminishing but persistent local sourcing from adjacent Appalachian terranes. Comparison with more resilient mineral proxies, notably zircon, appears to confirm recycling in the lower drainage basin and highlights the limitations of using a single mineral proxy in isolation.</jats:p><jats:p>This case study serves as an example of the growing potential of multiproxy provenance toolkits not only to decipher sediment-routing corridors in paleodrainage systems, but to better define and connect the drivers, mechanisms, and spatial and temporal ranges of Earth surface processes and tectonic events.</jats:p>",

The irrigated coastal area of Dyiar-Al-Hujjej has observed a drop in agricultural activity following a seawater intrusion. Thus, yields have become disrupted in direct relation to the quantities of fresh water supplied and transferred over a distance of 100 km. For the sustainability of this area, the feasibility of using desalinated water to stabilize the irrigation water supply was analyzed. When all crop water requirements are to be met with desalinated water, the net income is negative for crops currently grown, except strawberry. All the open-field crops remain unprofitable even in the case of agro-industrial development, except tomatoes. A blending between desalinated seawater and aquifer saltwater also leads to a negative income for the main crops. The introduction of greenhouses to replace the same open-season crops is beneficial when desalinated water is used. The use of desalinated water in irrigation faces the high cost of desalination (0.5 US $/m3) while the average price of irrigation water in Tunisia is 0.05 US $/m3. Desalination can be recommended only in the case of crops with low need for water and high added value.</jats:p>",

However, most gate drivers for normally‐off SiC JFETs require not only a positive power supply for turning on the JFET but also a negative power supply for turning it off and maintaining a negative gate–source voltage to suppress a false turn‐on power loss caused by crosstalk during fast switching. Therefore, modifications of gate drivers increase complications and costs. In this study, a normally‐off SiC JFET gate driver, which can be realized using a simple circuit configuration with a single power supply, is proposed. To minimize undesirable crosstalk, the gate‐source voltage of the JFET is driven to a negative value and retained in the state for a long period of time. © 2020 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Combined with EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) and the topic of remanufacturer, adopting green innovation has been an effective way when green supply chain management is applied. In this paper, we focus on the activity of green innovation and build a model where the manufacturer will invest in green innovation to improve the product availability rate of recycled products and save the cost in the process of remanufacturing. Besides, we take three stages in a cycle into consideration, that is, production/sale, recycling used production, and remanufacture/sale, and meanwhile, the government gives a subsidy to enterprises to encourage the activity of recycling. In the process of model solving, we take a dynamic decision-making way into consideration. We find that the decision adjustment speed of players has a significant effect on the stability, and in a long dynamic repeated game process, with the speed of decision adjustment increasing, the system enters into chaos at the end of the process. It is interesting that when the speed of decision adjustment exceeds the critical point of the bifurcation diagram, the profit of the manufacturer decreases and then enters a chaotic state. Besides, with the level of subsidies increasing, the area of stable region decreases gradually. Certain investment has a positive effect on product selling and recycling as well as the profit, and the government subsidy undoubtedly raises the profit of manufacturers and encourages the activity of recycling. In the end, we make chaos control by adjusting the decision method.</jats:p>",

The current study draws from an extensive review to propose a competitive, inclusive, sustainable and scalable supply chain model of primary processing centers connecting farmers directly and efficiently with consumers. The proposed model will connect producers with the rest of the supply chain and streamline the supply chain process to reduce post-harvest losses as much as possible. The integration of a market information system will ensure transparency to help in better decision-making, reduced intermediaries and information asymmetry for producers, as well as the systematic disposal of the produce.

The party offering the trade‐in program faces the trade‐off between the fixed trade‐in cost incurred and the additional revenue generated. By conducting a game‐theoretic study, we analytically explore in this article the optimal choice of trade‐in provider in a dyadic supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer. We show that the trade‐in models can bear a much higher manufacturing cost and induce a higher new product sale than the benchmark case without trade‐ins. It is possible that both the manufacturer and retailer prefer to undertake the trade‐in program, which would lead to a conflict; or both firms prefer to be a free rider instead of being the trade‐in provider, which would fall into a prisoner's dilemma. Moreover, the powerful manufacturer has an incentive to delegate the trade‐in service to the retailer when facing a higher fixed trade‐in cost, but the delegation option is always worse off for the retailer compared to the scenario in which the retailer provides trade‐ins by herself. We also show that the trade‐in scenarios always benefit the environment and consumers of the replacement segment, but hurt the primary segment consumers. The social welfare would actually be higher in the scenarios with trade‐ins if the fixed trade‐in cost is relatively low and the residual value of old products is relatively high.</jats:p>",

Ten commodity groups (Wheat, Rice, Milk, Meat, Vegetables, Fruits, Pulses, Oil/Ghee, Tea and Other food were developed for analysis.

This implies that in future demand for milk and fruits would increase more proportionately as income would increase. The own price elasticities of all 10-food groups were also found congruent to economic theory (Wheat-0.28, Rice-0.65, Milk-0.92, Meat-0.34, Fruits-0.61, Vegetables-0.21, Pulses-0.29, Oil and ghee-0.04, Tea-0.35 and Other food-0.32). The income and own price elasticities depicted that wheat, vegetables, pulses and oil and ghee are necessities as compared to other food groups. The cross-price elasticity illustrated that rice could be a substitute for wheat and wheat for rice in the State of AJK. The Berry’s Index (82.43) depicted that food was diverse on average with a minimum Index value of 61.31. The study of different factors in relation to Berry’s Index depicted that education and income significantly and positively affect Berry’s Index while location of household in urban or rural area do not affect diversification of food. Inclusion of all necessities in Food Stamp program and Ramadan package and efforts by agriculture and livestock department regarding improved production of food commodities are recommended.</jats:p>"

The products of the two manufacturers are complementary products. One manufacturer sells products simultaneously through its own online channel and the traditional retailer, and the manufacturer delivers the product’s service to the retailer in its network direct sales channel by cooperating with the retailer in the form of service cost sharing. Considering the different market power structures of channel members, we establish three different pricing game models. By using the backward induction method and game theory, we obtain the corresponding analytical equilibrium solutions. Then, the service cooperation strategy of using the channel service sensitivity coefficients to construct the weight to share the service cost is proposed. Finally, numerical examples of optimal pricing strategies and profit conditions in different game situations are given, and sensitivity analysis of some key parameters is selectively performed, in which some valuable management insights are obtained.</p>",

Ideally, an objective measure of milk supply would either dispel or confirm this perception and provide reassurance or guide professional advice. Clinical signs of sufficient milk intake (steady growth, sufficient elimination, infant alertness and breasts feeling full before breastfeeds and soft after breastfeeds) should provide confidence in milk supply. We surveyed 423 mothers in early lactation who had breastfeeding problems to determine the proportion that had PIMS and to determine if the mothers with PIMS relied on these clinical signs or other perceptions of their infants' behaviour as indications of insufficient milk supply. By 3 weeks after birth, we found that the rate of PIMS among mothers with breastfeeding problems was 44%. Supplementary infant formula was being given to 66% of the infants, so the clinical indications were that milk intake was sufficient, but 74% of the mothers with PIMS cited concerns that their infants did not appear satisfied after breastfeeds. After targeted advice from lactation consultants, mothers with PIMS showed positive changes in their perceptions of their milk supply, underlining the value of professional guidance soon after birth. We conclude that an appearance of infant dissatisfaction is the major cause of PIMS in Western Australia.</jats:p>",

However, several lines of evidence suggest that lateral supply of aged organic matter hosted on lithogenic particles derived from sediment resuspension may also be a significant process. Despite its potential importance, lateral POC supply has not been systematically examined on a global scale. Here, we assess the contribution of resuspended sediment to sinking particulate matter in the ocean using literature data of sediment trap studies. Proportions and absolute fluxes of lithogenic material at 158 sites and available radiocarbon contents are compiled to develop a global‐scale assessment. We find that lithogenic material accounts for 25 ± 20% of sinking particulate matter, comprising a mean flux of 67 mg m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Lithogenic material flux generally decreased with increasing distance from the coast and with increasing height above the seafloor. The Δ<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C values of POC exhibited a linear relationship with a wt/wt ratio of lithogenic material to POC. Loadings of aged POC to lithogenic material obtained from this relationship were similar to or higher than POC content of the surface sediment in the vicinity. Based on this relationship, and the global mean of lithogenic material content of sinking particulate matter, we calculate that aged POC from sediment resuspension comprises 0.2–0.7% of sinking particles and 4–11% of sinking POC intercepted by sediment traps.</jats:p>",

Although, to some extent, the emergence of supply chain finance can enhance the financing capacity of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reduce financial risks of financial institutions, with the development of smart city and smart finance, the financial risks of SMEs are more complex, infectious, dormant, and difficult to accurately identify and measure. Facing this status, financial institutions have been required to understand and evaluate the financial risks of SMEs from a new perspective. Therefore, this paper, based on the study of financial risks assessment of SMEs under the smart city and smart finance, innovatively constructs a new index evaluation system for supply chain finance, based on improved hesitant fuzzy linguistic PROMETHEE method, and the effectiveness and advantages of the model have been verified through an example. To a certain degree, the SMEs financing the evaluation model and improved PROMETHEE method can not only help financial institutions reduce the risks in the specific financial transactions but also reduce the survival threat of financial institutions. Moreover, it is of positive significance to the stable operation of the financial system.</jats:p>",

Then, a multiobjective optimal matching model is constructed based on the largest overall satisfaction of the logistics service supply and demand side and the smallest satisfaction variance of the supply- and demand-side individual, and the multiobjective solution algorithm is designed based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III). Interval numbers are used to sort the matching results to obtain the approximately optimal two-sided matching scheme.

The mechanics of such media is characterized by spectra of viscous, plastic and elastic properties in their various combinations. The forming of these substances is influenced by the microclimatic conditions of the premises, in which these processes take place. In technological operations, as a rule, large shear deformations take place, which greatly exceed the elastic limit. Thus, the most significant for technological calculations are viscoplastic properties, which reflect the relationship between the existing shear stresses and the rate of irreversible shear deformation. For a qualitative description of this relationship, it is customary to use consistency curves that relate shear stresses to the rate of irreversible shear deformation or the dependence of the effective viscosity on the rate of irreversible shear deformation. Structure formation is one of the main processes in the technology of processing solidifying paste-like and liquid-like media when their characteristics approach those inherent in the corresponding capillary-porous bodies. The properties of such media depend on the type and nature of the structure. The study and control of the process of structure formation to obtain a medium with desired properties is an important technological task, which can be solved, in particular, by microclimate systems. The change in the structural state of the solidifying medium can be estimated from the corresponding changes in plastic and conventional mechanical strength, degree of hydration, heat release, elastic modulus, etc. In this work, structure formation is understood as a process, as a result of which the characteristics of the material approach the characteristics of the corresponding capillary-porous body (CPB). The main parameter that determines this approximation is the degree of completeness of structure formation. Analysis of the hardening process of the considered pasty and liquid-like media on the basis of the moisture state diagram makes it possible to fix the structural state of the capillary-porous structure of these media and to evaluate the interaction of chemical reactions and the process of structure formation. And the resulting changes in the rate of structure formation allows to identify and evaluate the destructive processes that occur during solidification of the substance.</jats:p>"

This is done to have an optimal oxygen excess ratio in the fuel cell for enhanced energy generation. The higher order dynamics of PEMFC is approximated to be non‐integer first‐order stable plus time delay model. A simple proportional ‐integral/proportional‐integral‐derivative (PI/PID) control scheme is designed for a specific maximum sensitivity (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>Ms</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>) using analytical tuning rules. This, in turn, enhances its dynamic performance by regulating the SM pressure. The proposed integer order PI/PID control technique is compared with the other fractional order IMC‐PI control techniques that are recently published. The simulation results obtained prove that the proposed tuning rules provide a good response compared with fractional order controllers and thereby maintaining the SM pressure. The robustness of the novel controller is analyzed by introducing perturbations and noise to the dynamic model. The tuning rules proposed are applicable for two maximum sensitivity values of 1.4 and 2 as a measure of robustness. To measure system performance, few time domain metrics and integral absolute error (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>IAE)</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>, integral square error (<jats:styled-content><jats:italic>ISE)</jats:italic></jats:styled-content>, and <jats:styled-content><jats:italic>TV</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> metrics are used. For both the <jats:styled-content><jats:italic>Ms</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> values, the proposed techniques provide stable and improved responses.</jats:p>",

This study presents a new view of the association between health insurance and labor supply by using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. The results reveal that the health insurance system has a remarkable effect on labor supply. The health insurance coverage tends to encourage middle-aged and elderly farmers to increase their farm labor participation rate and working time, especially for their household agricultural labor participation rate and working time. However, it also reduces the non-farm labor participation rate and working time. Different types of health insurance have diverse effects on labor supply. The new cooperative medical insurance has a stronger pull-back effect. It encourages the middle-aged and elderly farmers to leave the urban non-farm sector and transfer to rural areas to engage in their household agricultural work. The urban employee medical insurance encourages farmers to reduce self-employed labor supply and increase employed work. The supplemental health insurance tends to reduce the labor supply of farm employed and non-farm labor supply, but improve the farm labor supply. Furthermore, urban resident medical insurance and government medical insurance encourage farmers to quit directly from the labor market. In conclusion, the health insurance system is facilitating change in the labor market. Policy-makers should pay full attention to such impacts while improving the health insurance system’s design and operation in China.</jats:p>"

Although this approach is highly structured, \n  limitations such as overemphasizing the cost criterion and failure to meet other criteria, utilizing team members’ votes to rank solutions, ignoring inherent uncertainty \n  and ultimately disagreement between value engineering team members have reduced the effectiveness of this approach. The present study aims to provide a coherent framework \n  for utilizing a value engineering approach to supply chain cost management and overcome the aforementioned limitations by utilizing gray multi-criteria decision-making. \n  In this regard, in the first phase, the initial list of improvement solutions is determined, the criteria extracted from the literature are localized using value engineering \n  team members’ opinion. These criteria are weighted using the gray stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA-Gray) method. Then, the score of each solution is calculated \n  by the value engineering team based on the list of criteria as a gray number. The scores are aggregated using the gray evaluation based on distance from average solution \n  (EDAS-Gray) method, and the solutions are prioritized. Finally, the application of the proposed framework is investigated in a real case study in a power plant in Iran. \n  The results of the research show that the final rankings of the solutions rarely changed for different methods; so the model used in this study \n  has acceptable stability.</jats:p>",

It revealed that the interaction between FeSO4 concentration and NaBH4 concentration had a significant effect on the preparation of montmorillonite-loaded nanometer zero-valent iron material, playing a key role in the removal of amoxicillin, and the effect of FeSO4 concentration was even more significant. In addition, the shape, structure and characteristic groups of the prepared materials were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), etc. The nanometer zero-valent iron loaded with montmorillonite can effectively slow down the nZVI agglomeration effect and improve the effect of material degradation of pollutants. For the same concentration of amoxicillin wastewater, the removal rate of amoxicillin wastewater, after 1 h reaction, is as follows: Mont/nZVI &amp;gt; nZVI &amp;gt; Mont. The optimal conditions for the reaction are: pH is 3, the initial concentration is 60 mg/L, and the dosage is 2 g/L. The higher the temperature, the more amoxicillin is degraded by Mont/nZVI.</jats:p>",

Plagued by arsenic contamination, the state has been pushing to expand and consolidate a networked piped infrastructure bringing in treated surface water. This shift threatens to reconfigure the existing diverse infrastructure configurations that are fragmented, incremental in nature. We examine the scholarship on the situated and embodied forms of Urban Political Ecology to understand how everyday social relations and plural practices at the level of the town, the ‘para’ (roughly neighbourhood), and the household shape socio-material artefacts. The shift in the socio-technical configurations, in turn, lead to new forms of power coalitions, network conflicts, and collaborations. Through an in-depth qualitative examination, we conclude that heterogeneous infrastructure configurations and everyday practices are not only gendered but also intricately embedded within intersections of social affinity, intimate geographies, and embodied class power relations in the ‘para’. </jats:p>",

This study examines the effect of CSR orientation incongruence on relationship performance. Drawing on the congruence theory literature, we posit that a firm's relationship performance may suffer when there is incongruence between the levels of CSR orientations of supply chain partners. Furthermore, we adopt a network perspective and argue that certain characteristics of a firm's egocentric social network (i.e., network centrality and network diversity) may moderate the linkage between CSR orientation incongruence and relationship performance. Our empirical study, which is based on dyadic data, indeed reveals that a firm's relationship performance is adversely affected when the firm and its major supply partner have incongruent levels of CSR orientations. Such a negative effect is moderated by the firm's egocentric social network. Specifically, the negative impact of incongruent CSR orientation is heightened if the firm occupies a central position in the egocentric network. Network diversity, however, plays a contrasting role as a firm's relationship performance may be less susceptible to incongruent CSR orientations when there is access to a diverse social network.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a third-party remanufacturer responsible for collecting used products and remanufacturing is constructed. Considering the quality level of remanufactured products, four kinds of closed-loop supply chain alliance structure models are constructed. The optimal equilibrium decisions of these four models are compared and analyzed. The optimal decisions of the models are verified by numerical analysis. Furthermore, the impacts of the quality of remanufactured products and the decision influence of the third-party remanufacturer in the alliance on the remanufacturer’s decision are further analyzed. The results show that remanufactured products are competitive with new products, and the improvement of the remanufactured product quality will reduce the market demand of new products. The equilibrium decision of the closed-loop supply chain is affected by the alliance behavior of members in the closed-loop supply chain and the quality level of remanufactured products. The higher the decision concentration of the closed-loop supply chain is, the more favorable the supply chain is; the higher the remanufacturing quality level is, the more favorable the supply chain is, and the alliance decision of the third-party remanufacturer is affected by the quality level of remanufactured products and the decision-making influence of the third-party remanufacturer in the alliance structure. We find that the improvement of the concentration degree of closed-loop supply chain decision can benefit the supply chain by improving the remanufacturing quality level, which has direct effect on the alliance decision of the third-party remanufacturer. In most cases, the choice of the alliance is the dominant decision of the third-party remanufacturer. </jats:p>",

The study presents the results of the research on the productivity features and adaptability parameters of domestic corn hybrids under different irrigation modes and water supply under conditions of the Arid Steppe. Methods. The general scientific, special selection genetic, computational and comparative research methods were used. The research object was modern corn hybrids of domestic selection of different maturity groups. The hybrids were sown under different irrigation modes (common sprinkling, drip irrigation, sub-irrigation). Results. The retrospective analysis of the productivity of main grain crops in the area of the Arid Steppe over a 130-year period showed that the highest rates of an increase in productivity were recorded in corn. An annual increase in its productivity was 31 kg/ha per year and it was due to the use of new varieties (hybrids) and the improvement of growing techniques. Irrigation made it possible to realize potential productivity of new hybrids and increase the productivity from 6.59 to 82.3 c/ha. Productivity rose 12.5 times over a 130-year period, the annual increase being 58 kg/ha per year. Without irrigation the grain productivity was the highest in early-maturing hybrids – 3.28 and 3.05 t/ha indicating their high drought resistance. The use of these hybrids is appropriate under conditions of water-saving irrigation modes on irrigated lands with a low hydro-module and on dry massifs. A fall in the productivity under other irrigation modes was from 0.41 to 1.93 t/ha. Conclusions. Under irrigation conditions it is necessary to use corn hybrids with a genetically programmed reaction to optimal growing conditions (an optimal mode of soil moisture and mineral nutrition).&#x0D;\nKeywords: hybrid, corn, irrigation, adaptability, drought resistance, grain, selection.</jats:p>"

We present a system approach for the optimal design and operation of pumping systems in real-world high-rise buildings that is based on the usage of mixed-integer nonlinear and mixed-integer linear modeling approaches. In addition, we consider different booster station topologies, i.e. parallel and series-parallel central booster stations as well as decentral booster stations. To confirm the validity of the underlying optimization models with real-world system behavior, we additionally present validation results based on experiments conducted on a modularly constructed pumping test rig. Within the models we consider layout and control decisions for different load scenarios, leading to a Deterministic Equivalent of a two-stage stochastic optimization program. We use a piecewise linearization as well as a piecewise relaxation of the pumps’ characteristics to derive mixed-integer linear models. Besides the solution with off-the-shelf solvers, we present a problem specific exact solving algorithm to improve the computation time. Focusing on the efficient exploration of the solution space, we divide the problem into smaller subproblems, which partly can be cut off in the solution process. Furthermore, we discuss the performance and applicability of the solution approaches for real buildings and analyze the technical aspects of the solutions from an engineer’s point of view, keeping in mind the economically important trade-off between investment and operation costs.</jats:p>",

Patchouli oil industry which is mainly located in Aceh Jaya Regency is the object of this study due to the fact it is the largest supplier of patchouli oil in Aceh Province. It is estimated that patchouli oil which is one of the superior local wisdom product is becoming an interesting subject again. This is indicated by several local products that use it as the main raw material.

Demand interdependence (product substitutability) among various brands is critical and thus we investigate its impact on firms’ profits. Using an economic framework with manufacturers operating as Stackelberg leaders, our analysis reveals unique and substantive insights dependent on the underlying market demand structure, and in some cases, the extent of supply coverage. For the Spence–Dixit–Vives demand structure, we find that competing manufacturers prefer to offer brands with low levels of substitutability while retailer’s preferences are moderated by the interaction effect between the number of competing brands and level of product substitutability (essentially the retailer prefers high levels of substitutability when the number of brands is “small,\" and vice versa). For the Shubik–Levitan demand structure, manufacturers may prefer high or low levels of product substitutability depending on the extent of supply coverage while the retailer always prefers high levels of product substitutability. These findings offer useful prescriptions for category management and persuasive advertising. </jats:p>",

The quality of transfused blood is crucial in this process as blood donors must be free of transfusion‐transmissible infections and donated blood should be compatible to that of the recipient. The quality of donated blood could be affected by the quality of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) used in the screening process. Consequently, the need for high‐quality, safe and well‐performing IVDs for use in transfusion medicine arises, accompanied by the need for tight regulations in this domain. In the European Union, the new IVD Regulation will replace the existing IVD Directive within a five‐year transitional period. Manufacturers of IVDs are expected to fully comply with the new Regulation by 26 May 2022. In this review, we address the major differences relating to marketing authorization and testing between this new Regulation and its predecessor. We further present the main elements of the prequalification assessment introduced by the WHO for IVDs, including disease‐specific IVDs for blood screening laboratories.</jats:p>",

Therefore, technology is needed to solve the problem through the innovation of a milk sterilization machine with the principle of non-thermal plasma sterilization by utilizing plasma technology to reduce microbial contamination. The output frequency and voltage are determined through software simulation using voltmeter, oscilloscope, and counter timer. After 220VAC supplies a voltage step down and rectifier circuit to produce a 12VDC output voltage to supply the Switching circuit voltage and the Flyback Transformer driver. Rated voltage and frequency reach 20kV 15kHz.The positive wire from the Flyback Transformer is connected to the acrylic box filled with water (positive electrode) and the ground wire is connected to another acrylic sheet (ground electrode. The milk medium to be sterilized can be placed on the positive electrode or between the ground and positive electrodes. Non-thermal plasma has an effective ability to decontaminate bacteria. This is because plasma is composed of a mixture of ionized particles, reactive radical molecules, and also ultraviolet Schematic circuit design has been successfully simulated. Acrylic sterilization media designs can be used to generate plasma. The mechanism of bacterial sterilization in milk is by the activity of inhibiting bacterial biofilms which can lead to bacterial DNA damage through reactive species in the non-thermal plasma used. Milk quality testing is carried out based on comparison of supporting literature with milk quality requirements according to SNI 3950: 2014.</jats:p>"

This study found that there is limited literature available on the operationalization of the concept, and energy use is not considered a key performance indicator by water regulators and utilities. Regionally, most of the studies were carried out in the northern and southern Africa, where energy demand for water supply through desalination is high. An analysis of water supply and demand drivers show diminishing quantities of available freshwater, and increased anthropogenic pollutant loads in some areas are projected. Consequently, utilities will likely consider alternative energy-intensive water supply options. Increased population growth with the highest global urban growth rate is projected, with about 60% of the total population in Africa as urban dwellers by 2050. This implies huge growth in water demand that calls for investment in technology, infrastructure, and improved understanding of energy use and optimization, as the largest controllable input within utilities boundaries. However, it requires a data-driven understanding of the operational drivers for water supply and incorporation of energy assessment metrics to inform water-energy policies and to exploit the nexus opportunities.</jats:p>"

The analyses were performed based on authors who studied the region, reports of private companies and government agencies and public databases. The research results show a contradiction between the strong presence of the poultry space circuit, which requires cereals (especially maize) to supply the ration factories, and the gradual reduction of this cereal cultivation areas in the regional agricultural space. We also deal with the presence of non-hegemonic actors (unions and cooperatives) that work in the region concerned with the \"field issues\" and that seek to stimulate, and organize, an agricultural production based on the regional territory, with the objective of mitigating and overcoming the problems in the rural spaces engendered by the corporate use the territory.Keywords: Use of territory; Poultry production; Regional production of maize; Geopolitics of the place</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sustainable delivery of drinking water of adequate quantity/quality sits at the core of rural development paradigms worldwide. The overarching goal of this study was to assess operational performance of rural water supply services (RWSS) in India to help authorities understand challenges/shortfalls vis-à-vis opportunities. Data on habitation-level coverage, aggregated by states between 2013 and 2018, were obtained from the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) database, against two water supply norms, namely, 40 lpcd and 55 lpcd (litres per capita per day). Results indicate that certain states are faring better (providing full coverage to over 90% habitations) while others are lagging (e.g., the north-eastern region, and Kerala and Karnataka in the South, for both norms). Several states yet fail to provide 55 lpcd to over half of their rural habitations. Overall, RWSS is marked by high spatial heterogeneity, inequality and recurrent slip-backs (decline in year-to-year habitation coverage) that thwart the basic motto of NRDWP— Har Ghar Jal (Water for All). Ground-level experience reveals a mismatch between theoretical systems’ output (40 lpcd and 55 lpcd) and on-site delivery, and highly intermittent services. Moreover, frequent scheme failure/abandonment adds to systems’ uncertainties and water users’ plight. A multitude of operational/organisational flaws, associated with government waterworks bodies, at different levels of systems’ hierarchy, limit RWSS operational performance. To that end, the concluding section argues for a demand-driven RWSS model (bottom-up systems’ governance) and highlights the core tenets of the same that call for integration of environmental, social, cultural, ethical and political perspectives in RWSS systems’ thinking/design. </jats:p>",

Elevated Road Project is one of the way to minimize the effect land acquisition, and also Joint operation (JO) and applying Non Cash Loan (NCL) at the form Supply Chain Financing (SCF) in project can have good performance effect that can be see positif Project Cash Flow (PCF). Supply Chain Financing (SCF) is a financial instrument issued by financial institutions with various terms and conditions applicable to a supply chain that occurs between buyers and sellers, which aims to optimize the management of working capital and company liquidity. However, the selection of the SCF financing scheme also has a weakness where there is a cost of money that must be spent in the process. The purpose of this study was to determine the NCF SCF Cost Structure and evaluate the implementation of the use of SCF facilities on the elevated road project performance with a JO project case study at PT.X. Research methodology using survey and project cases study, while for the conducted to determine cost structure using statistical descriptive analysis. This study produce cost structure table which is majority for material, equipment, and sub contractor can be implemented using NCL SCF, also implementation procurement procedure using SCF until invoicing.</jats:p>",

These ecosystems may return to their pre‐disturbance state after disturbance ceases; however, humans have altered the environment in ways that may change the rate or direction of this recovery. For example, human activities have increased supplies of biologically limiting nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which can reduce grassland diversity and increase productivity. We tracked the recovery of a grassland for two decades following an intensive agricultural disturbance under ambient and elevated nutrient conditions. Productivity returned to pre‐disturbance levels quickly under ambient nutrient conditions, but nutrient addition slowed this recovery. In contrast, the effects of disturbance on diversity remained hidden for 15 years, at which point diversity began to increase in unfertilised plots. This work demonstrates that enrichment of terrestrial ecosystems by humans may alter the recovery of ecosystems and that disturbance effects may remain hidden for many years.</jats:p>",

At the same time, power delivery infrastructures are challenged by extreme weather events. Losses in primary food production due to electrical outages are still largely unquantified. This paper reports the effect of storm-induced power outages on milk production in Finland. The study used detailed, farm-level records of power cuts from 2010 to 2015 available from two power companies and contrasted them to the respective monthly milk production statistics collected at farm level. For each major storm event, deviation in the milk production compared to previous month was calculated for each farm. Effect of power outages onto milk production was estimated using linear mixed modeling. Power outages mainly occurred during and after storm events, and dairy farms experienced more outages than what was a national average for rural power customers. The power outages decreased the monthly milk yield of the most affected farms by 4.6% (farms experiencing outages longer than 72 h), and production recovered already for the month following the storm event. The results imply that milk production in Finland is prepared and resilient toward power outages shorter than 3 days and that the current magnitude of power outages in dairy farms is higher than what was known previously.</jats:p>",

The temperature of water returned into a network from the user is an important indicator of the energy efficiency of the heat supply system.

It is necessary to obtain equations that directly determine the temperature of the network water after each stage of the heaters and returned to the heat supply network. Results. By the method of modeling variable modes of operation of the heat supply system, the equations of the temperature schedules of the operation of the heating station with a two-stage scheme for connecting the hot water heaters are obtained. The dependences for the coefficients of the equations of the temperature graphs after each stage of the hot water heaters are determined. Conclusions. The obtained equations are valid for the heating schedule of central regulation, including with a cut, in the maximum water consumption mode in the hot water supply system. An analysis of the operating modes of the heat supply system revealed patterns that makes it possible to predict the temperature of the return network water depending on the outdoor temperature and variable water consumption in the hot water supply system.</jats:p>",

As desalination capacity increases, reducing the energy consumption of the RO process per permeate volume (i.e., specific energy consumption) is of particular importance. In this study, numerical models are used to characterize and compare the energy efficiency of one-stage continuous RO, multi-stage continuous RO, and closed-circuit RO (CCRO) processes. The simulated results across a broad range of feed salinity (5,000–50,000 ppm, i.e., 5–50 g kg−1) and recovery (40%–95%) demonstrate that, compared with the most common one-stage continuous RO, two-stage and three-stage continuous RO can reduce the specific energy consumption by up to 40.9% and 53.6%, respectively, while one-stage and two-stage CCRO can lead to 45.0% and 67.5% reduction, respectively. The differences in energy efficiencies of various RO configurations are more salient when desalinating high-salinity feed at a high recovery ratio. From the standpoints of energy saving and capital cost, the simulated results indicate that multi-stage CCRO is an optimal desalination process with great potential for practical implementation.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer or 3PL can act as the guarantor for the retailer who borrows bank credit. Two different leadership structures are investigated, namely, Nash game and manufacturer leadership Stackelberg game, where the manufacturer and 3PL decide simultaneously and sequentially, respectively. The supply chain under both leadership structures prefers guarantor financing to traditional bank financing when the supply chain is sufficiently cost‐efficient. In the Nash game, however, firms encounter a free‐rider dilemma when choosing between MG and LG, wherein both potential guarantors prefer the other to be the guarantor. This free‐rider dilemma can be resolved in the Stackelberg game. We also observe the follower–guarantor advantage in the Stackelberg game, wherein all firms favor the follower to provide guarantor financing. Our analysis shows that the supply chain under guarantor financing with a longer decision hierarchy (i.e., the Stackelberg game) can be conditionally more effective than that with a shorter one (i.e., the Nash game). By further analyzing different cost structures, pricing mechanism, and retailer’s initial capital, we find that most of our qualitative results remain accurate under more sophisticated conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of the value of guarantor financing in a capital‐constrained supply chain and the impact of leadership structure on financing decisions. </jats:p>",

In this study, -based photo-decomposition of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in a VUV/sulfite system was investigated. The kobs of PFHxS decomposition in the studied system was 0.0049 ± 0.0005 min−1, which was 24.5-fold faster than that in a sole VUV system. It was demonstrated that was the main reactive species responsible for PFHxS decomposition. PFHxS decomposition kinetics were accelerated at higher initial solution pH and sulfite dosage, but were restrained when higher initial PFHxS concentration was introduced. Co-existence of chloride showed slight enhancement of PFHxS decomposition, whereas nitrate and bicarbonate suppressed PFHxS decomposition. Accompanying PFHxS decomposition, short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were detected as main intermediate products. PFHxS decomposition started with C-S bond fracture, followed by perfluoroalkyl radical hydrolysis reactions and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) formation. Afterwards, PFHxA was defluorinated by stepwise loss of CF2 units to generate other short chain PFCAs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interaction capability provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) significantly increases communication between human and machine, changing our lives gradually. However, the abundant constructions of 5G small base stations (SBSs) and large-scaled access of IoT terminal equipment (TE) will surely cause a dramatic increase in energy expense costs of a wireless communication system. In this study, we designed a bilateral random model of TE allocation and energy decisions in IoT, and proposed a mixed energy supply algorithm based on a matching game and convex optimization to minimize the energy expense cost of the wireless communication system in IoT. This study divided the problem of minimizing energy expense cost of the system into two steps. First, the random allocation problem of TEs in IoT was modeled to a matching game problem. This step is to obtain the TE matching scheme that minimizes the energy consumption of the whole system on the basis of guaranteeing the quality of service of TEs. Second, the energy decision problem of SBS was modeled into a convex optimization problem. The energy purchase scheme of SBSs with the minimum energy expense cost of the system was obtained by solving the optimal solution of the convex optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed mixed energy supply scheme can decrease the energy expense cost of the system effectively.</jats:p>"

Green stressed cucumber plants were evaluated in their recovery (SPAD index and weight variations) and to test the iron reduction capacity of the roots at pH 7.5 and 6.0 using each iron treatment as iron supply. The blood-derived product showed similar effects on decreasing iron-deficiency symptoms: SPAD increments and the weights of plants were similar. Noteworthy, the average of Fe3+ reduction capacity in roots was higher for EDTA/Fe3+, while it was similar for o,oEDDHA/Fe3+, and Fe-heme at pH 7.5. Fe-heme showed a complex behavior due to aggregation and low solubility at pH 6 and showed an unexpectedly high contribution of root exudates to iron reduction.</jats:p>"

Keeping this in mind, it is also found that the supply chain faces a lot of threats. This paper looks at various challenges a traditional supply chain faces such as Inventory theft, Information theft, Smuggling and Piracy, Trusting data to third party vendor. So, there is a high sense of need of security and monitoring for the data as well as the products. In this paper we discuss about the steps involved in implementation of Blockchain. This paper will summarize on how Blockchain, which on combining with IoT platform, will provide a real time and a secure supply chain. By doing so, the productivity, efficiency, and profitability of the supply chain can be improved.</jats:p>"

The first sexual maturity was analysed by dividing the <jats:italic>H. scabra</jats:italic> by weight with 25 g weight class intervals, resulting in 12 weight groups. The size at first sexual maturity was determined using mature <jats:italic>H. scabra</jats:italic> (Stages III, IV, and V). The first maturity of <jats:italic>H. scabra</jats:italic> was reached at a smaller size than previously reported, from 178 <jats:italic>H. scabra</jats:italic> that were observed, the first sexual maturity is achieved at 42 g gutted body weight.

In this study, the groundwater environment zones in the process of river water infiltration were divided, and the arsenic content in groundwater in the study area had a good correlation with the environment zones. In the weak oxidation environment zone and the weak reductive environment zone, as the distance from the riverbank increased, the arsenic content gradually increased. In the reduction environment zone, there was a decreasing trend in arsenic content in groundwater. The arsenic content in groundwater varied significantly with the seasons, and its dynamic characteristics were closely related to the water level. The arsenic content in groundwater decreased with the rise in groundwater level, and it responded obviously to the change of water level in the shallows. Overall, arsenic entered the groundwater from the solid phase through adsorption and desorption of exchangeable arsenic and exchangeable iron, and reductive dissolution of iron or manganese oxides bound iron in the medium during riverbank filtration.</jats:p>",

Thus, the interplay among organic matter deposition, tectonics and sediment supply is not commonly assessed. In this study, we use well logs, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content, biostratigraphy and seismic data from the SW Barents Sea to unravel the variability of organic‐rich successions and its interaction with potential reservoir rocks in areas affected by active normal faulting versus tectonically stable areas. Four Transgressive‐Regressive (T‐R) sequences were defined for the Middle to Upper Jurassic Fuglen Formation and for the organic‐rich Upper Jurassic to lowermost Cretaceous Hekkingen Formation. Three TOC trends, controlled by palaeobathymetric variations, and organic matter dilution, were identified within the two main organic‐rich sequences (sequences 2 and 3): (a) wells with the highest TOC values (&gt;10 wt %) at the base of the succession; (b) wells with the highest TOC values at the top of the succession and (c) wells with high TOC values at the base and top of the succession. Our interpretation indicates that fault activity controlled the TOC trends in two different ways: Firstly, by creating a sharp topographic contrast‐triggering hyperpycnal flows, and shallowing the footwalls, where higher oxygen content and less developed stratified waters lowered organic matter preservation. Secondly, by significantly increasing the input of clastic material, which inherently led to dilution of organic matter and resulted in lower TOC values (&lt;6 wt %). We interpret that sand deposition was controlled by the size and geomorphology of the sediment source areas. The western part of the study area (i.e. the Loppa High) was characterized by uplifted footwall islands and localized sands along their flanks, whereas the southern part (i.e. the Finnmark Platform) constituted a larger sediment source area for the Volgian age. This work has implications for a better understanding of the distribution of reservoir and source rocks in active rift basins.</jats:p>",

Understanding patterns of uptake of behaviors among the poorest under ideal experimental conditions, such as those of an efficacy trial, can help identify strategies that could be strengthened in routine programmatic conditions for more equitable uptake. WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a randomized controlled efficacy trial that provided free-of cost WASH hardware along with behavior change promotion. The current paper aimed to determine the impact of the removal of supply and demand constraints on the uptake of handwashing and sanitation behaviors across wealth and education levels.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The current analysis selected 4 indicators from the WASH Benefits trial— presence of water and soap in household handwashing stations, observed mother’s hand cleanliness, observed visible feces on latrine slab or floor and reported last child defecation in potty or toilet. A baseline assessment was conducted immediately after enrolment and endline assessment was conducted approximately 2 years later. We compared change in uptake of these indicators including wealth quintiles (Q) between intervention and control groups from baseline to endline.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For hand cleanliness, the poorest mothers improved more (Q1 difference in difference, DID: 16%) than the wealthiest mothers (Q5 DID: 7%). The poorest households had largest improvements for observed presence of water and soap in handwashing station (Q1 DID: 82%) compared to the wealthiest households (Q5 DID: 39%). Similarly, poorer household demonstrated greater reductions in visible feces on latrine slab or floor (Q1DID, -25% Q2: -34%) than the wealthiest household (Q5 DID: -1%). For reported last child defecation in potty or toilet, the poorest mothers showed greater improvement (Q1-4 DID: 50-54%) than the wealthier mothers (Q5 DID: 39%). <jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>By simultaneously addressing supply and demand-constraints among the poorest, we observed substantial overall improvements in equity. Within scaled-up programs, a separate targeted strategy that relaxes constraints for the poorest can improve the equity of a program. <jats:bold>Trial registration:</jats:bold> WASH Benefits Bangladesh: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT01590095.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SCM 4.0 is expected to lead to increased automation and transparency throughout the supply chain; thus, opportunities for operational efficiency and digital enabled business models [1], [2]. However, the SCM 4.0 impacts the decision-making towards higher complexity [3]. Technology-wise many companies have adapted SCM 4.0. This paper claims that organizational and leadership matters have not yet gone through similar transition; Actually, we can neither see any changes in the way companies organize supply chains nor in how they facilitate practice-based learning of employees and leaders. With SCM 4.0 technologies, an effective supply chain is not just a question of transforming components to finished goods. Rather, the contemporary SCM organizations need a strong transdisciplinary practice-based learning agenda to be able to deliver customer value [4], [5]. With the purpose of understanding transdisciplinary levers for practice-based learning in SCM, the study builds on two cases of implementation of SCM 4.0 technologies, exploring how the case companies have managed the transformation from a classic 2.0 to a 4.0 practice-based learning organization. The research question guiding the study is: to what extent can practise-based learning be a lever for adapting SCM 4.0?</jats:p>",

Twenty healthy porcine hearts were used in this study. The blood vessels were analyzed by light microscopy using four different staining techniques in transverse sections taken from the upper, middle, and lower segments of the anterior part of the interventricular region and the adjacent parts of the right and left ventricles containing epicardial nerves and the endocardial peripheral parts of the Purkinje fibers. In total, 317 epicardial nerves were detected. The vasa nervorum were present in 75.7% of these nerves. The vasa nervorum resembled arterioles and postcapillary and collecting venules. One hundred and forty nine epicardial nerves were perivascular, located in the adventitia of the anterior interventricular artery and vein. The remaining 168 nerves ran freely through the epicardial interstitium. The presence of the vasa nervorum was not related to topographical location or nerve diameter. Additionally, from a total of 33 analyzed ventricular complexes of Purkinje fibers small blood vessels located in their proximity were identified in only two cases. It can be concluded that the majority of the anterior epicardial nerves of porcine heart possess well‐developed vasa nervorum. In contrast, similar blood vessels are rarely present in the vicinity of the Purkinje fibers. The data obtained contribute to a better understanding of the nutrition of the cardiac nerves.</jats:p>",

A few studies have reported higher concentrations of these metals in the transboundary Langat River, Malaysia. This study determined the spatial and temporal distributions of Cd, Cr and Pb concentrations (2005–2015) in the Langat River along with assessing the status of these metals in the drinking water supply chain at the basin. Water samples were collected once in 2015 from the drinking water supply chain, i.e., from the river, treated water at plants, taps and filtration water at households. Determined mean concentrations of Cd, Cr and Pb by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in the Langat River were within the drinking water quality standard of Malaysia and the WHO, except for the Pb (9.99 ± 1.40 µg/L) concentration, which was at the maximum limit, 10 µg/L. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metals’ concentrations indicate dilution of it downstream, along with the increasing trend in rainfall and water flow, especially during the northeast monsoon. Significant correlation and regression analysis of the Cd, Cr and Pb concentrations also indicate that the sources of this metal pollution are mainly the natural weathering of minerals along with anthropogenic activities in the basin. The determined overall water quality of the Langat River is categorized Class IIA (i.e., clean), which requires conventional treatment before drinking; however, the maximum removal efficiency of these metals by the plants at the basin was about 90.17%. Therefore, the proactive leadership roles of the local authorities will be appropriate to reduce the pollution of this river as well as introducing a two-layer water filtration system at the Langat River Basin to accelerate the achievement of a sustainable drinking water supply.</jats:p>"

Desalinated water as an industrial product causes environmental problems. The objectives of this study are investigating environmental sustainability indicators related to seawater desalination via reverse osmosis (SWRO) on the coastline of Hormozgan province to provide a better insight for current and future water and energy demands related to this alternative. The selected indicators are specific energy consumption, seawater withdrawal, and brine volume in desalination, fuel consumption, carbon emission and water withdrawal in electric power generation. Using a solution-diffusion model, the direct indicator of energy consumption was obtained as used to calculate indirect indicators from the energy generation sector. Analysis of results indicates that desalination can lead to out-of-area side effects resulting from fuel type consumed and the practical power of the power plant, in addition to the regional environmental effects that are mostly affected by total dissolved solids of feed water. Based on the results, the environmental issues should be considered for the regions where desalination was planned as the most feasible alternative for water supply. This result can help policymakers to manage water supply and demand for sustainable development appropriately.</jats:p>",

A reservoir in a water supply system was suspected as the source of the outbreak because of the acute onset and geographical distribution of cases. We investigated the outbreak to confirm the source, extent of the outbreak and effect of control measures. A case was defined as a person in a household served by Water Supply System A (WSS-A) who had gastroenteritis for more than 24 h between 1 and 19 June 2019. We conducted pilot interviews, a telephone survey and an SMS-based cohort study of residents served by WSS-A. System information of WSS-A was collected. Whole genome sequencing on human and environmental isolates was performed. Among 6,108 individuals, 1,573 fulfilled the case definition. Residents served by the reservoir had a 4.6× higher risk of illness than others. <jats:italic>Campylobacter jejuni</jats:italic> isolated from cases (n = 24) and water samples (n = 4) had identical core genome MLST profiles. Contamination through cracks in the reservoir most probably occurred during heavy rainfall. Water supply systems are susceptible to contamination, particularly to certain weather conditions. This highlights the importance of water safety planning and risk-based surveillance to mitigate risks.</jats:p>",

An assured supply of biomass feedstocks is a crucial bottleneck for the bioenergy industry emanating from uncertainties in land-use changes and future prices. Analytical approaches deriving from geographical information systems (GIS)-based analysis, mathematical modeling, optimization analyses, and empirical techniques have been widely used to evaluate the potential for bioenergy feedstock. In this study, we propose a three-phase methodology integrating fuzzy logic, network optimization, and ecosystem services assessment to estimate potential bioenergy supply. The fuzzy logic analysis uses multiple spatial criteria to identify suitable biomass cultivating regions. We extract spatial information based on favorable conditions and potential constraints, such as developed urban areas and croplands. Further, the network analysis uses the road network and existing biorefineries to evaluate feedstock production locations. Our analysis extends previous studies by incorporating biodiversity and ecologically sensitive areas into the analysis, as well as incorporating ecosystem service benefits as an additional driver for adoption, ensuring that biomass cultivation will minimize the negative consequences of large-scale land-use change. We apply the concept of assessing the potential for switchgrass-based bioenergy in Missouri to the proposed methodology.</jats:p>"

There is however limited empirical evidence of the magnitude of these effects for montane catchments in East Africa. We collected a unique 4‐year high‐frequency data set and assessed seasonal sediment variation, water pathways, and sediment response to hydrology in three catchments under contrasting land use in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. Annual suspended sediment yield was significantly higher in a smallholder agriculture‐dominated catchment (131.5 ± 90.6 t km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) than in a tea‐tree plantation catchment (42.0 ± 21.0 t km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and a natural forest catchment (21.5 ± 11.1 t km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). Transfer function models showed that in the natural forest and the tea‐tree plantations subsurface flow pathways delivered water to the stream, while in the smallholder agriculture shallow subsurface and surface runoff were dominant. There was a delayed sediment response to rainfall for the smallholder agriculture and the tea‐tree plantations. A slow depletion in sediment supply suggests that the wider catchment area supplies sediment, especially in the catchment dominated by smallholder farming. In contrast, a fast sediment response and depletion in sediment supply in the natural forest suggests a dominance of temporarily stored and nearby sediment sources. This study shows that the vegetation cover of a forest ecosystem is very effective in conserving soil, whereas catchments with more bare soil and poor soil conservation practices generated six times more suspended sediment yield. Catchment connectivity through unpaved tracks is thought to be the main explanation for the difference in sediment yield.</jats:p>",

From local markets’ viewpoint, the goal is to maximise social welfare. Four DR levels are considered to evaluate the effect of different DR portions in the cost of the electricity purchase.

Seasonal planning of the electricity system is currently mainly adressed using climatological approach to handle variability of consumption and production. Our study addresses the need for quantitative measures of the risk of supply-demand imbalance, exploring the use of sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasts which have hitherto not been exploited for this purpose. In this study, the risk of supply-demand imbalance is defined using exclusively the wind energy production and the consumption peak at 7 pm. To forecast the risks of supply-demand imbalance at monthly to seasonal time horizons, a statistical model is developed to reconstruct the joint probability of consumption and production. It is based on a the conditional probability of production and consumption with respect to indexes obtained from a linear regression of principal components of large-scale atmospheric predictors. By integrating the joint probability of consumption and production over different areas, we define two kind of risk measures: one quantifies the probablity of deviating from the climatological means, while the other, which is the value at risk at 95% confidence level (VaR95) of the difference between consumption and production, quantifies extreme risks of imbalance. In the first case, the reconstructed risk accurately reproduces the actual risk with over 0.80 correlation in time, and a hit rate around 70–80%. In the second case, we find a mean absolute error (MAE) between the reconstructed and real extreme risk of 2.5 to 2.8 GW, a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE) of 3.8% to 4.2% of the mean actual VaR95 and a correlation of 0.69 and 0.66 for winter and fall, respectively. By applying our model to ensemble forecasts performed with a numerical weather prediction model, we show that forecasted risk measures up to 1 month horizon can outperform the climatology often used as the reference forecast (time correlation with actual risk ranging between 0.54 and 0.82). At seasonal time horizon (3 months), our forecasts seem to tend to the climatology.</jats:p>"

Macronutrient dynamics (of nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) associated with subglacial discharge plumes in front of marine‐terminating glaciers are widely cited as important drivers of summer phytoplankton blooms in the fjords. However, the dynamics of iron (Fe), an essential micronutrient for primary production, remain largely unstudied in glacial fjords. To investigate the role of subglacial discharge plumes in Fe supply processes in glacial fjords, a comprehensive survey of Bowdoin Fjord, adjacent to the marine‐terminating Bowdoin Glacier in northwestern Greenland, was conducted. The subglacial discharge of Fe‐rich meltwater induces a buoyancy‐driven upwelling plume in front of the glacier that entrains nutrient‐rich Arctic‐ and Atlantic‐origin waters. The plume water potentially carried 4.5–8.7 × 10<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> g day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of total dissolvable Fe out of Bowdoin Fjord in summer. The concentration of dissolved Fe (dFe) in the plume water (~15.6 nmol kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was 4 times higher than that in the water in the outer part of the fjord (~3.8 nmol kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The dFe:nitrate + nitrite ratio (mmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the plume water varied between 0.58 and 3.2, several orders of magnitude higher than the phytoplankton cellular Fe:nitrate ratio estimated using the hypothetical Fe:C ratio and observed particulate organic carbon:nitrate ratio of the fjord. Hence, the plume water is replete with Fe with respect to phytoplankton demands. Subglacial discharge drives the upwelling of Fe and macronutrients toward the euphotic zone, which is vital for the generation of summer phytoplankton growth in glacial fjords.</jats:p>",

In our research, based on the study of the change in head loss of the empty tank of the filter using fresh water, we studied the effect of different filter particle sizes, filtration flow rates and backwash flow rates on the filter performance using Yellow River water, and obtained the optimal operation mode of the sand filter for the drip irrigation system. This was achieved when the filter material particle size was 1.70–2.35 mm, the filtration flow rate was 0.018 m/s, and the backwash flow rate was 0.022 m/s.

The BRI presents opportunities for cross‐border supply chain collaboration (SCC) research. Assessing the influencing factors of cross‐border SCC is beneficial for understanding and improving this evolving, globally influential international trade policy. The BRI is quite complex so that subjective assessment methods are useful but need to be improved. To address this issue, this paper initially develops a cross‐border SCC factor framework based on synergetic theory. A vague set and DEMATEL methods are integrated to form a unified model to support the assessment. A combination weighting that uses analytic hierarchy process and an entropy weighting method, that is, a data crawler for BRI‐related documents, to ensure that objective importance weights of the factors in the Belt and Road context are achieved. The results show that information sharing, profit allotment, the degree of trust, and goal congruence as common drivers of SCC are not driving factors in the Belt and Road cross‐border context. They are core issues that do not affect cross‐border SCC directly. Senior manager support and customs regulation are two important drivers of cross‐border SCC. The practitioners of cross‐border SCC should not only focus on the support from senior managers and customs regulation but also attempt to improve performance, such as information sharing and trust, to obtain more support from senior managers and policy makers to promote cross‐border SCC indirectly.</jats:p>",

In this work, the coolant is applied via the tool’s rake face during orthogonal turning of Ti-6Al-4V. The effect of a nitrogen supply pressure adjustment and a subcooler usage—proposed here for the first time for machining—is analyzed in terms of process forces, tool temperatures and wear patterns, taken dry cutting as a reference.

The results show that high-voltage electrostatic fields and magnesium ions can inhibit scale growth in circulating cooling water. When the magnesium ion concentration is 4 mmol/L, the scale inhibition effect is the best under the action of the electric field (6 kV), and its scale inhibition rate can reach 44.56%. Meanwhile, some phenomena are explained and confirmed by the results of first principle calculations. The calculated shear modulus of aragonite is greater than that of calcite. This might explain why aragonite adheres more easily to the heat exchange surface. This is in good agreement with experimental results. Calcite has better anti-scaling properties than aragonite. The crystal structure after physical water treatment is blunt, and the untreated crystal structure is sharp.</jats:p>",

The results show that the consumers’ concern for riding experience can encourage the operator to increase recycling effort and the operator increases the rents and recycling effort over time. Besides, the sharing deposit income among supply chain members only affects the wholesale price and does not change the decisions of rent and recovery effort. In other words, the deposit is used to adjust the profit distribution among members, and there is no difference for consumers and society.</jats:p>",

Incorporating sensors into packaging is promising, but it is challenging to achieve the required sampling volume while using food‐safe sensor materials. Here, by leveraging water‐based processing of silk fibroin, a platform for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in food is realized using a porous silk microneedle array; the microneedle array samples fluid from the interior of the food by capillary action, presenting the fluid to polydiacetylene‐based bioinks printed on the backside of the array. Through the colorimetric response of bioink patterns, <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> contamination in fish fillets is identified within 16 h of needle injection. This response is distinct from spoilage measured via the increase in sample pH. It is also shown that the microneedles can pierce commercial food packaging, and subsequently sample fluid and present it to the sensor, enabling the adaptation of the technology downstream in food supply chains such as in stores or at home. This study highlights that regenerated structural biopolymers can serve as safe materials for food contact and sensing with robust mechanical properties and tailored chemistry.</jats:p>",

The present study demystifies the relation of sustainability and food security and structurally identifies the sustainable drivers, and the pragmatic interventions that can critically contribute to the sustainability of food security within each stage of the FSC. A systematic review of articles from six databases was implemented. Thematic analysis was engaged to detect the sustainable drivers and interventions practised at each stage in the FSC for food security purposes. Six main themes of the drivers and interventions were derived from the analysis: food security governance involvement, input resource management, output management, information sharing, income, and technology. The result identifies the potential that quality management has on the mediating effect towards sustainable food security, through which a conceptual model for sustainable food security in the FSC was thus developed. It is deduced that mapping and categorizing the drivers and intervention of sustainable food securities could help deepen the understanding of effective and innovative practices towards food security in the FSC.</jats:p>"

These transaction rules are not perfect, market uncertainty is strong, and transaction costs remain high. Transaction rules are an important means by which the government can intervene in the market, protect farmers’ land-use and income rights, and make the market more open, equitable, and just. Using a field survey (260 questionnaires) in Nanhai District, Guangdong Province, China, we estimated the impact of the openness, equity, and justice of transaction rules on the transaction costs of the RCCL market. Tobit models were constructed, and the results showed the following: (1) The overall level of market efficiency of the RCCL in Nanhai District is low. In different regions, the highest market efficiency is in Guicheng Street and the lowest is in Xiqiao Town. However, after excluding the influence of environmental and random factors, the overall level of market efficiency decreased, while the market efficiency of Lishui and Xiqiao Town increased. (2) The influencing factors of RCCL market efficiency under the arrangement of transaction rules are mainly related to the disclosure of information in the openness dimension, income distribution and supervision in the fairness dimension, and land-price formation in the fairness dimension. Therefore, we suggest that the lower the transaction cost of an RCCL market, the more active the market will be. It is very important to improve the transaction rules of the RCCL market, reduce the transaction cost, and improve the market efficiency. The transaction rules of the RCCL market should be further improved in the three dimensions of openness, equity, and justice. Our work provides insight into the improvement of market efficiency, which contributes to the development of the RCCL markets in other areas of China and worldwide.</jats:p>"

Recently, we found that noradrenaline increased the intracellular GSH concentration in astrocytes via β<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐adrenoceptor stimulation.

MK571, which inhibits the export of GSH from astrocytes mediated by multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1, also prevented the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Oxygen supply for ischemic brain tissue during stroke is critical to neuroprotection. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) treatment is effective for stroke. However, it is not known whether RIC can improve brain tissue oxygen supply. In current study, we employed a mouse model of stroke created by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to investigate the effect of RIC on oxygen supply to the ischemic brain tissue using a hypoxyprobe system. Erythrocyte oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue oxygen exchange were assessed by measuring oxygenated hemoglobin and oxygen dissociation curve. We found that RIC significantly mitigated hypoxic signals and decreased neural cell death, thereby preserving neurological functions. The tissue oxygen exchange was markedly enhanced, along with the elevated hemoglobin P50 and right-shifted oxygen dissociation curve. Intriguingly, RIC markedly elevated 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) levels in erythrocyte, and the erythrocyte 2,3-BPG levels were highly negatively correlated with the hypoxia in the ischemic brain tissue. Further, adoptive transfusion of 2,3-BPG-rich erythrocytes prepared from RIC-treated mice significantly enhanced the oxygen supply to the ischemic tissue in MCAO mouse model. Collectively, RIC protects against ischemic stroke through improving oxygen supply to the ischemic brain tissue where the enhanced tissue oxygen delivery and exchange by RIC-induced 2,3-BPG-rich erythrocytes may play a role. </jats:p>",

This paper employs hybrid programming with system dynamics simulation to optimize such a co-digestion system from the perspective of demand-oriented biogas supply chain, thus to improve the efficiency of the biogas utilization. The optimum operational parameters of the co-digestion system are derived from the simulation model. It is demonstrated that the demand-oriented biogas supply mechanism can be effectively driven under market-oriented incentive policy. For better compensation of the external cost to assist the operations of the co-digestion supply chain, it is suggested that the substrate collection and transportation subsidy should be combined with the renewables portfolio standard to be implemented as the optimum incentives. The limitations of the study are discussed to lay the foundation for future improvements. </jats:p>",

Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are commonly regarded to be less harmful to the environment, among various reasons, due to their organizational distribution and thus the shortened physical distance between primary producers and final consumers. In this paper, we empirically test this hypothesis, by assessing and comparing the environmental impacts of short and long food supply chains. Based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, we calculate eco-efficiency indicators for nine types of food distribution chains. The analysis is performed on a sample of 428 short and long food supply chains from six European countries. Our results indicate that, on average, long food supply chains may generate less negative environmental impacts than short chains (in terms of fossil fuel energy consumption, pollution, and GHG emissions) per kg of a given product. The values of eco-efficiency indicators display a large variability across analyzed chains, and especially across different types of SFSCs. The analysis shows that the environmental impacts of the food distribution process are not only determined by the geographical distance between producer and consumer, but depend on numerous factors, including the supply chain infrastructure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the environment surrounding companies has become more challenging. It has become more difficult for many companies in the manufacturing industry to possess all the skills they need, such as production, warehousing, and retailing, so they need to outsource certain skills. In supply chains with several companies, each has an optimal strategy. Specifically, supply chains where the solution is decided through negotiations with their partners are defined as “decentralized supply chains.” In such situations, collaborative relationships are important. One possible approach is replenishment contracts between vendors and buyers under the condition that demand for each buyer is constant. In a buyer-dominated supply chain, because the vendor cannot choose solutions that lower the satisfaction of buyers, it is difficult to change the replenishment intervals. The common replenishment epochs (CRE) strategy is one of the methods used to address this issue. The vendor integrates the buyers’ replenishment timings using CRE and provides a price discount on the products to compensate for the increase in the cost to the buyers. The price discount rate is calculated based on the worst reduction rate in the costs incurred by the buyers based on the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. The optimal CRE and discount rate are decided such that the cost incurred by vendor is minimized. The increased emphasis on the worst reduction rates can potentially lead to biases in buyer satisfaction, and the price discount rate is overestimated. Then, the cost of the vendor increases. Hence, through the negotiations with less satisfied buyers, the vendor changes the CRE so that their satisfaction is improved and the price discount is lower. As a result, the vendor can reduce its cost. This study develops a model to find an improved solution after the negotiations. If satisfaction of multiple players is regarded as multi-objective, a solution of multi-player decision-making is obtained using multi-objective optimization. Linear physical programming (LPP) has been applied as a form of multi-objective optimization, and it is possible to determine the weight coefficients using the preference ranges of the objective functions. In addition, by considering the buyers’ preference levels, the constraints of the discount rates are relaxed and the vendor’s cost can be reduced. Therefore, this study develops a model based on the CRE strategy using LPP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> After-sales service on a product could be a lucrative source of profits however it is notoriously difficult to manage due to uncertain demand from consumers, and its complex organization such as either to provide warranty or maintenance contract or repair service. This paper focuses on a problem where the manufacturer sells a repairable product while an agent provides after-sales service under uncertain demand. Due to demand volatility, either manufacturer or agent or both the players are risk-averse toward their decisions. The goal of this paper is to design various after-sales service strategies where the optimal price of repair or maintenance contract for the agent whereas the optimal product price for the manufacturer are explicitly determined such that the utility of both players can be maximized. Moreover, the impacts of risk-preference and demand uncertainty are investigated on both players’ price decisions, demand level, and their utility function. Also, the impacts of the agent’s warranty service on product price as well as repair and maintenance contract price are investigated. The interaction between the manufacturer and agent is performed under non-cooperative game where the manufacturer is the leader, and the agent is the follower. The analytical results show that when both players are risk-averse, they should adjust their prices with demand uncertainty and risk-tolerance level in order to maintain the demand stability and get more utility. Further, we consider some special cases where the risk-tolerance level of the manufacturer has an impact on the risk-neutral agent’s decisions whereas the risk-tolerance level of an agent does not have any impact on the risk-neutral manufacturer’s decisions. The analysis also shows that there is a significant impact of the agent’s free-replacement renewing warranty (FRRW) on repair and maintenance price decision if both players are risk-averse. A numerical example is presented to further illustrate the results and related issues. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization of milk production includes a rational use of forages, respect for the environment and offers the best quality to consumers. Milk production based on grass and forages produces healthier milk and it is widely spread throughout the Atlantic arc to maximize milk yield per hectare. However, the mode of offering the grass can have a major influence on milk composition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of grass supply mode (grazing, zero-grazing or ensiling) on dairy cows’ performance, with particular reference to fatty acids and fat-soluble antioxidants concentration. A three by three Latin square experiment was performed with 18 dairy cows. Experimental treatments consisted of exclusive feeding with grass silage and zero-grazing, both offered ad libitum indoors, or grazing for 24 h. The results showed that grazing cows had a higher dry matter intake and greater milk yield than cows feeding on grass silage and zero-grazing, as well as higher concentrations of protein, lactose, nonfat-solids and urea in milk than housed cows. Milk fat from grazing cows had a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids than from cows feeding on grass silage and zero-grazing, with significant differences in the proportion of vaccenic and rumenic acids. The 18:1 trans-11 to 18:1 trans-10 ratio is proposed as biomarker to identify the milk produced from the management system of grazing cattle. Milk from grazing cows had a greater proportion of lutein than cows eating grass silage, with the zero-grazing system having intermediate values. In conclusion, the mode of grass supply affects fatty acid and antioxidant profiles of milk.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Industry 4.0, a network of enterprises and factories is constructed collaboratively and dynamically according to the cyber physical system (CPS) paradigm. It is necessary to build smart supply chains according to this concept. A network of component enterprises in a supply chain would be modeled as a virtual supply chain in the cyber world. From the viewpoint of Industry 4.0, virtualizing a supply chain is the foundation for constructing a CPS for a supply chain. The virtualization of a supply chain makes it easier for companies to study their integrating and expanding opportunities. By using this CPS, comprehensive and autonomous optimization of the supply chain can be achieved. This virtual supply chain can be used to simulate the planning phase with negotiation, as well as the production phase. In this paper, instead of specific mathematical modeling for each supply chain, a general configuration method of a virtual supply chain is proposed. The configuration method of a supply chain model is proposed as a virtual supply chain using enterprise e-catalogues. A virtual supply chain is constructed as a multi-agent system, which is connections of software agents that are automatically created from each selected enterprise model in the e-catalogues. Three types of component enterprise models are provided: manufacturer model, part/material supplier model, and retailer model. Modeling templates for these three types of enterprises are prepared, and each template is a nominal model in terms of enterprise’s behavior. Specific component-enterprise models are prepared by filling the appropriate template. Each component enterprise agent is implemented using the enterprise model selected from the catalogues. Manufacturer, retailer, and supplier e-catalogues, as well as an automatic construction system of a virtual supply chain, are implemented. Methods for developing templates for the manufacturer, retailer and supplier were provided, and the construction system for specific enterprise models (as e-catalogues) is implemented as a trial.</jats:p>",

Compared with the VO, the PO could effectively improve the water distribution on sloping land and minimize the risk of soil erosion. Additionally, the PO was superior in the WAU, and a rectangular arrangement could dramatically enhance the WAU at smaller sprinkler spacing, while larger acceptable sprinkler spacing was accepted in a triangular arrangement. The riser orientation and sprinkler spacing had the most significant effect on the WAU, followed by the slope and sprinkler arrangement, suggesting that the adjustment of riser orientation or sprinkler spacing was helpful in improving the WAU. However, from the aspects of investment cost and installation convenience for irrigation projects, the method of PO was recommended. Therefore, when designing the sprinkler irrigation systems on the slope, choosing PO is the simplest and most effective way to achieve good irrigation uniformity.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the export coefficient model (ECM), source strength coefficient method (SSCM), and the equivalent pollution loading method (EPLM) were integrated to evaluate NPSP in the Xiao’anxi River Basin (XRB) in 2018. The results showed that NPSP is the primary pollution type in the study area for 68.1% of the total pollution load. The primary pollutant was total nitrogen (TN), which accounted for 56.16% of the total pollution. Moreover, rural residents' living sewage accounted for 48.81% of NPSP, which was the primary pollution source. The evaluation results are consistent with field investigation, which indicates that the proposed integration method is capable of NPSP assessment in an ungauged basin. In addition, the hydrological analogy method and Q–V linear fitting were used to determine the discharge and flow velocity to calculate water environmental capacity, and compare with the prediction of NPSP in the study area in 2022. It was found that the critical rehabilitation regions are Bachuan Town, Nancheng Town, and Er'ping Town. Furthermore, the primary pollutants, TN and total phosphorus (TP), exceeded the water environmental capacity by 76.67% and 48.58%, respectively.</jats:p>",

Therefore, an irrigation water deficit index (IWDI) based on the estimation of irrigation water demand and supply is proposed. The performance of the new index was compared with the Soil Moisture Anomaly Percentage Index (SMAPI) over the upstream of the Zi River basin (UZRB). The results indicated the IWDI is highly correlated with precipitation, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration, combined with a more comprehensive moisture condition than the previous agricultural drought index. Due to the consideration of crop growth process and farmland spatial distribution, the proposed index showed a significant advantage in stressing drought conditions of agricultural concentration area and eliminating the impact of invalid soil moisture drought of non-growing seasons. Furthermore, the drought condition identified by the new index presented a good agreement with the historical drought event that occurred in 2013.7–8, which accurately reproduced the soil moisture variation and vegetation growth dynamics.</jats:p>",

Injection pressures of 200, 250, and 300 bar and pressure ratios of 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 at each of those pressures have been investigated. Tracer LIF with acetone as tracer has been applied to experimentally quantify the mixing of methane and quiescent air. In order to exploit the symmetry of the configuration, accompanying simulations have been carried out in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes framework with the k – w SST turbulence model and real-gas modelling based on the Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State has been employed to account for high-pressure corrections in thermodynamic and caloric properties. The experiments confirm the hyperbolic decay of axial fuel concentration and the Gaussian shape of traverse concentration profiles in the self-similar region of the jets, while simulation results match well with experimentally determined fuel concentration fields. It is found that scaling laws proposed in literature for steady-state jet propagation can qualitatively interpret the effect of injection variations on jet tip penetration and volume. Increasing pressure ratio at fixed injection pressure leads to the formation of slightly richer jets, with slightly smaller mass percentage in the range of air-to-fuel ratios most favorable to autoignition. By contrast, increasing pressure ratio at fixed chamber pressure leads to virtually identical Probability Distribution Functions of local air-to-fuel ratios and the same is observed when employing a fixed pressure ratio at higher pressure levels. </jats:p>",

Sixty-four rats were divided into four groups: water + 90 min of ischemia; Cr + 90 min of ischemia; water + 180 min of ischemia; and Cr + 180 min of ischemia. Donor animals received oral Cr supplementation (0.5 g/kg/day) or vehicle (water) for five days prior to LTx. The left lung was exposed to cold ischemia for 90 or 180 min, followed by reperfusion for 2 h. We evaluated the ventilatory mechanics and inflammatory responses of the graft. Cr-treated animals showed a significant decrease in exhaled nitric oxide levels and inflammatory cells in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Moreover, edema, cell proliferation and apoptosis in lung parenchyma were reduced in Cr groups. Finally, TLR-4, IL-6 and CINC-1 levels were lower in Cr-treated animals. We concluded that Cr caused a significant decrease in the majority of inflammation parameters evaluated and had a protective effect on the IRI after LTx in rats.</jats:p>"

Diversas soluciones se aproximan para garantizar el consumo de agua segura. Sin embargo, la falta de involucramiento de los usuarios y destinatarios de los proyectos de agua y/o saneamiento desde el inicio de la gestión, limitaciones o carencias de conocimiento, asimetrías de información, inexistencia o no aplicación de mecanismos de participación y ausencia de compromiso institucional local, entre otros, suelen conducir al fracaso de las tecnologías que se diseñan para suplir los requerimientos sanitarios por la no apropiación o adopción social de las mismas. En este trabajo se presentan algunos lineamientos de gestión para contribuir al abastecimiento de agua segura a pequeñas comunidades del noroeste santafesino basados en los Sistemas de Captación y Aprovechamiento del Agua de Lluvia (SCALL). Se ha implementado una metodología de trabajo que considera todas las variables y todos los actores intervinientes en la temática desde el diagnóstico hasta la puesta en práctica de las acciones estructurales y las medidas no estructurales correspondientes. Se seleccionó como caso demostrativo del plan de gestión integrado del abastecimiento de agua segura al Paraje Santa Lucía (Departamento Vera, Municipio de Vera, Provincia de Santa Fe).</jats:p>"

This paper explores the coordination mechanisms in a food supply chain, where the demand and costs are sensitive to the supply chain quality visibility that depends on an upstream supplier and a downstream retailer jointly, and the effort to improve quality visibility is increasingly expensive. After comparing the centralized and decentralized supply chain models to discover an opportunity for Pareto improvement, it is proved that a pure revenue-sharing contract fails to coordinate the supply chain, while the price discount contract with effort alignment policy or effort cost-sharing policy works. The two coordinating contracts’ boundary conditions of excluding deviated actions are presented. It is shown that the contract with effort alignment policy is cheaper but more rigid, whereas the cost-sharing one allows us to arbitrarily allocate the supply chain’s profits despite more information being collected. The models are applied to a fresh chicken supply chain in order to verify their effectiveness and robustness in reality. The impacts of several specific parameters on supply chain decisions and performances are analyzed, and the results reveal some meaningful managerial implications regarding supply chain quality visibility.</jats:p>",

This dual requirement places a particular demand on folate availability during pregnancy when both rapid cell generation and programmed differentiation of maternal, extraembryonic, and embryonic/fetal tissues are required. Accordingly, prenatal neurodevelopment is particularly susceptible to folate deficiency, which can predispose to neural tube defects, or when effective transport into the brain is impaired, cerebral folate deficiency. Consequently, adequate folate consumption, in the form of folic acid (FA) fortification and supplement use, is widely recommended and has led to a substantial increase in the amount of FA intake during pregnancy in some populations. Here, we show that either maternal folate deficiency or FA excess in mice results in disruptions in folate metabolism of the offspring, suggesting diversion of the folate cycle from methylation to DNA synthesis. Paradoxically, either intervention causes comparable neurodevelopmental changes by delaying prenatal cerebral cortical neurogenesis in favor of late-born neurons. These cytoarchitectural and biochemical alterations are accompanied by behavioral abnormalities in FA test groups compared with controls. Our findings point to overlooked potential neurodevelopmental risks associated with excessively high levels of prenatal FA intake.</jats:p>",

Water samples (n = 30) were collected to analyze the hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality of the lake. Statistical methods including correlation, principal component, cluster analysis, Gibbs ratio, and the Piper–Trilinear diagram were used to analyze parameters. The Water Quality Index revealed that the lake water is not suitable for human consumption because measured pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, color, and bicarbonate exceeded their respective thresholds on all occasions. The calculated sodium absorption ratio (13.7–14.8) and soluble sodium percentage (94.43–95.43%) showed that the lake is not appropriate for irrigation as they exceeded their respective limit of 2 and 60%. The Gibbs ratio revealed that rock–water interaction is the underlying mechanism for water evolution. The Piper–Trilinear diagram revealed that alkalies earth and weak acids dominate the water chemistry of the lake. The dominant cation is sodium (82.22%), while the dominant anion is bicarbonate (79.39%). Five monitoring stations were identified, and the water quality was influenced by diverse anthropogenic and natural sources. The findings will provide a reference for policymakers and decision-makers at Lake Bosomtwe.</jats:p>",

In particular, this paper constructs two parallel supply chains, each of which includes one manufacturer and one retailer. Moreover, the market demand is impacted by the self-price sensitivity coefficient, the cross-price sensitivity coefficient, the market share, and the demand shock. We then assumed that the retailer can forecast market demand by using different forecasting techniques (i.e., the moving average technique (MA), the exponential smoothing technique (ES), and the minimum mean square error technique (MMSE)). We constructed the quantity model of the bullwhip effect and the inventory bullwhip effect. Finally, we analyzed the impact of different forecasting techniques and market share on the inventory bullwhip effect. We analyzed the conditions under which the retailers should choose different types of forecasting techniques on the basis of the inventory bullwhip effect. The results show that the MMSE forecasting technique can reduce the lead-time demand forecast error to the largest extent, and the inventory bullwhip effect can obtain the lowest level using the MMSE method: retailer-1 can reduce the inventory bullwhip effect by using the MA technique, when the self-price sensitivity coefficient, the price autoregressive coefficient, and the probabilities associated with customers choosing retailer-1’s product are very low.</jats:p>",

Consequently, a water quality index that uses conventional measurements to assess toxic cyanobacterial hazards and guide the selection of proper treatment technologies could benefit water resource managers about water quality parameters routinely analyzed in line with environmental changes. An index model, called Icyano, showed that chlorophyll-a, cyanobacterial concentration, and total nitrogen were most important for the index. All reservoirs classified as good by Icyano used direct filtration water treatment technology. Many of the medium Icyano-classified reservoirs used a pre-treatment unit followed by a direct filtration unit. Two reservoirs that were classified as bad or very bad have been utilizing pre-treatment + direct filtration or a complete cycle technology, respectively. As the Icyano index increases, water treatment plants should switch from direct filtration to using a pre-treatment to improve finished water quality. Findings from this project suggest that the direct filtration technology initially used in water treatment plants is not capable of meeting the current water quality guidelines in reservoirs that contain adverse water quality conditions, mostly related to an increase in toxic cyanobacterial blooms. As such, based on our findings, we recommend prioritizing financial resources towards pre-treatment technology or changes to more advanced technologies when Icyano index values increase.</jats:p>",

However, largescale substitution of existing primary care doctors resulting in a net increase of only 5.7 per 100,000. Increases in both PMM and total primary care doctors were lower in priority municipalities due to lower allocation of PMM doctors and greater substitution effects. The PMM led to amenable mortality reductions of − 1.06 per 100,000 (95%CI: − 1.78 to − 0.34) annually – with greater benefits in municipalities prioritised for doctor allocation and where doctor density was low before programme implementation.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p>PMM potential health benefits were undermined due to widespread allocation of doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The bullwhip effect (BWE) and stochastic demand coexist in supply chain operation management, which leads to a lower performance. In recent years, with the development of blockchain, cloud computing, big data, and other digital technologies (DTs), many enterprises hope to use them to weaken the BWE and improve profits. This paper focuses on improving the application level of DTs in the supply chain through coordination for enhancing the performance. We consider a supply chain with one-supplier-one-retailer and coordinate it with the cost-sharing contract and revenue-cost-sharing contract (the improved contract). We find out that the retailer and supplier did not always have the willingness to use DTs to alleviate the BWE. Even if they have the intention to use DTs, their ideal application level is not the same. After coordination, both the application level of DTs and the performance of the supply chain are improved, and we find that the improved contract has a better coordination effect. Finally, we validate our model by numerical simulation.</jats:p>",
