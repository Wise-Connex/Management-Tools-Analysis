This study follows a 1999 cohort of students from 24 schools for five years. Propensity score matching methods are used with a comparison group of students who were excluded due to quotas to estimate the average and marginal impacts of the Becas program. Multilevel methods are also used to estimate the contributions of Becas program management and school characteristics in explaining variation between schools in student outcomes. The results show significant effects of the Becas program in increasing attendance, reducing grade repetition and improving students' performance. The impacts were largest for students who received the scholarship for more than one year, suggesting a dynamic incentive may have been established by linking receipt of the scholarship in subsequent years to students' academic performance in the first year of participation. The multilevel analysis suggested that efforts to strengthen institutional capacity and conditions for learning in the schools and to promote better management and communication also contributed to student performance.</jats:p>"

Hybrids with good chilling resistance at germination can be sown as early as 10 April, when the soil temperature reaches 8-10°C. There was a significant correlation between sowing date and the grain moisture content at harvest. When hybrids with good chilling resistance at germination were sown early, the grain moisture content at harvest was reduced by 5-10%. A plant density higher than the optimum reduces yield and yield stability.

A joint program among the Moroccan Federation of Food Processors (FICOPAM), the Institut Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II (IAV Hassan II), and DAI was supported by USAID to examine how to improve industry competitiveness. Field surveys and workshops with farmers, buyers, and processors in Morocco's three main caper growing regions were used to inform a national conference to arrive at a consensus action plan. The plan focuses on a shift from weight-based to grade-based buying practices. Supporting changes were identified to modify on-farm practice; equip and regulate buying floors at major markets; institute minimum traceability requirements; and establish HACCP programs for caper processors in collaboration with Moroccan export authorities. Training programs to support these changes were completed with farmers and extension personnel in 2004.</jats:p>",

Design/methodology/approach – A case study was designed to examine the links between specific efficiencies and cost savings that derived from transitions in the evolution of the integrated lean and agile supply chain. The case study focused on the company's supply chain management innovations that led to specific improvements in production processes that in turn resulted in enhanced financial outcomes. Findings – The data revealed how specific quality enhancing and lean manufacturing components evolved over a period of seven years in a two stage transition from a ‘lean’ supply chain to one that represented an integrated lean and agile paradigm based on the decoupling point approach (Christopher &amp; Towill, 2001). Research limitations/implications – A single site case study limits the generalizability of the findings. Additional research is necessary to replicate the findings in other firms/industries. Practical implications – By incorporating improvements in production processes in the supply chain, managers can determine how inefficiencies in the supply chain process can be tracked and eliminated to improve a firm's financial performance. Originality/value – Research that documents links between different managerial functions, e.g. supply chain management, improved manufacturing processes, and accounting issues (e.g. cost reduction and improved profitability), is particularly useful.</jats:p>",

At about 100 days after bloom, exposed fruit on the south side of the canopy were chosen for monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence and fruit peel samples were taken for measuring xanthophyll cycle pigments, antioxidant enzymes, and metabolites. At noon, the efficiency of excitation transfer (Fv'/Fm') of the sun-exposed peel was higher in the low N treatment than in the medium or high N treatments. Photochemical quenching coefficient did not differ between fruits in different N treatments. The Photosystem II operating efficiency was higher in the peel of low N fruit compared with medium N or high N fruit. However, maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) of fruit peel after overnight dark adaptation was similar across the N treatments. The xanthophyll cycle pool size expressed on peel area basis was larger in the high N fruit than in the low N fruit. This corresponds well with the thermal dissipation capacity, as indicated by efficiency of excitation transfer. Over 95% of the xanthophyll cycle pool in the sun-exposed side was present in the form of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin at noon regardless of N treatments. Activities of superoxide dismutase and all the antioxidant enzymes and metabolites in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle were higher in the high N fruit than in low N fruit. The results indicate that apple fruit with a good N status have a higher photoprotective capacity in terms of xanthophyll cycle-dependent thermal dissipation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species compared with low N fruit.</jats:p>",

In one of the water-supply areas, groundwater polluted by nitrate flows from the upper terrace of the river toward the lower terrace and the production wells. In order to protect the wells from pollution, the waterworks of Budapest has to know the hydrogeology of the area in detail. Since groundwater flow strongly depends on the type and distribution of the subsurface materials, we made 230 dc vertical electrical soundings (VES) in the lower terrace over an area of 6 [Formula: see text] to map the subsurface conditions. There is a 200–300-m-wide high-resistivity zone (200–400 ohm-m) running parallel to the river and separated from the upper terrace by a 200–500-m-wide low-resistivity zone (&lt;50 ohm-m). The low resistivity is due to silty and clayey sand, as indicated by monitoring wells. These sediments have low hydraulic conductivity; therefore, they form a hydraulic barrier against the polluted groundwater flow coming from the upper terrace. Except in the northern part of the area, they protect the lower terrace. In the northern part of the area, the lower terrace is narrow, and the low hydraulic conductivity zone is not well developed. Therefore, the polluted groundwater can seep through the lower terrace and reach the production wells. One-dimensional vertical electrical soundings can still be successfully used to map the shallow subsurface resistivity conditions over a large area. The results of the soundings greatly contribute to the understanding of the hydrogeology of the area. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The business of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has very quickly become a topical and important energy concern. While the liquefication process has been developed and refined for a number of decades and importation of LNG is an accepted practice in the Middle East, Japan, Korea and parts of Europe, it is a relatively new source of supply in North America. However, increased North American demand for natural gas, coupled with diminishing production from accessible basins in Western Canada and the reduced costs and efficiencies of ships, liquefaction plants and storage terminals, have rendered LNG a viable and price competitive supply alternative.\n\nThe LNG industry provides unique challenges to producers, regulators, consumers and stakeholders. Producers must not only negotiate development, joint venture and sale and purchase agreements, but also arrange for shipping and transportation and terminal services agreements. In North America, while regulators have divided jurisdiction over LNG terminal facilities on the basis of the location of the facility, the stage of production and the degree of integration with related infrastructure, they also appear to be encouraging further development by facilitating regulatory approval.\n\nAs the Fairwinds and Qatar Petroleum projects demonstrate, the evolution of the LNG industry is dependent upon a delicate collaboration of governments, regulators, producers, financiers, consumers and stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Specifically, this paper addresses the question of whether heroin purity levels in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) could be predicted by heroin seizures at the national level by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in the preceding year.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design </jats:bold> We considered two forms of evidence. First, a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) change‐point model was used to discover (a) if there was a substantial increase in heroin seizures by the AFP, (b) when the increase began and (c) whether it occurred after increased funding to the Australian Federal Police for the purpose of drug law enforcement. Second, standard time‐series methods were used to ascertain whether fluctuations in heroin seizure weights or the frequency of large‐scale seizures after the aforementioned changes in seizure levels predicted fluctuations in heroin purity levels in the ACT after autocorrelation had been removed from the purity series.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings </jats:bold> A Bayesian MCMC change‐point model supported the hypothesis that heroin seizures rapidly increased about a year before the estimated decline in heroin purity and after the increased funding of AFP. The autoregression models suggested that 10–20% of the variance in the residuals of the heroin purity series was predicted by appropriately lagged residuals of the seizure‐number and log‐weight series, after autocorrelation had been removed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that large‐scale heroin seizures by the AFP reduce street‐level heroin supply a year or so later, although the short‐term dynamics suggest an ‘opponent’ response to residual fluctuations in seizures. To our knowledge, this is first time a connection has been identified between large‐scale heroin seizures and street‐level supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soybean [<jats:italic>Glycine max</jats:italic> (L.) Merr.] seeds have sufficiently high oxalate concentration that they are not recommended for consumption by individuals prone to formation of kidney stones. One possible precursor of oxalate is glyoxylic acid and this acid is formed in soybean seeds as a product of ureide catabolism. A nodulating soybean variety was compared with its nonnodulating isoline and the lack of nodules resulted in significant decline in ureide supply to developing seeds. However, oxalate concentrations in the seeds of the isoline were not reduced, suggesting that oxalate is not formed via glyoxylate in soybean seeds. Because oxalate and Ca concentrations are often correlated, manipulation of Ca supply to soybean plants was also studied by increasing Ca supply during pod development by 3.5‐fold relative to the level in the rooting medium. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of Ca supply on Ca concentrations in leaves, pod walls, or seeds, indicating that Ca accumulation is stable in spite of Ca supply. The Ca treatment also did not significantly alter oxalate accumulation in developing seeds. In spite of this lack of treatment effect, the correlation of oxalate and Ca concentrations within sampling times was generally significant. Oxalate concentration was 2‐ to 3‐fold higher in developing seeds than in mature seeds. It is concluded that (i) the correlation between Ca and oxalate in developing soybean seeds is probably related to unknown factors influencing oxalate accumulation and the subsequent binding of Ca by the oxalate accumulated, (ii) lowering oxalate in soybean seeds will most likely be achieved by selection of low‐oxalate genotypes, and (iii) because oxalate concentrations are higher in immature soybean seeds than in mature seeds, those prone to formation of kidney stones should be cautious about consuming immature soybeans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we analyze a decentralized supply chain consisting of a supplier and two independent retailers. In each order cycle, retailers place their orders at the supplier to minimize inventory-related expected costs at the end of their respective response times. There are two types of lead times involved. At the end of the supplier lead time, retailers are given an opportunity to readjust their initial orders (without changing the total order size), so that both retailers can improve their expected costs at the end of respective retailer lead times (the time it takes for items to be shipped from the supplier to the retailers). Because of the possibility of cooperation at the end of supplier lead time, each retailer will consider the other’s order-up-to level in making the ordering decision. Under mild conditions, we prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for the retailer order-up-to levels, and show that they can be obtained by solving a set of newsboy-like equations. We also present computational analysis that provides valuable managerial insight for design and operation of decentralized systems under the possibility of partial cooperation. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, net partitioning of dry matter and N were assessed during grain filling. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in large containers. Our hypothesis was that N deficiency reduces grain set due to low partitioning of carbon (C) and N to the grains during the lag phase and reduces grain yield also because of excessive remobilization of N from the leaves during grain filling. During the lag phase, low N supply increased partitioning of recently assimilated photosynthates towards stem and roots at the expense of partitioning towards reproductive organs. However, despite of diminished sink strength of the reproductive organs for photosynthates, sugar concentrations in the grains of N‐deficient plants were increased, indicating that kernel set and potential kernel weight were not limited by low C supply at the end of the lag phase. In contrast to C, partitioning of recently absorbed N towards the reproductive organs was increased at low N supply at the expense of partitioning towards the roots. This indicates different mechanisms for the regulation of C and N distribution within the plant. During grain filling, biomass partitioning between plant organs was more affected by genotype than by rate of N supply. Nitrogen accumulation in the grains substantially exceeded total N uptake in the plant after flowering. Excess N accumulation in the grains was covered mainly by depletion of stem N at high N supply and by depletion of leaf N at low N supply. However, high concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates in the stem at maturity indicated that grain yield of N‐deficient plants was not limited by low source strength of N‐depleted leaves.</jats:p>",

We extend a cost-based location-inventory model (Shen et al. 2003) to include a customer service element and develop practical methods for quick and meaningful evaluation of cost/service trade-offs. Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives. We use a weighting method to find all supported points on the trade-off curve. We also propose a heuristic solution approach based on genetic algorithms that can generate optimal or close-to-optimal solutions in a much shorter time compared to the weighting method. Our results suggest that significant service improvements can be achieved relative to the minimum cost solution at a relatively small incremental cost. </jats:p>",

While the beneficial impact of supply chain agility is generally acknowledged, very little research exists to date addressing how an organization can achieve supply chain agility. This study first presents a framework of an organization's supply chain process flexibilities as an important antecedent of its supply chain agility, and then establishes the key factors that determine the flexibility attributes of the three critical processes of the supply chain—procurement/sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution/logistics. Using empirical data, we develop flexibility and agility scales related to our supply chain agility model, and then test the model. Findings reveal that supply chain agility of a firm is directly and positively impacted by the degree of flexibility present in the manufacturing and procurement/sourcing processes of the supply chain; while it is indirectly impacted by the level of flexibility within its distribution/logistics process. The results also support our view that a firm's supply chain agility is impacted by the synergy among the three process flexibilities in its internal supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Depending on genotype, sugar beet can differ considerably in yield and quality characteristics. These are additionally modified by environmental conditions with drought stress recently gaining in importance, restricting growth and altering the chemical composition of the beet. The occurrence and development of these genotypic differences during the vegetation period and their possible interaction with environmental conditions were investigated. In 2002 and 2003, four sugar beet genotypes differing in yield and quality and putative different with regard to drought tolerance were tested in field trials, partly under irrigated conditions, in a total of 10 environments with consecutive harvests starting in early summer. In 2 years of stress and non‐stress conditions they exhibited significant differences for taproot and leaf dry matter and the concentration of sucrose, K, Na and <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐amino nitrogen in the taproot. These differences existed already in mid‐June and virtually did not change any more from this time on. Accordingly, interactions between genotype and harvest date did not occur. For sugar beet, genotype by environment interactions generally do not exist. Water supply, as an important single determinant of the effect of the environment, was studied separately analysing data from selected locations. Under drought conditions, withholding irrigation reduced leaf and taproot growth and root‐to‐leaf ratio, decreased the percentage of sucrose in dry matter and resulted in an accumulation of <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐amino N. Interactions between genotype and water supply did not occur for any of the parameters under study. A genotype‐specific high <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐amino N content, which might be of advantage for osmoregulation, did not improve the adaptation to drought. Differences in leaf maintenance or taproot‐to‐leaf ratio during drought also did not affect yield response. Due to the lack of interaction between genotype and harvest date as well as between genotype and irrigation it is concluded that harvest date or climatic factors of the growing region do not have to be taken into consideration when choosing a variety.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When grown at a low P supply, <jats:italic>Hakea prostrata</jats:italic> R.Br. (Proteaceae) develops dense clusters of determinate branch roots, termed ‘proteoid’ or ‘cluster’ roots and accumulates Mn in its leaves. The aim of this study was to vary the production of cluster roots and assess the relationship between Mn uptake and cluster‐root mass. We collected native soil from a location inhabited by <jats:italic>H</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>prostrata</jats:italic> and amended this with ‘high’ and ‘low’ amounts of insoluble or soluble P. After 14 months, we measured the impact of the treatments on cluster‐root development and the [P], [Mn], [Fe], [Zn] and [Cu] in young (expanding) and mature leaves. Dry mass and leaf area increased with increasing P availability in the soil, but growth decreased at the highest soluble [P], which caused symptoms of P toxicity. The [P] in young leaves (1.3–2.7 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM) exceeded that in older leaves (0.28–0.85 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM), except when plants were grown with soluble P (3.2–21 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM). Cluster‐root formation was inhibited when leaf [P] increased; [P] in young leaves, rather than that in old leaves, appeared to be the factor that determined the proportion of the root mass invested in cluster roots. Old leaves of all treatments had [Mn] from 90 to 120 µg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM, except for plants grown at high levels of soluble P, when [Mn] decreased below 30 µg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM. The [Mn] and [Zn] in old leaves and the [Cu] in young leaves were positively correlated with the fraction of roots invested in cluster roots. These findings support our hypothesis that cluster roots play a significant role in micronutrient acquisition, and also provide an explanation for Mn accumulation in leaves of <jats:italic>H</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>prostrata</jats:italic>, and presumably Proteaceae in general.</jats:p>",

These measures are impeded and undermined by tobacco corporations, whose profit drive compels them to seek to maintain and expand cigarette sales. Tobacco corporations seek to expand cigarette sales because they are for-profit business corporations and are obliged under law to maximise profits, even when this results in harm to others. It is not legally possible for a for-profit corporation to relinquish its responsibility to make profits or for it to temper this obligation with responsibilities to support health. Tobacco could be supplied through other non-profit enterprises. The elimination of profit driven behaviour from the supply of tobacco would enhance the ability of public health authorities to reduce tobacco use. Future tobacco control strategies can seek to transform the tobacco market from one occupied by for-profit corporations to one where tobacco is supplied by institutions that share a health mandate and will help to reduce smoking and smoking related disease and death.</jats:p>",

Hearts perfused with HEPES buffer at a constant flow demonstrated a negative force-frequency relation, whereas hearts perfused with red blood cell-enriched buffer exhibited a positive force-frequency relation. In contrast, HEPES buffer-perfused hearts showed a concentration-dependent increase in left ventricular systolic pressure [EC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> = 7.0 ± 1.2 nM, maximal effect (E<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) = 104 ± 2 and 84 ± 2 mmHg at 0.1 μM and baseline, respectively] in response to adenosine, whereas hearts perfused with red blood cell-enriched buffer showed no change in left ventricular pressure. The positive inotropic effect of adenosine correlated with the simultaneous reduction in heart rate ( r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.01; EC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> = 3.8 ± 1.4 nM, baseline 228 ± 21 beats/min to a minimum of 183 ± 22 beats/min at 0.1 μM) and was abolished in isolated hearts paced to suppress the adenosine-induced bradycardia. In conclusion, these results indicate that the negative force-frequency relation and the positive inotropic effect of adenosine in the isolated rat heart are related to myocardial hypoxia, rather than functional peculiarities of the rat heart. </jats:p>",

The response of human fecal microbial communities from two donors to alterations in pH (5.5 or 6.5) and peptides (0.6 or 0.1%) was studied here in anaerobic continuous cultures supplied with a mixed carbohydrate source. Final butyrate concentrations were markedly higher at pH 5.5 (0.6% peptide mean, 24.9 mM; 0.1% peptide mean, 13.8 mM) than at pH 6.5 (0.6% peptide mean, 5.3 mM; 0.1% peptide mean, 7.6 mM). At pH 5.5 and 0.6% peptide input, a high butyrate production coincided with decreasing acetate concentrations. The highest propionate concentrations (mean, 20.6 mM) occurred at pH 6.5 and 0.6% peptide input. In parallel, major bacterial groups were monitored by using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of specific 16S rRNA probes.<jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>levels increased from ca. 20 to 75% of total eubacteria after a shift from pH 5.5 to 6.5, at 0.6% peptide, coinciding with high propionate formation. Conversely, populations of the butyrate-producing<jats:italic>Roseburia</jats:italic>group were highest (11 to 19%) at pH 5.5 but fell at pH 6.5, a finding that correlates with butyrate formation. When tested in batch culture, three<jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>species grew well at pH 6.7 but poorly at pH 5.5, which is consistent with the behavior observed for the mixed community. Two<jats:italic>Roseburia</jats:italic>isolates grew equally well at pH 6.7 and 5.5. These findings suggest that a lowering of pH resulting from substrate fermentation in the colon may boost butyrate production and populations of butyrate-producing bacteria, while at the same time curtailing the growth of<jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>spp.</jats:p>",

Oxygen saturation of jejunal microvascular hemoglobin was determined by tissue reflectance spectrophotometry. Microvascular blood flow was assessed by laser-Doppler velocimetry.

Impairment of cardiac high-energy phosphate homeostasis is an important manifestation of both acute and chronic DXR cardiotoxic action. Using the Langendorff model of the perfused rat heart, we characterized the acute effects of 1-h perfusion with 2 or 20 μM DXR on two key kinases in cardiac energy metabolism, creatine kinase (CK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and related them to functional responses of the perfused heart and structural integrity of the contractile apparatus as well as drug accumulation in cardiomyocytes. DXR-induced changes in CK were dependent on the isoenzyme, with a shift in protein levels of cytosolic isoenzymes from muscle-type CK to brain-type CK, and a destabilization of octamers of the mitochondrial isoenzyme (sarcometric mitochondiral CK) accompanied by drug accumulation in mitochondria. Interestingly, DXR rapidly reduced the protein level and phosphorylation of AMPK as well as phosphorylation of its target, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. AMPK was strongly affected already at 2 μM DXR, even before substantial cardiac dysfunction occurred. Impairment of CK isoenzymes was mostly moderate but became significant at 20 μM DXR. Only at 2 μM DXR did upregulation of brain-type CK compensate for inactivation of other isoenzymes. These results suggest that an impairment of kinase systems regulating cellular energy homeostasis is involved in the development of DXR cardiotoxicity.</jats:p>",

But a recurrent difﬁculty is knowing just how much to say on a particular occasion and then judging how successful we have been in saying it. This is particularly crucial if we then proceed to treat this ‘new’ information we supply henceforth as part of our listeners’ everyday knowledge.

For some the main need may be to avoid going around in circles; such learners will need reminding that new information always accompanies repetition in mature writing. For others the need may be to prevent the text drifting; such learners will need telling that repetition usually provides the grounding for new information. In either case, materials may need developing that give the student practice in bonding back to earlier sentences. The well-tried strategy of supply-ing the learners with an incomplete text and asking them to complete it may be adaptable to this purpose; indeed, there is no reason why more than one text organizing principle at a time might not be practised in this way. All of this is rather obvious, but it is easy for second language learners to lose sight of the applicability of what they already know in their ﬁrst language when faced with the twin tasks of selecting appropriate lexis and avoiding ungram-maticality. As so often is the case with language learning, encouraging the learners to transfer a skill from their ﬁrst language is half the battle."
