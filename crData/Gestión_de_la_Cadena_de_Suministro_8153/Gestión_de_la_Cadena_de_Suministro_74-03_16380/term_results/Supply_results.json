      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes a scheme whereby surplus power during reduced demand periods is used to liquefy air which can be stored and used later to supply peak power with considerably reduced fuel requirements. All the component processes of the system are established techniques, are very largely automatic in operation, and the location is on-site. Such a system can be constructed and placed on-line in a minimum of time and with greatly reduced pollution control requirements. It is capable of considerable flexibility in the use of the liquefied product as air or as the separated constituents as O2 and N2, and thus furnishes a number of ways of optimum utilization as operating conditions and economic circumstances change.</jats:p>",

Large branches of two types emerged from the extramural arteries and traversed the myocardial wall, terminating in the subendocardial zone. The largest vessels supplied the papillary muscles and trabeculae carneae. The terminals of these branches formed the subendocardial anastomotic network. No other anastomoses were observed in the ventricular walls. The capillaries had a course parallel to the muscle fibers and anastomosed freely. Most of the interventricular septum was supplied by branches from both the left and the right descending arteries. Only a minor part of the septum was supplied by the anterior and posterior septal arteries.</jats:p><jats:p>The ventricular vascular pattern of the pig was found to be very similar to that of the human heart. It was concluded that the pig, in contrast to the dog, has ideal attributes for comparative cardiovascular research in man.</jats:p>",
