Based on a survey of 126 chief purchasing officers, internal purchasing outperforms third parties when strategic buys are involved. For nonstrategic purchases, performance is about equal for internal and third party purchasers, except where tight systems connections or strategic input are critical. Accompanying case studies support these conclusions and illustrate the approaches used by leading firms to position internal purchasing for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Findings reveal that in food supply chains both postponement and outsourcing are applied to a lesser extent than in other industries. Reasons, which refer to the industry‐specific characteristics, are given. Ways for food companies to assure competitiveness are then described on the dimensions of postponement, outsourcing and spatial reconfiguration. A framework is developed to position chains in terms of degree of outsourcing, level of postponement and spatial configuration. The framework can help managers diagnosing and repositioning their organizations, along the dimensions mentioned.</jats:p>",

A useful approach to ensure the reliability of a manufacturer's supply stream is to follow a multiple sourcing policy. Mathematical programming techniques lend themselves nicely by providing optimal solutions to several instances of the problem. However, a recent review of supply selection methods (Weber et al. 1991) identified very few articles that have proposed mathematical programming techniques to analyze supplier selection decisions. Given the economic importance and inherent complexity associated with the supplier selection problem, this article proposes a mixed integer programming approach to solve the supplier selection program. The modelSUPPSEL (Supplier Selection) simultaneously decides the set of suppliers and order quantity allocations among them.</jats:p>",

Even though the learning curve literature has largely ignored the effects of purchasing, over 80 percent of the total cost reduction in this study was the result of raw material cost savings. The purpose of this article is to highlight the important role played by purchasing in the study of the learning curve. This study was conducted when the author was a business manager in the subject company which allowed for complete access to data, personnel, and company documents. This “insider's position” was a critical factor in uncovering the sources of cost reduction in this business unit. Cost data for 221 products produced by this business unit were evaluated using the learning curve. Cross‐sectional differences in learning rates were analyzed to determine the sources of cost reduction. Cost reduction efforts had the most success when the business unit was able to identify and prioritize the cost reduction opportunities and then apply the proper type and level of resources.</jats:p>",

Much less attention has been paid to the institutional mechanisms that mediate between the external supply and the host-country demand for skilled labour, even though these play a vital role in the selection of such migrants. Australia has maintained a selective, highly regulated permanent skilled migration program for much of its contemporary history. This program contains both general and specific skilled entry. The former is not linked to any particular needs of individual firms or industries. Rather, in seeking some balance between supply and demand, entry is on the basis of general criteria such as the possession of a qualification recognised in Australia and English-language proficiency. Short-term imbalances between the supply of general skills and occupational demand have led to changes in entry criteria in response to labour market information and pressure from professional associations and trade unions. Specific skilled migration is closely tied to employer nominations. They cannot proceed unless certain institutional processes are met. The firm concerned must demonstrate that the required human capital cannot be found in Australia, that the position is in fact a highly skilled one, and that the firm has a training strategy for Australians.</jats:p>",

In contrast to many European countries the disinfectant residuals typically maintained in the distribution system are relatively high. The primary factors that are driving high disinfectant residuals include regulation, and using chlorine as a primary disinfectant rather than other advanced treatment systems. Lower disinfectant residuals are likely in the future with changes in regulations, installation of advanced treatment processes, and improvements in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

The aim was to discover latest library practice regarding charging and other related issues for interlibrary loans in UK university libraries. Of the 325 questionnaires sent, 170 (52 per cent) responded and of those, 120 libraries (70 per cent) provided an ILL service. A total of 117 libraries from 120 gave details on their ILL charging policy, with 76 libraries from the 117 (65 per cent) charging and a small number regulating ILLs on a quota system. Only a handful of libraries which currently do not charge have plans to or are considering doing so in the near future. The most popular charges made to groups of users were £1 per request to students and staff and £7‐£10 to externals. Where a flat rate per request was in operation, the most common charges were £5, £1 and £2, respectively. The use of electronic sources is playing an increasingly important role in document delivery, with bibliographical databases encouraging demand for requests, full‐text databases (especially in particular subject areas such as business information) allowing access to articles from journal titles to which the library does not subscribe and the use of electronic documents also for items not held locally.</jats:p>",

They respond to current shortages by increased purchasing. After the pipeline delay passes, masses of inventory pour in. Then those purchasing inventory typically shut off further spending, to no further short‐term avail. Eventually the pipeline clears and the inventory excess turns into a shortage, at which time the cycle repeats. The correction is fairly simple: include the pipeline inventory in the calculation. Gaining that visibility is key to establishing a financial control system which responds stably to changes.</jats:p>",

Historically, the wide diversity in water resource availability and supply infrastructure across the Continent, as well as disinfection philosophy, have all influenced disinfection practice. However, in the future new EU regulatory standards for disinfection by¬products and customer pressure for improved water taste, will also have a growing impact. The paper reviews the fundamental principles of disinfection, both at source and in the distribution network, and highlights the critical issue of balancing microbial risk against achievement of low disinfection by-product levels and acceptable tastes for customers, New technology is facilitating moves towards low or even zero disinfectant residuals, However, whilst the goal of zero network residuals and high standards of microbiological safety has already been achieved in some parts of Europe, in many supply systems this will only be possible at significant cost.</jats:p>",

Data envelopment analysis and a stochastic production frontier model are applied to measure x‐inefficiency in the electricity industry. The potential increase in total factor productivity resulting from microeconomic reform is introduced into the CGE model as a factor‐augmenting technological change. The model is used to measure the macroeconomic effects of microeconomic reform of the electricity industry. The Monash model is also used to replicate the results of earlier studies by the Industry Commission (1995) and Quiggin (1997) and thereby to provide a basis for comparing the three sets of results. The results of the current study imply that the impact of microeconomic reform on economic growth could well be significant if only a small proportion of the benefits were to be reflected in terms of an increase in aggregate employment.</jats:p>",

The ‘general equilibrium’ demand and supply curves produced by Walras and extended by Launhardt have subsequently been almost entirely ‘lost’ in the literature, despite their central role in the analysis of exchange. They have been independently rediscovered several times, but the approach has not been systematically developed. The derivation of Walras’s curves is examined in this paper. It is suggested that the approach is potentially very useful, particularly in view of the increased use of non‐linear methods in economics.</jats:p>",

In the implosive industries a wide range of end products are manufactured from a limited number of standard materials. The problem of producing a product range with high customer service is studied within the framework of product range, capacity and customer acceptable lead time. In the existing just‐in‐time literature, strong emphasis is put on set‐up and through‐put time reduction for achieving high product availability with low cost. However, the decision regarding the product range and its implications on production control is not adequately considered. It is proposed that the relevant time scope to consider demand and capacity is the product range cycle. Three cases from the food and paper industry are studied. The cases indicate constraints for achieving quick response capability.</jats:p>",

The content of copper and iron in water from different Swedish municipalities, before and after water treatment, was calculated using equilibrium models. The actions slightly decrease the iron corrosion in comparison with the drinking water without corrosion control, while the copper content in the water is somewhat increased.</jats:p>",

The article concludes by arguing that this is a product of four factors: the lack of experience among both purchasers and providers of long‐term partnership arrangements; the risk‐aversive nature of the Civil Service; the pressure on departments from ministers to minimise risk; and government guidelines on competitive tendering which make it difficult to enter into long‐term agreements.</jats:p>",

The court’s judgment was the conclusion of what had become a never-ending story about the struggle of Danish hemophiliacs to protect themselves from HIV and to place the responsibility for their becoming infected. It was a struggle that became publicly known as the blood scandal. This scandal had the most extensive and protracted judicial sequel in Danish political-administrative history. Although the many judicial tribunals that reviewed claims of the aggrieved found grounds for criticizing Danish blood policy and its implementation, they did not sustain the hemophiliacs’ central charge. Politicians, civil servants, and blood product manufacturers had not endangered lives by acting negligently when they had postponed the introduction of heat treatment of blood products and HIV antibody testing of blood donations. Indeed, the conclusion to be drawn from the many judicial interpretations of the Danish hemophiliac case is that despite the widespread perception in the Danish population, there was in legal terms never a “blood scandal”.</jats:p>",

In the nineteen eighties, suppliers concentrated on designing, developing, and marketing unique technologies. Thus, each supplier tended to specialize in a single technology, with some variations in size and capacity. With the present growth of the APM market, several APM suppliers have developed, either through mergers or acquisitions, a more diversified range of technologies to meet a variety of system requirements in terms of capacity, service and budget considerations. As a result of this trend, the transit industry now has a full range of technologies that are well proven and capable of meeting the different needs, special operational requirements, and budgets of its potential clients.</jats:p>",

Incentives are intensified when supply control is coupled with a price discrimination scheme that renders the supply of the agricultural product to the higher‐priced (premium) market perfectly elastic. In this case, aper‐unit levy imposed on the premium market to finance the advertising is shifted entirely to consumers, which means that the producer cost of advertising the premium product is nil. This in essence is the situation for fluid milk in Canada, Taiwan and California, which explains in part why fluid milk dominates the generic advertising scene in these regions. This article investigates these and related issues in some detail, using an earlier analysis by Goddard and McCutcheon as the point of departure.</jats:p><jats:p>La gestion de l'offre amplifie les incitations à produire par le biais de ses politiques corrollaires de commerce extérieur qui mettent le secteur intérieur à I'abri de la concurrence étrangère.

An important objective is to realize a sustainable housing estate: the design is focused on water and energy saving, and the use of sustainable building materials. An alternative water supply system, in which household water is used besides drinking water, may be an important contribution to this ambition. Household water can be used for toilet flushing, for washing clothes or for both. Amsterdam Water Supply developed five scenarios for such an alternative water supply system. Water saving and supply of two types of water are key elements in these scenarios. Based on a comprehensive selection in which public health aspects, technical feasibility, legislation, acceptance by the public, costs and environmental impact were used as criteria, the optimum scenario was chosen: a dual water system, supplying drinking water from the existing drinking water production plants, and supplying household water for toilet flushing and washing, produced from a local surface water, the IJ-lake.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The presence of nerves in human tooth pulp has been recognized for over a hundred years, and the innervation of dentine for about 40 years. These observations have been made in permanent teeth. Very few studies have reported on the innervation of the primary pulp and dentine. The purpose of this study was to describe the innervation of the primary tooth pulp–dentine complex. Ten mature primary teeth (one incisor, six canines and three molars) were used. Immediately following extraction they were divided into three sections using a diamond disc and saline coolant. They were then immersion fixed in a solution of formaldehyde and picric acid dissolved in a phosphate buffer pH 7·4). The teeth were then demineralized for 1–3 weeks in formic acid. Following complete demineralization, 30 μm sections were cut on a freezing microtome. Neural tissue was stained using a specific antibody to calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). Sections were mounted on glass slides and examined using light microscopy. No individual nerve fibres were seen in the control sections, suggesting that the method used was specific for CGRP‐containing nerve fibres. The primary teeth appeared to be well innervated. Myelinated and unmyelinated nerves were seen. There was a dense but variable subodontoblastic plexus of nerves (plexus of Raschkow) and nerve fibres were seen to leave this to travel towards the odontoblast layer. Most terminated here, but a few penetrated the odontoblast layer to enter predentine and the dentine tubules. The maximum penetration was 125 μm but most terminated within 30 μm of the dentinopulpal junction. The coronal region was more densely innervated than the root. Within the crown the cervical third was the most densely innervated region, followed by the pulp horn and the middle third. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that mature primary tooth contains a pulp which is well innervated and has many nerve endings terminating in or near the odontoblast layer, with a small number penetrating into dentine.</jats:p>",

The growth of the rat fetus was examined when the mothers were fed on diets containing 180, 90 and 60 g protein/kg. The numbers of fetuses were similar in animals fed on the 180 and 90 g protein/kg diets but the number was significantly reduced in the animals fed on the 60 g protein/kg diet. The fetuses carried by the mothers fed on the 90 g protein/kg diet were 7·5% heavier than those of mothers fed on 180 g protein/kg diet on day 19 of gestation, but by day 21 the situation was reversed and the fetuses in the protein-deficient mothers were 14% smaller. Analysis of the free amino acids in the maternal serum showed that on day 19 the diets containing 90 and 60 g protein/kg led to threonine concentrations that were reduced to 46 and 20% of those found in animals fed on the control (180 g/kg) diet. The other essential amino acids were unchanged, except for a small decrease in the branched-chain amino acids in animals fed on the 60 g protein/kg diet. Both low-protein diets significantly increased the concentrations of glutamic acid+glutamine and glycine in the maternal serum. On day 21 the maternal serum threonine levels were still reduced by about one third in the group fed on the 90 g protein/kg diet. Dietary protein content had no effect on serum threonine concentrations in non-pregnant animals. Analysis of the total free amino acids in the fetuses on day 19 showed that feeding the mother on a low-protein diet did not change amino acid concentrations apart from a decrease in threonine concentrations to 45 and 26% of the control values at 90 and 60 g protein/kg respectively. The results suggest that threonine is of particular importance to the protein-deficient mother and her fetuses. Possible mechanisms for the decrease in free threonine in both mother and fetuses and the consequences of the change in amino acid metabolism are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The performance of fifth generation offspring of a desert annual (<jats:italic>Dimorphotheca sinuata</jats:italic>DC.) were compared in the absence of UV‐B, under variable atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>and nutrient supply, after four consecutive generations of concurrent exposure of their progenitors to UV‐B at ambient (seasonal range: 2.55–8.85 kJ m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>d<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and enhanced (seasonal range: 4.70–11.41 kJ m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>d<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) levels. Offspring of progenitors grown under elevated UV‐B exhibited a diminished photosynthetic rate, a consequence of a reduced leaf density, and diminished foliar levels of carotenoids, polyphenolics and anthocyanins. Conversely, nonstructural carbohydrate and chlorophyll<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>levels were increased. Altered physiology was accompanied by reduced apical dominance and earlier flowering, features generally considered under photomorphogenic control, increased branching and inflorescence production and greater partitioning of biomass to reproductive structures, but diminished seed production. Many of these changes were magnified under nutrient limitation and intensified under atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>enriched conditions. The latter disagrees with current opinion that elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>may reduce detrimental UV‐B effects, at least over the long‐term. Observed correlations between seed production and polyphenolic, especially anthocyanin, levels in offspring, and indications of diminished lignification (thinner leaves, less robust stems and fewer lignified seeds set) all pointed to the involvement of the phenylpropanoid pathway in seed formation and plant structural development and its disruption during long‐term UV‐B exposure. Comparisons with earlier generations revealed trends with cumulative generations of enhanced UV‐B exposure of increasing chlorophyll b and nonstructural carbohydrates, decreasing polyphenolics and biomass allocation to vegetative structures, and diminishing seed production despite increasing biomass allocation to reproductive structures. Notwithstanding some physiological compensation (increased chlorophyll b), the accumulation and persistence of these ostensibly inherited changes in physiological and reproductive performance suggest a greater impact of elevated UV‐B on vegetation, primary production and regeneration over the long‐term than presently envisaged.</jats:p>",

Hogan, and P. D. Wagner. J. Appl. Physiol. 75: 2586–2593, 1993), respectively. Although this is evidence of muscle O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply dependence in itself, it raises the following question: With such high O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery in KE, are the quadriceps still O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply dependent at maximal exercise? To answer this question, seven trained subjects performed maximum KE exercise in hypoxia [0.12 inspired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fraction ([Formula: see text])], normoxia (0.21 [Formula: see text]), and hyperoxia (1.0 [Formula: see text]) in a balanced order. The protocol (after warm-up) was a square wave to a previously determined maximum work rate followed by incremental stages to ensure that a true maximum was achieved under each condition. Direct measures of arterial and venous blood O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration in combination with a thermodilution blood flow technique allowed the determination of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery and muscleV˙o <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Maximal O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery increased with inspired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>: 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.6 ± 0.2, and 1.9 ± 0.2 l/min at 0.12, 0.21, and 1.0 [Formula: see text], respectively ( P &lt; 0.05). Maximal work rate was affected by variations in inspired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (−25 and +14% at 0.12 and 1.0 [Formula: see text], respectively, compared with normoxia, P &lt; 0.05) as was maximal V˙o <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(V˙o <jats:sub>2 max</jats:sub>): 1.04 ± 0.13, 1.24 ± 0.16, and 1.45 ± 0.19 l/min at 0.12, 0.21, and 1.0[Formula: see text], respectively ( P &lt; 0.05). Calculated mean capillary [Formula: see text] also varied with[Formula: see text] (28.3 ± 1.0, 34.8 ± 2.0, and 40.7 ± 1.9 Torr at 0.12, 0.21, and 1.0 [Formula: see text], respectively, P &lt; 0.05) and was proportionally related to changes inV˙o <jats:sub>2 max</jats:sub>, supporting our previous finding that a decrease in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply will proportionately decrease muscleV˙o <jats:sub>2 max</jats:sub>. As even in the isolated quadriceps (where normoxic O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery is the highest recorded in humans) an increase in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply by hyperoxia allows the achievement of a greater V˙o <jats:sub>2 max</jats:sub>, we conclude that, in normoxic conditions of isolated KE exercise, KEV˙o <jats:sub>2 max</jats:sub> in trained subjects is not limited by mitochondrial metabolic rate but, rather, by O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply. </jats:p>",
