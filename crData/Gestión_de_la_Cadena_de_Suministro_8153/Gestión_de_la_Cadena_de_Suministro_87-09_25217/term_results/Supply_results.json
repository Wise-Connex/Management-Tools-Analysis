The stated rational for conservative supply-side policy is to overcome the current prolonged stagnation of the U.S. economy by increasing productivity and output by providing incentives for \"productive\" investment and increases in labor supply. This paper presents a reconstruction of a Marxist theory of the current crisis, followed by a review of the supply-side economists' literature. The last section examines the potential impact of conservative policy on the current crisis brought on by a falling rate of profit and a rise in unproductive economic activity. It ultimately suggests an answer to the question: is conservative economic policy rational for capital? </jats:p>",

A firm cannot adapt rapidly its output to higher demand unless it has decided fairly in advance to expand its productive capacity. Macro elasticity depends thus on the existence of ex ante excess capacity, built on the basis of expectations.</jats:p><jats:p>The post‐war boom is thus explained in terms of a virtuous sequence expectations‐decisions‐events. This approach helps in understanding the inversion of the expansionary phase to one of stag‐flation, the failure of Keynesian policies and the subsequent industrial restructuring which gave rise to the present employment squeeze.</jats:p><jats:p>Flexibility is something which depends on the relationships between individual expectations and decisions and their systemic results; the presently pursued micro‐flexibility is at high risk of producing increasing macro‐rigidity.</jats:p>",

Fifteen studies of intervention programmes, one by the present authors, are discussed. Since non-intervention studies of water supply are difficult to assess, a valid study design must include an intervention programme, even though such studies are more costly and time-consuming. Detailed descriptions of programmes, study plans, and analytical methods are often lacking, and different studies reach greatly diverging conclusions. It may be proposed that studies based on “weak” methodology give a more positive impression of improved public health after improvement of water supply than do before–after studies using comparison groups. </jats:p>",

Short‐run marginal‐cost pricing does not generally lead to long‐term deficit, but may involve price and surplus/deficit cycles for the case with lumpy investments and growing demand, where the price increases with demand but is reduced with capacity expansion. Taking account of the extra costs of government revenue collection and the likely average price/cost ratio in the economy, the third‐best pricing policy is likely to result in long‐term surplus, making the objectives of equity, efficiency and financial viability much more consistent with each other than is generally believed. This is particularly true for water with historically increasing costs of additional sources of supply.</jats:p>",

Specification of upstream and downstream relationships with respect to demand for skills and supply of qualifications, and differentiation of segments comparable to commercial markets from segments comparable to industrial markets, allow us to outline an analysis framework within which human resources reproduction is the outcome of an unbalanced development process.</jats:p>",
