This has consequences for the measurement of performance. Traditional measurement approaches may have to be abolished and a supply chain measurement system developed. Traditional performance measures may limit the possibilities to optimize supply chains as management does not “see” supply chain wide areas for improvement. This note raises issues critical to measuring supply chain performance. A new measurement approach should lead the way for supply chain competitiveness and should direct management attention to areas for supply chain optimization. A preliminary framework for measuring unmeasurable performance is developed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Dutch potato sector went through a process of considerable concentration during the past two decades. The number of firms decreased substantially while production levels increased. The process of restructuring was triggered by a combination of shifting consumer demands, internationalisation of markets, and concentration among food retailers. Many potato firms were unable to adjust to these developments and found themselves either for sale or bankrupt. Others engaged in mergers or strategic alliances to meet the changing demands. The resulting concentration process led to higher levels of both vertical and horizontal interdependence between the remaining firms. The rules of competition have changed: opposed to competing individually, successful potato firms achieve substantial competitive advantages through co‐operative inter‐firm arrangements that gain access to high‐quality raw materials, production capacity, and large customers. Consequently, managing inter‐firm co‐operation has become a strategic issue for firms in the potato supply chain.</jats:p>",

These studies have shifted the emphasis from operational to strategic considerations. The practice of supply chain management has also broadened to include both operational and strategic concerns. A framework was developed to evaluate both the operational and strategic effectiveness of the supply chain which was tested with ten consumer goods and automobile manufacturers. It was found that consumer goods companies had significant room to improve their logistics operations. But none had a logistics strategy to guide the change. Automotive companies, on the other hand, had more sophisticated logistics operations and had plans to improve further over the next two years. The framework described in this paper provides a useful benchmark set for focusing change projects to improve both operational and strategic capabilities of the corporate supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reactive sputtering in an Al–O2/Ar system equipped with a dc power supply in constant voltage mode was simulated using a kinetics model in this article. This work showed that reactive sputtering under reactive gas flow rate control and with a constant voltage power was much different from that with a constant current power both in time-dependent and parameter-dependent behaviors. Numerical analysis predicted the continuous, N-shaped V–I characteristics curves, which agreed with the experimental curves reported by other researchers in a system which was equipped with a dc constant current power but operated under voltage control [R. McMahon et al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. 20 376 (1982); K. Steenbeck et al., Thin Solid Films 92, 371 (1982)] and in a system with a modulated power supply [H. Ohsaki et al., Thin Solid Films 281-282, 213 (1996)]. The continuous parameter-dependent functions indicated that there is no hysteresis effect in constant voltage reactive sputtering, which is a well-known feature of dc constant current magnetron sputtering of an Al–O2/Ar system. According to the simulated kinetics curves using the same simulation parameters, the initial values of oxide coverage on the target surface had no influences on the final parameters at steady state in a constant voltage system, whereas different initial coverage may lead to different steady states (hysteresis behaviors) in a constant current system. This article showed that the films of any reactive gas contents, i.e., the M1−θ−(MOx)θ films (M=metal, MOx=compound of metal) with full range of 0⩽θ⩽1, could be produced in constant voltage reactive sputtering which is a system simpler than those under partial pressure control.</jats:p>",

The aim was to assess a gradient in nutrient supply parallel to the change in species composition. Net nitrogen mineralization was measured under field conditions and in a laboratory incubation experiment. The seasonal course of net N mineralization was determined by the increase of soil temperature in spring and changes in soil moisture during summer. In the farmland soils fertilization was also an important factor. Annual net N mineralization was highest in the moderately acid soils of the Rosenberg on the Lower Devonian schist. It was lowest in the soils of the transect near Erdorf on limestone. Two transects on dolomite took an intermediate position. At all study sites net N mineralization and the mineral nitrogen contents were higher in the peripheral zones of the calcareous grasslands than in the centre of the grasslands. In the base‐rich soils of the three transects on limestone and dolomite annual net N mineralization varied in the calcareous grasslands between 4.6 and 61 mg/kg, in the peripheral zones between 35 and 190 mg/kg and in the farmland between 117 and 350 mg/kg. In the base‐poor soils of the transect on Rosenberg it was 96 mg/kg in the calcareous grassland, 115–130 mg/kg in the boundary zone and 165 mg/kg in the meadow. It is presumed that the increase in nitrogen supply was caused by nutrient input from the adjacent farmland.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study relates the leaf CO2 assimilation and leaf dynamics of nitrogen catch crops to environmental conditions. Winter rye (Secale cereale) and fodder radish (Raphanus sativus) were grown as catch crops in an outdoor pot experiment at two rates of nitrogen supply (N2 higher than N1) in Wageningen, Netherlands, from August 1993 until April 1994. Biomass increased with increasing N supply. There was no net growth after mid-November. The number of tillers in rye and of appeared leaves in radish were higher in N2 than in N1. Leaf appearance rate increased with temperature in fodder radish and rye. Tillering in rye ceased in mid-October. Leaf lifespan was related to the temperature sum between leaf emergence and leaf death. Leaf lifespan was 478 +or- 68 degrees C day in fodder radish. In rye, the leaf lifespan gradually decreased from 592 +or- 66 to 389 +or- 25 degrees C day and from 545 (1 observation) to 401 +or- 64 degrees C day in N1 and N2, respectively. In young leaves, Amax (light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate) was approximately 1.2 mg CO2 m-2 leaf s-1 in September and 0.5 mg CO2 m-2 leaf s-1 later on, independent of species and N supply, N supply affected the organic N concentrations only in the older leaves. Amax was not dependent on temperature at measurement (range: 12-19 degrees C in September, 5-15 degrees C from November until March), but, in contrast, strongly related to temperature and irradiance during the preceding growth period. Leaf nitrate concentrations increased with N supply. Water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations were higher in N1 than in N2 and higher in rye than in fodder radish. They fluctuated during the season. It is concluded that overall growth rates were limited by process rates other than that of leaf CO2 assimilation per unit leaf area in both N1 and N2.</jats:p>"

Results indicate that growers adjust relatively fast to changes in expected prices. However, these adjustments tire rather low for some crop in the short‐and long‐run. Growers' production decisions have also shown a significant response to prices of other products competing for farm space and other production resources. These results will support efforts aimed at market development and crop enhancement programs.</jats:p>",

In the first experiment, late lactation cows received a 14·3 kg dry matter (DM) per day basal diet consisting of (g/kg DM) chopped barley straw (415), soya-bean meal (322), molassed sugar-beet pulp (197), molasses (33), urea (17) and a vitamin and mineral supplement (17) for a 21-day co-variance period. During four 16-day periods, six treatments were allocated randomly to cows, consisting of potato starch (1, 2 or 3 kg DM per day) or fat supplements (0·64, 1·27 or 1·91 kg DM per day). In the second experiment, early lactation cows received 40 kg/day (fresh weight, (FW)) of silage (307 g/kg toluene-corrected dry matter, 149 g/kg DM crude protein and 11·6 MJ/kg ME). During three 21-day periods, four treatments were evaluated consisting of supplements of either 4·1 (LI) or 8·1 (12) kg fresh weight per day of a low fat concentrate (acid hydrolysis ether extract (AHEE) 45 g/kg DM) or 3·8 (HI) or 7·5 (H2) kg fresh weight per day of a high fat concentrate (AHEE 110 g/kg DM). Both experiments showed individual cow milk allantoin concentration or excretion to be poorly correlated with urinary purine derivative excretion or calculated microbial protein supply. Use of treatment mean (TM) values dramatically improved these relationships. For pooled TM (no. = 10) values from both experiments, close relationships existed between milk allantoin excretion and concentration with milk yield (r values 0·991 and 0·883, respectively). Auto-correlation with milk yield appeared to account for milk allantoin excretion and concentration being highly correlated with urinary purine derivative excretion (r values 0·908 and 0·934, respectively) and calculated microbial protein supply (r values 0·938 and 0·945, respectively). Current experimental data indicates that measurement of milk allantoin is not a reliable indicator of microbial protein supply for individual cows.</jats:p>",

The research focuses on first‐tier suppliers to the “Big 3” automobile manufacturers in North America. Linkages among supply‐based strategies, human resource (HR) initiatives, procurement leadtime performance, and overall business performance are tested empirically. The study shows that procurement leadtime is significantly related to overall firm performance, especially market share and market share growth. The supply‐based strategy of standardization and the HR strategy of employee empowerment are shown to be key drivers of procurement leadtime performance. Also, the combined use of these strategies is shown to have a synergistic effect on procurement leadtime.</jats:p>",

Twenty-five healthy adults were infused intravenously with l-[1-13C]leucine continuously for 9 h.

This allowed protein intake to be varied against a constant postprandial insulin level so that the extent of any amino-acid-mediated responses which were additional to those exerted by insulin could be investigated.

Ambient temperature and quantitative water supply are thought to affect animal performance and well-being, but conclusive data in the literature are sparse. Therefore, effects of ambient temperature (T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>; low, about 5° medium, about 15° high, average 20-25°) and water supply (<jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic> (N), or 10 % extra supplementation in the food (E)) were investigated regarding effects on quantitative water intake and excretion, urine osmolality and solute excretion, and urinary cortisol and catecholamines as stress indicators in an experiment with twelve lactating mink with litters of three to seven kits in three consecutive periods, lasting 3, 3 and 2 d respectively. Kit ages ranged from 15 to 20 d at the end of the experiment. Water requirement for milk production (factorial calculations) and water available for evaporation (balance component) were estimated. Period, and hence mainly T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>, had a significant influence on intake of metabolizable energy, quantitative water intake and excretion, but there was less effect of water supply. The total water intake and excretion were very high in relation to the weight of the animals as an effect of lactation. Water intake and excretion, and urinary Na excretion, seemed to be less accurately regulated compared with corresponding functions in non-lactating animals. Rectal temperature increased with increasing T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>, possibly as a means of decreasing evaporative water loss. Water output in milk was estimated to increase from 118 g/d at low T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> to 134 g/d at high T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>. The amounts of water available for evaporation were estimated to be 42, 58 and 69 g/kg<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup> at low, medium and high T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>. Cortisol data did not indicate that the animals experienced negative stress. It was concluded that prolonged periods of high T<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> may be hazardous for lactating mink because of decreased intake of metabolizable energy resulting in energy deficit and excessive mobilization of body reserves simultaneously as the requirement for intake of water increases considerably.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies supply chain management in the grain industry by investigating the effects of wheat quality on marketing arrangements between wheat producers, grain handling companies and processors. Wheat quality is defined by many different characteristics, broadly categorized into physical and intrinsic quality attributes. The complexity of wheat quality places limitations on the effectiveness of industry grading schemes in assuring end‐use quality. In the U.S., wheat grading factors mostly reflect physical characteristics. Moreover, the U.S. wheat industry does little to regulate the intrinsic quality of new cultivars. Consequently, there is functional quality uncertainty in the U.S. wheat market, encouraging some individual processors to segregate wheat based on their own quality specifications. The costs and benefits of wheat segregation are illustrated with a case study of wheat procurement taken from the U.S. flour industry. Pendleton Flour Mills Inc. operates a stringent testing program to segregate wheat supplies with specific intrinsic quality attributes from the U.S. wheat market. The paper concludes that the inadequacy of the U.S. grading system in guaranteeing functional quality provides some processors with an incentive to manage the supply chain for milling wheat.</jats:p>",

The chemical composition of tissues, xylem and phloem exudates was determined and on the basis of the previously determined nitrogen flows (Peuke <jats:italic>et al., New Phytologist</jats:italic> (1998), <jats:bold>138</jats:bold>, 657–687) the flows of potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride and ABA were modelled. These data, which permit quantification of net‐uptake, transport in xylem and phloem, and utilization in shoot and root, were compared with results obtained in plants with pedospherically‐supplied nitrate or ammonium and data in the literature. Although the overall effects on the chemical composition of supplying ammonium to the leaves were not as pronounced as in pedospherically supplied plants, there were some typical responses of plants fed with ammonium (ammonium syndrome). In particular, in ammonium‐sprayed plants uptake and transport of magnesium decreased and chloride uptake was increased compared with nitrate‐sprayed plants. Furthermore, acropetal ABA transport in the xylem in ammonium‐sprayed <jats:italic>Ricinus</jats:italic> was threefold higher than in nitrate‐sprayed plants. Additionally, concentrations of anions were more or less increased in tissues, particularly in the roots, and transport fluids. The overall signal from ammonium‐sprayed leaves without a direct effect of ammonium ions on uptake and transport systems in the root is discussed.</jats:p>",

The effect of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment on total system carbon content did not diminish with time. Increased carbon accumulation occurred despite the development over time of a lower leaf area index and less carbon in the green leaf fraction at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The extra carbon accumulated at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the soil, senesced leaf and leaf litter fractions at all N levels, and in root at high‐N, while at low‐and mid‐N less carbon accumulated in the root fraction at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The rate of leaf turnover was increased under CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment, as indicated by increases in the carbon mass ratio of senesced to green leaf lamina. Microcosm evapotranspiration rates were lower at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> when water was in abundant supply, resulting in higher average soil water contents. The higher soil water contents at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> have important implications for microcosm function, and may have contributed significantly to the increased carbon accumulation at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. These results indicate that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment can increase carbon accumulation by a simple soil–plant system, and that any increase in whole system carbon accumulation may not be evident from snapshot measurements of live plant carbon.</jats:p>",

        "the dosages used to kill mosquitoes, non-target organisms are safe. Both of these products, especially Bacillus, break down quickly and should therefore present no hazard to water quality. Given that a site such as Big Bay may become a mecca for those wishing to swim, sail or even fish, a surveillance programme and some environmental modifications are necessary. The deeper open waters of this bay coupled with a vegetation-free foreshore as a buffer zone, perhaps 400 m on either side of a swimming zone, should minimize or even negate swimmer’s itch. Adjacent Hydrilla and other macrophytes will require clearing as these will also present a physical hazard to swimmers and watercraft. The monitoring programmes could ideally be done three to four weeks prior to extensive public usage to allow time for any remedial action. The prevalence of key mosquito species and of large Austropeplea (and Gyraulus and Amerianna) snails can be established quickly as can cercarial infection in the snails. If it is found necessary to establish infection rates in mosquitoes, the newly developed Ross River and Barmah Forest virus testing procedures using mosquito cell cultures and enzyme immunosorbent assay (Oliveira et al. 1995) would require six days processing time. This offers considerable economy over previous methods using intracerebral inoculation of baby suckling mice. We would suggest that prior to selected recreational events, especially those from March to May, the Water Supply Board should initiate the action shown in Figure 9.6. The information supplied in response to a request should be communicated to recreational users to ensure that they are aware of the risks. Perhaps mosquito, arbovirus, and schistosome status could be displayed in the same way as fire hazard status is commonly indicated. It would be remiss of us to generate the impression that we had all the answers to the Ross River dam. The stage 2A lake and its surrounds are undergoing a process of ecological change and realization of this must remain paramount. There are issues relating to mosquito biology and behaviour and to do with snail ecology generally that would repay further study. Thus further selective monitoring and research should not be forsaken. References"
