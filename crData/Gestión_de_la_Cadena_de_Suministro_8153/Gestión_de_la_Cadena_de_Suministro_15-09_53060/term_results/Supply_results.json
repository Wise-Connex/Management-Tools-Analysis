HLC initiatives can fail. To improve the chance of success, a thorough consideration of the potential issues involved, such as seeking supply chain partners’ support, ensuring access to information/data security and assessing whether an HLC model could bring improvements to a wide range of supply chain metrics rather than reductions in distribution costs only, needs to be understood before deciding to proceed with such an initiative.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– A two-stage methodology is deployed. As part of Stage 1, a series of 20 semi-structured interviews with senior managers from retailers, retailers’ suppliers and logistics service providers were undertaken. Subsequently, in Stage 2, a focus group with practitioners from retailers and logistics service providers was run to verify the findings gathered during Stage 1. Four elements of a new HLC project being considered are investigated by supply chain champions across the UK Fast-Moving Costumer Goods industry, namely, consideration factors, required synergies, enablers and anticipated output metrics.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– When considering whether to embark on an HLC project, the supply chain requirements need to be taken into account and potential supply chain performance benefits projected. The paper identified several consideration factors; synergies and enablers that support the development of HLC projects are identified, such as legislation, trust among partners, common suppliers and delivery bases, capable third party logistics (3PL) and an effective commercial model, including a fair sharing of benefits.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The research provides new understanding in accounting for the needs of the supply chain when considering an HLC initiative involving leading players from the retail sector.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The importance of taking a supply chain approach when evaluating the feasibility of HLC is demonstrated.

BoP projects address how companies contribute to fulfilling the needs of the poorest populations; increasingly, academics are applying theory to explain these projects. The need for integrating the BoP population into value-adding activities is widely acknowledged, but this is not yet reflected in supply chain management (SCM)-related concepts. The links to SSCM are frequently mentioned but in a scattered manner. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper presents a structured literature review of BoP papers published between 2000 and 2014 in peer-reviewed, English-speaking journals available on Web of Science. A content analysis of BoP papers is conducted based on SSCM constructs from the framework presented by Beske and Seuring (2014). </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The frequencies of SSCM constructs identified in the BoP papers indicate the prevalence of SSCM arguments in the BoP discourse. Technological integration emerges as the core SSCM practice frequently identified and is contingent with a number of other practices. Further, SSCM practices including long-term relationship development, partner development, joint development, enhanced communication, learning, stakeholder management and innovation have regularly been referred to and are considered important by respective BoP scholars. The contingency analysis shows significant correlations among various pairs of categories and allows us to point to major lines of related arguments. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper offers insights into the potential links between the SSCM and BoP research streams and sets ground for further theoretical exploration of the subject. Limitations are the uptake of one particular conceptual framework, the selection of BoP papers for the review process and the interpretation of the frequency and contingency analysis. The paper offers a foundation for developing a research stream where BoP-related issues are integrated into research on (S)SCM. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – SCM has many practical applications, which help to establish and improve supply chain design and operations. This would benefit BoP projects and should improve their practical outcomes. The relevance of technological integration seems straightforward, but needs a lot of effort to be implemented in each single project. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – BoP-related research has gained increasing attention in recent years and should help drive the global sustainable development agenda further in the respective geographic locations. Establishing capable supply chains that deliver sustainable outcomes will be at the core of such projects. This paper highlights fundamental practices for firms targeting BoP markets with an effort to alleviate poverty. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper applies SSCM theory to analyze BoP issues and thereby interlinks the two research streams.

Therefore, by providing an overview of existing publications, more focus for future studies is created, which is valuable and necessary for advancing both fields. Additionally, assessing BoP-type projects in low-income countries will allow the SSCM agenda to look beyond what is so far typically researched.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The authors interviewed managers at 49 companies in Period 1 and managers at 57 companies in Period 2. In all, 15 companies participated in both rounds of interviews.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– This study builds and describes a taxonomy of relational resistors. The authors then explore how sociological and structural resistors reinforce each other to undermine collaborative behavior. Specifically, the interplay among resistors: obscures the true sources of resistance; exacerbates a sense of vulnerability to non-collaborative behavior that reduces the willingness to invest in relational architecture; and inhibits the development of essential relational skills and organizational routines.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This research identifies and describes the behaviors and processes that impede successful supply chain alliances. By delving into the interplay among relational resistors, the research explains the detail and nuance of inter-firm rivalry and supply chain complexity. Ultimately, it is the re-enforcing nature of various resistors that make it so difficult for firms to realize relational rents.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Topics are addressed to illustrate challenges with respect to: specification of equipment (clarity and timing), defining equipment packages, vendor risk assessment, quality control within the supply chain, and identifying the right personnel and workload planning for managing equipment fabrication. Experience-based recommendations are provided in order that organizations may mitigate these challenges on future major projects. The examples provided are based on the FPSO industry, but the challenges and the recommendations equally apply to other offshore structures, including Spars, TLPs, and semi-submersible platforms.</jats:p>",

Quality management practices in supply chain contribute to quality offerings, overall firm performance, cost reduction and ultimately for competitive advantage. The paper empirically and analytically investigates the relationship between total quality management and supply chain performance. The primary data for the study were collected from 44 managers of small manufacturing firms, 74 wholesalers and 120 retailers in district Udhampur of J&amp;K State. The data after purification &amp; validation through factor analysis were subjected to multivariate tools. The results of Chisquare test, hierarchal regression model and correlation matrix revealed positive association between total quality management &amp; supply chain operational efficiency, overall supply chain performance as predictor of quality management and existence of direct relationship between TQM and supply chain performance. The study emphasized that proper implementation of TQM programs could play a major role in developing an integrated organisation through teamwork, cordial relationship, training &amp; education, cultural change and customer focus across the supply chain.</jats:p>"

At present, the telecommunication sector is liable for its energy consumption and the amount of emissions it emits in the environment. In the context of off-grid telecommunication applications, off-grid base stations (BSs) are commonly used due to their ability to provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. However, in the past, the off-grid BSs usually relied on emission-intensive power supply solutions such as diesel generators. In this review paper, various types of solutions (including, in particular, the sustainable solutions) for powering BSs are discussed. The key aspects in designing an ideal power supply solution are reviewed, and these mainly include the pre-feasibility study and the thermal management of BSs, which comprise heating and cooling of the BS shelter/cabinets and BS electronic equipment and power supply components. The sizing and optimization approaches used to design the BSs’ power supply systems as well as the operational and control strategies adopted to manage the power supply systems are also reviewed in this paper.</jats:p>"

To understand this it is necessary to accept the water supply system as a product of engineering works and water as social goods. While the engineering approach verifies the product against predefined specifications, the CAT validates the capability of that product to satisfy user expectations. In the water supply, sanitation and hygiene sector, there is a culture of verification, but validation should also be given due importance. The validation process is based on user stories and is done before handing over the project to the community. It establishes the community's supremacy over system decision-making and service delivery. The CAT approach promotes the designing of community-engineered systems.</jats:p>",

A decentralized inexpensive technology that would effectively remove algae from water would be beneficial. Electrocoagulation (EC) combined with electroflotation (EF) as a single process (ECF) is a promising algae harvesting technique with no moving parts that may be powered using a modest array of photovoltaic panels if a low power system can be developed. Here, an ECF system was constructed to study the energy required to remove algae from a simulated drinking water supply. Results from 18 ECF experiments indicated a &amp;gt;95% improvement of water clarity measured by optical density (OD750) could be achieved with as little energy as 1.25 kWh m−3. The key was to find the ideal combination of gas bubbles produced by EF (G) and coagulant from the EC relative to the concentration of suspended solids (S). The ideal gas to solids (G/S) ratio for the ECF system ranged from 0.09 to 0.17. In solutions containing chloride (Cl−) ions ECF produced chlorine gas which is known to contribute to disinfection. Results suggest that ECF can efficiently remove algae and simultaneously contribute to disinfecting contaminated drinking water supplies.</jats:p>",

Twenty‐six LHON patients were recruited for the study. LHON patients were sub‐grouped in: acute (aLHON), chronic phase (chLHON) and asymptomatic carriers (LHON carriers). All subjects had an extensive ophthalmological examination, including Enhanced depth imaging‐optical coherence tomography (EDI‐OCT). Macular choroid thickness was significantly increased in aLHON patients and this was most evident nasally and superiorly. On the contrary, choroidal thickness was significantly reduced in chLHON patients in all measurement but the 1500 nasal. In comparison, LHON carrier subjects showed a significant increase of choroidal thickness in the 1500 inferior measurement. In the present study we show that choroidal thickness follows a pattern similar to that observed in RNFL, increasing in the pre‐symptomatic and acute stages and decreasing in the chronic stage. This feature might be explained by different hypotheses including: (1) a peripapillar microangiopathy, typical of the acute stage, involving the choroidal vessels; (2) increased blood flow through a thickened choroid in response to inefficient metabolism of the retina requiring more oxygenation or a greater heat state.</jats:p>",

However, the importance of process management is explicitly indicated by the process management maturity models, through analysis of the level of process orientation, or through analysis of the level of quality of process orientation components. Starting from the fact that competition in modern conditions often takes place between supply chains, process management maturity grows into supply chain management maturity. Some of the supply chain management maturity models are SCMAT model, S(CM)2 model and SCPM3 model. In this paper the framework of another supply chain management maturity is formulated, by upgrading the SCOR model with process orientation, or SCORBPO model. This model involves analysis of the presence of supply chain management best practice, on one hand, and the presence of process orientation components, on the other hand. The aim of the research was to identify the maturity of enterprises in Serbia in applying supply chain management best practice, as well as process orientation components that are potential sources of competitive advantage or constraints for enterprises and supply chains. Analysis of justification of hypotheses is done by using correlation and regression analysis. The general conclusion is that between the presence of best practices and process orientation components there is a positive correlation, and that most of the process orientation components affect the implementation of supply chain management best practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Supply chain coordination is enabled by adequately designed contracts so that decision making by multiple actors avoids efficiency losses in the supply chain. From the literature it is known that in newsvendor-type settings with random demand and deterministic supply the activities in supply chains can be coordinated by sophisticated contracts while the simple wholesale price contract fails to achieve coordination due to the double marginalization effect. Advanced contracts are typically characterized by risk sharing mechanisms between the actors, which have the potential to coordinate the supply chain. Regarding the opposite setting with random supply and deterministic demand, literature offers a considerably smaller spectrum of solution schemes. While contract types for the well-known stochastically proportional yield have been analyzed under different settings, other yield distributions have not received much attention in the literature so far. However, practice shows that yield types strongly depend on the industry and the production process that is considered. As consequence, they can deviate very much from the specific case of a stochastically proportional yield. This paper analyzes a buyer–supplier supply chain in a random yield, deterministic demand setting with production yield of a binomial type. It is shown how under binomially distributed yields risk sharing contracts can be used to coordinate buyer’s ordering and supplier’s production decision. Both parties are exposed to risks of overproduction and under-delivery. In contrast to settings with stochastically proportional yield, however, the impact of yield uncertainty can be quite different in the binomial yield case. Under binomial yield, the output uncertainty decreases with larger production quantities while it is independent from lot sizes under stochastically proportional yield. Consequently, the results from previous contract analyses on other yield types may not hold any longer. The current analytical study reveals that, like under stochastically proportional yield, coordination is impeded by double marginalization if a simple wholesale price contract is applied. However, more sophisticated contracts which penalize or reward the supplier can change the risk distribution so that supply chain coordination is possible also under binomial yield. In this context, many contract properties from planning under stochastically proportional yield carry over. Nevertheless, numerical examples reveal that a misspecification of the yield type can considerably downgrade the extent of supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

Circulation pumps and quick-closing valves contribute to noise in water systems. Pump noise is generally untreated. Quick-closing valves m may cause water hammer, which can be treated with a water hammer arrestor (WHA). Common WHA’s functions by adding a compliant gaseous volume to the system; the gas volume is sealed from the system by a free piston. Control of both water-borne noise and water hammer may be achieved by a flow-through device integrating a compliant, voided polymer. The performance of current WHAs diminish over time as (1) mineral deposits degrade sealing effectiveness and (2) the gas permeates the seals; a voided polymer WHA will not suffer from these drawbacks. Prior work has demonstrated that a voided polymer is an effective source of compliance for noise control in oil systems at the anticipated pressure and temperature range of water systems. Furthermore, the acoustic impedance of oil is similar to water. Basic modeling and performance data for a prototype device will be presented.</jats:p>",

We identify a dominant ‘work first’ unemployment intervention narrative that ignores the nature of disadvantage and its relationship to workforce exclusion. This narrative reduces unemployment to a simple matter of labour market supply and demand, and privileges immediate economic productivity and exit from welfare payments over sustainable attachment to quality jobs. We examine fourteen programs for disadvantaged job seekers under one national provider network. Data was gathered from eleven semi-structured telephone interviews and eight evaluation reports and analysed using thematic analysis supported by NVivo. Our findings challenge the dominant narrative and stress the importance of a partnership-orientated and capacity building focus on the unemployed person, and the significance of quality employment with long term support. We identify the importance of acknowledging job seekers’ strengths, aspirations and preferences, and of job seekers having agency to determine their own pathways with support from service providers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article advances and describes a new way to strengthen the capacity of health workers in the domain of supply chain management of medicines. Although the focus on SCM in health is relatively recent, a well-functioning supply chain system embedded within the overall health system is nowadays recognized as a prerequisite for the continuous availability of quality health commodities. Availability of medicines directly improves the quality of patient care and also enhances trust in the health system, especially by those in need. Efforts to build capacity and improve skills in SCM have moved between in-service training of practising health workers towards introducing the discipline as part of pre-service university programs. The attempt to create a Community of Learning and Practice through the use of e-learning, is an approach meant to transcend the difference and shortcomings of both pre- and in-service trainings and prepare health workers for the new job expectations of today and tomorrow. Some advantages and drawbacks of e-learning are explored in more detail, and solutions suggested. A case study is described where participants who followed an introductory SCM course in a pre-service setting as well as others who enrolled in an in-service session online have all become part of an alumni course where the availability of updated content, topical discussions and exchange of experiences is continuously guaranteed. Although more research and surveys are required, it is expected that belonging to an active online community on SCM in healthcare will not only reinforce capacity and improve the availability of medicines, but lead to broader HR advantages in healthcare.</jats:p>",

User-friendly, powerful and reliable, its public domain use has spread throughout the world. However, from an energy standpoint its capacity is limited to the point at which, in certain circumstances it can supply erroneous results. This is understandable because on the one hand its main aim was to model water quality, and on the other hand, because it was conceived and developed towards the end of the last century before people started talking about the water–energy nexus. Increases in the cost of energy and the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions, however, have made energy efficiency a primary and inescapable objective. As the transport of pressurized water is a big consumer of energy, it seems convenient for EPANET users, particularly for those who applied this software to pressurized irrigation networks, to understand, as far as energy is concerned, its weaknesses and limitations which, in the end, is the aim of this paper.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that different business models became dominant in the less developed Eastern European and the developed Western European region.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the large gap between the microeconometric estimates of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (0–.5) and the values used by macroeconomists to calibrate general equilibrium models (2–4). These two ranges identify two fundamentally different notions, the micro and macro Frisch elasticity, respectively. Due to the different definitions, there are two restrictions in the micro Frisch elasticity that are relaxed in the macro Frisch elasticity. First, the micro Frisch elasticity focuses only on prime‐aged married males who are the head of their household, while the macro Frisch elasticity represents the whole population. Second, the micro Frisch elasticity only incorporates intensive margin fluctuations in hours, while the macro Frisch elasticity includes both intensive and extensive margin fluctuations. This paper finds that relaxing these two restrictions causes estimates of the Frisch elasticity to increase from 0.2 to between 2.9 and 3.1, indicating that these two restrictions can explain the gap between the microeconometric estimates and the calibration values. However, this paper demonstrates that these estimates of the macro Frisch elasticity are sensitive to the estimation procedure and also the exclusion of older individuals, implying that calibration values used for macroeconomic models should be selected carefully.

This paper expands on that view in building a new theory of vertical integration. In my model firms integrate to gain bargaining power against other suppliers in the production process. The cost of integration is a loss of flexibility in choosing the most suitable suppliers for a particular final product. I show that the firms who make the most specific investments in the production process have the greatest incentive to integrate. The theory provides novel insights into the understanding of numerous stylized facts such as the effect of financial development on the vertical structure of firms, the observed pattern from FDI to outsourcing in international trade, and the effect of technological obsolescence on organizations.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, both grid and off-grid electrification options are being used. As off-grid option, 50 Watt Solar Home Systems (SHS) is being provided to consumers in remote rural areas where grid connection is inaccessible. But the SHS of the mentioned size can hardly produce 0.3 to 0.4 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity per day, even under the best solar conditions. This electric energy is substantially lesser than the Basic Electric Energy (BEE = 50 kWh per month), being utilized in the country free of cost by grid connected low income households. In this research work, efforts have been made to determine the most economical options in South Africa’s rural areas with off-grid capacity equivalent to BEE. For analysis, off-grid/micro grid options have been compared not only with one another but also with grid connection. To incorporate renewable resources spatial variations, the work has been carried out at provincial level with the period 2014 to 2050. From analysis, it has been found that currently grid-connection is marginally better than off-grid options. But due to increasing grid connection cost and development in the off-grid technologies, the later with generation equivalent to BEE will be a more attractive option to electrify South African rural areas.</jats:p>"

Such areas have a “yield gap” between the crop yields they achieve and the crop yields that could be achieved under more intensive management. Crop yield gaps have received increased attention in recent years due to concerns over land scarcity, stagnating crop yield trends in some important agricultural areas, and large projected increases in food demand. Recent analyses of global data sets and results from field trials have improved our understanding of where yield gaps exist and their potential contribution to increasing the food supply. Achieving yield gap closure is a complex task: while agronomic approaches to closing yield gaps are generally well-known, a variety of social, political, and economic factors allow them to persist. The degree to which closing yield gaps will lead to greater food security and environmental benefits remains unclear, and will be strongly influenced by the particular strategies adopted. </jats:p>",

We use organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to develop hypotheses that identify the comprehensiveness of an organization's supply chain planning capabilities as an important mediator in the relationship between its supply chain integration activities and its operational performance. Further, our interpretation of OIPT suggests that an organization's usage of technology‐enabled supply chain management systems (SCMS) moderates these effects. Using survey data from 445 global firms, we estimate the corresponding moderated‐mediation structural model. The results indicate that usage of SCMS enables organizations to better utilize the information they gain from external integration efforts (relationships with customers and suppliers), thus improving the comprehensiveness of their supply chain planning capabilities. In contrast, the use of SCMS appears to be a partial substitute for internal integration as a driver of planning comprehensiveness. Most importantly, the results suggest that planning comprehensiveness is a significant generative means by which integration and technology investments produce superior operational performance. These findings provide a richer and more theoretically grounded explanation of relationships between supply chain integration, supply chain planning, and operational performance.</jats:p>",

The on-site water efficiency measures include reclamation of gray water and rainwater use. The water and energy saving potential of both strategies were studied, and their energy intensities were compared to centralized water and sewerage services. Furthermore, the water consumption pattern for 10 low-income households was empirically determined using smart meters; the rainwater supply was estimated by using the computer program Netuno 4.0; and the water supply and sewage reduction potential of gray water systems were determined using a theoretical method. On average, the gray water and rainwater supply capacities were equivalent to 24% and 43% of the total water consumption of households, respectively. In regard to energy savings, rainwater harvesting was the most energy intensive strategy (0.86 kWh/m³), followed by centralized systems (0.84 kWh/m³); whereas, gray water was the most energy efficient strategy (0.54 kWh/m³). The findings suggest that alternative water and sewerage services may promote energy savings in comparison with centralized ones only when a concomitant reduction in sewage production is achieved.</jats:p>",

We do so in the present research and posit that supply chain intelligence, defined as technological and competitive knowledge sourced and integrated from suppliers, customers, and competitors, plays an important role in explaining new product launch success. We further employ the knowledge‐based view to theorize that both supply chain adaptability and product innovation capability act as important mediators of the effects of supply chain intelligence on new product launch success and firm financial performance. While the former capability refers to a firm's ability to quickly adjust its supply chain to react to market and product design changes, the latter refers to the firm's proficiency in developing innovative new products. We test hypothesized relationships among these factors utilizing data collected in a survey of 229 U.S. manufacturing firms. Results point to the central role of supply chain adaptability in capturing the benefits of supplier technological intelligence for enhanced product innovation capability, new product launch success, and firm financial performance. In contrast, product innovation capability serves as the generative means by which customer and competitor intelligence is translated into more successful new product launches, which, in turn, produce superior firm financial performance. Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of factors that can explain why certain product launches are more successful than others, and offer practical insights for appropriate investments in the development of related knowledge resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Time and price of contracted construction as well as their overrun are among highly pronounced issues in the construction practice. Numerous studies indicate that there is a dependency between these parameters at various construction markets. The paper shows the results of a research conducted on a group of 40 projects related to water supply systems carried out in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2001 to 2012. Collected data, obtained through interviewing chief engineers of construction companies, have been used as input parameters for implementation of single linear regression by applying the BTC (Bromilow time-cost) algorithm. The final result is a model in the form of an exponential equation. Whereas it was obtained based on effectuated values, it can be considered appropriate for assessing and testing the construction time in the early planning stage, as well as at work contracting. Since the parameter values in the model depend on circumstances of the specific area under consideration, the application of the model is recommended primarily in the area where the research was conducted. Results of the price overrun and construction overrun interdependence have not resulted in determining the exponential model. The paper also proposes application recommendations and guidelines for further research.</jats:p>"

This method has the advantages that no information about the plant uncertainty is required and it can deal with external disturbance and noise simultaneously. The controlled RO plant is a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. The two controlled variables are product water flow and product water salinity, which are fundamental in water desalination. The result shows that the achieved controller has very good performance which can deal with up to 52% uncertainty, and eliminate 60% of disturbance and 70% of noise, while common existing controllers in RO desalination can't cover the uncertainty and disturbance or can only deal with small values of these factors. Now that the software and hardware in the RO plant are sufficiently robust, it is possible to use this powerful method for better water quality control of RO systems.</jats:p>",

Determination of the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand is important for making sustainable and wise water management strategies in this highly water deficit region. In this study, the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand as well as net crop irrigation water requirements for nine major crops during 1985–2009 were analyzed by combining the Penman-Monteith equation recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and GIS technology. The regional water stress was also evaluated based on the total irrigation water demand and river discharge at the annual and monthly scales. The results indicated that the annual irrigation water demand in this arid region showed a significant increasing trend during the past 25 years.  Total irrigation water demand increased from 14.68 × 108 m3 in 1985 to 34.15 × 108 m3 in 2009. The spatial pattern of total irrigation water demand was significantly affected by the changes in cotton growing area. Due to differences in crop planting structure, the monthly average irrigation water demands in Korla City and Yuli County amounted to the peak in July, while those in other regions reached the maximum in June. Although the annual river runoff was much larger than the irrigation water demand, there was serious water deficit during the critical water use period in May and June in some dry years. The presented study provides important information for managers and planners on sustainable use of water resources in this arid region.</jats:p>"

The nature of the engineering design decision in our research entails choice of integral versus modular design that has direct implications for the input raw material waste and ensuing competition between suppliers (i.e., incumbent and new). Whereas the integral design requires a large blank and generates excessive material scrap, the modular design reduces the generated scrap, and enhances cut‐to‐fit modularity, but incurs joining cost and yield loss. The incumbent supplier who supports the status quo choice of integral design can effectively recycle excessive material waste, as it is strategically located close to the source of material. The engineering design team at our study firm is currently exploring the option to source from alternative suppliers that can support either integral or modular designs, but have significantly lower effectiveness in recycling scrap material. We characterize the buyer's price sensitivity levels, component characteristics, supply chain configurations, and virgin and scrap specialty material prices that yield various design and sourcing policy alternatives. The buyer's optimal policy choice, the ensuing price–demand dynamics, and the resulting recycling implications demonstrate that the buyer can benefit from strategically tailoring his design decisions to affect the suppliers' material requirements and costs. We show that utilizing an alternative supply option is particularly valuable for components made from a material with a low price differential in virgin and scrap forms in supply chains wherein the new supplier base can recycle effectively. In such cases, the buyer induces severe price competition by dual sourcing the integral design, and competition may negate the seemingly obvious benefits of operational improvements (e.g., higher scrap material return rate). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes how action research can advance sustainable supply chain management research. Most sustainable supply chain management research is empirical and little attention has been paid to reflecting upon how research is conducted in the field. Current research fails to make links with ideas of relationality, change and engagement proposed in broader sustainability research. We propose to address this gap by discussing how action research could help address current challenges in sustainable supply chain management. The article explores the proponents and application of action research as a relevant methodology for knowledge development in the field, based upon a critical analysis of sustainable supply chain management and action research, including a review of previous action research studies and insights from a research project in which action research was applied. Particular emphasis is put on exploring the links between the sustainability dimension of sustainable supply chain management and the foundations and practice of action research. The article does not reject other methodological approaches, but it shows that the pragmatic orientation of action research is particularly suitable for an applied field such as sustainable supply chain management where problems are often messy, cross-disciplinary and essentially concerned with the flourishing of individuals and organizations. Our article has broader implications for inter-organizational research. </jats:p>",

Therefore, agricultural districts in the Great Plains of the US may not need to pay high subsidies to compete with those in the eastern Corn Belt to attract biofuel firms. Policy restrictions on irrigation due to concerns over groundwater depletion may, however, diminish the relative comparative advantage of the irrigated Corn Belt for biofuel production.</jats:p>",

To quantify SGD into the northern Bohai Bay, China, naturally occurring radium isotope (226Ra) was measured in water samples collected along two transects in September 2012. Based on a tidal prism model, two different flushing times of the coastal water were determined to be 9.1 d and 11.5 d with respect to the different return flow factor (b) obtained from a physical model and a mass balance model of 226Ra and salinity, respectively. Using the derived flushing time, we developed a 226Ra mass balance model to estimate the SGD into the bay, which includes mixing, sedimentary input and SGD. The 226Ra budget indicated the 226Ra input from SGD accounted for 99% of the total tracer input to the northern Bohai Bay. We arrived at an average flux from SGD of 4.83 × 107 m3/d. The large volume of SGD confirms its importance in supplying a considerable quantity of nutrients to the bay.</jats:p>",

Different laboratory-scale tests were carried out to evaluate the treatment impact on ClO2 consumption in disinfection and on the formation of disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes, adsorbable organic halogen, chlorite and chlorate). The results showed that coagulation/flocculation and activated carbon adsorption have the most significant impact on reducing disinfectant consumption. Pre-oxidation of artificial lake water with KMnO4 and NaClO determines the highest ClO2 consumption. Regardless of the water source, the amount of chlorite produced after disinfection with ClO2 is 40–60% lower using NaClO as the pre-oxidant rather than KMnO4 or ClO2. Otherwise, NaClO leads to a high formation of adsorbable organic halogens and trihalomethanes in artificial lake water (up to 60 μg/L and 20 μg/L respectively), while in the case of ClO2 oxidation, trihalomethane formation is 98% less compared to NaClO. Further, adding ferrous ion in coagulation/flocculation improves the removal of chlorite produced during pre-oxidation, with a 90% removal, mainly due to the reduction of chlorite to chloride. Finally, activated carbon adsorption after pre-oxidation and coagulation/flocculation removes adsorbable organic halogens and trihalomethanes respectively by 50–60% and 30–98%, and completes the chlorite and chlorate removal.</jats:p>",

Its two zones, which are lower A and upper B basins, mainly yield fine- and coarse-grained deposits, respectively. Trend and distribution analyses of manual and automatic measurements of groundwater levels indicated that: (1) the groundwater levels generally increased as the river water levels rose after the river was dammed; (2) the significant correlation between groundwater and river water levels could lead to reductions in the groundwater levels if the barrage gates were opened as a control measure; and (3) the lowering of high groundwater levels during dry seasons is important for preventing soil wetting in the riversides.</jats:p>",

It argues that sexual harassment is fostered both by coercive labour conditions within global value chains and by existing hierarchical gender relations. The research finds that harassment is widespread, that many lack a vocabulary to describe or discuss this, and that female casual and temporary workers are most likely to be targeted. Action research coupled with organisation of workers, however, has been effective in giving ‘voice’ to those suffering harassment: this is a first step in a feminist labour mobilisation and policy formulation. Procedures against sexual harassment are beginning to be formulated: a key concern is implementation. Addressing sexual harassment is central in ensuring the security of working people, particularly the most marginalised.</jats:p>",

Three economic scenarios namely; business as usual (BAU), low economic consumption scenario (LEC) and high economic growth scenario (HEC) were developed for modelling purposes. Moreover, the study develops a dry weather scenario to explore how the country’s electricity system would behave under dry weather conditions. The model results suggests: If projected final electricity demand increases as anticipated in BAU, LEC and HEC scenarios, the total installed capacity will expand at 9.05%, 8.46% and 9.8% respectively from the base value of 804.2MW. Correspondingly, the model results depict dominance of hydro, coal, natural gas and geothermal as least-cost energy supply options for electricity generation in all scenarios. The alternative dry weather scenario formulated to study electricity system behaviour under uncertain weather conditions suggested a shift of energy supply option to coal and natural gas (NG) dominance replacing hydro energy. The least cost optimization results further depict an insignificant contribution of renewable energy technologies in terms of solar thermal, wind and solar PV into the total generation shares. With that regard, the renewable energy penetration policy option (REPP), as an alternative scenario suggests the importance of policy options that favour renewable energy technologies inclusion in electricity generation. Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate to approximate the influence of discount rate on the future pattern of electricity generation capacity demonstrated that lower values favour wind and coal fired power plants, while higher values favour the NG technologies. Finally, the modelling results conclude the self-sufficiency of the country in generating future electricity using its own energy resources.</jats:p>"

The critical elements for determining the optimal year-end water level for multi-year regulating storage reservoirs were revealed through analysis of the impacts of runoff and year-start water level on year-end water level. Simulated operational results from the model were compared with practical operational results for the Longyangxia reservoir system from 1990–2012. A comparison shows that the operating mode for Longyangxia reservoir (after 2006) achieved significant improvement versus before 2006, in making the reservoir run at a higher water level and increasing benefits.

Magnetic poly glycidyl methacrylate resin (m-PGMA), a new type of resin, has shown better removal performance for humics than MIEX®. Removal of oxytetracycline (OTC) in water by m-PGMA, and factors influencing the removal, were examined, and in addition, the removal of OTC by MIEX and powdered activated carbon (PAC) were used as a comparison. Results showed that m-PGMA could remove more OTC than MIEX and PAC. The removal performance was greatly affected by dosage of m-PGMA, inorganic anions, organics and pH value. At a contact time of 30 min, the removal rates of OTC were 45%, 52% and 63% when the dosage was 5 ml/L, 10 ml/L and 20 ml/L, respectively. In comparison the removal rate of OTC by MIEX was 45% with a dosage of 10 mL/L and a contact time of 30 min. The removal of OTC was significantly increased when the pH value was above 7.3, as the OTC molecule exists as an anion in alkaline medium. In conclusion, m-PGMA is more effective than MIEX and PAC in the removal of OTC in water, and can be one of the choices to remove trace organics like OTC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose of the work is improved approaches to ensure the required quality parameters of voltage in the traction network based on modern technologies and equipment in the application of power distribution system. Actuality. The introduction of high-speed traffic, increase weight standards Train necessitates increasing the carrying capacity of railways. Often the carrying capacity of existing sections electrified at 3.0 kV DC power supply unit limits. Such limitations include voltage decrease on the electric current collector below the allowable value for the normal operation of 2700 (2900 for high-speed V) and heating the contact wires, thereby losing their mechanical strength. Existing power supply system of RS, which have considerable installed traction substations, can not provide the required level of power density traction network for high-speed movement within 1.5 - 2 MW / km and, respectively, the required voltage quality. At the same time, the daily loading of a powerful traction substations in providing intensive schedule of trains does not exceed 20-25%, while the energy loss in traction network peak load increases and reaches 10-15% of the energy consumed. Thus, the existing system of power traction networks is not sufficiently effective and economical, even with the application of existing methods to strengthen them. In our view, the main limiting factor for a given quality of voltage in the traction network is the use of centralized power. From this, the development of measures to improve the quality of voltage in the traction network in the implementation of high-speed traffic in a growing scarcity of energy resources is an urgent task. Scientific novelty. Using distributed power supply system with adjustable supply points combined into intelligent power supply, which enables adaptive change the characteristics of the transfer, conversion and consumption and optimize the mode of functioning of the traction power supply is suggested for improving the quality of voltage in the traction network in the implementation of high-speed and heavy traffic. Practical significance. Improving the quality of voltage in the traction network by using the proposed circuit design traction power supply will ensure the desired mode voltage and power characteristics of the traction network in the implementation of high-speed and heavy traffic while reducing electricity losses by 20-30%.\n\n</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the structural, institutional and political rigidities that affect the adoption of irrigation scheduling technologies in southern European countries and highlights the corresponding opportunities. The recent implementation of water pricing policies, as required under the European Water Framework Directive, could motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management. A review of irrigation water prices in southern Europe found a large range of prices both within and between countries, from 0.054–0.645 €/m3 (Greece) to 0.23–1.50 €/m3 (France). However, inadequate monitoring infrastructure and a lack of political will to impose the new water prices are giving a mixed signal to farmers. An ageing and poorly trained farm population, small farm size and low level of farm investment also impede the uptake of irrigation technologies. Within this context, European-funded research needs to consider these constraints and pay closer attention to the conversion of knowledge and innovation into successful commercial products.</jats:p>",

The most important contribution this paper makes is that it includes the period after the sharp rises in electricity tariffs in 2007/2008 following a period of load-shedding and insecurity in electricity supply. Previous studies have included data only until 2007 and, for the most part, have found statistically insignificant, positive elasticities. However, for the period post-2007, we found statistically significant and negative elasticities for 9 of the 11 sectors considered. Our results show that the majority of industrial sectors have become much more sensitive to changes in the price of electricity following 2007/2008, indicating to policymakers that tariff restructuring might influence consumer behaviour significantly.</jats:p>"

With a continental interconnected transmission system, a large and growing demand, and a total installed generation capacity around 137 GW, from which around70% comes fromhydropower plants withmultipleownerscoexisting in hydro cascades, this electricity market has gone through two large institutional and regulatory reforms in the last twenty years. Nevertheless, currently the conciliation between the commercial commitments of the market participants and the physical dispatch is not smooth. There is a lack of “trading opportunities” to encourage participants to comply with their contracts. Moreover, the Brazilian short-term market actsas a mechanismto settle differences rather thana true market and,neither the short-term price northe dispatch schedule is determined by the market. This paper discusses these problems, brings out some dilemmas that should be examined in order to implement a more market-oriented approach, and proposes a new market design to overcome these issues. The proposed market design is based on the concept of energy right accounts as virtual reservoirs and aims at enhancing the flexibility to enable market participants to comply with their contracts, while still ensuring the efficient use of the energy resources and maintaining the current security supply level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The bottom of the pyramid—that is, the world's four billion consumers who live on $5 or less per day—is one of the last untapped markets for multinational companies (MNCs) to drive revenue and profit growth. However, most <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MNC</jats:styled-content>s have found it difficult to make money “solving the pressing needs of low‐income communities.” We explore why the bottom of the pyramid has become a strategic focal point. We also identify and discuss fundamental differences and trade‐offs <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MNC</jats:styled-content>s encounter in meeting the demands of the world's lowest‐income consumers. Drawing on the experience of exemplar case studies, we describe how <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MNC</jats:styled-content>s can leverage resources to build the infrastructures needed to think differently about how to measure financial performance, design products differently to leverage both customization and standardization, and deliver differently to compensate for infrastructural deficiencies. Finally, given much of the product acceptance‐and‐profitability challenge falls under the purview of supply chain decision makers, we call for research in specific operational and relational domains to help companies design supply chain networks and processes for success at the bottom of the pyramid.</jats:p>",

Opiate overdose can be reversed through timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first- ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimising the risk of adverse effects. To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to: prescribe take-home naloxone to all patients; forewarn patients of potential side effects; and instruct patients in naloxone dose titration.</jats:p>"

This country pursues remarkably conservative policies. Drawing on morality issue theory, secularization theory, and the supply side theory of religion, we develop a framework that explains the political dynamics around morality issues and policies in this country. We contribute to the understanding of the various ways in which religion can enter politics by showing how and why a minimal politicization of morality issues can coincide with a strong religious wording of such issues in a context where a high level of religiosity stands out. Religious vitality came about because religion became attached to the nationalist and language struggle, which encouraged religious activity. The ample supply of religion accounts for religious vitality, which, in turn, explains why religion continues to play in morality politics.</jats:p>",

A series of Al-doped, Fe-doped, Zn-doped and co-doped TiO2 nanotubes were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. According to the characterization of ion-doped TiO2 nanotubes, Al3+ and Fe3+ ions occupied substitutional positions in the crystal lattice, and Zn2+ ions were partially dispersed in the bulk of the TiO2 nanotubes, with ZnO formed on the surface of the TiO2. The calcination temperature and doping concentration could affect the anatase phase weight fractions, average crystallite sizes, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, bandgap energy, and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts. For single ion-doped TiO2 nanotubes, the best photocatalytic activities were achieved when the ion-doping amount was 1.0%, and the optimal calcination temperatures for Al-, Fe- or Zn-doped TiO2 were 600°C, 550°C and 550°C, respectively. The highest HA removal efficiency of 80.1% was achieved in the presence of 550°C calcined, 1.0% co-doped TiO2 nanotubes with an Fe:Zn ratio of 1:1 (atomic percent), with second-order rate constant of 0.0394 L/(min·mg). The addition of a third ion had little effect on the photocatalytic activity. The pollutants in filter influent from No. 9 waterworks in Beijing could be efficiently removed, with UV254 and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies of 57.2% and 44.7%, respectively.</jats:p>",

The initial 24V<jats:sub>DC</jats:sub> voltage generated by the modules are converted and inverted to 240V<jats:sub>AC</jats:sub> to replicate national utility grid standard. However indeed most modern connected loads and electrical appliance are operable within DC voltage internally which requires no extra conversion or inversion at all. Nevertheless when the AC voltage from the grid once been connected to the system, the early PV modules seemed to be totally forgotten and abandoned. An energy conservation concept has been disrupted. A new strategy of benefitting both available DC power and AC utility grid was introduced which could be implemented to save energy and optimised the whole system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An innovative design of a gas turbine annular combustor is investigated analytically and numerically. Its principal feature is the helical arrangement of the burners around the turbine shaft. Hence, a shorter combustor with lower aerodynamic losses and cooling air demand might be realized. A generic model of the combustor is developed and analyzed by means of a parametric study. Scaling laws for the geometry of the flame tube and the burners are derived. Thereby, the relevant similarity parameters for fluid flow, combustion, and heat transfer are maintained constant. Subsequently, nonreacting and reacting flow regimes of selected design variants are numerically investigated. It is shown that a double annular (DA) configuration with a tilting angle of β = 45 deg, where circumferentially adjacent swirls are corotating and radially are counter-rotating, is the superior design in terms of (1) maintaining the relevant similarity rules, (2) size and location of the recirculation zones and swirl flames, and (3) flow pattern at the combustor exit. The deflection angle of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) as well as the axial length of such a short helical combustor (SHC) could be reduced by approximately 30%.</jats:p>",

The tribunal is also specifically empowered to make enforceable orders to reduce or remove remuneration related incentives and pressures that contribute to unsafe work practices in the road transport industry. Recently the tribunal handed down its first order. The article considers whether, and the degree to which, the tribunal has been willing to exercise its explicit power to impose enforceable obligations on consignors and consignees – such as large supermarket chains – at the apex of road transport supply chains. It examines the substance and extent of the obligations imposed by the tribunal, including whether the tribunal has exercised the full range of powers vested in it by the Act. We contend that the tribunal's first order primarily imposes obligations on direct work providers and drivers without making large, powerful consignors and consignees substantively responsible for driver pay and safety. We argue that the tribunal's first order could have more comprehensively fulfilled the objectives of the Act by more directly addressing the root causes of low pay and poor safety in the road transport industry.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a photovoltaic (PV) powered UPS using microcontroller PIC16F628A-I/P. It is a standby UPS whereas if the main power source fails to supply power to loads, a battery powered inverter turns on to continue supplying power. The battery is charged by the PV using solar charger and transfer switch controlled by the microcontroller. In this research, AC three-level waveform single phase inverter was developed and created by a microcontroller PIC16F627A-I/P with varied maximum voltage angle from 20<jats:sup>0</jats:sup> to 180<jats:sup>0</jats:sup> and tested to a load of 240 V, 20 W AC aquarium water pump, and also analyzed effect of maximum voltage angle on the three-level single phase inverter performance. The result showed that maximum voltage angles of the inverter effected on root mean square value of AC voltage, current and power. If the maximum voltage angle was increased, therefore value of the AC voltage, current and power would increase. The maximum voltage angle would effect on the current total harmonic distortion (CTHD), the lowest CTHD of 15.448% was obtained when the maximum voltage angle was 134<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>.</jats:p>"

As a result of mining, urbanization and other industrial activities, irreversible changes have taken place in the environment. In this paper, the method of collecting, preserving, storing and preparing samples from four Silesian rivers was optimized. Silesian sediment and river water samples are a challenge for the analyst, because they have complex matrices and high content of chlorides coming from the discharges of saline water. This study concerned determination of Sb(III), Sb(V), As(III), As(V), MMA, DMA, AB, Cr(III) and Cr(VI) with high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The following columns were used: Dionex Ion Pack AG7 to determine chromium forms, Hamilton PRP-X100 to separate antimony species and Dionex Ion Pack AS7 to determine five chemical arsenic forms. The methodology used allowed for elimination of interferences during analysis of highly saline and complex samples and ions separation directly without adding any complexing compounds. Depending on the analytes, full separation was obtained within 3–9.5 min. The sediment sample extraction and determination were validated (recovery, limit of detection, repeatability and uncertainty) with the certified reference materials (CRMs). The optimized methodology allowed for study of mobility and seasonality changes of As, Sb and Cr species in the river environment.</jats:p>",

We explore the problem from a central policymaker's perspective who wants to maximize social welfare. We consider two stakeholders, retailers, and consumers, who optimize their own objectives (i.e., profits and net utility) and three competitive settings (i.e., monopoly, monopolistic competition with symmetric market share, and monopolistic competition with asymmetric market share). For the monopoly case, we find that when the retailer's profit is high, imposing some carbon emission charges on the retailer and the consumers does not substantially change the supply chain structure or the social welfare. However, when the retailer's profit is low, imposing carbon costs optimally can lead to a significant increase in social welfare. Moreover, the impact of imposing carbon emission charges becomes more significant when the degree of competition increases. Additionally, the quantum of benefit may depend only on factors common across industries, such as fuel and carbon costs. </jats:p>",

In this study, a simple voltage sensorless multi‐loop control method is proposed for the single‐phase UPS inverter and the parameters are designed systematically based on a frequency domain method. The suggested control scheme uses two nested simple proportional controllers instead of proportional–integral/resonant controllers to regulate the output voltage and produce active resonance damping. In addition, a feedforward compensation of the reference voltage is used to enhance the performance of the control system. The proposed controller does not need any reference frame transformation or integration/derivation of measured quantities in its structure. To reduce the cost and at the same time to improve the reliability of the converter system, the output voltage sensor is replaced by a simple estimation algorithm based on the digital Kalman filter. Experimental results with a 500 VA prototype, as well as simulation results validate the excellent performance of the suggested estimation and control scheme.</jats:p>",

This paper looks at systems for improved community-based water supply and sanitation management in the Rural Village Water Resources Management Project (RVWRMP), in mid and far west Nepal. The paper analysed 496 rural, community-managed drinking water and sanitation schemes (with 30 to 250 beneficiary households per scheme) supported by RVWRMP (2006–2014). Observed results are: 91.5% fully functional, 8.3% partially functional and 0.2% of schemes closed due to natural disasters and social conflicts. This compares very favourably to the systems implemented by the government of similar age. We consider that the experience gained in RVWRMP provides relevant lessons on how to safeguard the functionality of rural water services infrastructure systems. The key elements noted by our staff are: prioritisation of the schemes by the community; application of quality implementation and user committee management; Water Safety Plans and active maintenance; and hands-on technical support and monitoring.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Supply networks are becoming increasingly complex with multiple overlapping relationships between firms that may span across industries. Consequently, inventory management is becoming more difficult as managers have to cope with variability in the supply flows that originate from different parts of the network. Managers that quickly sense abnormal flows may intervene and adapt their inventory policies in response to system changes. In this article, we present a framework for sensing abnormal flows originating within the upstream supply network of a focal organization. Our framework combines time series modeling with process charts to identify abnormal flow patterns in the incoming supply streams. It is a flexible framework that uses off‐the‐shelf technology to provide managers with a process that can be employed for monitoring multiple individual or aggregated data streams originating within any complex system such as complex adaptive supply networks. We illustrate our framework on four years of longitudinal supply data from the second largest food bank in the United States. We identify multiple instances of abnormal supply flows and validate our results through rigorous inventory analysis as well as field‐based expert interviews. We discuss the implications of our findings for inventory management in complex supply networks, both from academic and practitioner points of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pulse power systems with highly dynamic loads like klystron, backward wave oscillator (BWO), and magnetron generate highly dynamic noise. This noise leads to frequent failure of controlled switches in the inverter stage of charging power supply. Designing a reliable and compatible power supply for pulse power applications is always a tricky job when charging rate is in multiples of 10 kJ/s. A ±50 kV and 45 kJ/s capacitor charging power supply based on 4th order LCLC resonant topology has been developed for a 10 Hz repetitive Marx based system. Conditions for load independent constant current and zero current switching (ZCS) are derived mathematically. Noise generated at load end due to dynamic load is tackled effectively and reduction in magnitude noise voltage is achieved by providing shielding between primary and secondary of high voltage high frequency transformer and with LCLC low pass filter. Shielding scales down the ratio between coupling capacitance (Cc) and the collector-emitter capacitance of insulated gate bi-polar transistor switch, which in turn reduces the common mode noise voltage magnitude. The proposed 4th order LCLC resonant network acts as a low pass filter for differential mode noise in the reverse direction (from load to source). Power supply has been tested repeatedly with 5 Hz repetition rate with repetitive Marx based system connected with BWO load working fine without failure of single switch in the inverter stage.</jats:p>",

Both aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies regulate sediment transport and deposition in such cross-dune braided rivers. Here we show a significant selective deposition in response to both aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies in the Ulan Buh desert braided channel. The Ulan Buh desert is the main coarse sediment source for this desert braided channel, and the mean percentage of the coarser (&gt; 0.08 mm) grains on the aeolian dunes surface is 95.34 %. The lateral selective deposition process is developed by the interaction between the flows and the aeolian–fluvial sediment supplies, causing the coarser sediments (&gt; 0.08 mm) from aeolian sand supply and bank erosion to accumulate in the channel centre and the finer fluvial sediments (&lt; 0.08 mm) to be deposited on the bar and floodplain surfaces, forming a coarser-grained thalweg bed bounded by finer-grained floodplain surfaces. This lateral selective deposition reduces the downstream sediment transport and is a primary reason for the formation of an \"above-ground\" river in the braided reach of the upper Yellow River in response to aeolian and fluvial sediment supplies.\n                    </jats:p>"

Three hundred randomly selected respondents were interviewed, while 44 households were selected and randomly assigned to four improved container treatment groups: Covered Buckets with Taps (CBT), Covered Buckets without Taps (CB), Covered Kegs with Taps (CKT) and Covered Kegs without Taps (CK). Water samples from springs, regular storage containers (RSC), and improved containers were analysed for total coliform (TC), total viable bacteria (TVB) and Escherichia coli for 2 weeks. About 96% reported using the same containers for cooking and drinking water, while only 23.3% used a form of water treatment. TC count for RSC and CB exceeded the recommended limit. Only 3 (6.8%) of the samples from RSC contained E. coli. A statistically significant difference was observed between the mean TC counts of samples from the improved containers. Percentage reduction in TC count from RSC, and the improved containers (CB, CBT, CK and CKT) were 25.4%, 37.3%, 45.0%, 56.8% and 53.8% respectively. Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas were isolated from the water samples. CK produced the best result. Hygiene education on use of appropriate storage containers for drinking water is recommended at the household level.</jats:p>",

The resolve of clients to procure public works based on competitive pricing, especially in developing countries, is notable. The management of projects is affected by procurement and supply chain structures in the construction industry. This premise led to a qualitative study, which examined how supply chain structures influence the procurement of public works in Malawi. The study elicited views from clients, consultants, contractors and suppliers. The research reveals that the traditional procurement method, based on the lowest price, is the preferred method used; as such, in Malawi public works project performance depends on the design and supervision team. As a result, the management of the parties to a project is crucial to successful outcomes, although it appears that the short-term nature of most relationships has marginalised the realisation, as the continuous reliance on a single method of procurement tends to hinder collaborative working arrangements that could lead to improved performance in Malawi. </jats:p>",

The study was based on the results of field tests of windows with heat-reflective shields in a certified climate chamber. The method to determine the minimum indoor air temperature under standby heating using heat-reflective shields in the windows and multifunctional energy-efficient shutter with solar battery have been developed. Annual energy saving for the conditions of different regions of Russia and France was determined. Using windows with heat-reflecting screens and a solar battery results in a triple power effect: reduced heat losses during the heating season due to increased window resistance; lower cost of heating buildings due to lowering of indoor ambient temperature; also electric power generation.</jats:p>"

The difference with the conventional chain is that in the short supply chain the primary products are locally processed and sold directly by the producer to the consumer. The short supply chain has different microbiological quality and safety aspects in comparison with the conventional chain.

On the basis of analysis, a new analytical mathematical model of common‐mode (CM) EMI noise path is presented. This model is easier to construct and allows researchers to better understand the impact of each parameter on CM EMI noise than former models. According to the proposed model, the capacitors from the traces connected to the ground (GND), voltage drain drain (VDD), current sense (CS) and feedback (FB) pins to the ground demonstrate the greatest impact on CM EMI. Two improved layouts are designed to verify the analysis result. The layouts were driven by the newly developed model. Test results show that they correspond with theoretical calculations supporting the analysis and the model that was developed in the course of this work.</jats:p>",

The implementation of SCMIS is a complicated process with significant risk since disparate systems spanning across companies are being integrated. A review of literature has revealed that the success in implementing SCMIS is not very encouraging. Against this backdrop, this paper identified 18 critical success factors and proposes a model for successful implementation of the system that can give the organization an edge over their competitors. The proposed model confirms that following factors play a significant role during implementation of SCMIS—top management support, user involvement, pre-implementation analysis, user training, change management, data accuracy and communication. The process model and critical success factors will provide a useful guide for industry practitioners who are planning to implement SCMIS in their organization. The study can help them gain an understanding of the complexities intrinsic in implementing these systems, improve decision-making for successful implementation of the system right from inception and subsequent realization of the enormous benefits, such as, reduction of inventories, minimization of bullwhip effect and cost reduction, that will accrue with right implementation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advanced traction power supply system (ATPSS) is a new directional development for traction power supply systems, which can totally remove the neutral sections and effectively promote power quality. However, the existing converters suffer from small substation capacity. In this paper, a new configuration based on a three-level neutral point clamped (3L-NPC) three-phase to single-phase cascade converter in a substation is proposed for ATPSS, which can be used to match the capacity of the converter for high voltage and large power applications. The control strategy of the proposed converter is analyzed in depth, and the phase disposition sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PD-SPWM) with phase shift carrier SPWM (PSC-SPWM) is employed in the inverters. Then, the inductance equalizing circuit is applied for the voltage balance on the DC-link. Besides, a LC filter circuit is designed to eliminate the double line-frequency ripple of DC voltage. Afterwards, a simulation model and an experimental prototype are developed, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed converter in this paper can not only meet the requirements of voltage and capacity for the traction network, but also improve power quality. Finally, the experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.</jats:p>"

CNT-based filters have a prospective advantage in comparison to the commercial filters already in operation because they are light weight and do not require electricity to operate. This investigation handles the filtration efficiency of manganese and iron from aqueous solution using commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Taunit). The effects of different parameters such as CNT filter mass, concentration of manganese and iron in aqueous solution and pH of aqueous solution on removal of these heavy metals are determined. From these investigations, the removal efficiency of manganese and iron could reach 71.5% and 52% respectively for concentration 50 ppm, suggesting that Taunit is an excellent adsorbent for manganese and iron removal from water. There was a significant increase in removal efficiency at pH = 3 for manganese and pH = 8 for iron. The effect of oxidation on the structural of MWCNTs was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques to investigate the functionalization with oxygen-containing and outer diameter distribution. It was found that functionalized CNT-based filters are more efficient at removing manganese and iron from aqueous solutions. Oxidized MWCNTs may be a promising candidate for heavy metal ion removal from industrial wastewater.</jats:p>",

In this work, we go ahead by analysing the thermal properties (such as, primarily, the temperature) of the water used inside the distribution system and of that discharged. To this purpose, we add the relevant thermal equations to the MS Excel<jats:sup>TM</jats:sup> simulation model developed in the first study. The resulting model is able to derive the temperature trend of water inside all the tanks of the distribution system. Situations where the temperature of the water used for rinsing is higher than the maximum allowed value of approx. 25°C are also highlighted and suggestions for improvement are proposed.</jats:p>",

Randomly selected 50 farmers from a group of 380 and eight agriculture officers were used as the survey participants to identify the current performance and operational strategies in the rice production sector. Based on the statistical analysis of the rankings given by survey participants, key success factors related to mechanization, quality improvement and product development, knowledge and skill development, risk management and information availability of the rice supply chain were identified and were validated with experts’ opinion. The analysis helped in developing a Rice Supply Chain Development Ladder (RSCDL). The RSCDL contained three states, namely Introduction, Improvement and Review/Standardization, and facilitated identification of AS-IS state (existing circumstances) of the rice supply chain for the selected study site. These states could differ from district to district, based on the constraints present. This development ladder can be used as an analytical framework to represent the current AS-IS states of the rice supply chain. The RSCDL model provided a structured framework to analyze the current level of operational practices in a high performance rice production area. This can be a useful benchmarking tool for the poorly performing rice growing area with similar environmental conditions.</jats:p>"

However, it still faces problems in channelizing information along CSCs due to data heterogeneity. Trust issue is also a barrier to information sharing for integrating supply chains in a centralized collaboration system. In this paper, the authors present a web service framework, which facilitates storage and sharing of information on a distributed manner mediated through ontology-based web services.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Introduced in this article is a 1:15 brine model experiment rig with an actual large space building as the research object, which provides different concentration brine for a simulation of the stratified air conditioning in the steady-state flow field featured with columnar air supply in the bottom, heat source on the ground, the central air return, and air exhaust from roof in a large space. According to the similarity theory, it is concluded that the similarity criterion numbers applied here are Reynolds number (Re) and Archimedes number (Ar) for designation of experiment rig size, choosing device type, and confirming experiment condition. In the designation of key components of experiment rig, the application of automation control makes brine recovery and recycling in the process; designation of electrical control system makes a centralized control of experiment start–stop and the adjustment of the pipeline flow, realizing automation in the whole experiment process. Particle image velocimetry testing technology is used to get velocity vector field of air return mouth area in the model under various working conditions, and also proper orthogonal decomposition method is applied to analyze flow field structure of air return mouth area and reconstruct it. Consequently, we can get a kinetic energy ratio of return air entrainment of lower air-conditioning section and upper non-air-conditioning section in large space. Experiments show that under the conditions of same air supply, indoor environment temperature difference, and height and direction of return air inlet, fastening the speed of return air suction, the entrainment of flow field around it strengthens accordingly. The entrainment of return air inlet has more kinetic energy in the lower air-conditioning section than the upper non-air-conditioning section. </jats:p>",

A two‐stage stochastic mixed‐integer linear fractional programming (SMILFP) model is developed to optimize the levelized cost of energy generated from shale gas. In this model, both design and planning decisions are considered with respect to shale well drilling, shale gas production, processing, multiple end‐uses, and transportation. To reduce the model size and number of scenarios, we apply a sample average approximation method to generate scenarios based on the real‐world EUR data. In addition, a novel solution algorithm integrating the parametric approach and the L‐shaped method is proposed for solving the resulting SMILFP problem within a reasonable computational time. The proposed model and algorithm are illustrated through a case study based on the Marcellus shale play, and a deterministic model is considered for comparison. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 61: 3739–3755, 2015</jats:p>",

In this water supply complex is the Água Preta lake, which serves as a reservoir for the water pumped from the Guamá river. Due to the great importance of this lake for this system, several works have been devoted to its study, from the monitoring of the quality of its waters to its hydrodynamic modeling. This paper presents the results obtained by computer simulation of the phosphorus dispersion within this reservoir by the numerical solution of two-dimensional equation of advection-diffusion-reaction by the method θ/SUPG. Comparing these results with data concentration of total phosphorus collected from November 2008 to October 2009 and from satellite photos show that the biggest polluters of the water of this lake are the domestic sewage dumps from the population living in its vicinity. The results obtained indicate the need for more information for more precise quantitative analysis. However, they show that the phosphorus brought by the Guamá river water is consumed in an area adjacent to the canal that carries this water into the lake. Phosphorus deposits in the lake bottom should be monitored to verify their behavior, thus preventing the quality of water maintained therein.</jats:p>",

It is shown that having two degrees of freedom in designing the DF buck helps to achieve high efficiency, low output ripples, and tracking capability with low ripples, simultaneously. A comparison analysis is done with regards to the mentioned performance indexes with the standard and three‐level buck converters; in addition, the results are validated in HSPICE in BSIM3V3 0.35‐µm CMOS process.

By means of similar control strategy use, the topology employed to implement the PQCs can operate as unified PQC (UPQC), or, through some circuit modifications, as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system. Considering 3P4W systems, the use of the dual compensation strategy into the PQCs comprised of two four‐leg (4‐Leg) converters is the main contribution of this study. Different from the conventional strategies, in the dual compensation strategy, the 4‐Leg converter connected in parallel with the load is controlled to operate as a sinusoidal voltage source, whereas the 4‐Leg converter connected in series between the grid and the load is controlled to operate as a sinusoidal current source. Both the voltage and current controllers are implemented into the synchronous rotating reference frame, and the converters use the three‐dimensional space vector modulation technique. Experimental tests, based on a digital signal processor, are performed in order to validate the theoretical development and to verify both static and dynamic performance of the PQC operating as UPQC, as well as UPS system.</jats:p>",

These complications may be reduced by sparing the vagus nerve branches to the lung. However, current descriptions of the regional anatomy are insufficient. Therefore, we aimed to provide a highly detailed description of the course of the pulmonary vagus nerve branches. In six fixed adult human cadavers, bilateral microscopic dissection of the vagus nerve branches to the lungs was performed. The level of branching and the number, calibre and distribution of nerve branches were described. Nerve fibres were identified using neurofilament immunohistochemistry, and the nerve calibre was measured using computerized image analysis. Both lungs were supplied by a predominant posterior and a smaller anterior nerve plexus. The right lung was supplied by 13 (10–18) posterior and 3 (2–3) anterior branches containing 77% (62–100%) and 23% (0–38%) of the lung nerve supply, respectively. The left lung was supplied by a median of 12 (8–13) posterior and 3 (2–4) anterior branches containing 74% (60–84%) and 26% (16–40%) of the left lung nerve supply, respectively. During transthoracic oesophagectomy with <jats:italic>en bloc</jats:italic> lymphadenectomy and transection of the vagus nerves at the level of the azygos vein, 68–100% of the right lung nerve supply and 86–100% of the inferior left lung lobe nerve supply were severed. When vagotomy was performed distally to the last large pulmonary branch, 0–8% and 0–13% of the nerve branches to the right middle/inferior lobes and left inferior lobe, respectively, were lost. In conclusion, this study provides a detailed description of the extensive pulmonary nerve supply provided by the vagus nerves. During oesophagectomy, extensive mediastinal lymphadenectomy denervates the lung to a great extent; however, this can be prevented by performing the vagotomy distal to the caudalmost large pulmonary branch. Further research is required to determine the feasibility of sparing the pulmonary vagus nerve branches without compromising the completeness of lymphadenectomy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Estonia is a relatively small country with a limited supply of indigenous energy resources mainly consisting of oil shale, wood, and peat. Estonia is also the only country in Europe with a dominant electricity production by burning oil shale. Around 90% of the overall electric energy production in Estonia comes from the Narva Power Plants. This presents great challenges and problems due to massive emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as well as radiological impact on the environment. Therefore, the current energy supply strategy can be considered hazardous and an unpopular choice for future energy system planning. In this article, we analyze the current energy policy as well as inclusion of new strategies to produce electricity for Estonia for a target year of 2035. We use a computer model Model for Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impacts (MESSAGE) to provide optimization and aim in helping the policymakers in the Estonian decision making process. We also add a specific case in the MESSAGE model to examine the ability of the current electricity supply strategy to handle climate related shocks with a special focus on cold weather in two plausible cases; single cold winter and prolonged cold winter. Results indicate that unexpected demand shocks may cause serious losses in gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, the authors come to the conclusion that extra capacity is highly recommendable for a number of reasons. We also find that nuclear power becomes economically preferable to oil shale with a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> tax of €20/t. Yet moving toward nuclear or other low CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> alternatives presents certain challenges. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 469–478, 2016</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates and defines the topographic anatomy of the medial femoral circumflex artery (MFCA) terminal branches supplying the femoral head (FH). Gross dissection of 14 fresh–frozen cadaveric hips was undertaken to determine the extra and intracapsular course of the MFCA’s terminal branches. A constant branch arising from the transverse MFCA (inferior retinacular artery; IRA) penetrates the capsule at the level of the anteroinferior neck, then courses obliquely within the fibrous prolongation of the capsule wall (inferior retinacula of Weitbrecht), elevated from the neck, to the posteroinferior femoral head–neck junction. This vessel has a mean of five (three to nine) terminal branches, of which the majority penetrate posteriorly. Branches from the ascending MFCA entered the femoral capsular attachment posteriorly, running deep to the synovium, through the neck, and terminating in two branches. The deep MFCA penetrates the posterosuperior femoral capsular. Once intracapsular, it divides into a mean of six (four to nine) terminal branches running deep to the synovium, within the superior retinacula of Weitbrecht of which 80% are posterior. Our study defines the exact anatomical location of the vessels, arising from the MFCA and supplying the FH. The IRA is in an elevated position from the femoral neck and may be protected from injury during fracture of the femoral neck. We present vascular ‘danger zones’ that may help avoid iatrogenic vascular injury during surgical interventions about the hip. </jats:p><jats:p> Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2015;97-B:1204–13. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent work has shown that aerial diatoms are a useful ecological tracer of hydrological connectivity in the hillslope–riparian zone–stream (HRS) system. While such work has improved both our understanding of catchment functioning and aerial diatom taxonomy, assemblages and distribution, further work is hampered by lack of data on diatom population depletion during rainfall events. We still do not know whether or not diatom tracers are supply limited. Here we test the null hypothesis that aerial diatoms exhibit infinite supply in the context of natural rainfall events. Rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in a small forested catchment in northwest Luxembourg. We extracted periodically soil surface samples and overland flow samples for diatom population size and species assemblage analyses. Diatom population size was quantified using a new approach we have developed, which involves extracting diatoms using carbonated water and an isopycnic separation technique. Our results showed that pre‐event population size was <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 96 100 diatoms per cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the riparian zone. During the artificial rainfall event, the diatom population was depleted by 72% to 27 200 diatoms per cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The diatom assemblage was characteristic of a frequently disturbed environment. Overall, these results suggest that diatoms are supply limited, and are flushed significantly throughout rainfall events. Nevertheless, based on the data from these 1 in 10‐year rainstorm simulations, the riparian zone diatom population is unlikely to be exhausted on an event time scale. Further research is now underway to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of aerial diatom communities across a range of storm sizes.

We report the results of a matched cluster randomized trial investigating the effect of improved water supply on diarrheal prevalence of children under five living in rural areas of the Volta Region in Ghana. We compared the diarrheal prevalence of 305 children in 10 communities of intervention with 302 children in 10 matched communities with no intervention (October 2012 to February 2014). A modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratio. An intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken. The crude prevalence ratio of diarrhea in the intervention compared with the control communities was 0.85 (95% CI 0.74–0.97) for Krachi West, 0.96 (0.87–1.05) for Krachi East, and 0.91 (0.83–0.98) for both districts. Sanitation was adjusted for in the model to remove the bias due to residual imbalance since it was not balanced even after randomization. The adjusted prevalence ratio was 0.82 (95% CI 0.71–0.96) for Krachi West, 0.95 (0.86–1.04) for Krachi East, and 0.89 (0.82–0.97) for both districts.

While approximately 70% of the annual rainfall is received during the summer season, most of the agricultural water is utilized from May to June. Therefore, irrigation facilities including reservoirs, canals and pumps were installed to efficiently manage agricultural water. Efficient operation of irrigation systems is important for sustainable irrigated agriculture, which is undermined due to the low water efficiency of the irrigation systems. Irrigation water management using web‐based decision support systems is necessary to resolve water efficiency problems. In this study, automatic water gauges were installed at the main and secondary irrigation canals in the Dongjin River Basin, South Korea. The water levels in each canal were monitored and the irrigation water supply calculated. An irrigation model considering intermittent irrigation was developed to compare the estimated irrigation demands with the actual supplies for decision‐making and demand strategies. Using this model and water‐level data, a risk‐based decision support system for the operation and management of agricultural water was developed and evaluated. Using this system. it is possible to optimally manage irrigation water and to make plans for efficient agricultural water operation and management.

Some of these compounds are efficient inhibitors of glucose uptake in lung cancer cells and have a notable antiproliferative effect. In contrast to their 5‐aryl‐substituted regioisomers, the newly synthesized compounds reported herein do not display significant binding to the estrogen receptors. The inhibition of glucose uptake in cancer cells by these compounds was further observed by fluorescence microscopy imaging using a fluorescent analogue of glucose. Therefore, blocking the ability of tumor cells to take up glucose by means of these small molecules, or by further optimized derivatives, may be a successful approach in the development of novel anticancer drugs.</jats:p>",

Logistic regression analyses estimated associations between percentage of minority residents, and net gains and losses of RHCs and FQHCs, adjusting for total population, percentage of elderly residents, infant mortality rate, poverty rate, and physician, hospital, and clinic supply.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Essential amino acids (EAA) are responsible for skeletal muscle anabolic effects after nutrient intake. The pattern of appearance of EAA in blood, e.g., after intake of “slow” or “fast” protein sources or in response to grazing vs. bolus feeding patterns, may impact anabolism. However, the influence of this on muscle anabolism is poorly understood, particularly in older individuals. We determined the effects of divergent feeding profiles of EAA on blood flow, anabolic signaling, and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in older men. Sixteen men (∼70 yr) consumed EAA either as a single dose (bolus, 15 g; n = 8) or as small repeated fractions (pulse, 4 × 3.75 g every 45 min; n = 8) during <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> phenylalanine infusion. Repeated blood samples and muscle biopsies permitted measurement of fasting and postprandial plasma EAA, insulin, anabolic signaling, and MPS. Muscle blood flow was assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (Sonovue). Bolus achieved rapid insulinemia (12.7 μiU/ml 25-min postfeed), essential aminoacidemia (∼3,000 μM, 45–65 min postfeed), and mTORC1 activity; pulse achieved attenuated insulin responses, gradual low-amplitude aminoacidemia (∼1,800 μM 80–195 min after feeding), and undetectable mTORC1 signaling. Despite this, equivalent anabolic responses were observed: fasting FSRs of 0.051 and 0.047%/h (bolus and pulse, respectively) increased to 0.084 and 0.073%/h, respectively. Moreover, pulse led to sustainment of MPS beyond 180 min, when bolus MPS had returned to basal rates. We detected no benefit of rapid aminoacidemia in this older population despite enhanced anabolic signaling and greater overall EAA exposure. Rather, apparent delayed onset of the “muscle-full” effect permitted identical MPS following low-amplitude-sustained EAA exposure. </jats:p>",
