This paper addresses the challenge of taking innovation to scale in an established firm by enhancing our understanding of the nature of service ramp ups and ramp downs. Digital service ramp ups differ substantially from production ramp ups as the speed is much greater, and problems are visible to customers. However there are similarities between service ramp downs and product recalls and an important contribution is exploring the nature of ramp downs their processes and possible causes. Using an engaged research approach, longitudinal data from three consecutive ramp ups in a European telecom operator were collected. Through analyses of cases, qualitative and quantitative case data, and using a system dynamics model, we identified a set of issues that affect service ramp ups and ramp downs. These include the need to ramp up the service supply chain, biases leading to unrealistic assumptions about scalability and problem‐solving, decision biases in various functions, launching digital services in beta form, a lack of transparency of capacity and lack of learning from previous ramp ups. We show that if these problems are not addressed or resolution is delayed, this can lead to cycles of delay, backlogs and productivity problems and the inevitability of a ramp down. We explore reasons and importance for such delays that lead to service ramp downs.</jats:p>",

Tian Shan system is an important water resource in Central Asia: river waters are intensely taken for hydropower energy, urban systems, irrigation. But geopolitics in Tian Shan is difficult: it crosses five densely populated countries. The problem consists in water delivery between countries located in the highlands with excellent water supply (Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) and those located in valleys with water shortage (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan). The water use causes debates among these countries. Besides, global warming causes water deficit, which adds difficulties to hydro-energetics. A multidisciplinary analysis was performed in the article: water supply in Tian Shan, spatial distribution of hydro-energetic resources and effects of climate impact were analysed.</jats:p>"

Utilizing corn stover as the single feedstock to a biorefinery also poses a source of risk to seasonal feedstock availability, affordability, and sustainability. Implementing a year‐round feedstock switching strategy or utilizing an optimal mixture of corn stover, miscanthus, and switchgrass is demonstrated to diminish these concerns while reducing the cost of sugar production by as much as 3.8% and 13.6%, respectively, when compared to a baseline sugar price of 441.9 $ metric ton<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (t) attributed to a fixed corn stover feedstock basis. This study determines that a mixing ratio of corn stover, miscanthus, and switchgrass of 36%, 50%, and 14%, respectively, minimizes the selling price of sugar. If miscanthus is sufficiently available in the future, its fraction could be further increased to 70% by reducing the fraction of corn stover. We find that the mixed feedstock considered in this study reduces the nutrient replacement and feedstock transportation costs and improves the quality of feedstock (determined by total carbohydrates and ash) relative to corn stover alone. Results suggest that a high‐quality feedstock with a high carbohydrate content is an important metric for consideration, beyond strictly the feedstock cost, to reduce the selling price of sugar and its uncertainties. In the future this may be supported by the increased availability of higher carbohydrate feedstocks such as miscanthus. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we use life-cycle inventories of electricity-generating technologies and an integrated assessment model (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model) to project the global raw material requirements in two scenarios: a second shared socioeconomic pathway baseline, and a 2 °C scenario by 2100. Material usage reported in the life-cycle inventories is distributed into three phases, namely construction, operation, and decommissioning. Material supply dynamics and the impact of the 2 °C warming limit are quantified for three raw fossil fuels and forty-eight metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources. Depending on the time horizon, graphite, sand, sulfur, borates, aluminum, chromium, nickel, silver, gold, rare earth elements or their substitutes could face a sharp increase in usage as a result of a massive installation of low-carbon technologies. Ignoring nonfuel resource availability and value in deep decarbonation, circular economy, or decoupling scenarios can potentially generate misleading, contradictory, or unachievable climate policies.</jats:p>"

To address new developments and changing trends, organizations are now compelled to identify and implement innovative and sustainable solutions, not only within their organizations’ boundaries, but also across the whole supply chain network. The primary goal of this paper was to identify and analyze drivers of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) that influence or encourage organizations to undertake sustainability initiatives and implement sustainable solutions throughout their supply chains. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted and 1559 drivers of SSCM were identified from 217 journal articles. Precise interpretation, clear definitions, restructuring, and classification into external and internal driver categories produced a list of 40 unique drivers of SSCM. The results revealed that regulatory and market pressures, with reference to the number of citations, are the most prevailing drivers of SSCM for the implementation of sustainability practices. Classification of the drivers of SSCM into primary and secondary driver categories may assist practitioners and decision makers in prioritizing sustainability-related initiatives and adopting sustainability practices across the whole supply chain network.</jats:p>"

The categories considered (financial activity, legal interests, energy system) allow to reveal the special importance of state enterprises for the state economy. Identification of energy supply problems of state-owned enterprises will allow to assess the optimal power capacities of the public legal sector. The revealed regularities of the energy potential will allow us to assess the risks when planning and predicting energy efficiency. The dynamics of the increase in the consumption of electricity by state enterprises is traced, at the same time as the search for alternative sources of resource support is on. The developed infrastructure of state-owned enterprises implies the search for technologically justified solutions to obtain energy resources in an innovative way. Recommended approach of energy saving systems usage will allow the enterprise manages to optimize the costs. State enterprise is a unique organizational and legal form with the participation of public and legal entities that allow the state to participate in economic processes in the most optimal, efficient and effective way and realize the most significant state tasks. Such tasks include: implementation of public interests, provision of society with necessary goods and services, implementation of separately subsidized activities, production of military equipment, cartridges, gunpowder, chemical production, disposal of hazardous waste. These tasks emphasize a special priority for the presence of public legal entities in this sector of the economy. The legal nature of state enterprises allows for the most effective implementation of this activity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\t \tThis work proposes a promising scenario of large-scale deployment of battery energy storage systems that attempts to address three important issues toward a sustainable energy landscape in the near future: (1) Suppressed grid integration of variable renewable generations such as wind; (2) Low profitability of battery energy storage systems due to limited applications; and (3) Conflicts between the current power infrastructure and the installation of charging stations to meet the growing needs of electrical transportation. To maximize the utilization of renewable energy while increasing the profitability of battery energy storage systems, a new concept has emerged from our previous work which envisions a transition from \"Battery Farm\" to \"Battery Warehouse\", i.e. the batteries can be mobilized instead of completely stationary. More specifically, we design a system in which electric trucks transport the batteries between battery warehouse and electric vehicle charging stations. This facilitates the planning and operation of electric vehicle charging station networks without constraints from the grid. In many areas in the United states (e.g. Texas) where there are abundant renewable energy sources and the road networks do not suffer from frequent congestion, this could be a viable solution. To further demonstrate its feasibility, in this work, we use the theoretical framework of supply chain management and investigate a three-layer supply network (battery warehouse, charging stations, electric vehicles). The objectives are two-folded: firstly, developing an integrated pricing method to include costs, risks, and consumer utilities; and secondly, determining the locations and sizes of charging stations to minimize costs in the logistics system. Using the city of Corpus Christi, Texas and the nearby Chapman Ranch wind farm as test case, we implement the design and simulate its performance based on the supply chain management models. The two main performance indexes are: reliability (supply can always meet demand) and profitability. While the former can be ensured through good planning and control, the latter remains an open problem. However, our preliminary results in this work, even if far from definitive due to various assumptions and uncertainties, would shed some light on this issue to help potential stakeholders make business decisions or policy recommendations.   </jats:p>",

Применение других видов печати может сократить логистические издержки. Проведена классификация логистических издержек в цепи поставок создания книжной продукции. Классификация проведена по следующим классификационным признакам: по участникам цепи поставок, по функциональным областям логистики — снабжение, производство, сбыт, по потокам, движение и изменение которых вызывает возникновение издержек, — материальный, финансовый и информационный. Далее рассматриваются отличительные особенности таких видов печати, как офсетная печать и цифровая печать. Сравнение проводится по основным критериям: себестоимость единицы готовой продукции, особенности используемых материалов, возможности производства.

The use of other types of printing can reduce logistics costs. The classification of logistics costs in the supply chain of book production was made. The classification is carried out according to the following classification criteria: by participants of the supply chain, by functional areas of logistics — supply, production, sales, by flows, movement and change of which causes costs — material, financial and information. Further, the distinctive features of such types of printing as offset printing and digital printing are considered. The comparison is carried out according to the main criteria: the unit cost of the finished product, the features of the materials used, the possibility of production. A comparative analysis of logistics costs at each stage of book creation, depending on the use of offset, digital or hybrid printing. On the basis of this analysis an additional comparison of logistics costs using offset printing and printing-on-demand was made</jats:p>",

In this regard, a special role belongs to fundamental research, which will allow to consider government regulation not only from the point of its content, water supply and disposal, but also from other perspectives - as far as it can be described as a social, economic, legal phenomenon and determine practical value for society as a whole.Methodology is a set of subjects and objects, goals and objectives, principles, approaches and functions, criteria and indicators, forms and methods of state regulation. All elements of the state regulation methodology form an organic unity. The methodological guidelines and approaches that significantly affect all components of the state regulation methodology and directly related to public administration are the most crucial components of state regulation. The article is devoted to the methodological approaches study related to the state regulation in the sphere of water supply and wastewater disposal. The author explores the state regulation category, describes it as a social, economic, legal phenomenon and tries to determine its practical value for society as a whole.Special attention is paid to the sphere of centralized water supply and sanitation as a natural monopoly, and the causes of the natural monopoly origin in this sphere have been analyzed. The author explores and analyzes the subjects, object, forms and methods, principles and functions of state regulation in the field of water supply and wastewater disposal. The author also examines rationale for the causes and limits of state intervention in the economic and other processes in the field of water supply and sanitation, as well as the nature, practical value and direction of regulation.In the article, the author draws attention to some inconsistencies in the legislation on state regulation in the sphere of water supply and wastewater disposal, and gives suggestions concerning formation of a unified approach to the definition of natural monopolies, an understanding of the objectives of government regulation and reform, and perspective research.</jats:p>"

For example, (a) the use of electric powered vehicles in the delivery supply chain has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions; and (b) using recycled cardboard or materials that are biodegradable would reduce landfill waste. This paper examines the potential benefits of these green practices in the delivery supply chain.  Our results are that a case can be made for use of electric-power vehicles and their potential benefit to reduce CO2 emissions in an environment where power generation in non-coal based.  In other words, using electric cars in all delivery supply chains isn’t always a solution; firms must recognize the significant impact of the power generation process in their operating area.   From a packaging perspective, there is documented consumer interest on using environmentally friendly material for consumer products.  However, depending upon the market segment size, this might not always result in better financial outcomes for companies. </jats:p>"

Increase in the volume of tailings requires proper attention to tailings disposal, the establishment of tailings dams, water consumption and prevention of environmental and groundwater pollution. Since tailings disposal consists of many stages such as discharge, thickening technology and location, and transportation, selection of the best disposal method is a complicated task. Nowadays, decision-making methods are widely used and they are very reliable and efficient. Therefore, a model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been developed in this study to optimize tailings disposal method selection. In the model, 21 criteria and a wide range of alternatives have been introduced. The model has been applied to the Sangan Iron Ore Project (SIOP). The concentrator plant of SIOP will produce 75 million tons of tailings during the mine lifetime. Since the current disposal method wastes 1.5 million cubic metres of water annually and the project is located in a dry region, the proposed model has been used to investigate other options and the results show the filtered technique is the best alternative.</jats:p>",

Results of the study showed that for bacterial removal, ZVI-amended BSFs outperformed the BSF by at least 1 log10 unit throughout the filter operation. Effluent turbidity in the BSF and modified BSFs was not significantly influenced by influent values for the turbidity range tested in the study (17.0–45.4 NTU). Removal efficiency of nitrates was higher in the modified BSFs, with up to ∼89% removal in the modified BSFs compared with ∼29% in the BSF. Sharp decline in dissolved oxygen (DO) was observed during the passage of water through the filters. The DO decline was more in the modified filters compared with the conventional BSF. Effluent iron remained within the drinking-water quality standards. The study thus indicates the potential of ZVI to improve the performance of BSFs.</jats:p>",

The continual shortages or scarcity of refined petroleum products cripples business activities, which undermines the development of the Nigerian economy. The purpose of this multiple case study was to identify the strategic role of technology application in mitigating petroleum shortages in the petroleum supply chain and to sustain business development in Nigeria. The research participants include ten senior leaders from two private-sector Nigerian downstream petroleum supply companies located in the Niger Delta region, who had successfully implemented strategies for petroleum supply. The conceptual framework for the research was the resource based view theory. Data collection was through semi structured face-to-face interviews and review of company’s operational and policy documents. Data validation was through member checking and triangulation, after transcription and analysis. The findings indicate that the oil and gas industry is technologically driven, and for efficiency and effectiveness of supply, petroleum leaders should apply required technology in all segment of the supply chain; (operations) vessel or marine, discharge operations, tank farm operations, logistics, and retail outlets, (no operations) administration, sales, safety, IT, finance, and marketing. Findings may be used by petroleum business leaders and investors to create effective and efficient technological resource management strategies in the supply chain, leading to product availability, sustainability, poverty reduction, and economic development.</jats:p>"

The water samples were collected monthly started from September 2017 to January 2018.The results demonstrate that the total average values of radon activity level for the 5 months for site 1, site 2, site 3 and site 4 were 36.6, 28.5, 46.2 and 37.2 Bq.m−3, respectively. The average radon concentration value of the four sites during the 5 months was 37.1 Bq.m−3. Dissolved radon concentrations for the study samples were also calculated and their average values were 1.242, 0.930, 1.510 and 0.930 Bq.L−1 for site 1, site 2, site 3 and site 4, respectively. The overall average calculated radon surface exhalation rate for the water samples was 0.363 Bq.m−2.h−1. Annual effective doses due to water consumption for adults, children and babies were also calculated. The obtained values of radon concentrations in the study water samples were found to be lower than the maximum permissible concentrations in water as recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Also, the results reveal that the radon activity level has its lowest value during November but that there are no considerable variations with different times of the year.</jats:p>",

The investment in preservation technology is considered a decision variable to control the deteriorated quantity of an integrated system. The objective of the study is to optimize preservation investment, the number of shipments and shipment quantity, so that the total cost per unit of time of the supply chain is minimized. The study proposes a solution method, and the results show that investment in preservation technology reduces the total supply chain cost by 13%. Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations. Moreover, comparative study and managerial insights are given to extract significant insights from the model.</jats:p>"

This includes identifying the objectives of the dairy industry, along with the internal and external critical factors (CFs). SWOT exploration does not offer any investigative basis for evaluating the priorities of CFs, therefore the analytic hierarchy process is applied to define the priorities of identified CFs.

This research would analyze demographic and social factors underlying educated unemployment in Central Java in 2018 from supply side only. The data used was raw data on the result of National Labor Force Survey (SAKERNAS) conducted by BPS-Statistics of Central Java Province on February with 3375 respondents being the sample. The methods employed were descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses. The result of research showed that age, family member number, sex, and relationship to household head, marital status, residence area, and on-the-job training variables simultaneously affected the predisposition of educated work force to be unemployed. Meanwhile, partially family member number and residence area variables did not affect an individual’s predisposition to be educated unemployed</jats:p>"

In Haiti, and elsewhere, this is a dynamic requirement affected by population growth, not least in urban areas. In this paper, the principles of legitimacy, integration, inclusiveness, and capacity have been used to gauge and understand the institutional environment regarding water source protection for urban drinking water provision. The research was based on a review of official documents and key informant interviews. The absence of robust legislation can result in a misinterpretation of institutional responsibilities with respect to both water and land management. The legitimacy of some key institutions is questioned due to unclear legal status, particularly when they are directly appointed by central government. Some institutions have gained recognised authority as a result of their sectoral prominence but lack legal backing. Particular initiatives may foster the integration of stakeholders but, without involving all necessary sectors, agencies and levels of government, their sustainability is questionable. Technical, structural and financial institutional capacities appear limited, hampering the implementation of initiatives and their continuity, also compounded by institutional dependence on external funds and high turnover of administrators.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As economic globalisation increases, inclination toward domestic protectionism is also increasing in many countries of the world. To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman’s assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies’ appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: This study aims to propose a methodology that identifies and prioritizes the operational risk factors in a supply chain (SC) to provide a tool according to the process-based SC approach that is useful for risk assessment throughout the SC. Materials and methods: Risk identification was conducted by a scenario analysis, which linked the risk factors with the standard key performance indicators (KPIs) of the processes and logistics activities proposed by the supply chain operational reference model (SCORM o SCOR). These influence relationships were quantified using a proposed scale, and then, the risk factors were prioritized by the definition of their influence levels. This approach was applied to a real SC. Results and discussion: Twenty risk factors were clearly and effectively identified, analyzed and prioritized, and priority was given to those with the highest influence level, which can be understood as the risk factors that have a larger capacity to negatively affect SC performance. Conclusions: The methodology allows the identification of the most influential risk factors in a SC, and as it is based on a standard model, it fosters a collaborative analysis among its echelons. The main contributions of this paper are the risk identification by means of the KPIs of the SCOR model and the measurement of their influence levels, which is a new and useful feature for risk prioritization.</jats:p>"

Both experimental and numerical approaches were adopted in this investigation. In the experimental work, the air was passed through a PCM-incorporated aluminum air duct, and the temperature at various points of the duct was recorded. Computational fluid dynamics models of the PCM-incorporated supply air duct and the hollow-core slab were developed and validated with the respective experimental data. The validated models were used to simulate the performance of PCM-incorporated hollow-core slabs during summer in Melbourne, Australia. The results showed that the reduction in temperature fluctuation varied with the way the PCM was incorporated inside the supply air duct. The temperature difference was maximum and was maintained for a longer period when the PCM was spread to all four internal surfaces of the supply air duct. The results also showed that the effectiveness of the combined PCM–air duct–hollow-core slab system in reducing the temperature fluctuation was lower than the individual performance of the PCM–air duct and hollow-core concrete slab for a given inlet temperature condition during the simulated period. This was because the integration of PCMs in the supply air duct resulted in a precooling effect which reduced the difference between the amplitude of slab inlet temperature swing and average slab temperature. As a result, the reduction in temperature fluctuation due to the thermal mass of the hollow-core slab was 21% lower in the presence of PCMs compared to the no-PCM case.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rainwater harvesting that is good and right by the needs of household clean water is one of the problems for the people in the islands in Indonesia, especially Merbau Island which is located in the Kepulauan Meranti Regency, Riau Province. The only source of clean water that can be enjoyed easily and cheaply is rainwater. Rainfall on Merbau Island ranges between 2.000 – 4.000 mm per year which is classified as moderate. A survey of 100 randomly selected people was conducted, with a questionnaire containing components for rainwater harvesting (RWH) and other core questions. If available rainfall is used optimally, the need for clean water on the island can be met. Calculation of rainwater for cooking, drinking and washing needs is estimated to be around 15 lpcd. The data obtained is rainfall in 2016 with a total rainfall of 1,754 mm, roof storage area of 36 m2, and the type of roof used is zinc. Rain cycle V2 simulation produces a 3 m3 volume rainwater storage tank, with a construction cost of Rp. 10,365,000. This tank can meet the needs of clean water for five family members for a year.</jats:p>"

The study evaluates the impact of this mitigation strategy on the existing supply chains published by Lim and Biswas. The experience of a local palm oil mill installed with the KUBOTA biogas trapping system was incorporated into a typical 60 metric tonne per hour palm oil mill for effluent treatment. This allowed us to assess the changes in sustainability performance of the whole crude palm oil supply chain using the Palm Oil Sustainability Assessment (POSA) framework. Installing the biogas trapping system increased waste recycling and reuse percentage of the mill from 81.81% to 99.99% and the energy ratio (energy output/fossil fuel and biomass energy input) from 2.45 to 2.56; and reduced the Greenhouse Gas emission of the supply chain from 0.814 tonne CO2eq to 0.196 tonne CO2eq per tonne of Crude Palm Oil. This system could also potentially increase the mill’s annual revenue by 2.3%, while sacrificing the sustainability performance of other economic indicators (i.e., a further 3% negative deviation of actual growth rate from sustainable growth rate). Overall, sustainability score of the supply chain improved from 3.47/5 to 3.59/5 on the 5-level-Likert-scale due to environmental improvement strategy consideration. Finally, this paper shows that the POSA framework is capable of capturing changes in the sustainability performance of triple bottom line indicators associated with the use or incorporation of any improvement strategy in the crude palm oil supply chain.</jats:p>"

Multiple experiments in the Kenyan dairy sector show that: (i) farmers are willing to incur sizable costs to receive infrequent payments as a commitment device, (ii) poor contract enforcement, however, limits competition among buyers in the supply of infrequent payments. We then present a model of demand and supply of infrequent payments and test its additional predictions. (JEL K12, L66, O13, O17, Q12, Q13) </jats:p>",

So far, no research has been done on trapezoidal piano-key side weirs (TPKSWs) in a curved channel. This study examines the effect of using one or two cycles in TPKSWs on discharge capacity, having the same total width and upstream–downstream length. Dimensional analysis has been performed to determine the dimensionless parameters affecting the discharge coefficient related to the developed length (CdL) of TPKSWs in a curved channel. An empirical equation for CdL has been proposed based on the experimental results. There is a good agreement between estimated and measured data. Results showed that the discharge coefficient related to the total width of a TPKSW is 1.7 to 5.6 times higher than that of a CRSW. Also, the CdL of a one-cycle TPKSW is 1.4 to 2 times higher than that of a two-cycle TPKSW.</jats:p>",

Detailed procedures for estimating the serviceability of water supply networks using pressure dependent demand (PDD) and pressure dependent leakage (PDL) techniques were proposed. The developed methodologies can simulate many pipe leakage and breakage situations more realistically. The methodologies were applied to representative pipe networks to investigate the models and new performance quantification indicators were additionally presented. The developed models are judged to be usable as a basic tool finding for guidelines because they can simultaneously quantify the amount of leakage calculated from the viewpoint of suppliers as well as the water availability of consumers when an earthquake hazard has occurred.</jats:p>"

The major challenge met by HMCâ€™s are to attain a trade-off between the number of dc sources, switching devices and voltage levels. This paper presents the development of a modified active neutral point clamped fifteen level multi-level converter for isolated power supply electric systems. A Variable Frequency Overlapped Carrier (VFOC) modulation scheme is implemented for capacitor voltage balancing and switching loss reduction.

Such matching platforms can facilitate the creation of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) for used goods, which can enhance product reuse and limit reliance on recycling and disposal alternatives. Yet, the true environmental benefits of these internet-enabled C2C CLSCs remain to be ascertained. In this study, I use a quasi-experimental setup to examine how Craigslist’s entry into various U.S. geographic markets impacts a key environmental outcome: municipal solid waste (MSW). I assemble a data set from various disparate sources to test my hypothesis. I find that, on average, Craigslist’s entry into a geographic market results in a 2%–6% annual reduction in MSW per capita generated. I conduct a variety of robustness checks, falsification tests, and validation checks to provide support to my findings. Overall, this study provides deeper insights into the potential of online reuse platforms for the creation and coordination of C2C CLSCs. To my knowledge, this is the first study of closed-loop supply chains in a C2C context.</jats:p><jats:p>The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2963 .</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</jats:p>",

Of particular interest is the interface between telecommunications and urban water and electricity utility systems. I examine the degree to which ICT deployments for urban water and electricity supply shape and are shaped by the urban context of Nairobi, Kenya. I show how in recognition of the city’s splintering and fragmentation, service providers have employed spatial targeting, strategically deploying ‘pro-poor’ services. I argue that while framed along narratives of spatial justice, ‘pro-poor’ deployments demonstrate market-led priorities for utility providers in their desire to maximise returns on investment, expand centralised networks, increase market share, and counter competition from private and heterogeneous providers. I also show that these deployments have had to contend with micro-political dynamics and implications. Ultimately, the objective for this paper is to offer an empirical perspective on the efficacy of the urban nexus and the contested nature of the politics and spatialities of smart or ICT-led urbanism especially in the context of an African city. </jats:p>",

Second, the authors developed a conceptual framework to confront customer-driven and customer-centric approaches to supply chain management in an evolutionary perspective.

Recent technological advancements can impact TBL sustainability by changing the design, structure, and management of modern SCs. Blockchain technology enables immutable data records and facilitates a shared data view along the supply chain. The Physical Internet (PI) is an overarching framework that can be applied to create a layered and comprehensive view of the SC. In this conceptual paper, I define and combine these technologies and derive several high-level research areas and research questions (RQ) to investigate adoption and management as well as structural SC issues. I suggest a theory-based research agenda for the years to come that exploits the strengths of rigorous academic research, while remaining relevant for industry. Furthermore, I suggest various well-established theories to tackle the respective research questions and provide specific directions for future research.</jats:p>"

One of the critical points for the success of this research direction is the improvement of culture conditions, such as oxygen supply, in the engineering of bioartificial pancreatic islets to ensure their viability and functionality after transplantation. In this work, we fabricated microwell spheroid culture devices made of oxygen-permeable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), with which hypoxia in the core of bioartificial islets was alleviated and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was increased ~2.5-fold compared to a device with the same configuration but made of non-oxygen-permeable plastic. We also demonstrated that antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AA2P), could neutralize islet damage caused by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell culture environment. These results suggest that supply of oxygen together with removal of ROS may lead to a better approach to prepare highly viable and functional bioartificial pancreatic islets.</jats:p>"

Elles doivent prendre en compte les dimensions environnementales et sociales ainsi que leurs relations avec l’ensemble de leurs parties prenantes. Si les approches de la RSE ont longtemps été centrées sur l’entreprise, depuis quelques années, la multiplication des défaillances dans les supply chains, liée à la fragmentation et à la dispersion des unités de production, a progressivement conduit à revisiter les frontières de la RSE. Cet article vise à une meilleure compréhension de la diffusion de la RSE dans la supply chain, en s’intéressant, en particulier, au rôle que peut jouer la firme pivot dans ce processus. En s’appuyant de la littérature et d’entretiens avec des professionnels du secteur agroalimentaire, il s’agit de mettre en évidence l’acteur capable de piloter le réseau ainsi que les mécanismes dont il dispose afin de parvenir à une supply chain plus durable.</jats:p>",

This study utilizes survey data from 249 employees in the Jordanian banking sector and tests the research framework and hypotheses using exploratory factor analysis. The impact of supply chain internal and external integration and internal control significantly affected financial performance. The impact of the examined factors on financial performance is as follows, in decreasing order: internal integration, supplier integration, customer integration, and internal control.

There is an urgent need to better understand such digital orientations, who controls them, and how children’s agency becomes enabled and constrained. In this article, we argue that a child rights framework operates to surface the tensions and stumbling blocks at play in the ostensibly seamless circulation of children’s data through the socio-technical assemblages of corporate, government and university organisations. Smooth flows of data become problematised when we explore children’s data journeys and associated frictions with data. This demonstrates the importance of moving beyond existing attempts to better steer children and their data, towards the much more difficult role of co-curating the social, spatial and material supports required to enhance their agency in the digital age. </jats:p>",

The manufacturers may have heterogeneous valuations on the input sold by the suppliers. In such a supply chain network, a manufacturer and a supplier must have a business relationship or “link” to bargain and trade with each other. However, a firm on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the other side of the supply chain network. We show that valuation heterogeneity, supply and demand balance, and network structure are the main factors that influence the equilibrium prices, trading pattern, and surplus allocation in such a supply chain network. Valuation heterogeneity among manufacturers can mitigate unfavorable supply and demand balance to protect some surplus for the manufacturers and leads to higher price dispersion in the supply chain network. We demonstrate that bargaining effectively takes place in smaller subnetworks in a general supply chain network and develop an algorithm to decompose the general network into these smaller subnetworks, which simplifies the analysis of the general supply chain network significantly. We then identify types of supply chain networks that are efficient so that only manufacturers with the highest valuations are able to trade and types of links that can be added into a supply chain network to improve its efficiency. </jats:p>",

Understanding the genetic basis of these signaling mechanisms is key to future improvement of nutrient use efficiency. While major progress has been made in understanding N and P signaling pathways and their interaction in the model plant Arabidopsis, understanding of transcriptional responses to N and P in a major monocot crop wheat is lacking. Therefore, we investigated gene expression dynamics of wheat roots in response to N and/or P provision using RNA-Seq. We found that nitrate presence is the major trigger for most of the transcriptional response to occur within 24 h, however, we also identified a large array of synergistic transcriptional responses to concomitant supply of N and P. Through gene co-expression analysis, we identified gene co-expression modules prominent in nitrate signaling and metabolism in wheat. Importantly, we identified likely instances of functional divergence in major N-responsive transcription factors families<jats:italic>HRS1/HHO</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>TGA</jats:italic>of wheat from their rice/Arabidopsis homologues. Our work broadens the understanding of wheat N and P transcriptional responses and aids in prioritizing gene candidates for production of wheat varieties that are efficient in nitrogen usage.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to summarize and disseminate the main developments and scientific contributions coming from the project. In particular, the working core of the SYNCHRO-NET solution is an integrated and cloud-based eco-system of optimization and simulation software modules that supports stakeholders’ decisions in freight transportation and logistics management at strategic, operational, and real-time levels. The platform has achieved a high grade of automation in several processes to overcome all the issues related to human-based operations. The efficiency and effectiveness of the overall platform have been tested on three case studies considering pan-European and regional trade lanes, as well as commercial activities between the Far East and European ports.

Although nowadays there are computer-based asset information management systems, the problem is that such a system cannot immediately monitor the status of the asset. There is some information that is not related to reality, including a lack of asset movement records and information as to the status of each asset, which could lead to the mistake in terms of the working process which is unable to control and monitor a situation. Therefore, this re-search applied the concept of supply chain management (SCM) and IoT tech-nology in order to unsure good governance on the part of HEIs. This research is focused on durable articles and the use of a Near Field Communication (NFC) tag to communicate and exchange information with NFC-compatible smartphones. In this case, it can identify and monitor the asset under considera-tion and also assess associated information from any device. This solution can increase efficiency and value in terms of the organization. Moreover, the design diagram of the system leads to the development of asset supply chain manage-ment system (ASCMS)-based IoT technology for HEIs. The evaluation of the performance of this technology shows that the system operates at a great level, and that ASCMS-based IoT technology for HEIs it can be applied to ensure the good governance of such institutions. In addition, this research can serve the in-ternal organizational administration of Thai HEIs, involving dealing with working processes in line with real-life situations, relating to budget management, organizational working behaviors, and service users’ requirements.  All of these aspects are analyzed based on good governance, including the rules of law, transparency and values.</jats:p>"

This is especially true in the evolving field of supply chain management (SCM). The purpose of this qualitative study was to assess the effectiveness of the SCM Applied Learning Center (referred to as the “Center”) at a Midwestern university in the United States by understanding its perceived value through its stakeholders—that is, participating companies and students. This understanding was achieved by interviewing stakeholders who used the Center during its initial 18-month rollout period. The data analysis from this study resulted in the emergence of the following themes: (1) developing transferable skills, (2) accelerating applied learning, (3) cultivating personal relationships, and (4) supporting business improvement. The establishment of the Center and the corresponding results from this study contribute to the literature associated with university–industry collaboration, SCM education, and the evolving role of higher education. This work provides a template to programs interested in improving their working relationship with business partners through the implementation of comparable industry collaboration activities, while at the same time providing skill improvement opportunities for their students. </jats:p>",

This paper focuses on two towns – Mussoorie and Devprayag in the western IHR – to understand various aspects of the growing water scarcity and urban water management. In the current scenario of a changing climate, natural springs, their main water resource, are drying up. Mussoorie experiences an acute shortage of water in summer, precisely when the town hosts numerous tourists. In Devprayag, religious tourism and in-migration from rural areas contribute to rising demand. The reduced discharge in nearby streams has widened the demand–supply gap. An integrated management of water sources is crucial to solving water problems in Mussoorie and Devprayag. In both towns, little effort has been made towards recharging existing water sources. Detailed planning of the water supply system while being mindful of the floating population, a proper sewage and storm water management system, and rainwater harvesting schemes, are absent. There is an urgent need to adopt a comprehensive approach to solving urban water issues, covering aspects of demand, supply and water resources management in these hill towns for adaptive water management.</jats:p>",

The objective of the paper is to assess the current access to and the perceived water quality in villages with various types of water supply. The survey was carried out during July–December 2017 in four villages in central Kazakhstan. Overall, 1369 randomly selected households were interviewed. The results revealed that even though villagers were provided with tap water, significant numbers used alternative sources. There were three reasons for this situation: residents’ doubts regarding the tap water quality; use of other sources out of habit; and availability of cheaper or free sources. Another problem concerned the volume of water consumption, which dropped sharply with decreased quality or inconvenience of sources used by households. Moreover, people gave a poor estimate to the quality and reliability of water from wells, open sources and tankered water. The paper suggests that as well decentralization of water management as monitoring of both water supply and water use are essential measures. There must be a tailor-made approach to each village for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of providing rural Kazakhstan with safe water.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, the impacts of MWT were examined in terms of leaf area, special leaf area, and some of the physiographic indicators such as relative water capacity and foliar chlorophyll content in three species endemic to arid environments, namely Nitraria, Haloxylon, and Atriplex. In addition to the factors mentioned, acidity (pH) and electrical conductivity (EC) were also measured. This research was conducted in a completely randomized block design with three replications. Data analysis was carried out via the analysis of variance using MSTAT software. The results showed that species irrigated with magnetized water had better performance on measured growth indices. On average, the amount of increase for morphology and physiology parameters in the three species irrigated by MW (comparing with those irrigated by normal water) were: leaf development by 121.74 (19.59%), leaf area index (LAI) by 108.97 (17.5%) mm2, special leaf area (SAL) by 8.68%, relative water content (RWC) by 9.81%, and special product analysis division (SPAD) by 14.77%. The water magnetization process also reduced pH by 0.5 and EC by 0.3 μmhos.cm−1.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes using the equivalent model function blocks, as built by MATLAB/Simulink, for simulations of the probable line‐to‐line and single line‐to‐ground faults in a distribution system when the power supply mode is switched from ‘normal’ to ‘same‐phase’. The simulation results prove that, when the power supply is switched to the ‘same‐phase’ power supply mode, all the short‐circuit fault currents are a little lower than that in the ‘normal’ power supply mode, and the maximum difference is less than 3%. Therefore, when the supplying power of the system is in shortage or the power distribution system has a short‐circuit fault between phase lines, the system can be directly switched to the ‘same‐phase’ power supply mode and can continue supplying power to the essential and basic loads for life‐support and people's livelihoods. © 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The research methodology is to conduct a critical analysis of existing scientific approaches to the assessment of value added; substantiate components of net value added; develop a structural scheme of methodological provisions in the duality of conceptual and methodological bases; substantiate a four-level system of estimating indicators using the net value added indicator; determine the possibilities and advantages of author’s methodological provisions. Results. The authors prove the expediency of using the net value added indicator to assess the efficiency of both production and supply chains, as well as producers and their cooperative formations that are non-profit organizations. The components of net value added, which include wages, profit, and specific expenses of business entities in terms of the parts of the production and supply chain, are substantiated. The authors proposed a structural scheme of methodological provisions that united the conceptual and methodological bases, defined the main principles of evaluation: objectivity and accuracy, systemacity and complexity, efficiency, purposefulness, the priority of economic interests of the state (macrolevel). A four-level system of indicators is developed for estimating volumes and dynamics of net value added, reproductive product profitability, the structure of net value added, the efficiency of material and labour resources use. Practical implications. Methodological provisions can be used by commodity producers and their associations to assess the efficiency of operation in the production and supply chain, justifying the feasibility of establishing a cooperative in the region. Also, the results of the analysis can be used by the state authorities during the definition of “gaps” in the chain and the justification of methods of selective regulation for its balanced development. Value/originality. Methodological provisions developed by the authors form the analytical foundation for making managerial decisions both at the micro level (producers, cooperatives) and meso and macro levels (regional and state authorities).</jats:p>"

Competition for farmland use became an obstacle in producing biofuel since food products would be destined for energy rather than for human or animals. Nowadays, governments lay down regulations to encourage producing nonfood biomass which brought them huge costs. In this article, the long‐term behavior of parties is analyzed in a three player supply chain including farmers, biorefineries, and governments. The dynamic behavior of parties is modeled by using evolutionary game theory and the stable strategy of each party is derived by solving replicator dynamic equations. Finally, a numerical study is presented based on a real case in Iran to give a better understanding of the features of the game model. Sensitivity analyses on some key parameters such as price and governments' penalties leads to interesting managerial insights into long‐term strategies in the proposed supply chain. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13122, 2019</jats:p>",

However, such trade can also cause social, environmental and economic impacts beyond the limits of the countries directly involved in the exchange. Agricultural systems are telecoupled because the impacts caused by trade can generate important feedback loops, spillovers, rebound effects, time lags and non-linearities across multiple geographical and temporal scales that make these impacts more difficult to identify and mitigate. We make a comparative review of current impact assessment methods to analyze their suitability to assess the impacts of telecoupled agricultural supply chains. Given the large impacts caused by agricultural production on land systems, we focus on the capacity of methods to account for and spatially allocate direct and indirect land use change. Our analysis identifies trade-offs between methods with respect to the elements of the telecoupled system they address. Hybrid methods are a promising field to navigate these trade-offs. Knowledge gaps in assessing indirect land use change should be overcome in order to improve the accuracy of assessments.</jats:p>"

However, they often fail to comprehensively address the needs and interests of various supply-chain participants. While voluntary in nature, MSIs have most often been implemented through coercive approaches, resulting in friction among their participants and in systemic problems with decoupling. Additionally, in those cases in which deliberation was constrained between and amongst participants, collaborative approaches have often failed to materialize. Our framework focuses on two key aspects of these breakdowns: assumptions about the orientation of MSI participants, and the deliberation processes that participants use to engage with each other to create these initiatives and sustain them over time. Drawing from stakeholder and deliberation theories, we revisit the concept of MSIs and show how their deliberative capacity may be enhanced in order to encourage participants to collaborate voluntarily.</jats:p>",

Unquestionably, access to energy is a key component of achieving this goal. Having an adequate, reliable, affordable, environmentally-cleaner and uninterrupted supply of energy is crucial. Despite the calls to immediately cease using fossil fuels, hydrocarbon resources are essential to support the global economy. We cannot achieve a sustainable world in the long term without access to oil and gas. Currently, more than 50% of world energy demand is met by oil and gas. The difficult and yet-to-be-answered questions in the energy industry are the timing of oil and gas depletion and the energy mix afterward.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Will oil remain as the primary source of energy at the end of this century, especially in the transportation sector which currently consumes from 75 to 80% of the oil produced? Will gas remain as a primary source of energy for power generation and petrochemicals by the end of this century? Even with renewable energy growing by 400% or more, when will there be enough of these sources to replace oil and gas? Will they be practical for transportation? No one disagrees that oil and gas are depletable energy sources, and that we must find other sources of energy to replace them if mankind’s lifestyle on Earth is to be maintained or improved for hundreds, or I may say, thousands of years to come. However, knowing precisely when this will happen is quite challenging.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The oil and gas industry long ago embraced the challenge of finding and producing enough resources to meet growing world demand. Replacing what is produced each year isn’t enough; as demand grows, production capacity must grow, which means discovering more resources. We’ve met that challenge. How? By making enormous investments in research and development (R&amp;D).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There is absolutely no doubt that the last few decades’ R&amp;D efforts have reduced uncertainties on the exploration side and have increased recovery efficiency. Thanks to newly developed technologies, fields that were not economically feasible before are now being developed. We’ve learned how to economically and safely produce tight and unconventional resources, and those in hostile environments. All of this has resulted in significant reserves addition and recovery increases.</jats:p>",

Describe the tools used by the authors for experimental research on the possibilities of using renewable energy sources in the power supply systems of non-traction consumers of railway transport. The methodology of research is based on modern methods of computational mathematics, statistics and information analysis using modern computer technology. Findings. To date, there is no comprehensive approach and specific reasonable measures for the introduction of re-newable energy sources in the energy supply of non-traction consumers. The article presents examples of the introduction of renewable energy sources in the power supply systems of railways abroad. It is noted that when using different renewable energy sources in the power supply systems of non-traction consumers, it is necessary to have a volume of statistical information to determine their technical and economic indicators. The classification of wind power plants with a horizontal axis is given. The schematic diagram and general view of the developed experimental wind power plant are given. The schematic diagram and general view of the developed experimental photovoltaic plant are given. The equipment used for research of wind flow and intensity of solar radiation in places of possible location of wind power or photovoltaic installations is considered. The presented experimental wind power and photovoltaic plants, which serve for a comprehensive study of the possibilities of using wind and solar sources in the power supply systems of non-traction consumers, are generalized and allow to clarify the necessary data for decision making. The originality is the introduction of renewable energy sources in the power supply system of non-traction consumers of railway transport. Practical implications. The use of additional renewable energy sources to supply non-traction consumers minimizes electricity consumption.

Its constraints have a great impact on the carbon emission reduction decisions and production operations of supply chain enterprises, as well as profit distribution. In the construction supply chain, there are few studies on the profit distribution and emission reduction decisions considering cap-and-trade policy. This paper investigates the profit distribution model of a two-echelon construction supply chain consisting of a general contractor and a subcontractor with cap-and-trade policy. Using game theory and Shapley value method, the optimal emission reduction decisions and profit distribution under three cooperation modes of pure competition, co-opetition, and pure cooperation are obtained, respectively. The research shows that the profits of the construction supply chain are increasing in pure competition, co-opetition, and pure cooperation scenarios, and the emission reduction amount of the construction supply chain in the case of pure cooperation is greater than that of pure competition and co-opetition. The carbon emission reduction amount under the co-opetition scenario is not always greater than that under the pure competition scenario, which depends on the emission reduction cost coefficient relationship of general contractor and subcontractor. When the cost coefficient of emission reduction of the general contractor is less than that of the subcontractor, the emission reduction amount under pure competition is larger than that under co-opetition. A numerical study is carried out to verify the conclusions and illustrated the profits of the supply chain decreased with the increase of carbon emission reduction cost coefficient, and had nothing to do with the emission reduction efficiency of enterprises.</jats:p>"

One research questions were answered lso one hypothesis were formulated. A descriptive survey research design was used for this study. The population for the study comprised all staff of recreational centres in Kaduna State, with a population of 3,249. Multistage sampling technique was used to select the sample for the study. Researcher developed questionnaire was used as the instrument for data collection and it was validated by 3 experts from the Department of Physical and Health Education, Faculty of Education, Bayero University, Kano. A pilot study was conducted and a reliability index of 0.87 was obtained. Out of 441 copies of questionnaire administered by the researcher and his assistants, 432 copies were duly completed, returned and analyzed. Frequency count and percentage were used to describe the demographic information of the respondents while Chi-square (χ2) statistics was used to test all the formulated hypotheses at the 0.05 alpha level of significant. The findings of this study revealed that power supply significantly influence the patronage of recreational centres in Kaduna state c2=184.08, df=1, P&lt;0.05. It was recommended among others, that more roads should be constructed within the recreational centres in Kaduna state, as this will go a long way in increasing the numbers of patronage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Meticulous field observations are a common underpinning of two landmark studies conducted by Don Swanson dealing with the rate at which magma is supplied to Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i. The first combined effusion rate and ground deformation observations to show that the supply rate to Kīlauea was constant at ~0.11 km3/yr during three sustained eruptions from 1952 to 1971, a quiescent period at neighboring Mauna Loa volcano. This rate was also interpreted as the steady supply rate from the mantle to both volcanoes combined throughout historical time. The second breakthrough involved field evidence that activity at Kīlauea alternates between dominantly effusive and explosive styles over time scales of several centuries, and that the magma supply rate during explosive periods is only 1%–2% of the rate during effusive periods. For the historical period, several later studies concluded that the supply rate to Kīlauea has varied by as much as an order of magnitude, contrary to Swanson’s earlier suggestion. All such estimates are fraught with uncertainty, given the poorly known amount of magma stored within the volcano’s rift zones as a function of time—an enduring problem and active research topic. Nonetheless, Swanson’s original work remains an important touchstone that spurred many subsequent investigations and refinements. For example, there is strong evidence that Kīlauea experienced a surge in magma supply during 2003–2007 that exceeded the historical average by as much as a factor of two, and that the surge was followed by a comparable lull before the supply rate returned to “normal” by 2016. There is also evidence for supply-rate variations of similar magnitude during the latter part of the twentieth century and possibly earlier, subject to the aforementioned uncertainty in rift-zone storage. The extent to which variations in the magma supply to Kīlauea can be attributed to partitioning between Kīlauea and Mauna Loa, a long-debated topic, remains uncertain. Since Kīlauea’s inception, the net magma supply to the volcano (and also to Lō‘ihi Seamount, since it began growing) has increased, while Mauna Loa’s growth rate has slowed, suggesting that the volcanoes compete for the same magma supply. However, geochemical differences between lavas erupted at Kīlauea and Mauna Loa indicate that they do not share a homogeneous mantle source or common lithospheric magma plumbing system. Both ideas might be correct; i.e., Kīlauea and Mauna Loa magmas may be sourced in differing portions of the same melt accumulation zone and ascend through different crustal pathways, but those pathways interact through stress or pressure changes that modulate the supply to each volcano. Currently, magma supply-rate estimates are facilitated by comprehensive imaging of surface deformation and topographic change coupled with measurements of gas emissions. Physics-based models are being developed within a probabilistic framework to provide rigorous estimates of model parameters, including magma supply rate, and their uncertainties. Further refinement will require intensive multiparameter observations of the entire magmatic system—from source to surface and above, and from the volcanoes’ summits to their submerged lower flanks—in order to account fully for a complex magma budget.</jats:p>",

The market is run in every period, and all firms submit their price-contingent production schedules in every day-ahead market. Following the clearance of a day-ahead market, in the next period, each (renewable) firm chooses its production quantity (after observing its available supply). If a firm produces less than its cleared day-ahead commitment, the firm pays an undersupply penalty in proportion to its underproduction. We explicitly characterize firms’ equilibrium strategies by introducing and analyzing a supply function competition model. The purpose of an undersupply penalty is to improve reliability by motivating each firm to commit to quantities it can produce in the following day. We prove that in equilibrium, imposing or increasing a market-based undersupply penalty rate in a period can result in a strictly larger renewable energy commitment at all prices in the associated day-ahead market, and can lead to lower equilibrium reliability in all periods with probability 1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Marine supply of sand can control the development and morphology of coastal dunes. However, processes that control the sediment transfer between sub-tidal and the supra-tidal zone are not fully understood, especially in coastal settings such as sand-flats close to inlets. It is hypothesised that storm surge events induce sediment deposition on sand-flats, so that this may influence dune development significantly. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify which processes causes deposition on the sand-flat during storm-surge conditions and discuss the relation between the supra-tidal deposition and sediment supply to the dunes. We use the island of Texel as a case study, on which multi-annual topographic and hydrographic data sets are available. Additionally, we use the numerical model XBeach to simulate the most frequent storm surge events for the area. Results show that a supra-tidal shore-parallel deposition of sand occurs in both the numerical model and the data. The amount of sand deposition is directly proportional to surge level, and can account for more than half of the volume deposited at the dunes on a yearly basis. Furthermore, storms are also capable of remobilising the top layer of sediment of the sand-flat, making fresh sediment available for aeolian transport. Therefore, in a sand-flat setting, storm surges have the potential of adding significant amounts of sand for aeolian transport in periods after the storm, suggesting that storms play a significant role in the onshore sand supply between sub-tidal and subaerial zones in those areas.\n                        </jats:p>"

This study investigated access to potable water among physically challenged people in three homes for the disabled in Ibadan. Sixty-four physically challenged persons living at the Cheshire Home (CH), Sekinat Adekola (SAC) and Lawal Centre (LC) were surveyed. Quantity of Drinking Water (QDW) received daily was compared to the WHO minimum requirement of 2.5 litres/head/day. Drinking water samples were analysed for total coliform (TCC) and Escherichia coli counts (ECC). Respondents' ages were 22.4 ± 5.1 years in CH, 23.6 ± 7.4 years in SAC and 13.8 ± 5.6 years in LC. The QDW received was 5.3 ± 1.5 litres/head/day in CH, 4.5 ± 0.5 litres/head/day in SAC and 2.8 ± 0.8 litres/head/day in LC. Thirty-seven percent in CH, 55.0% in SAC and 22.0% in LC were very satisfied with QDW received. CH water had lower TCC (2.0 ± 0.6 cfu/100 mL) compared to SAC (378 ± 169.3 cfu/100 mL) and LC (357.3 ± 174.3 cfu/100 mL). Only LC water showed an ECC of 1.0 ± 0.4 cfu/100 mL. Not all individuals experienced adequate access within the homes. Water quality was poor across the homes and treatment was inadequate. Constant potable water is required for the well-being of disabled people in these homes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article has been made Open Access thanks to the generous support of a global network of libraries as part of the Knowledge Unlatched Select initiative.</jats:p>",

In our empirical study we survey in-store logistics processes in 52 supermarkets belonging to a major retail chain in central South East of Vietnam. Using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) and simulation, we facilitate process benchmarking. We also identify ways of improving in-store logistics processes by showing the performance impacts of different managerial strategies and tactics. The DEA results indicate different efficiency levels for different store formats; the hybrid store format of the small supermarket exhibits a comparatively worse performance in the analyzed execution of in-store logisticsprocesses. The strategic and tactical design of in-store logistics processes (such as store locations/layouts, capacity management, reorder time, order period and safety stock factors) lead to substantial service performance improvements (such as higher on-shelf availability combined with reduced inventory obsolescence costs) will be detected from the process simulation analysis.

The system of around 170 notifications, through which states are obliged to provide to the WTO relevant information on their policies, constitutes a key mechanism of transparency in the global trade regime. Based on data for the one-time and regular obligations from the years 1995–2014, we seek to map and explain the variation in the degree to which states comply with these obligations. Descriptively, we identify enormous differences in the compliance values of states, ranging from compliance well above 80% to below 20%. To explain those differences, we test five theoretical explanations that concentrate on the trade policy preferences of states and on their institutional characteristics. The empirical findings support four of the tested explanations. In particular, they highlight the relevance of states’ administrative capacities and membership in international organizations (IOs). In addition, the empirical analysis shows that compliance levels are strongly positively connected with the economic size of the members.</jats:p>",

With the aim of analyzing researches from national and international publications, the following keywords were used: sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and green supply chain management (GSCM). National and international papers were considered for this study within the period from 2013 to 2018. This time cut was essential because of the need to focus attention on recent and current publications. The practices were stratified according to the four pillars that underpin the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.

Modelling of supply chain of ready‐made garments in Bangladesh is a challenge in our socio‐economic conditions because supply chain of garments is constrained by the availability of raw material, cotton, yarn, fabrics, and transportation facility. This research presents a system dynamics model of supply chain of garments in Bangladesh that is structured with inventory adjustment and demand driven to provide the right quantity at the right time at the right place. Verbal description, causal loop diagram, and stock flow diagram are hypothesized to generate the observed behaviour of ready‐made garments. Sensitivity analysis and stability of the model have also been addressed. Also, the model has been simulated to address the issue of the raw materials price instability and the policy issue of local supply of all the fabrics as well as local supply of all the fabrics with no transportation delay.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The study was performed on wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa) wich is a wild ancestor of the domestic pig and is not part of Brazilian fauna. The arterial blood supply of the encephalus has been studied  by some researchers, who have systematized the cerebral blood supply from the rostral and caudal epidural rete mirabile and its sources in wild boar until the blood supply of the base of the brain. The objective was to improve the understanding of the arterial blood supply of the brain, particularly the paleopallium, of the wild boar and to provide a reference for comparative anatomy studies.  Materials, Methods &amp; Results: A total of 30 brains were obtained from an officially authorised slaughterhouse and approved by Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Renowable Resources. The animals were desensitized, followed by bleending of the jugular veins and common carotid arteries near the entrance of the thorax, according to the slaughter procedure. Finally, the animals were decapitated at the level of axis vertebra. The cerebral arterial system of each animal was rinsed (cooled saline containing 2500 IU of heparin) and drained by the jugular veins, and vessels were filled with latex 603 stained with specific red dye. The heads were submerged for one hour in running water immersed in 20% formaldehyde for fixation; the brains were removed along with a cervical segment of the spinal cord. The duramater was removed, and the arteries were dissected. Schematic drawings of the ventral view of the all preparations were made using magnifying glasses and photographic records. The Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria was used to named the cerebral arteries and their branches, and calculation of pecentages was applied in the statistical analysis. The cerebral carotid artery originating from the rostral epidural rete mirabile emitted a rostral branch and a caudal branch on the side of the hypophysis gland. The rostral branch emitted one to three middle cerebral arteries and continued as rostral cerebral artery. The latter emitted the superficial and perforating central arteries, lateral rhinal artery, ethmoidal artery, medial branch and medial rhinal artery. Discussion: Wild boar is a macrosmatic animal, it presents well-developed areas of the paleopallium that are exclusively olfactory. Its extensive paleopallium was nourished by branches of the rostral cerebral artery and its collateral branches, including the lateral rhinal, ethmoidal, and medial branch and the medial rhinal artery. The rostral cerebral arteries and their collateral branches supplied blood to the olfactory bulb, olfactory peduncle, two-thirds of the lateral olfactory tract, medial olfactory tract, and rostral two-thirds of the olfactory trigone. The medial cerebral arteries within the lateral fossa of the brain, emitted superficial rostral central branches to the paleopallium, perforating central branches (striated) to the lateral fossa of the brain and caudal third of the olfactory trigone and caudal central branches to the piriform lobe. The rostral most two-thirds of a small medial band of the piriform lobe was vascularised by central branches originating mainly from the rostral branch of the cerebral cartotid artery. The paleopallium in the wild boar was nourished by branches of the cerebral rostral, middle and caudal arteries and by the central branches of the cerebral carotid artery. The arterial blood supply of the paleopallium in the wild boar was compared to the chinchilla, nutria, rabbit and pampas fox. Three cerebral vessels were mainly responsable for the emission of the central branches that supplied blood to the paleopallium, namely the middle, rostral, and caudal cerebral arteries. The differences or variations among these species were due to the type of cerebral blood supply in the formation of the cerebral arterial circle.Keywords : anatomy, brain, paleopallia, arteries, Artiodactila, wild boar.</jats:p>"

Tritium will be generated in nuclear reactions in a lithium-containing material under the influence of neutron irradiation. However, nowadays a limited number of studies have been conducted with the eutectic of such a composition (with a lithium content of 15.7%) and consequently, there is a lack of data on mechanisms of tritium generation and release from Pb15.7Li. In this regard, there is an urgent necessity for research of tritium generation and release from Pb15.7 Li directly under neutron irradiation conditions. For these studies a differential method will be used, which consists in follows: a controlled flux of spectrally pure deuterium will be continuously fed into the experimental cell with the eutectic sample during the reactor experiment. The regulated flux of deuterium will be fed to the experimental cell with the Pb15.7Li sample using diffusion palladium-silver filter. The article describes the process of determination of deuterium flux supply modes into the experimental cell. The temperature dependences of deuterium penetration through diffusion palladium-silver filter are presented. The coefficients of diffusion, solubility and permeability of deuterium through a palladium-silver filter are estimated and the activation energies of these processes as well as the Arrhenius dependence are presented.</jats:p>"

The control objective is to improve the net power output through adjusting the oxygen excess ratio within a reasonable range. In view of the problem that the PEMFC air supply system is difficult to achieve accurate modeling and stable control, a robust adaptive controller is proposed by utilizing exact linearization and radical basis function (RBF) neural network (RBFNN) system. This controller does not need the complete structure and parameters of PEMFC system. The unmodeled dynamics of PEMFC system can be approximated by RBFNN in which the adaptive learning law can be derived based on Lyapunov theory, and the external disturbance as well as the approximation error of RBFNN can be attenuated through robust control. The stability analysis shows that the system tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of controller are validated by hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>For the baking quality of wheat flours, the composition and concentration of grain protein are crucial. It is common practice to use late nitrogen (N) application to increase grain protein concentration (GPC) and hence, improve baking quality. However, the use of N fertilizer—particularly shortly before harvest—involves environmental risks. With the suitability of GPC as a parameter for baking quality predictions being more and more questioned, there are further investigations needed considering not only the GPC but also the composition of grain protein. Gluten protein composition varies depending on genotype and environmental factors, such as weather conditions and fertilization rate. To examine whether the effect of a split N application varies under different amounts of total N supply, this study investigates the effects of split nitrogen application on grain protein concentration and composition of wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L. cv. JB Asano) at four different N fertilization levels (0.8; 1.0; 1.2, and 1.4 g N pot<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in a pot experiment. The GPC was affected by both, N fertilization level and split N application. In this experiment, the minimum GPC of 13%, which is required for class A wheat varieties, was only achieved when N supply was moderate (at least 1.2 g N per pot). Considering the storage protein composition, the split N application influenced the proportion of α‐/β‐gliadins and γ‐gliadins, the alterations being inconsistent. The ratio of high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits was increased by the split N application only at the lowest N fertilization level. It is concluded that splitting N fertilization into three doses and hence applying one dose of N late in the season can still be a useful approach to improve GPC as well as protein composition – especially when the total N supply is low.</jats:p>",

Challenges of using cellulosic feedstocks include the variability of feedstock quality (e.g., ash content and moisture content), which impacts the final cost of the manufactured product. Statistical Process Control (SPC), Taguchi Loss Function, and components of variance techniques were illustrated for quantifying cumulative variance in the biomass supply chain. Costs in the presence of cumulative variance were estimated for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and loblolly pine residues (Pinus taeda L.). Findings of the study indicated that additional costs from ash content variability in switchgrass increased the net cost by $19.15 per dry tonne. Additional costs from densification due to particle size variation increased net cost by $11.59 per dry tonne. Moisture content variation increased costs by $14.86 per dry tonne. This would represent a 50 to 100% increase in costs due to variation based on a $60 to $70 per dry tonne manufactured product cost. This study illustrates that total costs may be considerably underestimated if the influence of variance for key factors in the supply chain and associated costs are not estimated.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we present a closed-loop supply chain design with financial management problem, which is tackled as a stochastic programming model with ambiguity demand set. The main contributions of this work include: (i) A joint chance constrained programming model is proposed to maximize the total profit, and (ii) financial flow and uncertain demand are both taken into consideration. According to the characteristic of the problem, we chose four approaches, namely sample average approximation (SAA), enhanced sample average approximation (ESAA), Markov approximation (MA), and mixed integer second-order conic program (MI-SOCP). Computational experiments were conducted to compare the adopted methods, and 10,000 scenarios were generated to examine the reliability of the methods. Numerical results revealed that the Markov approximation approach can achieve more reliable solutions.</jats:p>"

Developing blood vessels were present in the jaw mesenchyme including the presumptive dental mesenchyme before the appearance of the epithelial dental placode and dental neurites. Similarly, formation of a blood vessel plexus around the bud stage tooth germ and ingrowth of vessels into dental papilla at E14 preceded ingrowth of neurites. Subsequently, pioneer blood vessels in the dental papilla started to receive smooth muscle coverage at the early embryonic bell stage. Establishment and patterning of the blood vessels and nerves during tooth formation are developmentally regulated, stepwise processes that likely involve differential patterning mechanisms. Development of tooth vascular supply is proposed to be regulated by local, tooth‐specific regulation by epithelial–mesenchymal tissue interactions and involving tooth target expressed <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">VEGF</jats:styled-content> signaling. Further investigations on tooth vascular development by local <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">VEGF</jats:styled-content> signaling, as well as how tooth innervation and development of blood vessels are integrated with advancing tooth organ formation by local signaling mechanisms, are warranted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is confronted with a severe freshwater crisis shaped by excess water demand and intermittent public supply. In Jordan’s capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35–45% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption. The outcome of this analysis could be relevant for policy attempting to enhance freshwater sustainability in Jordan.</jats:p>"

In order to balance the relationship between water supply and water environment requirements, the nexus of water supply-water environment capacity should be well understood. Based on the Saint–Venant system of equations and the convection diffusion equation, the water supply-water environment capacity nexus physical equation is determined. Equivalent reliability is employed to estimate the boundary design water flow, which will then lead to a dynamic nexus. The framework for determining the nexus was then applied to a case study for the Pearl River Delta in China. The results indicate that the water supply-water environment capacity nexus is a declining linear relationship, which is different from the non-salt intrusion and tide-impacted areas. Water supply mainly relies on freshwater flow from upstream, while water environmental capacity is affected by both the design freshwater flow and the water levels at the downstream boundary. Our methods provide a useful framework for the quantification of the physical nexus according to the water quantity and water quality mechanisms, which are useful for freshwater allocation and management in a saltwater intrusion area or the tail area of cascade reservoirs.</jats:p>"

With the gradual development of a transportation industry from quantitative expansion to structural optimization, and transformation of various transportation modes from independent operation to integrated development, traditional comprehensive transport planning theories and methods have not adapted. In thispaper, a new planning concept is proposed from the perspective of economic equilibrium with theaim ofoptimizing a supply structure for a comprehensive transport passenger transportation corridor. An in-depth analysis was conducted of the internal mechanism of the dynamic equilibrium between supply and demand of this corridor,wherein the maximum of the globaltransportation demand subjectcustomer surplus wastaken as a target function, respective interest functions of a demand subject and a supply subject served as constraints to quantitatively optimize the supply structure of the passenger transportation corridor in comprehensive transport, and a Gradient Descent algorithmwasdesigned. The results show that the proposed model better reflectstheeconomic operation mechanism of a passenger transportation market in a comprehensive transport corridor (CTC), and prove that the supply structure of CTC is closely related to passenger flow, travel value distribution, a supply subject's scale rate of return,and travel time. These research results have important academic values in terms of improving passenger transportation corridor structure optimization in region-specific comprehensive transport that conforms to a market economy mechanism. This concept can be extended from single corridor planning to point-to-point and door-to-door transportation supply structure planning, andto comprehensive transport network planning and urban transportation planning without loss of generality.</jats:p>"

In particular, incentive structures of various players in the healthcare field involved in HTA implementation are considered for both the inpatient and outpatient sectors. Taking into account that the Joint Federal Committee (G-BA) has different authority between sectors (\"ban reservation” for inpatients and “authorization right” for outpatients), we focus on the repercussions on reimbursement for new diagnosis or treatment methods by statutory health insurance companies.</jats:p><jats:p>\n            Results The G-BA’s authority implicitly creates a paradox in terms of incentives to implement and finance HTAs: in the outpatient sector HTAs are considered necessary to evaluate new medical services while players may not have sufficient incentive to implement and finance HTAs in the inpatient sector.</jats:p><jats:p>\n            Conclusion Characteristics of HTAs differ widely with respect to the items to be assessed. Therefore, an HTA for drug effectiveness is not easily transferable to radiological procedures. Within radiology, each method must be assessed individually (e. g. according to tumor stage). Despite these challenges, systematic compilation and critical assessment (regarding both cost and medical effectiveness) of available evidence should be a basic component of evidence-based radiology. As companies in healthcare fail to invest in studies that advance evidence-based radiology and considering the lack of incentive for such investments, public funding institutions need to accept the challenge to support studies that assess the benefit of radiological procedures.</jats:p><jats:p>\n            Key Points:\n          </jats:p><jats:p>\n            Citation Format\n          </jats:p>",

A trial in a peri-urban set-up with a low-cost decentralized wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) was carried out in the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons to assess the effect of irrigation water reuse management techniques on the yield and water productivity of rice. It was hypothesized that anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) irrigation water management does not have an effect on the yield of peri-urban grown rice. The impacts of irrigation water management techniques were very significant (P &amp;lt; 0.001) on the number of irrigation events, amount of irrigation and daily water balance. The impact was not significant (P &amp;gt; 0.05) on the tiller numbers per plant; it was however significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) on the panicle numbers per plant. The effects were not significant (P &amp;gt; 0.05) on the plant height but significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) on the yield rice for both trials. The effect was also significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) on water productivity. The result proved that the hypothesis be rejected. It could be concluded that significant potential exists for applying wastewater reuse for non-drinking applications such as irrigation.</jats:p>",

The connecting trains are an important and even unique chance for orders to reach their final destinations, and earliness and tardiness penalties in the connection and delivery process are closely related to the symmetry and harmony between production procedure decision and train-allocated choice. A scenario analysis method is adopted to reveal the relationships between production collection connecting time (PCCT) and production collection waiting time (PCWT) in the production process. In the delivery process, the relationships between production delivery connecting time (PDCT) and production delivery waiting time (PDWT) are mainly considered. An integrated scheduling coordination model is established to maximize the production connecting time (PCT) and production delivery time (PDT). The GA genetic algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The numerical results show that the coordinated schedule in our method can significantly reduce the number of missed connections when compared with considering delivery timeliness only through a delivery time window. Additionally, it is revealed that the quantitative performances of the delivery timeliness improved by the connecting quality (PCT) are much better than those from the view of the delivery time window (PDT).</jats:p>"

We hypothesized that K supplies may enhance antagonistic ammonium stress while improving nitrate nutrition function, which wheat seedlings were grown in sand culture in the presence of two N forms (ammonium; nitrate) supplied at two rates (2, 10 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and three K levels (0.5, 5, 15 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). We found that a high N rate increased plant biomass under nitrate nutrition, while it had a negative effect under ammonium nutrition. Compared with nitrate, biomass was depressed by 54% or 85% for low or high N rate under ammonium. This resulted in a reduction in gas exchange parameters and a subsequent decrease in growth variables and nutrient uptake, whereas these parameters increased significantly with increasing K levels. Moreover, in principal components analysis, these variations were highly clustered under nitrate nutrition and highly separated under ammonium nutrition. Our study shows a clear positive interaction between K and N, suggesting that high K supply relieves ammonium stress while improving growth vigor under nitrate nutrition by enhancing nutrient uptake and assimilate production in wheat plants.</jats:p>"

To combat hospital acquired infections, hospitals need an effective method of disinfection and sterilization which can be taken care by the central sterile supply department (CSSD). The objective of establishing a CSSD is to make reliably sterilized articles available at the required time and place. Aim and objectives were to study the organization and workflow management of CSSD of a tertiary care institution.Methods: This observational study was carried out from February 2018 to April 2018. An observation checklist was used for the purpose of study after obtaining permission from appropriate authorities.Results: CSSD of the institution is centrally located within the hospital premises and has 11 staff members. Linen, cotton, dressings, instruments and trays are sterilized in the CSSD. Sterilization is done by steam sterilization and gas sterilization with a total of seven autoclaves and two ETO machines. Physical, chemical and biological indicators are regularly used during the process of sterilization.Conclusions: CSSD of the institution is contributing its part towards reduction of nosocomial infections. Quality of standards for sterilization and disinfection is maintained.</jats:p>"

This interest partly stems from the view that enhancements in food safety can be achieved if farmers are willing to adopt supply chains that are often associated with ‘western’ forms of retailing. Our study investigates farmers’ willingness to change to two ‘modern’ alternatives – a supply model based on cooperatives and another based on investors facilitating the change. Using discrete choice data drawn from 412 farmers, mixed logit models in willingness to pay space are developed that reveal the relative importance of different drivers of change. The paper offers insights that can inform governments about the incentives required to bring about change. In addition, the paper illustrates the novel application of a choice experiment to enumerating the perceived costs of changes in vegetable supply chains.</jats:p>",

We use the Stackelberg game to model the problem and characterize optimal pricing strategies for each supply chain partner, examining different circumstances in terms of retail price and trade credit contracts. When a consistent price strategy is applied in the dual channels under conditions of an exogenous credit period, trade credit can help both partners to achieve win‐win situations in the following circumstances: (1) when the retail channel's market share is small and the retailer's interest rate is high; or (2) when the retail channel's market share is large and the retailer's interest rate is lower than the manufacturer's. The study also concludes that when an inconsistent price strategy is applied, a trade credit contract can alleviate channel conflicts when the retailer's interest rate is higher than the manufacturer's. Otherwise, the partners may terminate cooperation. However, when the manufacturer has the power to determine and set the credit period, trade credit cannot alleviate channel conflicts under consistent price and inconsistent price scenarios.</jats:p>",

The removal efficiencies of each DBP through the treatment processes were also investigated. This DWTP takes raw water from the Yangtze River in East China. The quality of the raw water used in this DWTP varied with different seasons. The results suggested that DBP concentrations of the finished water were higher in spring (82.33 ± 15.12 μg/L) and summer (117.29 ± 9.94 μg/L) with higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels, but lower in autumn (41.10 ± 5.82 μg/L) and winter (78.47 ± 2.74 μg/L) with lower DOC levels. Due to the increase of bromide concentration in spring and winter, more toxic brominated DBPs increased obviously and took up a greater proportion. In this DWTP, DBP concentrations increased dramatically after pre-chlorination, especially in summer. It is noteworthy that the removal of DBPs during the subsequent treatment was more obvious in spring than in the other three seasons because the pH value is more beneficial to coagulation in spring.</jats:p>",

Based on the practice‐based view and normalization process theory, this study adopts a novel perspective on green supply chain management (GSCM) practices implementation and suggests that innovation is a crucial mechanism in such process. Specifically, we theorize and test the mediating effect of product and process innovation on the relationship between GSCM practices and sustainability performance. Survey data from 173 manufacturing firms were used to test the model hypotheses. Our findings show that product and process innovation mediate the relationship between GSCM practices and sustainability performance. The findings also suggest that the relevance of different innovation mechanisms depends on the stage of the operational lifecycle within which the practices are implemented. Our study provides insights for managers and scholars seeking to define innovation strategies to ensure the successful implementation of GSCM practices.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, we analyze the influence of green consumers on the government’s optimal decision, based on social welfare maximization. It is found that without government intervention, social welfare is the lowest. The carbon tax policy is better when the proportion of green consumers and the environmental coefficient are extreme or moderate at the same time. Otherwise, the subsidy policy is better. The carbon tax policy is more effective than the subsidy policy in controlling carbon emissions.

Two stepwise discretisation methodologies are firstly proposed, which are used to discretise arbitrarily given cold‐load models and aggregate discretised EV discharge models, respectively. Then, under the framework of mixed‐integer linear programming, a methodology of forming particular responsive restoration islands is built, which aims to maximise the recovered energy of interrupted end‐users given discretised CLPU and EV discharge models. Comparative analyses via the proposed method against existing algorithms are conducted on both a partial IEEE RBTS‐BUS6 test feeder and a practical feeder. Specifically, the conducted analyses investigate the impacts of the CLPU on energy restoration and the assistance performance of discharge power from EV's on boosting the capability of responsive restoration islands to restore the interruption. Moreover, an especial relationship is studied, between the utilisation rate of total discharge power of an EV parking lot and the rate of restored energy concerning the total lost energy.</jats:p>",

Municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was collected and four fractions including hydrophobic acidic (HPOA), hydrophobic alkaline (HPOB), weakly hydrophobic (WHPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) organics were isolated from the effluent by using DAX-8/XAD-4 resin. We used potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate corrosion characteristics of N80 carbon steel in the different water samples and control samples. In contrast with control samples, the corrosion rate of N80 carbon steel decreased 41%, 23%, 18% and 4% in the presence of HPOA, HPOB, WHPO and HPI, respectively. The results were further confirmed by the EIS test. In the presence of the four fractions (especially HPOA), the radius of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot was much larger than that for the control samples, which indicated that the impedance in the EIS test of the HPOA sample was much higher than that of the control sample. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) could adsorb onto the surface of the electrode and form a protective film, which could inhibit electron transfer and increase the electrochemical impedance of the electrochemical test system.</jats:p>",

Yet, surprisingly little is known about how this group responds to medical marijuana laws (MMLs). We quantify the effects of state medical marijuana laws on the health and labor supply of adults age 51 and older, focusing on the 55 percent with one or more medical conditions with symptoms that may respond to medical marijuana. We use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study to estimate event study and differences‐in‐differences regression models. Three principle findings emerge from our analysis. First, active state medical marijuana laws lead to lower pain and better self‐assessed health among older adults. Second, state medical marijuana laws lead to increases in older adult labor supply, with effects concentrated on the intensive margin. Third, the effects of MMLs are largest among older adults with a health condition that would qualify for legal medical marijuana use under current state laws. Findings highlight the role of health policy in supporting work among older adults and the importance of including older adults in assessments of state medical marijuana laws.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the contracts of cooperation between the members in OASC are discussed. Based on both theory differential game and bi-level programming, we utilize the Nerlove–Arrow model and Stackelberg model to examine five cases of decision modes for both agents in the OASC. Then, we achieve the optimal strategies where the specified sets of organic growing effort, organic traceability technology effort, propaganda input, and service input can guarantee the maximization of the related profits. As a result, we could obtain the values of the corresponding optimal profits. For the centralized decision mode, the farmer cooperative and the online retailer make decisions with the goal of maximizing the overall profits of the OASC. Meanwhile, for the decentralized decision mode with four different cases, each member will independently make a decision with the goal of maximizing his own profit respectively. In detail, as for the fully decentralized decision mode, no contracts exist in OASC; regarding the decentralized decision mode with an information traceability cost sharing contract, two members pay the information traceability cost together; and for the decentralized decision mode with a revenue sharing contract, two members share the revenue together; as to the decentralized decision mode with a comprehensive contract, there are two cooperative ways that information traceability cost sharing and revenue sharing can be achieved. In addition, we also considered factors such as the consumer preferences of organic products and the cross influence between channels in models. Finally, through sensitivity analysis and comparison of optimal strategies and profits, we found that: (1) high consumer preferences of organic products and high cross influence between channels are profitable; and (2) the choice of contract is influenced by the relative size of the offline marginal income ratio and the online marginal income ratio.</jats:p>"

During the last few decades, high-throughput plant phenotyping and phenomics have been developed primarily in cereal breeding programs. In this study, plant reflectance, at the level of the leaf, was used to assess several physiological traits in five Vaccinium spp. cultivars growing under four controlled conditions (no-stress, water deficit, heat stress, and combined stress). Two modeling methodologies [Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS)] with or without (W/O) prior wavelength selection (multicollinearity, genetic algorithms, or in combination) were considered. PLS generated better estimates than MLR, although prior wavelength selection improved MLR predictions. When data from the environments were combined, PLS W/O gave the best assessment for most of the traits, while in individual environments, the results varied according to the trait and methodology considered. The highest validation predictions were obtained for chlorophyll a/b (R2Val ≤ 0.87), maximum electron transport rate (R2Val ≤ 0.60), and the irradiance at which the electron transport rate is saturated (R2Val ≤ 0.59). The results of this study, the first to model modulated chlorophyll fluorescence by reflectance, confirming the potential for implementing this tool in blueberry breeding programs, at least for the estimation of a number of important physiological traits. Additionally, the differential effects of the environment on the spectral signature of each cultivar shows this tool could be directly used to assess their tolerance to specific environments.</jats:p>"

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess physicochemical and bacteriological characteristics of water from sources to household connection in Nekemte town. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to March 2016. Water samples were collected in triplicates from selected 30 sampling points from source, disinfection point, main distribution system tank, and household taps. All samples were analysed for bacteriological, chemical, and physical quality parameters using standard procedures. The results showed that temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved substances, and electrical conductivity of the water samples were varied between 16.9 and 22°C, 6.8–7.0, nil-12 NTU, 50–70 mg/l, and 40–46 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>S/cm, respectively. Phosphate and nitrate concentrations of the water samples also ranged between 0.65 and 1 mg/l and 2.2–6.5 mg/l, respectively. Free residual chlorine concentration in the majority of the water samples was less than 0.5 mg/l. All samples were positive for total coliform with counts ranging from 12 to 120 CFU/100 ml, whereas faecal coliforms were detected in only 37% of tap water samples. In general, the majority of the tested parameters were within the permissible range of both the WHO and Ethiopian drinking water standards. However, Fe, Mn, faecal coliforms, total coliforms, and temperature did not conform to both WHO and Ethiopian drinking water standards. Based on the results, we can conclude that water quality deterioration was both at the sources and in the supply networks. Hence, proper drainage, sewage disposal systems, and sufficient disinfection of water with chlorine are of prime importance to deliver safe drinking water to the residents of Nekemte town.</jats:p>",

In this paper, in order to examine whether the above two goals can be achieved by setting a specific reuse target, we have modelled a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a supplier (the leader) and a manufacturer (the follower) with the constraint of a mandated remanufacturing target. In this model, the supplier determines the level of interchangeability in product design and the wholesale price of the key component. The manufacturer buys the key components from the supplier and makes production and remanufacturing decisions under the requirement of a mandated remanufacturing target. We have investigated the supply chain’s members’ optimal decisions and analyzed the impact of the mandated remanufacturing target on the optimal profits of the supply chain’s members and consumer surplus, and finally, we have explored the environmental implications of the mandated remanufacturing target. We found that the supply chain’s members’ optimal decisions are affected by the mandated remanufacturing target and the cost of the new component. In terms of the economic implications of the mandated remanufacturing target, we have demonstrated that the increase in the mandated remanufacturing target has negative effects on the profits of the supply chain’s members and consumer surplus. Regarding the goal of incentivizing green product design, we found that the mandated remanufacturing target cannot always incentivize the supplier to implement product design that is beneficial to remanufacturing. From the perspective of the environment, we further indicate that more stringent mandated remanufacturing targets may bring an undesirable environmental outcome.</jats:p>"

Here we combine new high-resolution bathymetry data with sub-bottom profiler images and sediment cores taken during 2012–2016 in order to map for the first time the spatial extent of the earthquake-triggered event deposit along the hadal Japan Trench. We quantify a sediment volume of ~0.2 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> deposited from spatially-widespread remobilisation of young surficial seafloor slope sediments triggered by the 2011 earthquake and its aftershock sequence.

This carbon supply is comparable to high carbon fluxes described for other Earth system processes, shedding new light on the impact of large earthquakes on long-term carbon cycling in the deep-sea.</jats:p>"

We varied the proportions of the components of the medium to determine how it influenced the nitrate removal and nitrogen fractions. Three different scenarios were used, with: (1) iron, activated carbon, and coarse sand at a ratio of 3:1:6; (2) iron, activated carbon, and zeolite at a ratio of 3:1:6; and (3) iron, activated carbon, and zeolite at a ratio of 3:3:4. The nitrate nitrogen concentration decreased from 25 mg/L to 2 mg/L in the first scenario. Removal was better when zeolite was added to the medium as most of the nitrate nitrogen broke down to ammonia nitrogen, with nitrite nitrogen as an intermediate product. The results of the tests showed that nitrate removal was best when the medium was iron, activated carbon, and zeolite, mixed at a ratio of 3:1:6.

Since China is the world’s largest energy producer, productivity of energy supply in China is a significant issue, which affects sustainability. As a technical application, this paper investigates the productivity and dynamic changes of Chinese coal mining firms. We find that the total factor productivity (TFP) growth of coal supply in China is largely lagging behind the growth rate of coal production. The entry and exit of non-state-owned enterprise (non-SOE) partially provide explanation for the dynamic change of aggregate TFP. Specifically, non-state owned entrants induced by the coal price boom after 2003, which had negative effects on TFP of energy supply, while the exit of non-SOEs had positive effects. Furthermore, there is regional heterogeneity concerning the effects of entry and exit on energy supply productivity. More entrants induced by coal price boom are concentrated in non-main production region (non-MPR), while more exits are located in MPR due to the government’s enforcement. This provides explanation for the phenomena that productivity of energy supply in MPR gradually surpasses that in non-MPR. We also anticipate our paper to enhance understanding on the energy supply-side, which might further help us make informed decisions on energy planning and environmental policies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 states that access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy should be provided for all by 2030. Mozambique is one of the poorest countries on earth but has abundant supply of energy resources. The electrification rate, however, has been slow. Rural electrification is hampered by lack of basic infrastructure, institutional barriers, and low ability and willingness to pay for energy services. Thus, there is a general gap between electricity supply and demand. In view of this, the present paper investigates supply and demand of electricity for a typical rural case study area in Mozambique. We suggest a nexus approach to improve water, energy, and food security initiated at a local level. Households in the investigated case study area can be connected to a mini-grid hydropower system that allows for energy production to 80–200 households. To increase the economic profitability of the mini-grid hydropower system we suggest including small-scale industry. For the studied rural village, this would be constituted by a small-scale factory for milling of corn and other cereals. Electricity produced can thus be used for food processing but also for pumping water supply to households for domestic use and small-scale irrigated farming lots. The results indicate that the villagers have a real payment capacity of between 8 and 19 USD per MWh of generated hydropower. Benefits of rural electrification are direct. It contributes to improved living conditions for households and provides better nexus security and sustainable development within healthcare, education, and small-scale business development.</jats:p>"

However, their field application to winter wheat under temperate climate remains poorly documented. Therefore, three <jats:italic>B. velezensis</jats:italic> strains IT45, FZB24 and FZB42 were tested for their efficacy under these conditions. Two biological interaction systems were firstly developed under gnotobiotic and greenhouse conditions combined with sterile or non‐sterile soil, respectively, and finally assayed in the field during two years coupled with different N fertilization rates. Under gnotobiotic conditions, all three strains significantly increased root growth of 14 d‐old spring and winter wheat seedlings. In the greenhouse using non‐sterile soil, only FZB24 significantly increased root biomass of spring wheat (+31%). The three strains were able to improve nutrient uptake of the spring wheat grown in the greenhouse, particularly for the micronutrients Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu, but the observed increases in nutrient uptake were dependent on the organs and the elements. The root biomass increases in inoculated plants coincided with lowered nutrient concentrations of P and K. In 2014, under field conditions and absence of any N fertilizer supply, FZB24 significantly increased grain yields by 983 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, or 14.9%, in relation to non‐inoculated controls. The three strains in the 2015 field trial failed to confirm the previous positive results, likely due to the low temperatures occurring during and after inoculations. The Zeleny sedimentation value, indicative of flour quality, was unaffected by the inoculants. The results are discussed in the perspective of bacterial application to wheat under temperate agricultural practices.</jats:p>",

To overcome this problem, this study used farmers’ self-reported assessments of their position in the supply chain. Using unique micro-survey data from the dairy sector in Poland, we constructed a proxy of farmers’ bargaining power and showed that it helps to explain discounts at which farmers buy feed from input suppliers, in addition to what is explained by the standard variables.</jats:p>"

The relative abundance of cations and anions was Na+ &amp;gt; Mg2+ &amp;gt; Ca2+ &amp;gt; K+, and HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; NO3−, respectively. The concentrations of Na+, HCO3−, NO3−, and total dissolved solids (TDS), and the electric conductivity (EC) values in some samples were higher than the permissible limits of the Water Health Organization (WHO). Gibbs diagrams showed that rock weathering mainly controlled the major ion chemistry of the groundwater, and the first aquifer of this study area had a weak hydraulic connection with atmospheric precipitation. The calculated sodium percentage (%Na) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) revealed that the slight sodium and high salinity hazards needed to be controlled before irrigation. According to the fuzzy comprehensive assessment, the groundwater samples were classified into four categories. The results showed that 92.86% of the groundwater samples were suitable for drinking use. For human health, the NO3− and Mn levels in the groundwater should be reduced before drinking, and treatment of the high salinity hazards is required before irrigation.</jats:p>",

The structure and morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Effects of factors on Mn(II)-based autotrophic denitrification were investigated in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). The results indicate that the highest nitrate removal and Mn(II) oxidation efficiency occurred under the conditions of initial Mn(II) concentration of 80 mg·L−1, hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 h and pH 7. Meteorological chromatography analysis showed that N2 was produced as an end-product, and that gas compositions were different depending on the concentration of Mn(II) in the MBBR. The community diversity in the MBBR was markedly influenced by the concentration of Mn(II) and Pseudomonas sp. H-117 played a primary role in the process of nitrate removal and Mn(II) oxidation.</jats:p>",
