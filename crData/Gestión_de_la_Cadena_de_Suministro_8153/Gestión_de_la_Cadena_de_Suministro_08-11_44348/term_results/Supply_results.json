      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the emergence of logistics cities, which are geographical concentrations of related industries situated around one or more international trade gateways adjacent to a metropolitan area. Broadly, a logistics city comprises logistics activities and related assets combined with an integrated mix of manufacturing and assembly companies, business services, retail outlets, research and education centres, and associated government services and administration sections. This concept is currently being promoted and developed globally by several regions, and examples of these logistics cities are described in this paper. Drawing from these examples and the limited available literature, a preliminary conceptual map of the logistics cities concept has been developed which incorporates a theoretical foundation of economic development and the principles of competitiveness in the notion of trade clusters. This map has provided the basis for our further investigations and the continued development of a more detailed conceptual model that will provide a systematic knowledge base for those engaged in the development of further logistics cities. The beneficiaries of this model will be public authorities, property developers and industrial concerns, and will be used when making decisions for future logistics infrastructure, services, supporting services and related social elements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The world of project contracting in the oil and gas industry is in a state of flux, with an unprecedented high demand globally for contractor capability at a time of dwindling people and equipment resources. This is leading to seemingly ever-increasing costs, longer schedules and, all too often, inferior quality in the delivered project. The operators are struggling to find the best response to this variable and volatile situation, and a variety of outsourcing initiatives and contracting strategies are being tried and tested. However, we believe getting the basics right in contracting and procurement is now more important than ever.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In many parts of the world during the 80s and 90s, the capital contracting bias of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and other operators moved towards large Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts, with a lump sum reward mechanism. Large engineering firms, in an effort to enlarge their work scopes, started to provide this integrated EPC service, allowing the IOCs to outsource their labour intensive and detailed project management activities. These EPC-lump sum contracts gave contractors a strong incentive to perform well and, driven by fierce competition and a perceived relatively certain business environment, they assumed many of the risks associated with the project execution and delivery, with sharp focus on their own cost performance. The clients saw ‘competitive fixed prices’ being offered to deliver their projects, and this made contractor selection seem relatively straightforward.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With hindsight, the mid to longer-term consequences of this strategic approach were not foreseen or, at least, were underestimated. For IOCs, many assumed a (sometimes false) sense of cost certainty. Independent Project Analysis (IPA) insightfully stated that the lump sum price was generally perceived as a ceiling price, whereas in reality it was no better than a floor from which cost could, and inevitably often did, grow. This was made worse by the total lack of cost transparency to the IOCs, and hence their inability to meaningfully negotiate the commercial terms for repeat projects and standardisation, or to adequately assess variations and claims. EPC outsourcing also reduced the skill base of the IOCs, and thereby their ability to internally manage large projects and their interfaces at a component level.</jats:p>",

As a result of this location, the supply of water to the fort using conventional aqueducts does not appear to have been possible, and yet no alternative methods of supply have been identified. This paper, after analysing detailed meteorological records from the site, concludes that the Romans would have been able to supply a garrison of 800 men with water using rainfall harvesting from the roof structures within the fort. Using an estimated runoff rate from the roofs of 65 per cent means that the soldiers could have been supplied with 10 litres/capita/day or 8 tonnes of water in total each day provided that a storage capacity of 300 cubic metres existed within the fort. This storage capacity is believed to have been provided by stone-lined tanks with volumes of around 2 cubic metres. Perhaps four or six of these tanks would be associated with each of the major buildings within the fort. Excess surface drainage and overflow from the storage tanks would have been led to the south-east corner of the site as a result of local topography to be used for flushing the latrines.</jats:p>",

Fifteen studies that estimate availability of lignocellulosic biomass quantities in in the U.S. and/or Canada are reviewed. Sources of differences in study methods and assumptions and resulting biomass quantities are elucidated. We differentiate between inventory studies, in which quantities of biomass potentially available are estimated without rigorous consideration of the costs of supply, versus economic studies, which take into consideration various opportunity costs and competition. The U.S. economic studies, which included reasonably comprehensive sets of biomass categories, estimate annual biomass availability to range from 6 million to 577 million dry metric tonnes (dry t), depending on offered price, while estimates from inventory studies range from 190 million to 3849 million dry t. The Canadian inventory studies, which included reasonably comprehensive sets of biomass categories, estimate availability to range from 64 million green t to 561 million dry t. The largest biomass categories for the U.S. are energy crops and agricultural residues, while for Canada they are expected to be energy crops and logging residues. The significant differences in study estimates are due in large part to the number of biomass categories included, whether economic considerations are incorporated, assumptions about energy crop yields and land areas, and level of optimism of assumptions of the study.</jats:p>"

It presents and examines several counterfeit ICs found in the supply chain and describes procurement practices and failure analysis techniques that can help determine whether a product is counterfeit or authentic. Part II, scheduled for the February 2009 issue of EDFA, provides additional procurement and analysis options along with case studies showing how complex analysis can become and how misleading the evidence can seem.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although a third of nurses in New Zealand are born overseas, little is known about their composition. Among OECD countries, the reliance on overseas trained health professionals is currently strong and growing. Globally, as the population ages, and fertility rates decline, the demand for health professionals, particularly doctors and nurses is projected to increase over the next 20 years. It is estimated that in the OECD countries, 11 percent of employed nurses and 18 per cent of employed doctors were foreign born, however there are significant differences between the foreign-born and foreign-trained health professionals (OECD 2007). The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of the origin of overseas-born nurses, their labour market outcomes and their family structures. In the OECD countries, the main countries of origin of foreign-born doctors and nurses are India and 1he Philippines respectively. In New Zealand nurses from Great Britain form the largest supply of migrant nurses followed by the Philippines. Overall, nurses were more likely to migrate as part of a family unit compared to other occupational groups like doctors, however differences were observed by nationality. The proportion of international nursing students has also grown, from 1 percent (of total enrolments) in 1995 to 7 percent in 2006. The proportion of registered nurses who were born in New Zealand has also changed and decreased from 82 percent in 1991 to 72 percent in 2006. These differences are more evident when examined by age groups. Our study illustrates that severe staff and skill shortage within the health systems of developed countries such as New Zealand has led to the rise in migration of nurses, leading to significant changes in the proportion of nurses who were horn in New Zealand and overseas. The shift from a primarily New Zealand born to an increasingly diverse nursing workforce raises some challenges and opportunities when delivering services to a diverse range of clients.</jats:p>"

Recent work has hypothesized that social preferences, as distinct from economic incentives, may influence behavior in supply chain transactions. Social preferences refer to intrinsic concerns for the other party's welfare, reciprocating a history of a positive relationship, and intrinsic desires for a higher relative payoff compared with the other party's when status is salient. This article provides experimental evidence that social preferences systematically affect economic decision making in supply chain transactions. Specifically, supply chain parties deviate from the predictions provided by self-interested profit-maximization models, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation, individual performance, and high system efficiency, sustainable over time; whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both system efficiency and individual performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many coral reef organisms live in symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic microalgae. This symbiosis extends the energy resources available to reef organisms, thereby potentially influencing biodiversity. In octocorals, about one‐half of the taxa contain photosynthetic symbionts while the rest do not, and thus octocorals are an ideal model to assess the relationships between biodiversity, spatial and environmental factors, and photosynthetic symbionts. Data collected from 1106 sites on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, between 12° and 24° S showed that taxa with photosynthetic symbionts (phototrophs) had higher abundances, wider ranges, and a wider spread of locations than taxa without symbionts (heterotrophs). In phototrophic assemblages, spatial turnover comprised both exchange and loss of taxa, and their richness was high across a broad range of environmental conditions. In contrast, heterotrophs were uncommon, had short ranges, and were located where energy supply was highest and disturbance lowest. Turnover between heterotrophic assemblages comprised taxonomic loss rather than exchange of taxa. The biodiversity patterns and differences between phototrophic and heterotrophic octocorals are similar to those recorded in more spatially limited studies of phototrophic sponges and hard corals, and heterotrophic sponges. This study therefore suggests that the association, or not, with photosynthetic symbionts, and spatial and environmental factors related to energy supply and disturbance are principal drivers of biodiversity, community composition, and ranges of coral reef benthos.</jats:p>",

Besides being a landlocked country in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe has since 2000 been saddled with socio-economic and political challenges which have seen a decline in all economic indices, hence posing some challenges to its railways. This article discusses the challenges faced by the railways as a result of high inflation, unstable currency exchange rate, brain drain, poor management, government interference in management, customs border delays, and energy shortage. The problems have been addressed in unique ways and unusual solutions are proposed. These include customer financing for maintenance and spares and the resuscitation of steam locomotives. The presented solutions, lessons and issues from this experience contribute to discussions and study of railway logistics in challenging environments. Finally, current and future research issues, which have a global appeal, are presented.</jats:p>"

Broadly, a logistics city comprises logistics activities and related assets combined with an integrated mix of manufacturing and assembly companies, business services, retail outlets, research and education centres, and associated government services and administration sections. This concept is currently being promoted and developed globally by several regions, and examples of these logistics cities are described in this paper. Drawing from these examples and the limited available literature, a preliminary conceptual map of the logistics cities concept has been developed which incorporates a theoretical foundation of economic development and the principles of competitiveness in the notion of trade clusters. This map has provided the basis for our further investigations and the continued development of a more detailed conceptual model that will provide a systematic knowledge base for those engaged in the development of further logistics cities. The beneficiaries of this model will be public authorities, property developers and industrial concerns, and will be used when making decisions for future logistics infrastructure, services, supporting services and related social elements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inwoners van Suid-Afrika behoort deurlopend herinner te word dat hulle ‘n waterarmland bewoon en dat kennis oor die fisiese omgewing en die aard en omvang van effektiewe openbare bestuur van watervoorsiening van strategiese belang is. Die oppervlakte- en grondwater wat in die rivieropvanggebiede saamvloei is hidrologies en geohidrologies verbind deur die hidrologiese kringloop. Laasgenoemde manifesteer in ‘n natuurlike omgewing wat nie net gekenmerk word deur ‘n toestand van wye diversiteit en kompleksiteit nie, maar ook deur die behoefte aan goed gestruktureerde openbare dienslewering op veral die plaaslike regeringsfeer. Teen die einde van April 1994 was die voorsiening van openbare drinkwater en basiese sanitasiedienste aan al die landsinwoners op al die owerheidsfeeren veral die plaaslike regeringsfeeragendas die hoogste in die openbare diens geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika. Gevolglik is die Regering nie net meer gemoeid met die verskaffing van genoegsame drinkwater alleen nie, maar ook met die fasilitering van die implementering van ‘n holistiese en geïntegreerde benadering aangaande die effektiewe, doeltreffende en ekonomiese bestuur van die ontwikkeling, vervoer, opgaar, behandeling en verspreiding van water. As die enigste bestuurder en bewaarder van die land se waterbronne is die Departement van Waterwese en Bosbou (DWAF) sedert veral die oorgang na ‘n demokratiese bestel in 1994 proaktief in die evaluering van bestaande beleidsdokumente sowel as die voortbring van verbeterde wette en uitvoerbare openbare beleid aangaande waterbestuursaspekte in die land. Dit is ook opmerklik dat primêre nasionale wetgewing aangaande die bestuur van openbare water sedert die 1956 - en die jongste 1998 waterwetgewing transformasie ondergaan het en dat die mees optimale voertuig tot meer effektiewe, doeltreffende en ekonomiese implementering van die nuwe getransformeerde openbare waterverwante wetgewing die 284 munisipaliteite in die land is. Dit is dan ook op hierdie regeringsfeer waar die spreekwoordelike ‘motorkarwiel die teerpad tref’ en die sukses al dan nie, van nuut geïmplementeerde openbare beleid evalueer kan word. Die fokus van die artikel is om vanuit ‘n dissiplinêr geïntegreerde perspektief die toepassing van watergewing in Suid-Afrika op munisipale owerheidsfeer krities in oënskou te neem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For many years Africa has presented a gloomy socio-economic picture. The problems Africa faces are so complex and interlinked that a holistic approach is needed to address the issues. Africa is increasingly being marginalised from world development. It accounts for only about 2% of the world total economic exchanges (UNECA, 2000). The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) is an initiative by African leaders to inspire political stability and address shortages in infrastructure, education and health in an attempt to end misery across Africa and launch its sustainable development. Inadequate infrastructure is a critical obstacle to intra-African trade and to the competitiveness of African products in international markets. Transport can facilitate the flow of people, ideas and technology. Bridging the transport infrastructure gap is therefore an important factor in unlocking the human and economic potential of the continent. NEPAD aims to coordinate and channel regionally fragmented efforts into one core long-term vision for the continent. NEPAD cannot work if there is too much high level strategic regional focus with little involvement of civil society, specific requirements and needs of African countries, and the private sector. It should develop some general high-level objectives and strategies related to transport operations and infrastructure, such as simplifying and harmonising transport regulations, deregulating the air industry and implementing the Yamoussoukro decisions, and focusing investments on transport corridors (road or rail).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article addresses the design of sustainable chemical supply chains in the presence of uncertainty in the life cycle inventory associated with the network operation. The design task is mathematically formulated as a bi‐criterion stochastic mixed‐integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that simultaneously accounts for the maximization of the net present value and the minimization of the environmental impact for a given probability level. The environmental performance is measured through the Eco‐indicator 99, which incorporates the recent advances made in Life Cycle Assessment. The stochastic model is converted into its deterministic equivalent by reformulating the probabilistic constraint required to calculate the environmental impact in the space of uncertain parameters. The resulting deterministic bi‐criterion MINLP problem is further reformulated as a parametric MINLP, which is solved by decomposing it into two sub‐problems and iterating between them. The capabilities of the proposed model and solution procedure are illustrated through two case studies for which the set of Pareto optimal, or efficient solutions that trade‐off environmental impact and profit, are calculated. These solutions provide valuable insights into the design problem and are intended to guide the decision maker towards the adoption of more sustainable design alternatives. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009</jats:p>",

Although there can be additional costs associated with utilizing emergency backup and storage facilities, they can be a particularly attractive and cost‐effective alternative in those cases where long‐term disruptions can, or should, be expected. In this paper we use set cover location modeling as a decision to determine the number of backup facilities to locate under varying cover, anticover, and complementary anticover distances. We then add the flexibility of allowing existing facilities to serve as backup facilities and explore the interrelationships among hazards, vulnerability, and location. Finally, these model formulations are applied to an example data set over 900 cities and towns in New England and New York.</jats:p>",

The functional importance of these coronary arteries remains unknown. In the present study we investigate the effects of permanent coronary artery occlusion in the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) on the ability to maintain heart rate and blood pressure at rest and during short term activity. We used colored silicone rubber(Microfil) to identify the coronary artery distribution and interarterial anastomoses. The coronary circulation was occluded and the snakes were then kept for 4 days at 30°C. Microfil injections verified that virtually all coronary arteries had successfully been occluded, but also made visible an extensive coronary supply to the outer compact layer in untreated snakes. Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (Psys) and heart rate (fH) were measured at rest and during enforced activity at day 1 and 4. Four days after occlusion of the coronary circulation, the snakes could still maintain a Psys and fH of 5.2±0.2 kPa and 58.2±2.2 beats min–1, respectively, during activity and the ECG was not affected. This was not different from sham-operated snakes. Thus, while the outer compact layer of the rattlesnake heart clearly has an extensive coronary supply, rattlesnakes sustain a high blood pressure and heart rate during activity without coronary artery blood supply.</jats:p>",

The provision of fleet management services on contract introduces a certain amount of financial risk to the fleet management company, specifically fixed rate maintenance contracts. The quoted rate needs to be sufficient and also competitive in the market. Currently the quoted maintenance rates are based on the maintenance specifications of the manufacturer and the risk management approach of the fleet management company. This is usually reflected in a contingency that is included in the quoted maintenance rate. An alternative methodology for calculating the average maintenance cost for a vehicle fleet is proposed based on the actual maintenance expenditures of the vehicles and accepted statistical techniques. The proposed methodology results in accurate estimates (and associated confidence limits) of the true average maintenance cost and can beused as a basis for the maintenance quote.</jats:p>"

A buyer chooses the supplier who offers the best price for his order profile, as described by his order size and delivery frequency. A supplier's offering price reflects her logistic cost structure as captured by relevant economies of scale in a “setup cost” component, and storage- and distribution-related costs in a “holding cost per unit” component. We argue that the matching of buyers' order profiles to suppliers' cost structures is the main source of supply chain coordination benefit in this many-to-many supply chain. Such cost-effective matching can be achieved naturally through price competition among suppliers. We identify the segment of the buyer's order space that each supplier can win, and perform market share sensitivity analysis when a supplier's cost structure changes. The winning supplier, at the equilibrium of price competition, offers the lowest price of her closest competitor instead of the lowest price she can offer. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conventional nitrification-denitrification treatment is a common way to treat nitrogen in wastewater, but this process is costly for low COD/N wastewaters due to the addition of air and external carbon-source. However, ammonia may alternatively be converted to dinitrogen gas by autotrophic bacteria utilizing aerobically autotrophically produced nitrite as an electron acceptor under anoxic conditions. Lab-scale sequencing batch biofilm reactors (SBBRs) inoculated with normal nitrifying sludge were employed to study the potential of an oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification-denitrification process initiated with typical nitrifying sludge for treating a synthetic ammonia wastewater devoid of organic carbon in one step. The ring-laced fibrous carrier (length 0.32 m, surface area 3.4 m2/m) was fixed vertically in a 3 L reactor. Two different air supply modes were applied:continuous aeration to control dissolved oxygen at 1.5 mg/L and intermittent aeration. High nitrogen removals of more than 50% were obtained in both SBBRs. At an ammonia loading of 0.882 gm N/m2-day [hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 hr], the SBBR continuously aerated to 1.5 mg DO/L had slightly higher nitrogen removal (64%) than the intermittently alternated SBBR (55%). The main form of residual nitrogen in the effluent was ammonia, at concentrations of 25 mg/L and 37 mg N/L in continuous and intermittent aeration SBBRs, respectively. Ammonia was completely consumed when ammonia loading was reduced to 0.441 gm N/m2-day [HRT extended to 48 hr]. The competitive use of nitrite by aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria (ANOB) with anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (anammox bacteria) during the expanded aeration period under low remaining ammonia concentration resulted in higher nitrate production and lower nitrogen loss in the continuous aeration SBBR than in the intermittent aeration SBBR. The nitrogen removal efficiencies in SBBRs with continuous and alternating aerated were 80% and 86% respectively. Specific microorganisms in the biofilm were characterized using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB) occurred side by side with putative anammox bacteria (cells hybridizing with probe AMX820) throughout the biofilm, though ANOB were rarely detected.</jats:p>",

The analytic framework is based on two structuring axes: on the one hand, the organisational know-how developed by the carrier; on the other hand, the degree of coordination necessary for efficient supply chain functioning. The analytic framework proposes four configurations the relevance of which is discussed using strategies of the Geodis group. It is possible to conclude, from a managerial point of view, two possible trajectories for transport strategic practices. The risk of the first trajectory is to make the carrier fall into a kind of trap from which it will have a great deal of trouble getting out off; the second trajectory is connected with a “winning strategy” favouring its development on the marketplace.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">L’objectif de l’article consiste à proposer une grille d’analyse des manœuvres stratégiques transport envisageables dans le contexte des schémas d’approvisionnement contemporains. Celle-ci s’appuie sur deux axes structurants : d’une part, le savoir-faire organisationnel développé par le transporteur ; d’autre part, le degré de coordination requis pour un fonctionnement performant au sein de la chaîne logistique. La grille d’analyse donne lieu à quatre configurations types dont la pertinence est discutée à partir de stratégies conduites au sein du groupe Geodis. Il est possible d’en inférer, sur un plan managérial, deux trajectoires possibles pour la manœuvre stratégique transport. L’une risque de faire chuter le transporteur dans une sorte de trappe dont il aura le plus grand mal à sortir, tandis que l’autre s’apparente à une « stratégie gagnante » favorisant son développement sur le marché.</jats:p>"

However, the benefits of sharing information can vary depending on the supply chain structure and its operational characteristics. Most of the existing research has studied the impact of sharing downstream information (e.g., a manufacturer sharing information with its suppliers). We evaluate the benefits of sharing upstream yield information (e.g., a supplier sharing information with the manufacturer) in a two‐stage serial supply chain in which the supplier has multiple internal processes and is faced with uncertain output due to yield losses. We are interested in determining when the sharing of the supplier's information is most beneficial to the manufacturer. After proposing an order‐up‐to type heuristic policy, we perform a detailed computational study and observe that this information is most beneficial when the supplier's yield variance is high and when end‐customer demand variance is low. We also find that the manufacturer's backorder‐to‐holding cost ratio has little, if any, impact on the usefulness of information. </jats:p>",

Our study makes two contributions to the literature. First, we use well‐established lean principles to explain how independent organizations achieve superior performance despite highly uncertain and variable customer demand—a context considerably different from the origins of lean principles. Second, we forward relational coordination theory to explain why the organizations in this decentralized supply chain coordinate their work. Relational coordination includes the use of shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect for one another's work as primary mechanisms to explain process improvement in the absence of any contractual incentives. Our study constitutes a first step in generating theory for work design and its improvement in decentralized supply chains.</jats:p>",

Its injection bump magnets, especially horizontal paint bump magnets, are excited by large pulse currents. Their rated currents are over 10 kA and pulse widths are about 1 ms. Tracking errors are required to be less than 1%. Multiple connected two‐quadrant IGBT choppers are adopted for their power supplies. Their output currents are controlled by feedback control with minor loop voltage control (m‐AVR). When output current of a chopper intermits at small current, its output voltage rises and current control becomes difficult. In this paper, response of m‐AVR and output voltage characteristics at current intermittent region are studied and an improved control scheme is proposed. The performance is confirmed by a test. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> According to the influential `environmental security' literature, supply-induced scarcity in the form of environmental degradation is a key driver of civil violence around the world. African drylands, especially the Sahel region, are allegedly among the areas most seriously affected by this development. Views of desertification and severe environmental degradation in the Sahel are held by environmental security scholars, despite the comprehensive literature questioning such ideas that has been published since the late 1980s. Instead of being steadily transformed towards more desert-like conditions through increasing population pressure, Sahelian environments are dominated by climatic fluctuations. This article first reviews the literature criticizing the idea of `desertification' as it is applied on African drylands. Then, the article critically discusses the use of the Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali as an example of a supply-induced scarcity related conflict. The case study shows that the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s played a role in the rebellion, but the rebellion was not driven by supply-induced scarcity. Instead, the droughts led to the migration of young men to Algeria and Libya, where they were exposed to revolutionary discourses. There was already a strong feeling among nomads and Tuareg in Mali of being marginalized by state policies of modernization and sedentarization. Embezzlement of drought relief funds by government officials in Bamako added further to the anger felt by the young men who took up arms against the Malian state. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s was probably not a necessary condition for the rebellion to take place. Detailed case studies of armed conflicts, engaging with environmental research, may be necessary to further deepen our understanding of links, or lack of such links, between violence and environmental stress. </jats:p>",

Within the Yorkshire region, UK, nitrates, pesticides and water colour present particular treatment problems. Catchment management techniques offer an alternative to ‘end of pipe’ solutions and allow resources to be targeted to the most polluting areas. This project has attempted to identify such areas using GIS based modelling approaches in catchments where water quality data were available. As no model exists to predict water colour a model was created using an MCE method which is capable of predicting colour concentrations at the catchment scale. CatchIS was used to predict pesticide and nitrate N concentrations and was found to be generally capable of reliably predicting nitrate N loads at the catchment scale. The pesticides results did not match the historic data possibly due to problems with the historic pesticide data and temporal and spatially variability in pesticide usage. The use of these models can be extended to predict water quality problems in catchments where water quality data are unavailable and highlight areas of concern.</jats:p>",

Using a case study method with multiple suppliers of two large buying firms, we mapped factors that initiated and improved environmental capabilities in small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises over time. Through several specific mechanisms, buyers' green supply chain management initiated and then enabled the improvement of suppliers' environmental capabilities. Independent of buyers, internal championing of environmental concerns also provided an impetus for small‐ and medium‐sized enterprise suppliers to acquire resources outside the supply chain. Thus, synergistic linkages emerged in supportive buyer‐supplier relationships, resource acquisition, and capability development. When these findings are combined with earlier research on larger suppliers, an integrative framework emerges that provides direction for suppliers, buyers, and public agencies seeking to improve environmental performance. </jats:p>",

A perspective of supply chains as complex activity networks is used for data analysis based on in‐depth interviews in a global setting. Applying these concepts of supply chains as the interaction of multiple work activities assists in comprehending the forces of change. The processes of change are characterized by expansive learning processes of creating instruments for initializing, developing and sustaining these relationships. These processes take place in a terrain of complex power exercises. The long‐term effects are totally dependent on nurturing the relationships. The findings may be useful to practitioners in understanding how implementation of successful supply chain changes may come about. It promotes risk‐sharing partnerships as instruments for innovation.

A 17‐yr time‐series study was conducted from 1990 to 2006 in the abyssal northeast Pacific (Sta. M, 4100 m in depth) to evaluate the importance of this food source and its temporal relationship to water column and surface ocean processes. Detrital aggregates appeared on the seafloor from June through December, with the highest peaks in 1990, 1994, 2001, and 2002 reaching a maximum density of 23 m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> in fall 2001. A total of 15,816 aggregates were measured, most less than 20 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in area and with a mode of 9 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Density of detrital aggregates was highly correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 600 and 50 m above the bottom (p &lt; 0.001) with no time lag. Export flux of organic carbon from the euphotic zone was significantly correlated with aggregate density, lagged earlier by 1‐4 months (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> ≤ 0.001). Zooplankton displacement volume was significantly correlated with POC flux (p = 0.023) and with detrital aggregate density (p = 0.028) on the seafloor when lagged earlier by ≤1 month. The Bakun upwelling index computed for the region around Sta. M was significantly correlated with detrital aggregate density when lagged earlier by 2‐5 months (p &lt; 0.001). A strong correlation exists between surface ocean processes and abyssal food supply, including POC flux and detrital aggregates.

We begin by reviewing the theoretical foundations of social exchange theory. Next, we use an illustrative multinational business example from a Danish Business Group to demonstrate the complexities of the lock‐in situation. Conjectures related to lock‐in behaviors are initially developed and then examined by means of a game‐theoretic model. The analysis provides a basis for the development of propositions which are examined employing a behavioral experiment. The results indicate that the optimal pricing strategy of the supplier is to lower the price with increasing demand and the optimal investment intensity of the buyer decreases with increasing demand.

Human and other animals excreta have been associated to many infectious diseases that can be disseminated through contaminated water. Enteric bacteria and other pathogens can cause gastroenteritis, cholera, systemic infections, among others. Once in the environment, these microorganisms can persist for large periods of time and under certain conditions can even replicate, increasing their number. This paper aimed the research and evaluation of survival rates for total coliforms, fecal coliforms (Escherichia coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in natura water samples from Passaúna and Iraí barrages and Iguaçú River, in Curitiba, Paraná. Colimetric analysis of water samples were performed by the membrane filtration method 64 Freitas MP, Blaskowski MMM, Dalke CR, Dalzoto PR, Pimentel IC. Estud and P. aeruginosa research was assayed using the multiple tubes method in Asparagin and Acetamyde Broth. Confirmatory tests such as catalase presence, citocrome oxidase test and pigment P (pyocyanin) production were also performed. It was observed the occurrence of total coliforms in water samples from Iguaçú River for approximately 50 days, while in Iraí and Passaúna barrages, the periods were 35 and 14 days, respectively. Fecal coliforms were found for about 35 days in samples from Iguaçú River and Iraí barrage, while in Passaúna barrage only for 14 days. P. aeruginosa persisted for approximately 63 days in all the water samples assayed. The higher persistence rate observed in P. aeruginosa can be related to an antagonism towards total and fecal coliforms, which had their populations decreased.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As consumer affluence and desire for customized products and services at affordable prices and shorter lead times continue to accelerate, supply chain operators are facing increasing challenges of becoming both physically efficient (to enable the delivery of low cost) and flexible (to enable market-responsiveness). In order to meet these challenges, organizations are devising supply chain operation strategies that enable them to gain the benefits of physical efficiency of mass production and the customer focus of mass customization. A key to gaining these benefits lies in the selection of appropriate decoupling points in the supply chain. Decoupling points lie on the push—pull boundary. The selection of decoupling points requires knowledge from a range of different experts. The research reported in this paper used knowledge-based techniques to bring together knowledge from the viewpoints of different experts in the selection of decoupling points in supply chains. A knowledge model in the form of a network of production rules is presented. Results derived from applying the knowledge model to the case studies show similar trends to published literature. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study was undertaken to provide a comprehensive set of data relevant to disclosing the physiological effects and possible oxygen transport limitations in the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) during an acute temperature change. Fish were instrumented with a blood flow probe around the ventral aorta and catheters in the dorsal aorta and sinus venosus. Water temperature was progressively increased from 13°C in steps of 4°C up to 25°C. Cardiac output increased from 29 to 56 ml·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>between 13 and 25°C through an increase in heart rate (58 to 105 beats/min). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced, causing a stable dorsal aortic blood pressure, yet central venous blood pressure increased significantly at 25°C. Oxygen consumption rate increased from 3.4 to 8.7 mg·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>during the temperature increase, although there were signs of anaerobic respiration at 25°C in the form of increased blood lactate and decreased pH. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was maintained during the heat stress, although venous oxygen partial pressure (Pv<jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub></jats:sub>) and venous oxygen content were significantly reduced. Cardiac arrhythmias were prominent in three of the largest fish (&gt;4 kg) at 25°C. Given the switch to anaerobic metabolism and the observation of cardiac arrhythmias at 25°C, we propose that the cascade of venous oxygen depletion results in a threshold value for Pv<jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub></jats:sub>of around 1 kPa. At this point, the oxygen supply to systemic and cardiac tissues is compromised, such that the oxygen-deprived and acidotic myocardium becomes arrhythmic, and blood perfusion through the gills and to the tissues becomes compromised.</jats:p>",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of organic amendment history and crop rotation on potentially mineralizable N (N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>), mineralizable N pools, and field estimates of soil N supply in potato (<jats:italic>Solanum tuberosum</jats:italic> L.) production, and evaluated a suite of N availability measures to detect changes in these parameters. Preplant soil samples (top 15‐cm) were collected from the potato year of a rotation trial in Maine during 2004 and 2005. Treatments included three crop rotations, with and without a history of organic amendment [solid beef (<jats:italic>Bos taurus</jats:italic>) manure] application: PB, potato‐barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic> L.); PSPB, potato‐soybean [<jats:italic>Glycine max</jats:italic> (L.) Merr.]‐potato‐barley; and PSBA/T, potato‐soybean‐barley‐alfalfa (<jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic> L.)/timothy (<jats:italic>Phleum pratense</jats:italic> L.). The N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and mineralizable N pools were determined by aerobic incubation at 25°C and periodic leaching for 24 wk with a fixed‐<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> approach. On average, historically amended soil had 35% higher values of N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>, and an 8% higher proportion of mineralizable N partitioned to the stable mineralizable N pool, compared with nonamended soil. Lower values of N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>, mineralizable N pools and some measures of N availability were measured in PSBA/T compared with PB and PSPB rotations. All tested measures of N availability detected management‐induced changes in N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and mineralizable N pools. The preplant nitrate, UV absorbance of 0.01 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> NaHCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> extract at 205 nm and particulate organic matter (POM)‐N were the best predictors of field‐based indices of soil N supply (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.50 to 0.73). Management‐induced changes in the size and quality of mineralizable N should be considered in developing best N management programs through organic amendment application and crop rotations.</jats:p>",
