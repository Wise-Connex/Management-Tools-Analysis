      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water resource development, particularly dam construction and inter basin diversions, can cause substantial environmental damage. Minimizing future damage can best be accomplished by using existing systems more efficiently, thus. reducing the need for supply augmentation: In the U.S., agriculture accounts for 83% of the annual total water consumption. The municipal and industrial sectors account for the remaining use. These shares are inversely related to economic value; agricultural water is worth between $30 and $75 per acre-foot in most applications while water in the municipal sector may be worth as much as $300 to $500 per acre-foot. The system inefficiencies implied by the sectors' use and relative economic values make it clear that water supply planning can be improved. If cost-effectiveness were the criterion against which water supply options and alternatives were assessed, system management and end–use efficiency would replace supply augmentation. Institutional, not technical, constraints prevent the adoption of the mote efficient options. Were these constraints relaxed, the monetary and environmental savings would be substantial.</jats:p>",

The objective of this research was to determine the micronutrient status of pine bark amended with two sulfate micronutrient sources and a control (unmended). Limed pine bark was unamended, amended with Ironite (1 and 2 g/l), or Micromax (1g/l). Bark was irrigated with distilled water in amounts equivalent to 30, 60, 90, and 120 irrigations (.63 cm per irrigation). Following irrigations, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were extracted with a modified saturated media extract method using .001M DPTA as the extractant. Irrigation amount had no effect on Cu and Mn concentrations which were greater in the Micromax treatment than the Ironite or control treatments. A micronutrient source × irrigation interaction existed for Fe and Zn concentrations requiring regression analysis. In general, slope values indicating the decrease in micronutrient values with increasing irrigations were quite low (≤ .001) for each source. Regardless of irrigation amount, Fe and Zn concentrations were similar for amended and unamended bark.</jats:p>",

The analysis measures the benefits arising to consumers and producers of stumpage from increases in softwood stumpage availability. Over the period of the analysis, average total benefits are roughly equal between the pulpwood and solidwood (combined lumber and plywood) stumpage markets. Average combined benefits range from $1.3 million to $5.3 million per year (1967 $). The size of the total benefits are more greatly affected by the level of shift assumed than they are by the structural characteristics of the market. The distribution of the benefits, however, differs quite markedly depending on the market structure. Pulpwood consumers (pulp and paper mills), for instance, receive greater than 150% of the total benefits from increased productivity effects on stumpage production as producers receive negative benefits. Solidwood producers receive positive benefits from increasing supply, although only 10% of the total benefits that are created. These distributional imbalances in the effects of policies designed to improve forest productivity should be considered in future analyses which assess the impacts and returns of these policies. For.

The effects of labor supply and demand, including special measures of public employment and two previously neglected aspects of competition—global industrial competition and sexual labor market competition—on unemployment, low‐wage employment, and low‐hours employment are examined. A higher proportion of females in the labor force in rural labor market areas provides benefits to men in the form of lower unemployment, but also costs them, through an increased prevalence of low‐wage employment, while the opposite effects are evident for areas with concentrations in periphery service industries. The findings suggest that industrial restructuring in the form of increased foreign competition and an increased loss of core transformative jobs are especially threatening to rural men's employment adequacy.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this research were to: (i) investigate the relative increases in both K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> and K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub> after addition of graded amounts of a 3‐4‐7.5 solution fertilizer; and (ii) determine if the changes in K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> and K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub> with fertilizer additions were related to some measurable physical or chemical property of the soil. Thirty‐three surface soils were equilibrated moist for 3 wk after addition of 0, 21, 42, 104, 208, 415, and 1245 mg K per kg of soil. High rates of application were used because they occur when the same total amount of K is placed in a small fraction of soil, e.g., band application. Values of K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> were determined from water‐displaced soil solution. Values of K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub> were obtained from K extracted with 1.0 <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>OAc at pH 7.0 minus θK<jats:sub>l</jats:sub>, where θ is the volumetric water content g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of sample. The increase in K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> with K addition was described by K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>ax<jats:sup>c</jats:sup></jats:italic> + <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>, where <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> is the amount of added K and <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> are regression constants. Values of <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>, the curvilinearity coefficient, varied from 1.00 (linear) to 1.59.

The value <jats:italic>g</jats:italic> represents the amount of exchangeable K in the untreated soil. Values of <jats:italic>h</jats:italic>, the slope, varied from 0.42 to 1.13. The coefficients describing the relation of both K<jats:sub>l</jats:sub> and K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub> to added K were not correlated with any of the measured soil properties.

However, the computer programs available for quantitative analyses fail for light elements because the correction and background modelling parameters are not accurately known. Therefore, we have developed a simple method of light element quantitative analysis using the peak ratios of two elements as the basis for calibration curves using stable standards. The use of peak ratios avoids the need for accurate ZAF corrections and minimizes many experimental variables. This article describes the criteria for the selection of standards, and the development of the calibration curve in the case of compounds containing oxygen and carbon. The success of the method depends on careful sample preparation and predetermined experimental parameters. The method has been successfully applied to the surface analysis of fresh and oxidized Western and Eastern Canadian coals.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, for the city of Waterloo, Ontario, through the use of 1981 and 1986 Census data we demonstrate that not only is the supply of licensed day care spaces insufficient to meet the demand, but also it is spatially arranged in a suboptimal way. Through population projections and net migration analyses we demonstrate that the demand for child care spaces in the near future is more likely to intensify in the periphery of the city, where the current supply is nonexistent. We thus argue that locational criteria should play a prominent role in the practice of licensing new day care centres.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Cet article vise à encourager la recherche sur I'offre</jats:italic> et la demande de services de garderie.

It is suggested that the negative relation between cutting age and heat susceptibility observed in our experiments, is a reflection of the decreasing shoot/root dry weight ratio rather than of age. Heat damage of root systems increased with the concentration of the nutrient solution, nitrate being the main factor responsible. The influence of light intensity on temperature mediated restriction of root growth was relatively small. However the roots of plants grown under low light intensity (60 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> PAR) appeared to be less stressed by supraoptimal temperature, i.e. roots appeared brighter, thinner and more ramified than plants growing at high light intensity (190 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>).</jats:p>",
