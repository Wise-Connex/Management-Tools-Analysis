Eight animals were injected with a cinnabar, mercury, zinc oxide mixture (Teichmann's paste) for dissection and for cleared specimens, two with radiopaque material, and two others with India ink. Findings indicate that the coronoid, condylar, and angular processes of the mandible are supplied by vessels which are primarily concerned with the nutrition of the muscles that attach to these areas, and not from the inferior alveolar artery. The inferior alveolar artery supplies the body of the mandible, teeth and adjacent structures. After entering the mandibular foramen this artery bifurcates beneath the third molar tooth. The larger inferior stem passes downward and backward to supply multiple branches to the pulp of incisor tooth and branches to the periodontium about this tooth. The superior stem passes forward beneath the apices of the molar teeth to supply them and the adjacent tissue. The venous drainage of the bone varies – the coronoid and condylar processes drain downward into a confluence of venous channels about the apex of the incisor tooth. Veins of the molar teeth and supporting structures pass through the bone into gingival veins. Concentrations of venous channels primarily draining the angle and condyle are found along the inferior border of the angle and above, where the angular process joins the body proper.</jats:p>",
