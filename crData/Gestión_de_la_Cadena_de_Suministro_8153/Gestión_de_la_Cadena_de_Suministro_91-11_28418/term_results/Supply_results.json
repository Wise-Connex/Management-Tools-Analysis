On a unit-leaf-area basis, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation was not affected when N was present; however, it was greatly inhibited in the absence of N. Changes in the leaf starch and soluble sugar concentrations occurred as a function of N supply and leaf age. In the roots, low N led to lower sucrose and higher levels of hexose and starch. More sucrose was transported and accumulated into leaf veins of low-N tissue. Exogenously supplied <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C-labeled sucrose was rapidly converted into starch in the low-N tissue.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous work on stream channels in upland areas of Britain has demonstrated a close control over channel morphology and stability by the rate of coarse sediment supply from the hillslopes of the catchment. Streams fed by large amounts of coarse sediment develop unstable, wide, often braided channels, whereas those with limited coarse sediment supply develop stable, much narrower, often meandering channels. The sediment supply from hillslopes is controlled by thresholds of hillslope stability, storm event frequency, and the coupling between the hillslopes and the channel. Climatically‐induced changes in any of these three factors may have implications for channel morphology and stability. This paper examines these implications in British upland fluvial systems, with particular reference to the Howgill Fells, Cumbria, in the contexts of the adjustment of stream channels to sediment supply from erosional gully systems, and their response to and recovery from major flood events.</jats:p>",

Moench in symbiosis with the local source of <jats:italic>Frankia</jats:italic> were exposed to darkness for 2 days, and then returned to normal light/dark conditions. During the dark period nitrogenase activity in vivo (intact plants) and in vitro (<jats:italic>Frankia</jats:italic> cells supplied with ATP and reductant), measured as acetylene reduction activity, was almost completely lost. Western blots for both the Fe‐protein (dinitrogenase reductase) and the MoFe‐protein (dinitrogenase) showed that, in particular, the amount of MoFe‐protein was strongly reduced during darkness. Protein stained sodium dodecyl sulphate‐polyacrylamide gels of <jats:italic>Frankia</jats:italic> protein showed that the nitrogenase proteins were the only abundant proteins that clearly decreased during darkness. During recovery, studied for 4 days, nitrogenase activity in vivo recovered to the level before dark treatment but was still only half of control activity, Nitrogenase activity in vitro and the amount of MoFe‐protein, both expressed per <jats:italic>Frankia</jats:italic> protein, recovered and reached similar values in previously dark treated plants and in control plants. The rate of recovery was similar to the increase in activity of control plants, suggesting growth of <jats:italic>Frankia</jats:italic> in addition to synthesis of nitrogenase proteins during the recovery after carbon starvation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study attempts to isolate the determinants of private hospital growth in the United Kingdom. Thirty-six variables, representing private medicine, the socio-economic environment, the political and government conditions, and the health care systems characteristics were selected for analysis. Multiple regression analysis shows that the number of independent hospital beds in the UK can be explained almost entirely by the number of persons with private health insurance, the number of NHS pay beds, and the overall bed level. Further analysis reveals that the number of persons with private health insurance can be explained to a large extent by the length of the NHS waiting list. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In hemodilution, red cell spacing in the microcirculation is increased, flow distribution may become more heterogeneous, and, as a result, oxygen supply to tissues may suffer. We tested the hypothesis that oxygen extraction from diluted blood may be enhanced by the presence of hemoglobin in the plasma phase in relatively low concentrations. In anesthetized dogs, the hindlimb vascular bed was isolated and perfused with the animal's own blood by a roller pump. One group of dogs (n = 6) was hemodiluted (hematocrit = 15.0 ± 1.0%) with a 6% solution of dextran. A second group of dogs (n = 6) was similarly hemodiluted (hematocrit = 16.0 ± 0.4%) with dextran containing stroma-free hemoglobin solution whereby plasma-phase hemoglobin concentration was raised to 1.1 ± 0.1 g∙dLé<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Systemic hemodynamic observations were made repeatedly over the subsequent 2.5 h, while blood flow to the hindlimb was progressively reduced in stepwise decrements. The hemoglobin-hemodiluted group showed increased systemic arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance when compared with the control (dextran diluted) group. The isolated hindlimb also showed evidence of increased vascular resistance in the hemoglobin-treated group. In each individual animal, critical oxygen delivery and extraction were determined by finding the intercept of the supply-independent and supply-dependent portions of the oxygen uptake/oxygen delivery relationship. Neither the critical oxygen delivery rates (5.75 ± 0.83 vs. 6.41 ± 0.53 mL∙kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) nor critical oxygen extraction ratios (0.75 ± 0.03 vs. 0.76 ± 0.04) were found to be significantly different in the two groups. We conclude that hemoglobin in solution in the plasma at a concentration of about 1 g∙dL<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> induces significant increase in vascular resistance and fails to augment oxygen extraction from diluted blood by the resting hindlimb.Key words: stroma-free hemoglobin solution, oxygen extraction, vasoconstriction, isolated hindlimb vascular bed, oxygen supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over a period of 3 years, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 6 strains were isolated from warm water outlets and dental units in the Dental Faculty and from the Surgery and Internal Medicine Clinics at the University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany. In the bacteriological unit of the above-mentioned facility, L. pneumophila serogroups 3 and 12 were grown from warm water specimens. The medical facilities are located in separate buildings connected with a ring pipe warm water system. All L. pneumophila serogroup 6 strains isolated from the warm water supply reacted with a serogroup-specific monoclonal antibody, but not with two other monoclonal antibodies which are subgroup specific, reacting with other serogroup 6 strains. The NotI genomic profiles obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of 25 serogroup 6 strains isolated from the Dental Faculty over a 3-year period, 1 isolate from the Internal Medicine Clinic, and 4 strains from the Surgery Clinic were identical. Furthermore, all these strains hybridized with a 300-kb NotI fragment when a legiolysin (lly)-specific DNA probe was used. The NotI pattern, however, differed from those of six serogroup 6 strains of other origins, one serogroup 12 strain from the bacteriological unit, and another six unrelated strains of serogroups other than serogroup 6. L. pneumophila serogroup 6 strains which can be divided into only two subgroups by the use of monoclonal antibodies are differentiated in at least six NotI cleavage types obtained by pulsed-field electrophoresis.</jats:p>",
