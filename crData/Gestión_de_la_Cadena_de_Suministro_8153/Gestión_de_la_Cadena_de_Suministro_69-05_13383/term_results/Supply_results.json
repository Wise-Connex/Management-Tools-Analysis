Each of the 500 Mwth, gas cooled, uranium-thorium fueled, thermal reactor. The power requirements for the city include oxygen production, carbon dioxide removal, and fresh water production, as well as electrical power and heating. A 100% overload has been allowed for industrial and agricultural applications.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Authors' Note.</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Project Atlantis was a six semester hour design course for graduate students in the Nuclear Engineering Program of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin.

The continental shelf is usually defined as that portion of the U.S. coastline with an ocean depth of 600 feet or less. At the maximum depth the city would be subjected to a pressure of 275 psia and an ambient water temperature of about 40°F.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In order to move freely between the city and the ocean floor it will be necessary to maintain the living and working quarters of the city at ambient pressure. To prevent nitrogen narcosis, the inhabitants of the city will breathe a mixture of helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. Because of the higher thermal conductivity of the helium, it will be necessary to maintain an ambient temperature in the city of about 80° F to insure \"shirt-s leeve\" comfort. Other special environmental considerations are:Use of water for neutron and gamma-ray shielding.contamination of seawater by neutron activation or fission product release.Use of seawater as a low temperature sink for heat rejection.Flooding of the reactor core.The corrosive nature of seawater.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The power required from the reactor has been determined as follows (see Fig. 1):Air conditioningventilation-2000 ft 3 /hrperson, 1 Mwe.CO2 removal-IOO watts/ person by electrodialysis, 2 Mwe.O2 makeup-2 Ibs/personday by electrolysis, 6 Mwe.Non-industrial electrical: lighting, communications, entertainment, etc.-35Mwe.Industrial electrical 175 Mwe.Fresh water production 130 Mwth.Heating-240 Mwth.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The choice of a nuclear reactor to provide this power was made in order to satisfy the requirements of reliability and independence from surface supply lines.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Supplied with sufficient power, air, and water, the city represents a permanent, self-sufficient, undersea habitation.

An experiment involving 25 double‐cross hybrids showed that 16 of these hybrids gave a 10% or greater grain yield response to irrigation, whereas the remainder showed very little or no yield increase. Certain hybrids produced about as well without irrigation as the highest yielding irrigation‐responsive hybrids. Subsequent experiments examined the irrigation response of several single‐cross hybrids and their double‐cross products. In a season of severe drouth requiring major irrigation, yield response of the double‐cross products to irrigation was predicted very well by averaging the yield response of the four non‐parental single crosses of the four inbreds involved.</jats:p><jats:p>Examination of the soil water depletion pattern of single‐cross hybrids has shown that the yields are related to the capability of the plant to meet its water requirements during the critical fruiting period from existing soil water supply. Cited as examples are the cytoplasmic male‐sterile versions of several single crosses which rather consistently yield better than their fertile counterparts.</jats:p>",
