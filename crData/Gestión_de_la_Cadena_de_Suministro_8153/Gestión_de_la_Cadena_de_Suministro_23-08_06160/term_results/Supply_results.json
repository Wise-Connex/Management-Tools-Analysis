      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the acceleration of technological change and globalization, companies face increasing environmental uncertainty and complexity. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely damaged the global supply chain and aggravated the operational risks of supply chains. Industry and academia have conducted studies on the construction of resilient and integrated supply chains, and to date a bulk of empirical literature has already been accumulated. A notable feature of existing literature is the heterogeneity in the characterization of the relationship between supply chain resilience, supply chain integration, and supply chain performance. In this study meta-analysis and structural equation modeling (MASEM) methods are integrated to construct a theoretical framework of supply chain resilience, supply chain integration, and supply chain performance. 45 empirical studies (73 effect size data, 2092 samples) are selected from 10,623 papers published over the years 2013 to 2021 to explore the transmission mechanisms, the role of mediator variable, and boundary conditions of the relationship between supply chain resilience and supply chain performance. The results show that supply chain resilience can promote supply chain performance. Moreover, supply chain integration (supplier integration, internal integration, and customer integration) plays a partial mediating role for the impact of supply chain resilience on supply chain performance. Situations and measurement factors such as industry type, national culture (power distance), sampling area, and logistics performance have a certain impact on the relationship, and the usage of different indicators may lead to marked differences in conclusions regarding the relationship. By extracting the conclusions of existing empirical studies, this study proposes new insights into the mechanism of action of supply chain resilience, supply chain integration, and supply chain performance and provides specific suggestions for future supply chain management.</jats:p>",

These changes have made the supply network more complex, particularly with regards to sustainability issues, and have increased the vulnerability of the supply chain to sustainability‐related risks. However, despite the growing importance of sustainability‐related supply chain risks (SSCRs), there is a lack of understanding and inadequate research on critical aspects in the existing literature on this topic, such as how firms in volatile and demand‐driven sectors cope with SSCRs and how these risks affect the firms' operational performance. To address this gap, this study investigates the impact of sustainability‐related supply chain risks on suppliers, customers, and the economic performance of businesses in the garment industry in Vietnam. Using a sample of 254 garment companies, this study aims to develop a comprehensive measuring scale for supply chain sustainability risk and evaluates the effectiveness of dynamic supply chain management techniques in mitigating the impact of sustainability‐related risks on firm performance characteristics. The findings of this research reveal that there is a risk–return trade‐off for economic hazards, while no such trade‐off is observed for social and environmental hazards. Furthermore, we find that supplier management and supply chain integration methods can assist in the management of environmental hazards, leading to a positive outcome for both businesses and the environment. The research results provide both theoretical and managerial implications for mitigating the risks associated with sustainability in the supply chain. The results suggest that effective management of sustainability‐related risks can result in a win‐win scenario for both businesses and the environment.</jats:p>",

A sample size of 241 respondents comprising of Procurement officers, Finance officers, Production managers and senior managers was obtained randomly from the sugar manufacturing firms. Convenience sampling was then employed to select officers and managers from the sugar manufacturing firms. Structured and semi-structured research questionnaires were used to collect primary data from the respondents. The questionnaires were dropped and picked later to enhance the response rate. The qualitative and quantitative data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS version 28. Inferential analysis was further carried out by correlation analysis, regression analysis and hypothesis testing. The results were then presented using tables, graphs, charts and histograms.&#x0D;\nResults: Lead time management Practice was found to have a significant effect on supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing (t =5.05, p =.000), from the study results. This meant that a change in lead time management practice had a significant change on supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study further revealed that lead time management and supply chain leverage had a statistically significant association (R =.779, R2 =.607). Consequently, lead time management practice was responsible for 60.7 percent of the variation in Supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya in terms of production efficiency, production flexibility and cost reduction.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends that individual sugar manufacturing firms observes lead time practices in the acquisition of raw material supplies ensuring the shortest possible lead time, to increase production optimization and efficiency, thus supporting the theory of constraints. Consequently the sugar manufacturing firms will incur limited inventory related costs associated with stock outs or overstocking hence promoting performance, resource optimization and production efficiency and flexibility.</jats:p>"

But the instability of pure option contract where supplier and distributor deal only by contract makes it difficult for both sides to reach a consensus. They overcome the defect by combining operation model with wholesale price model, and the mix model can reach Pareto improvement because it will increase supplier and distributor's profit at the same time. The distribution of the increasing profit will be influenced by many internal factors. Among these internal factors, the risk aversion and bargaining power can affect the profit distribution between supplier and distributor to a large extent. This paper establishes the mathematical model and chooses risk aversion and bargaining power to analyze. They found that 1) the higher the risk aversion level of the distributor or supplier is, the more its profit will be, and 2) the one with more initiative in the negotiation will reap more profits from the other side in supply chain.</p>",

Methods A retrospective analysis was carried out on 113\npatients who were diagnosed with HCC in our hospital and received TACE\ntreatment. Furthermore, the perfusion-enhanced CT prior to the first\nTACE in each patient selected the tumor area from plain scan, arterial\nlate stage, as well as the portal venous stage to measure the average CT\nvalue and calculate HAC and PVC. All patients received follow-up care\nthrough August 2022. Besides, the independent predictors of PFS and OS\nwere acquired by COX regression analysis, and subsequently, the\nindependent predictors and the correlation between PFS and OS were\nevaluated by the Log-rank test, and the survival curve was drawn by\nKaplan-Meier. Results A total of 91 patients died, with a mortality rate\nof 80.5%, the median progression-free survival was 0.78 (0.23-2.13)\nyears, and the median overall survival was 2.04 (1.22-3.98) years.\nUnivariate and multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated that\nHAC and vascular invasion were independent predictors of PFS and OS\n(P&lt;0.05). By utilizing the optimal HAC cut-off value, HAC was\ndivided into low HAC and high HAC groups, and the liver function grade\nand largest tumor diameter were statistically distinct between the two\ngroups (both P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Preoperative HAC and vascular\ninvasion predict progression-free survival as well as overall survival\nafter TACE of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, HCC with HAC ≥\n0.042 and preoperative vascular invasion by now demonstrated on imaging\nare particularly susceptible to progression after TACE and have a\nshorter overall survival time.</jats:p>"

Institutional support at the national industry level, development of value-adding capabilities and manufacturing process flexibility at the organizational level enhances the SN’s ability to re-organize.

Decision-makers in multinational companies must recognize the long-term impact of their procurement decisions on the supplier ecosystem. Developing local supplier capabilities rather than relying on established global SCs will pay off with future resilience. It, however, demands substantial investment and radical changes across all SC tiers. The lesson for smaller firms is not to over-rely on the existing relationships with supply partners. Although trust-based relationships and collaboration are essential, over-commitment can be counterproductive during global disruptions. With a lack of visibility and control over the SC, operational flexibility is critical for small firms to adapt to shifts in supply and demand.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this empirical research is one of the first attempts to operationalize the social–ecological perspective of SN resilience.

A number of factors contribute to IWS, such as leakage and water shortage, leading to inequitable water distribution. A way to reduce the inequity in IWS systems is by planning or adapting the network for equitable water distribution, which requires software capable of describing IWS conditions, including not only pressurized flow but also free-surface. In this paper, a new index for equity analysis is presented and compared with the existing indices available in scientific literature. The comparison is based on the EPA-SWMM modelling framework and standard IWS operations, including pipe emptying and filling, have been considered. Results reveal that EPA-SWMM has great potential in simulating IWS systems, especially in the application for equity analyses, as it provides a more realistic description of the pipe filling and emptying operations compared to standard water distribution modelling software. Furthermore, a novel equation called volumetric coefficient was developed which has a significant advantage in identifying the nodes with a higher impact on network equity, and ensuring the fair distribution of supply along the distribution network, considering the relevance of nodal demand, which none of the other indexes in the literature were addressed.</jats:p>",

Supply chains are a simplification of what actually happens, and supply networks are much closer to what is real. When two companies engage in business as a buyer and a supplier, they form a buyer-supplier relationship. That is a dyad—two entities linked in a relationship. Yet, triads are the smallest unit where we can begin to observe network dynamics. A common triad in supply networks is the buyer-supplier-supplier relationship. If we extend the supplier-supplier relationship horizontally, we get a supply base to a buying company. If we extend the buyer-supplier relationship vertically, we see an extended supply chain. If we combine the supply bases and extended supply chains, we end up with supply networks. Using the network concepts and theories, we study the structural and behavioral patterns of supply networks. Further, using the theoretical lens of complex adaptive systems, we examine the dynamic and evolutionary patterns of supply networks. By doing so, we consider how to help make supply networks become more resilient and robust.</jats:p>",

The purpose is to find a way to minimize water shortage by the allocation distribution model from the reliability analysis results.\r\nMethod: In this study, in order to analyze the water supply reliability of Andong and Imha Dam, using the Allocation rule presented by Park et al(2007), based on the planned water supply of Andong and Imha Dam for a total of 360 months from 1993 to 2022, analyzed. From the analysis results, the reliability of stable water supply was evaluated.\r\nResults: In the case of supplying the planned water supply of Andong and Imha Dam, the analysis result of Rule(B), which considers the ratio of the storage and inflow of the dam in the reservoir operation analysis result, showed that the shortage of Andong Dam occurred the most at 23 months, Regarding the number of shortages of control points, Rule(A), which considers only the storage capacity of the dam, was found to be short at 39 months, which is the largest number of shortages. As for the frequency standard reliability, Rule(B) showed the highest reliability of 90%, but in the case of quantitative reliability, the reliability was similar in all cases.\r\nConclusion: In the water supply reliability, the reliability of stable water supply by supplying only the planned water supply amount is 94%, 93%, and 90% in Rule(B) of the allocation distribution model. 5% at the Andong dam, 7% at the Imha dam, and 10% at the control point. When water supply is evaluated with frequency reliability, it is judged that countermeasures for the shortfall are necessary. Next, in the case of quantitative reliability, when only the planned water supply was supplied, it was analyzed to be 95%, 94%, and 95% in all methods, so that the quantitative reliability was higher than the frequency reliability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper addresses the supply contracts within a decentralized supply chain comprising an upstream component supplier and a downstream manufacturer. With the need to invest in production capacity before the sales season, suppliers often make conservative capacity decisions due to uncertain demand, which gives rise to the double marginalization problem. The distribution of supply chain profits is typically determined based on each member’s relative bargaining power, often exogenously provided in the market. While numerous studies have been conducted to design supply contracts for coordination in decentralized supply chains, most of them overlook the supplier’s capacity constraints and the existing bargaining power structure. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a supply contract scheme that achieves coordination under any given bargaining power structure. The key finding of this paper is that two contract types, namely capacity cost-sharing (CCS) and surplus capacity compensation (SCC), can address the entire spectrum of bargaining powers. This study demonstrates how to identify a specific threshold for a given bargaining power structure, from which the appropriate contract type is selected. Through numerical illustrations, we present how to select coordinated contracts for different bargaining power structures and examine the influence of contract parameters on the profit of each supply chain member. The primary contribution is that this study provides actionable insights for practitioners to effectively implement coordinated contracts by presenting a straightforward and practical methodology.</jats:p>"

These uncertainties can manifest in two contrasting scenarios: supply surplus, where companies have excess items, and supply shortages, where there is an insufficient quantity of goods. Each situation demands a different approach from businesses to adapt to the varying outcomes and maintain a competitive edge in the market. Product backordering is one of the important things that companies need to deal with in an uncertain supply chain. A backorder occurs when a customer-ordered product or service is not in stock or cannot be supplied immediately, and the customer has to wait. Companies striving for a balance in managing backorders. Machine learning models can help to determine the probability of a product being backordered. In this research, we develop Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model that uses previously known parameters to predict the likelihood of a product being backordered.

The pandemic highlighted worker safety inadequacies as well as system vulnerabilities to supply chain disruptions. One result has been political and media scrutinization of beef processing concentration as a culprit for these disruptions. Breaking plants up into smaller, more geographically dispersed processing could help mitigate risk from large plant closures but would likely result in higher retail prices because of lost scale economies. Additionally, improving worker safety likely means slower processing even in larger plants, again likely raising retail prices. We use a choice‐based conjoint analysis to examine to whether and to what extent consumers would be willing to pay higher prices to support smaller plant sizes and improved worker safety, among other beef characteristics. Findings of the study suggest that consumers do not care, at least directly, about plant size but are willing to pay to reduce food miles for processed beef (indirectly implying more geographic dispersion). Consumers are also WTP to improve worker safety. Results also show positive willingness to pay for characteristics such as “grass‐fed” which is consistent with other studies.  [EconLit Citations: Q13, Q18, C25, C83].</jats:p>",

Primary evidence is gathered from 22 field interviews with eight companies from multiple countries, all operating in the textile and apparel industry. The interview data is triangulated using a cross‐industry focus group with 28 participants and secondary sources including company annual reports and website information. The study contributes to organizational ambidexterity theory by identifying how companies embed structural ambidexterity in their supply chains, and in so doing create ‘parallel supply chains’. Our findings show that companies partition their production in terms of width (meaning that specific product lines were relocated) and depth (meaning that specific production activities were relocated). Companies then use a mix of offshored production facilities to manufacture low‐margin, long‐lead‐time products as well as reshored/nearshored production facilities to make high‐margin, quick‐response items. The ability to swap production volumes between parallel supply chains enables supply chain ambidexterity, which in turn allows companies to exploit efficiency and flexibility benefits simultaneously. Managers are provided with an empirically informed, step‐by‐step framework for developing structural ambidexterity and building parallel supply chains.</jats:p>",

The first step is to perform a study of previous research on global supply chain method (GSCM) principles that can adapt and survive adversity, such as a pandemic. The second is to put forth a conceptual framework for the GSCM that would aid in the fight for a stronger GSCM in the event of future turbulence similar to that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Is there, perhaps, a viable GSCM after COVID-19? Can the COVID-19 pandemic-related international logistics system (GSC) turbulences be predicted with certainty using these GSCM concepts? Regarding the raised issues, the paper concluded that, although arguable, sustainable GSCM is feasible and can be accomplished utilizing JIT, supply chain mitigation, and supply chain visibility, as demonstrated by the manufacturing firms referenced in the article.</jats:p>"

Our study covers the period from January 2000 to September 2022. The study’s results indicate that total connectedness changes over time, suggesting that it is sensitive to time-specific developments and short-run events. The new construction area is more likely to lead, while the construction area, especially the completed area, acts as a follower in the supply side of China’s housing market. Directional connectedness indicates that supply-side shocks generally lead demand-side shocks. Moreover, shocks usually run from housing prices to the supply side, and from the demand side to housing prices. This study also supports the predictive ability of connectedness measures for macroeconomic conditions, suggesting meaningful implications for investors, real estate developers, and policymakers.\n<bold>JEL Classifications:</bold> R21, R31</p>"

This paper proposes a new inventory management model that explicitly integrates process improvement efforts to improve supply chain sustainability through the better use of capital (materials, assets, and technology) and labor (workforce and know-how). Under a desired service-level constraint, we study reducing setup (fixed) costs when they are expressed in terms of economic production functions of two (input) decision variables: the level of capital (e.g., process change, and technology investments) and the level of labor required. This research is motivated by lean manufacturing practices, which rely on shaping the operating environment and operating optimally within that business environment. Based on mathematical modeling and analysis, we provide closed-form optimality expressions and structural results that lend themselves to decision insights. In particular, we provide, along with illustrative numerical examples, results on the sensitivity of setup-reduction efforts to demand rates, variability, and explicit expressions for determining the required labor and capital resources. A generalization of the model for carbon emissions is also presented.</jats:p>"

This survey involved 61 personnel from the marketing and supply chain departments of an Indonesian state-owned enterprise. The data were analyzed using a quantitative method and partial least squares (PLS) approach. This study revealed that work overload and interpersonal conflict have a negative impact on positive behavior and actions, including OCB and affective commitment. In addition, the findings accentuate the importance of employees’ affective commitment because it directly encourages employees to take on extra responsibilities. Furthermore, social interaction does not moderate the relationship between work overload and interpersonal conflict on affective commitment. This study broadened perspectives on OCB concerning work-related stressors and provided direction for the managerial team to cope with workload and conflict in the decision-making process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Improving the efficiency in the links in the supply chains of agri-food products is relevant in terms of the assessment methodology and practical aspects for ensuring and supporting sustainable supply chains of products not only in individual channels of product movement but also in the end-to-end supply chain of products, i.e., from the field to the end consumer. However, it is still unclear which supply chain opportunities in commodity distribution channels are more effective for creating end-to-end sustainable supply chains for agri-food products. The purpose of the study is to develop a methodology for assessing the impact of agri-food supply channels on the efficiency and link in supply chains, taking into account the factors affecting them and developing recommendations for their improvement. Quantitative methods based on correlation and regression analysis using the EViews program on the basis of Kazakh statistical data for 2008–2022 were used. A methodology is proposed for assessing the effectiveness of the functioning and links in commodity movement in the supply chains of agricultural products at the macroeconomic level based on the consideration and use of important factors affecting the efficiency and links: production and sales volumes, total costs, and profitability for each supply channel: “production–processing–industrial production–trade”. The relationship between the efficiency and the links in supply chains and also the key factors that affect them have been established. The results showed that the increase in the efficiency in supply channels in the commodity distribution system leads to a decrease in the coefficient of the link in commodity movement and inventory availability. To reduce the link ratio in the supply chains of agri-food products, it is necessary to increase the efficiency in supply chains in each supply chain link and reduce the share of retail trade in the gross turnover. Recommendations are proposed to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce links to support and create end-to-end sustainable supply chains of agri-food products. The study makes an essential contribution to providing empirical evidence of the relationship between the effectiveness of agri-food supply channels and the link in the supply chain. Since few works describe the relationship between the links of product distribution and the efficiency in supply chains in the literature, in this work, it was possible to propose a methodology and identify factors and gaps in research to identify potential areas for future research.</jats:p>"

While\nthe seasonal variations of the mixed layer depth remain small, in\nparticular under the perennial sea ice (O(30m)), the mean salinity of\nthe mixed layer varies largely, with a seasonal cycle as high as 3 pss.\nOn the shelves, where the sea ice is seasonal, the mixed layer is much\nfresher but exhibits a seasonal cycle with a similar amplitude.

The\nlargest variations are found in summer, when the mixed layer is the\nthinnest.

If the infection rate spikes again, it can hamper the supply chain for food commodities such as rice. From this paper, the research target focuses on the structure of the supply chain in rice under government supervision operated by a national company. In distribution capacity, domestic rice is a local type of superior quality to every interisland agricultural cooperative in Indonesia. Overall, this scientific paper calculates the multidimensional disruption in the rice supply chain from across the major islands in Indonesia During a normal situation and after a pandemic. A series of annual report data sourced from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) are tabulated using parametric regression. The research sample is framed in a combination of agricultural cooperatives in 6 objects in Indonesia based on 12 key variables. The time panel is divided into two compositions: 2017–2019 (pre–Covid) and 2020–2022 (post–Covid). The output of the study clarifies that there is a significant relationship between pre–Covid and post–Covid to the manufacturing industry, quality control, logistics, land infrastructure, and sales significantly. Then, there was a significant link between pre–Covid and post–Covid from paddy production to the manufacturing industry mediated by supply, logistics to agricultural cooperatives mediated by land and marine infrastructure, then agricultural cooperatives to consumers mediated by sales. In relation to this research, the participation of stakeholders is suggested to adopt schemes and controls that are integrated with the transition of the rice supply chain. </jats:p>",

In the auto industry, it is essential to categorize suppliers and identify their strategic roles, as they are critical to NPD and cost competitiveness. One supplier can transact with multiple automakers and supply a diverse product portfolio. The types of supply strategies that reflect various trade relationships on the demand side and technological diversity on the supply side are presented. The supplier's strategies are divided into four categories based on alliance portfolio diversity and product portfolio diversity: DS(Dedicated Specialist), DG(Dedicated Generalist), MS(Multi- relational Specialist), MG(Multi-relational Generalist). As a result of cluster analysis applied to the Chinese auto industry data for 10 years, it was clearly divided into the presented four clusters, and significant differences between the clusters were identified in the portfolio diversity indices. The cluster with the largest number of suppliers was the DS strategy. The DS is a strategy to gain cost competitiveness by supplying a single part based on trust with an automaker. On the other hand, the MG is a strategy to supply various products to various automakers, and it was confirmed that the search cost can be reduced by supplying various parts with related technologies.</jats:p>",

To narrow down the research gap, this research considers carbon emission reduction in industry by applying supply chain management (SCM) under monopolistic competition with carbon neutral indicators. We develop a mathematical model within an agent-based simulation model and perform the design experimental methods to achieve the optimal decision-making of supply chain carbon neutral indicators. Findings show that green-credit policies and preferences of green products are effective carbon neutral indicators in SCM that help reduce global carbon emissions. Our research not only offers a reference and inspiration for the China government to reduce carbon emissions, but also helps government decision-makers explore the optimum level and decision-making of green credit and preferences of green products in a supply chain environment. Lastly, it enables manufacturers to achieve profit maximization and move towards carbon neutrality.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this research aims to investigate the role of green human resources management on the green supply chain management and the role of variables such as recruitment and selection, training, performance evaluation and rewards on the green supply chain management. In this research, data were collected through a researcher-made questionnaire and distributed electronically between 59 managers and experts from 40 manufacturing companies of various industries in Iran. All of the questionnaires were used. The Cronbach's alpha in the questionnaire was 0.70, which is an acceptable value. Finally, data was analysed using the LISREL software. The results of the research variables showed that the variable of recruitment and selection with the loading factor of 4.38, training with the loading factor of 4.37, performance evaluation with the loading factor of 4.91, and rewards with the loading factor of 4.92 analysed. The level of significance in all variables is less than 5%, which indicates confirmation of the relevant hypotheses. The results affirmed that the factors of the green human resources management were very influential on the green supply chain management. Additionally, the results illustrated that obtaining and recruiting suitable staff who have the competencies, skills, knowledge and ability to learn the future education, their training and development, assessment of the process with the aim of determining the results of the work of an employee and facilities shared by staff all have a significant impact on the green supply chain management</jats:p>"

This paper presents the result of a study on the energy supply performance of air-, water-, and dual-cooled PV/T systems in different climatic zones of China. The study investigates the impact of different cooling systems on the efficiency of PV/T systems and provides insights into the design and installation of these systems in different regions. The paper presents simulation results that indicate the effectiveness of air-cooled, water-cooled, and dual-cooling units in different temperature regions. The study finds that water-cooled systems have an irreplaceable advantage in terms of total efficiency, and the tuning method is relatively simple. However, caution is needed when choosing other cooling units in higher temperature regions. The research also highlights some limitations of the study, such as the lack of experimental data on extreme weather, calcification, dust, humidity, and other phenomena that can affect equipment efficiency. Overall, the study provides useful information for researchers and engineers working on the development and optimization of PV/T systems.</jats:p>"

To do so, two mathematical models for mixed-integer nonlinear programming are developed. The first model optimizes fixed and variable costs in addition to the opening cost, whereas the second model only optimizes variable and opening costs. To evaluate the effect of considering FC on the optimization supply chain problem, four groups of instances are randomly generated, and solved using Lingo. The results of the two models are compared utilizing the average percentage deviation. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of changes in opening and variable costs on the considered optimization problem. The computational results and the sensitivity analysis show that the first model with minimized FC outperforms the second model, which does not consider the FC in minimization and FC affect the optimization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The municipal water supply, related mainly to the cities of Albanian, began to develop in the second half of the 19th century and much intensively after 1945. Today the reported mean water production for the cities, on average, is about 300 l/capita/d including drinking and industrial water supply. The territory of Albania consists of uneven distribution of very heterogeneous aquifers conditioning the reach variety of the municipal water supply solutions. In this article are analyzed and classified the hydrogeological aspects of water supply sources of the settlements, which are summarized in five groups: (a) Wells in alluvial intergranular aquifers; (b) karst springs; (c) wells in karst aquifers; (d) springs in fissured rocks, and (e) mixed water sources. For each group of the water supply sources the main concerns regarding the quantity and quality problems are analyzed facilitated by the description of a variety of representative examples of different situations. Based on the gained experience important recommendation are given for the better understanding of hydrogeological aspects of water supply systems emphasizing the problematics along the river water recharge areas and on the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers, as well as on transboundary aquifers. However, the main problems of public water supply of Albania remain the poor management of water supply systems which is reflected in the e high water losses, as well as the low public awareness of request for sustainable use.</jats:p>"

To enhance the sustainable profitability of the omnichannel supply chain, this study considers price and lead time dependent demand with both known and unknown distributions, and establishes mathematical models to maximize profit under centralized situations. The study analyzes the variations in demand with lead time in the three channels and examines the effects of price and lead time on profit. Additionally, it investigates the interactions between price and lead time. Through numerical examples, the study illustrates the effects of the mean and variance of random demand on decision variables and examines the influence of potential demand and the sensitivity of lead time.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of gaining extra income from recycling tomatoes waste generated along the FTSC and to calculate the contribution of extra income from recycling tomato waste to reduce income inequality along the FTSC. Data were collected from 136 greenhouse tomato producers, 60 wholesalers, 18 exporters, 120 domestic retailers, 22 overseas retailers, and 3 recycling facilities in Türkiye. Marketing cost, absolute marketing margin, relative marketing margin and net profit margin were used when economically analyzing the FTSCs. Research results showed that the net profit share of the producer decreased associated with the increasing number of intermediaries. Research results also showed that revenue gained from composting and recycling of product loss and waste increased the welfare of greenhouse producer more than other supply chain actors. When taking into account the revenue from composting and recycling of wastes, producers increased their net profit by 9.85% at first FTSC, while that of second and third FTSCs were 8.29% and 9.21%, respectively comparing to the prevailing conditions. The contribution of extra revenue from composting and recycling of wastes to retailers was more comparing wholesaler and exporter. Retailers and wholesalers gaining from recycling in domestic FTSCs was more comparing to overseas one. Close cooperation between producers, wholesalers, exporters, retailers, and recycling facilities is essential for the effective implementation of waste recycling initiatives. Organizing the training and education programs focused on waste management can increase the extra income of producers and active intermediaries in FTSC from composting and recycling tomato wastes. Offering financial incentives, grants, or subsidies can encourage producers and other actors within the supply chain to adopt waste recycling practices. Continuous research and innovation are crucial in identifying and developing new technologies, processes, and strategies to minimize food loss and waste.

This shortcoming is particularly obvious in the food processing product supply chain traceability system. The data of each supply chain sector is stored in different databases. When regulatory authorities conduct information investigation and traceability, they must search multiple databases. The steps could be more convenient and easier to hold accountable by using the blockchain technology. A supply chain traceability system based on blockchain technology is designed to respond to these problems. The supply chain traceability system for processed food products is taken as an example to implement. This system is developed on the hyperledger fabric (HLF) platform, which realizes decentralization and tamper-proof, one-click traceability of the complete information and other functions.

Demand uncertainty, globalization, shorter product and technology lifespans, and growth in the number of logistics partners result in more sophisticated global supply relationships, which in turn, increase SC vulnerability. Generally, nervousness reduces SC effectiveness because SC instability is primarily caused by events that are external to the business domain. This tension creates uncertainty, increases the cost of maintaining supply chains, and makes relationships with suppliers and customers unpredictable. This study analyzed global SC nervousness (GSCN) components in terms of drivers, consequences, indicators, and pillars, and proposed solutions. A questionnaire was used to study and evaluate the characteristics of the GSCN, and the DELPHI–FAHP was used to analyze the results and designate the factors that most impact nervousness mitigation in the supply chain. To this end, a framework is presented to discuss the interactions of nervousness in a SC with an integrated solution.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>With the rapid development of the construction industry, the trend of construction industrialization is becoming more and more obvious. The competition among construction supply chains gradually replaces the competition among construction enterprises. Previous studies have shown that the information sharing behavior among participating entities in the supply chain is one of the key factors affecting supply chain competition. Based on evolutionary game theory, this paper constructs a tripartite information sharing game model for owners, general contractors, and subcontractors under the assumption that all parties involved in the supply chain can obtain relevant benefits but also bear the sharing costs and risks. The model is simulated using Matlab software. By constructing and analyzing the model, as well as conducting simulations, the aim is to study and determine the specific impact of changes in benefits and costs related to information sharing among all parties in the supply chain on the dynamic evolution process of the tripartite evolutionary game system, and to identify the key factors that affect the stable operation of the supply chain, in order to take effective measures to strengthen the stability of the supply chain and enhance its overall competitiveness. Research has found that an increase in the amount of information sharing, the coefficient of collaborative benefits, and the coefficient of collaborative effects in the game model will lead to an earlier time for the three parties to reach a relatively stable state during the evolution process, while an increase in the cost of information sharing and the risk coefficient of information sharing will delay the time for the three parties to reach a relatively stable state during the evolution process. This indicates that the more sufficient information sharing among all parties in the supply chain and the more benefits obtained from implementing information sharing are more conducive to improving the overall stability and competitiveness of the supply chain. However, the increased cost burden and risk losses faced by implementing information sharing are not conducive to the overall stability of the supply chain, thereby reducing its competitiveness. The benefits and costs related to implementing information sharing are key factors that affect the overall stability of the supply chain. In addition, the study also found that when all parties in the game adopt information sharing, both the sum of the three parties' profits and their respective profits are better than when all three parties adopt information non sharing, which proves that good information sharing behavior is an effective way to improve the overall competitiveness of the construction supply chain. This paper analyzes and identifies the key factors that affect the stable operation of the supply chain through research, and concludes that information sharing can effectively enhance the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. Based on this, countermeasures and suggestions are proposed to enhance the stability and competitiveness of the construction supply chain. It can be believed that the research conclusions can provide good guidance and reference for the decision-making of participating enterprises and supply chain management departments in the construction supply chain.</jats:p>"

Supplier selection in the apparel sector involves multiple quantitative and qualitative parameters. The use of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) models has been extensively studied in various business sectors, including supplier selection and investment assessment. This study aims to develop a decisionmaking tool to assist decision-makers in selecting the best supplier in the clothing sector within a neutrosophic environment with interval values. The Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Analytic Hierarchy Process (IVNAHP) and the Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Technique for Order Preference Similarity to Ideal Solution (IVNTOPSIS) approaches are employed in this research for supplier selection. Two questionnaires are designed and distributed to experts in textile companies. The first questionnaire is used to evaluate the weights of criteria based on IVNAHP, while the second questionnaire ranks the companies based on IVNTOPSIS.

Travelers' perception errors on travel time and their risk-aversive behaviors on mode choice and path choice are incorporated in the model with a hierarchical choice structure. Due to the differences between HVs and CAVs, the perception errors and the safety margin reserved by risk-averse travelers are assumed to be related to the vehicle type. The path travel time distribution is derived by using the moment-matching method based on the assumption that link capacity follows lognormal distribution and link travel times are correlated. Then, the underlying problem is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. A path-based algorithm embedded with the Monte Carlo simulation-based method is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the features of the model and the computational performance of the solution algorithm.</jats:p>"

The pattern can be created through a chemical coating and applied to both sides of the bearing raceway, transforming it into a replenishment-augmented rolling element bearing (RaREB) that exhibits reduced friction. RaREB bearings facilitate better distribution and replenishment of lubricant in the bearing raceway, leading to enhanced anti-friction and extended service life, particularly in situations with limited lubricant supply. Test results confirmed the effectiveness of RaREB bearings in maintaining the desired thickness of the lubricating film and reducing friction torque. Additionally, a droplet transport simulation model was utilized to demonstrate the effect of the stepped wettability on oil replenishment. The proposed design holds practical significance for enhancing bearing performance in extreme operating conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sudden onset of natural hazards such as a flash flood events can be devastating to a country or region, often affecting numerous communities, and humanitarian supply chains play a major role in enabling the timely recovery of economic and social activities. However, the uncertainty and suddenness of natural disasters such as flash floods, as well as the potential for aftershocks, require humanitarian supply chains to be resilient during the relief process. This research first adopts the Delphi and literature review methods to identify the key indicators in the humanitarian supply chain to form an evaluation index system. Then, taking the 2021 mega-flash flood event which affected four cities in the mountainous region under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou municipal government, the ANP method is used to calculate the weights of each indicator and combines the weighted results with the Multi-styling and stereotyping method under Pythagorean fuzzy (PFs-VIKOR) to make an evaluation of the resilience of the humanitarian supply chain in the relief process. The findings suggest that policy makers and decision makers should pay close attention to the coordination of the parties involved in the humanitarian supply chain and improve the level of resilience of the entire supply chain by enhancing the resource scheduling capacity and responsiveness. At the same time, the VIKOR evaluation of the 4 cities highlighted the humanitarian supply chain in Dengfeng City to be most effective in this event due to the close cooperation and positive response of all parties involved in the humanitarian supply chain. The findings of this research provide some useful suggestions and guidance to the various practitioners involved in the humanitarian supply chain. Furthermore, the evaluation of the performance of the four cities in this mega-flash flood event provides some helpful indication of the importance of the various emergency measures which can help to inform policy recommendations for the Zhengzhou municipal government.</jats:p>"

It used a systematic review of the literature to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence in support of wastewater reclamation and reuse for future cities. A model known as PRISMA was used to identify the most appropriate articles for inclusion in the study. Out of the 105 studies, a total of 46 articles were selected for analysis based on their relevance, content validity, and strength of evidence. The findings indicate that wastewater reclamation and reuse create additional sources of water for both domestic and industrial use, reducing the overall pressure on the natural water sources. Wastewater reclamation and reuse effectively increase water supply for future cities while minimizing pressure on natural resources and promoting environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

In particular, when generating subgeneration, the utilization of existing samples is low and the number of individuals is high. Therefore, surrogate-based optimization has been developed, which greatly reduces the number of individuals in the subgeneration and the cost of optimization. In complex air supply scenarios, single-objective optimization results may not be comprehensive; therefore, this paper developed a double-objective air supply optimization method based on the Kriging surrogate model and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms-II. And proposed the infill criteria based on clustering to advance the Pareto Frontier. The method was validated by an inverse prediction case, and in particular, the problems when based on 3D steady-state simulations were analyzed. The results showed that the method can quickly achieve an approximate prediction of the boundary conditions (when prediction were made based on experimental data, the number of simulations was 82 and the average error was 6.8%). Finally, the method was used to optimize the air supply parameters of a dual-aisle, single-row cabin. The Pareto set suggested that an airflow organization with dual circulation may be optimal.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer sells both traditional and new green products through respective offline and online channels. Using a dynamic model to analyze the price game of the dual-channel supply chain, we investigate the effects of delay time lag, price adjustment speed, and green input level on the equilibrium price of the new green product. We obtain the Nash equilibrium point and stability region through the eigenvalue method and conduct numerical simulations. Our study shows that the trajectory of the product price evolution depends on system parameters, and that an optimal level of green input exists to maximize the manufacturer's profit. Our research emphasizes the importance of pricing strategies and coordination between manufacturers and retailers in the dual-channel supply chain of new green products.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: A critical decision made by firms is whether to adopt a responsive supply chain (prioritizing speed) or an efficient supply chain (prioritizing cost). We consider the environmental implications of this choice, distinguishing between responsiveness achieved via three pathways: responsive offshore supply chains increase speed by using expedited production and distribution methods; responsive nearshore supply chains increase speed by reducing the physical distance between source and destination for all production; and hybrid nearshore supply chains produce in multiple locations simultaneously, increasing speed by reducing distance on some portion of production. Methodology/results: Using a model wherein responsiveness increases fixed and marginal costs, decreases leadtimes, and changes the per-unit environmental impact of production and distribution, we identify several results. First, all types of responsiveness can decrease environmental impact relative to an efficient supply chain, showing any form of responsiveness has potential to improve sustainability. Second, despite this, all types of responsiveness can also increase environmental impact relative to an efficient supply chain, particularly if demand variability is high. This is precisely when responsiveness is most profitable to the firm, indicating a tension between firm and environmental preferences. Third, a win-win outcome in which responsiveness both maximizes firm profit and minimizes environmental impact is most likely to occur when demand variability is high and unsatisfied customers substitute with a product that generates high environmental impact. Fourth, the firm may have incentive to choose a supply chain that does not minimize (and may maximize) environmental impact, especially at low-to-moderate demand variability. Managerial implications: While responsive supply chains can improve sustainability, they also generate the potential for misalignment of profit and environmental performance. We discuss the implications of this for firms and for policymakers seeking to encourage firms to use supply chains that generate the least environmental impact. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0152 . </jats:p>"

These circumstances demand significant paradigm shifts, placing supply chain resilience (SCR) in the foreground of boardrooms and agendas of executive meetings. Method: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of selected articles that examine the intricate interplay of I4.0 and SCR under investment constraints. Employing a funnel approach, this study delves deeper into about a hundred papers that were initially selected from a pool of approximately four thousand publications on SCR. The study thoroughly analyzes the interconnection between SCR, I4.0, and investment (INV) while classifying these articles in a structured manner, based on industry type and focus. Results: The primary aim of the paper is to identify trends, gaps, and potential opportunities for future research on the SCR-I4.0-INV interplays. Conclusions: The findings reveal that industries are converging towards the implementation of digital technologies as a strategic move to tackle unexpected, unplanned, and undesired situations. This research illuminates the needs for organizations to prioritize supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions and vulnerabilities while highlighting the potential of digital technologies to enhance their resilience, therefore ensuring sustainable growth.</jats:p>"

The hydraulic systems of free overfall depend on rectangular end shape. The studies that dealt with triangular crest are few and almost non-existent. In this study, a triangular end-shape design uses multiple linear regression (MLR) and group method of data handling (GMDH) methods for four models with six sub-models. Then, 24 scenarios were chosen and compared. The discharge coefficient (Cd) of a free overfall with a triangular terminal was predicted using experimental data. The triangular end edge shape increased crest length, the discharge coefficient, and discharge passing over free overfall. To this goal, 180 triangular free fall tests were performed. Data were collected for two triangular free overfalls with an opposite flow direction with three angles 600, 750, and 900. Results of Cd acquired using the two ways discussed above show that the algorithm GMDH outperforms the other method. Values for the GMDH approach mod46 testing variables: RMSE, MARE, SI, R2, and NSE are 6.08 × 10−17, 2.65 × 10−17, 6.00 × 10−17, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively, while these values for MLR are 0.06332, 0.05970, 0.06624, 15.431%, and −3.0419, respectively. The GMDH technique shows the best results concerning MLR and then chooses the best four scenarios from 24 with a Cd percentage error not exceeding ±2%.</jats:p>",

Since the 19th century, drug fraud has been a serious issue for the healthcare sector. The regulator y and healthcare organizations struggle from time to time to reduce the danger of negative outcomes brought on by fake medications. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), four out of every ten pharmaceuticals sold in underdeveloped or disadvantaged nations may be tainted. Ultimately, because of stolen, diverted, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, drug makers lose billions of dollars annually. The regulatory authorities are currently developing severe regulations to prevent criminals from supplying and diverting fake or stolen medicine in the supply chain. To offer patients with safe and authentic medications, the healthcare business needs strict rules and secure traceability technologies. In essence, pharmaceutical drug serialization offers benefits by enhancing the supply chain's drug security by lowering adverse occurrences and investigations. Additionally, tracking and tracing technology is used in pharmaceutical drug serialization to take advantage of the advantages of tracking individual drug packages in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, conventional microfluidic systems heavily rely on external bulky facilities, such as syringe pumps and compressed air supplies, for continuous flow, which restricts their dissemination across various applications. To address this limitation, micropumps have emerged as a potential solution for portable power supply in microfluidic systems, with piezoelectric micropumps being widely adopted. Nonetheless, the inherent pulsatile mechanism of piezoelectric micropumps leads to unstable flow, necessitating appropriate mitigation for applications requiring flow stability. This research introduces an innovative hybrid pumping system that integrates a wirelessly controlled micropump with a 3D-printed modular microfluidic low-pass-filter. The primary objective of this system is to offer a portable and stable flow source for microfluidic applications. The system design and characterization are based on a three-element circuit model. Experimental results demonstrate a highly stabilized flowrate of 657 ± 7 µL/min. Furthermore, the versatility of the system is showcased by successfully forming droplets with a polydispersity ranging from 1.5–4%, comparable to that of bulky commercial pumping systems. This hybrid pumping system offers a promising solution for applications necessitating portable and stable flow sources, and its reconfigurability suggests potential integration into multifunctional microfluidic platforms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>A comprehensive understanding of how socioecological factors can influence multiple ecosystem services (ES) may provide stakeholders with a management tool to coordinate economic development and environmental protection. However, previous studies have focused more on the supply side than on the demand of ESs. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms for the changes in the supply-demand balance of ESs and their multiple drivers remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, an integrated theoretical framework was developed to assess the interactions of socioecological factors, including land use and cover, social economy, climate, and topography, on the variation in the ES supply, demand, and balance, which were mapped at the city scale in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). A variance inflation factor (VIF) was employed to detect the multicollinearity of the factors, and the sum of Akaike weights were used to simplify driving factors and identify essential driving factors. We employed variation partitioning analysis (VPA) to reveal the effects of unique and combined drivers on the ES supply, demand and balance. The results showed that undersupply cities (11.93% of the area) were concentrated within the three national urban agglomerations and increased in area from upstream to downstream, whereas oversupply cities (88.07%) were mainly distributed in the surroundings of the urban agglomerations. According to the VPA, the essential driving factors could effectively explain the variation in the ES supply, demand, and balance in the YREB. More importantly, these driving factors were simplified with no significant decrease in explanatory power. In the oversupply cities, the ES changes were determined by socioeconomic factors (urbanization rate and population density), land use/land cover (cropland, woodland, and unused land), and their interactions. In the undersupply cities, population density (PD) could explain the majority of the variation in ESs. However, the effects of climate and topography on ESs were more prominent at the scale of all cities in the YREB. Besides, PD displayed a significant negative correlation with ES supply and balance, whereas it was positively related to ES demand in the undersupply cities. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the interactions of socioecological factors on the supply-demand balance of ESs. This study is informative for human well-being and sustainable socio-economic development of the region.</p>"

The optimal production planning for multiple enterprises in terms of cost optimization and carbon emission optimization are presented in various scenarios of the fully decentralized system under carbon taxation, cap and trade, and mandatory carbon cap. We prove a unified framework for modeling the scenarios enabled by carbon tax and cap-and-trade policies. Furthermore, the decision vector of the optimal production lot is obtained by analyzing the joint decision scenario based on shared carbon emission caps. We give a comparative analysis of two settings of fully decentralized and carbon quota sharing. The results show that the decision of joint production and stock preparation can reduce the total operational costs of the multi-enterprise system, but the realized carbon emissions may not change or only increase slightly. Our study provides a useful reference for government carbon emission regulation and enterprise operation decision optimization under carbon neutrality and a carbon peak environment.</jats:p>"

The samples in the research were farmers (raw material suppliers), animal feed entrepreneurs, animal feed traders and breeders consisting of 7 farmers (raw material suppliers), 5 animal feed entrepreneurs, 10 animal feed traders and 8 breeders with the research location is in the Simalungun Regency. Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that in general, the supply chain for corn as a raw material for animal feed in this study area is farmers (raw material suppliers) - animal feed entrepreneurs - animal feed traders - breeders (consumers). From a business point of view, the supply chain for corn as a raw material for animal feed has carried out two business processes, namely procurement and customer orders. Supply chain performance in the study area is quite consistent with a consistency ratio value of 0.015. The value points that there is good cooperation from partnerships such as raw material suppliers who are currently still able to meet demands from entrepreneurs, then the consistency obtained from this method is also related to a workforce that is skilled enough to help develop businesses and can support the development of product marketing.</jats:p>",

After successfully operating\n  for ten years since its first light in 2013, various subsystems are\n  undergoing updates. In the context of magnet power supply upgrades,\n  the trend toward digitization and high-precision modulation control\n  is driving advancements worldwide. This study focuses on developing\n  a fully digital correction magnet power supply (FDCMPS) based on a\n  digital signal processor (DSP). The prototype utilizes a low-power,\n  floating-point DSP with multiple communication functionalities as\n  the core control unit. The output current is converted into digital\n  values using current sensors and high-precision analog-to-digital\n  converters. Discrete PI compensator algorithms are implemented\n  within the DSP to generate pulse-width modulation (PWM) waveforms,\n  driving a full-bridge (H-bridge) converter configuration with\n  metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET). This\n  forms a complete, fully digital closed-loop current control\n  system. A virtual control interface is designed to operate the\n  FDCMPS state. The control loop design of the prototype has been\n  validated and demonstrates stable output bipolar current\n  performance. When tested with a 0.1 V input reference signal, the\n  prototype achieves a -3 dB bandwidth of 2.03 kHz. Finally, a\n  hardware prototype circuit was constructed in the power supply\n  laboratory, with an input voltage of 48 V, an output current of\n  10 A, and a maximum power of 400 W. Overall, the developed fully\n  digital correction magnet power supply prototype showcases stable\n  and high-performance output bipolar current performance. The system\n  achieves total harmonic distortion of output current ripple within\n  0.3 mA peak to peak and long-term stability within ±\n  15 ppm. The successful implementation of the prototype establishes\n  a solid foundation for advancing magnet power supply technology at\n  the TPS.</jats:p>",

This paper selects the supply guarantee facilities during the city-wide lockdown of Shanghai during March-May 2022 due to COVID-19 pandemic as the research object. In this research, the thermodynamic diagram map generated based on cell phone visits reflects the actual distribution of population, and the per capita supply guarantee capacity and supply guarantee overlay intensity are analyzed based on official list of facilities, and the actual role of the supply guarantee facilities are investigated through a public research questionnaire. Based on these analyses, the level of “supply guarantee resilience” was evaluated and graded for each district of Shanghai. It was concluded that the overall level of supply guarantee resilience was high in the central city, divergence in the near suburban districts, and generally low in the remote suburban districts. Based on this, the paper summarize the problems of supply guarantee revealed in Shanghai during the epidemic lockdown and propose strategies to improve the resilience of similar scenarios in the future. With the help of big data and public research tools, this paper aims to provide ways and methods to evaluate the resilience of cities under major public emergencies.</jats:p>"

The use of electricity for synthetic reactions without the need for hazardous chemical oxidants and reductants is recognized as a green and sustainable approach. We have recently developed a split bipolar electrode (s-BPE) system [1], in which the redox reactions can be driven in a low electrolyte concentration, with batch [2,3] and flow [4] cells. Herein, we report a novel s-BPE system for organic electrosynthesis driven under a streaming potential condition with a pressure flow. As a proof-of-concept study on electrosynthesis without an electric power supply, electrochemical oxidative polymerization of aromatic monomers such as pyrrole successfully yielded the corresponding polymer films on an electrode surface at the upstream, which acted as an anode [5].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] Shida, N.; Zhou, Y.; Inagi, S. <jats:italic> Chem.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tProton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is projected to become a key technology to enable the decarbonisation of ‘hard to abate’ sectors of the economy. However, the technology’s reliance on iridium, one of the scarcest elements on Earth, as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, has led to uncertainty over whether a large-scale PEMWE industry can be realised. This work investigates the future iridium demand of the global PEMWE sector and examines how different catalyst strategies can improve iridium utilisation in the anode catalyst. Iridium utilisation targets necessary to avoid a situation where the PEMWE sector becomes limited by iridium supply are reviewed. Modelling the iridium demand of the PEMWE sector showed that iridium utilisation needs to improve by an order of magnitude by 2050 to avoid iridium supply limiting the capacity expansion. Furthermore, closed-loop recycling of iridium would increase the installed capacity in 2050 by 170%. If these two conditions are met, global PEMWE capacity could reach 1.3 TW by 2050 using only 20% of annual global primary iridium supply, which we consider to be realistic given future demand projections. Different types of iridium-based anode catalysts are compared in terms of iridium utilisation using catalyst coated membrane (CCM) testing data from the literature. The need to place greater research focus on catalyst stability and the ability to make homogeneous catalyst layers at low iridium loadings is established. As a main result, it is found that a terrawatt-scale PEMWE industry can avoid being constrained by iridium supply as long as technological development of a similar level to that seen in PEM fuel cells and high iridium recycling rates are realised.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference: <jats:italic>Perspectives on Current and Future Iridium Demand and Iridium Oxide Catalysts for PEM Water Electrolysis</jats:italic>, submitted to Catalyst Today ‘Catalysis for the Future’ special edition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"2044fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>",

Due to complex networks, a lack of information transparency and traceability, and security risks, the information flow management in traditional logistics supply chains using centralized databases is now facing several difficulties. By combining the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain Technology (BT), it may be possible to collect information intelligently, store it decentralized, and allow for reliable, cost-effective information flow. Even while IoT-integrated blockchain-based systems offer sufficient benefits across industries, e-commerce supply chain logistics management has so far had a very low acceptance rate. Therefore, in this research, we suggested an IoT-integrated Blockchain approach for improving information security and traceability in the logistics of the e-commerce supply chain. Utilizing an IoT monitoring module, the data is gathered and processed by a smart contract before being entered into a blockchain. ILAES, an improved logistic advanced encryption method, is used to encrypt the data and generate a new data block. The Proof of Logistic Information Share (PoLIS) consensus mechanism is used to validate the data block before it is uploaded to the blockchain. Throughput, block execution time, encryption time, and avalanche impact are used to assess the proposed system's performance. The findings demonstrated how well the suggested solution improved the security and openness of logistical information.</jats:p>"

This paper establishes three differential game models, namely centralized decision making, decentralized decision making with the manufacturers’ rational preferences, and decentralized decision making with the manufacturers’ loss-aversion preferences. The models are used to analyze the mechanism of the lag effect and loss aversion on manufacturers’ R&amp;D investment in emission reduction, based on a two-level supply chain consisting of manufacturers and retailers. This study finds that: (1) The lag effect can encourage manufacturers to invest in the R&amp;D of emission reduction technologies. (2) There is a threshold value for the lag time, and only when the lag time is higher than this threshold value will manufacturers display loss-averse behavior. (3) When manufacturers’ degree of loss aversion is small, loss-averse behavior has a negative effect on their investment in the R&amp;D of emission reduction technologies, while the opposite has a positive effect.</jats:p>"

This paper has analyzed the characteristics of rural ecotourism based on the current situation of WR utilization, starting from the meaning of rural ecotourism, and has taken three tourist villages for research on the utilization of WRs. The results indicated that the WRs used in the tourism industry in rich villages in 2019 accounted for the highest proportion (28.81%) between 2010 and 2019; medium villages reached a maximum of 18.32% in 2017; poor villages in 2014 used the highest proportion of WRs in the tourism industry between 2010 and 2019, accounting for 37.76%. Poor villages have consistently spent the largest amount of water in the tourism industry. It showed that blindly utilizing WRs in the tourism industry could not promote economic development, only rational distribution could achieve sustainable economic growth and sustainable development of tourism ecology. This paper has also discussed the problems of water utilization in rural ecotourism development using this research and provides corresponding solution strategies, hoping to provide a theoretical reference for the sustainable development of rural ecotourism.</jats:p>",

We exploit within-individual changes in air pollution, and fixed effects estimates indicate that an increase of 1 μg/m3 in PM2.5 reduces an individual’s average hours worked by about 14 min per week. We then leverage the city-level roll-out of air pollution monitoring and information provision to test hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms. We show that individuals with poor health respond to changes in PM2.5 the most. For individuals who are environmentally unaware, this effect is mostly through an impact of pollution on health, while individuals who are environmentally aware engage in avoidance behavior.

Kenya’s manufacturing sector has come a long way in contributing to the country’s economic growth and development. However, the past decade has not been favourable for the sector, as it has recorded a significant decline in performance and growth characterized by loss-making, and declining production. With supply chain taking a huge portion of the industry’s operations, it raises the question on the extent to which supply chain of the manufacturing firms in Kenya has been aligned to suite the interests of suppliers, service providers, and customers as the key stakeholders in the supply chain process. The paper was anchored on the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model which describes the essence of organizations to map, measure, and optimize their supply chain processes. Informed by a descriptive research design, primary data was collected from 160 manufacturing firms in Kenya using a questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that supply chain configuration was significant in determining the performance of the manufacturing industry in Kenya. The findings revealed that configuring supply chain through promoting relationship with customers and suppliers played a significant role in reducing the costs of operations, enhancing quality and productivity thus enhancing profitability of manufacturing firms. A recommendation is therefore drawn that for the Kenya’s manufacturing sector to regain its strength and performance, there is need for the management to put more emphasis on supply chain processes by instigating strategies that enhance configuration of the supply chain network.</jats:p>"

PT X is a logistics company engaged in the oil and gas sector that runs its business as an industrial fuel agent. Currently, PT X distributes HSD B30 fuel to one of its customers, PT A, with a vendor held stock (VHS) distribution scheme. PT X in carrying out the fuel distribution process has problems because it is currently experiencing a transition period in the distribution scheme, related to information management and coordination and does not rule out the possibility of this type of service being used to other customers. Until now PT X still does not have a strategy in risk management that is useful in determining and making decisions.

From 11 preventive actions, 4 preventive actions were selected that can be taken as steps for the company to be able to maintain smooth distribution, increase the level of service in the VHS scheme and with this risk mitigation can be used as a step to open market opportunities. These preventive actions were selected based on the priority of the effectiveness ratio value in carrying out mitigation actions including performing better coordination between operational functions that has an effectiveness ratio of 39.5%, improving coordination with the transporter by 19.1%, evaluating the performance of transporter vendors by 9.2% and providing training for workers by 8.0%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study was to examine the impact of entrepreneurial orientation on the supply chain performance of firms operating within the food sector in Jordan. This study developed a theoretical framework for analyzing three key dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation: proactiveness, innovativeness, and risk-taking. The data collection process in the Jordanian food manufacturing sector involved a quantitative approach. A total of 192 respondents participated in the study, and the collected data was subsequently analyzed using SPSS software. The findings of the study indicate a significant positive impact on supply chain performance from two particular elements related to entrepreneurial orientation: innovativeness and risk-taking. Additionally, the study found that proactiveness had no significant impact on the performance of the supply chain. This study offers decision-makers seeking to establish a unique market position an opportunity to distinguish their supply chain operations by leveraging entrepreneurial orientation. Furthermore, this empirical study provides practical recommendations to organizations on enhancing various aspects related to proactiveness, innovativeness, and risk-taking. Firms with high entrepreneurial orientation excel in supply chain performance as they create customer-focused products, adapt to market changes, and maintain rigorous standards with suppliers and partners. This results in increased productivity, reduced distractions, and faster delivery. Moreover, the present study provides a theoretical contribution by proposing a framework that investigates the influence of three distinct types of entrepreneurial orientation on supply chain performance an area that has received limited attention in previous studies, particularly in the food sector.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to gain in-depth insights into the relative performance of e-commerce platforms in the context of predefined criteria and sub-criteria. The research methodology consists of six stages, including data collection, selection of criteria and sub-criteria, application of Certainty Factor, selection of case studies, relative analysis using MOORA, and certainty level analysis using Certainty Factor. The results of the analysis show that these two methods provide valuable insights regarding the performance of e-commerce platforms. The MOORA method provides a relatively strong rating, while the Certainty Factor provides an additional dimension by considering the level of certainty regarding the factors that affect performance. From a comparison of the results of the two methods, platforms such as Tokopedia.com and Shopee consistently rank well in both analyses. The implication of this research is that the e-commerce platform has greater development potential in supply chain optimization efforts. Overall, the integration of the MOORA and Certainty Factor methods has succeeded in providing more detailed and comprehensive insights into supply chain optimization on e-commerce platforms. This research provides guidance for stakeholders in making more informed and directed decisions regarding supply chain optimization strategies in e-commerce platforms</jats:p>"

Jar tests are performed to determine the required dose of coagulant; however, these tests are slow to be performed and do not give a response in real-time to changes in raw water quality that changes abruptly during the day. To overcome this limitation, this research developed artificial neural network (ANN) models, using full-scale WTP data that served to calibrate the model and then predict the coagulant dosage, considering raw water as data input, in compliance with the treated water quality parameters. The best model was able to predict the coagulant dosage with a mean squared error of 0.016 and a correlation coefficient equal to 0.872. These results corroborate to promote coagulant dosage automation in WTPs, making it clear that ANN models allow a faster response in dosage definition and reduce the need for human interaction in the process.</jats:p>",

This study is the first attempt to use the ES matrix to link marine uses and the capacity to supply ES. Combining expert- and literature-based evaluations, we assessed the relationships of twelve marine uses and five selected ecosystem services in the German North and Baltic Sea and mapped their spatial distribution. Despite a limited data availability and a higher need for simplification, the matrix approach proved to be applicable for the marine realm. Areas used for tourism and those that provide coastal safeguarding show high values of ES supply in comparison to areas used for sediment extraction and areas previously used as ammunition dumping areas. Nature conservation areas tend to have the highest capacity to supply ES. Differences in the ES supply pattern between the North Sea and Baltic Sea were identified. The results show the influence of anthropogenic activities on the spatial distribution of ES supply and can support future marine planning. </jats:p>"

Among them were policies, adopted in the 1490s and thoroughly studied by scholars, that disrupted Novgorod’s relations with its Baltic trading partners and prompted major adjustments to its patterns of export. But even earlier, in the 1480s, Ivan introduced policies that dismantled the long-standing and well-organized system of supplying large quantities of squirrel pelts, one of Novgorod’s major exports, to the market. The economic effect of these policies, which had been designed to consolidate his political authority over the subjugated region, was seemingly unintentional.</jats:p>",

The present study demonstrates a solution for the operation of flooding problem in a multiple-purpose reservoir. A reservoir on River Narmada in central India is chosen as the case study. The multiple objective problems comprised maximization of hydropower releases, minimizing spills, and achieving stipulated target storage at the end of the operation period. The chosen optimization models are the Differential Evaluation Algorithm (DEA) and its variants: the Enhanced Differential Evolution Algorithm (EDEA) and the Modified Enhanced Differential Evaluation Algorithm (MEDEA). The EDEA model is modified in the present study to MEDEA. The results of all three models applied to the same case study are compared on convergence to an optimal solution. All three algorithms were tested on two of the popular benchmark functions that are Ackley and Sphere. The results of both applications demonstrated that MEDEA proved to be the best in terms of converging to the optimal solution, exhibiting better stability, and quality of final results. The outcomes of this study also provided an effective way to optimize large scale multi-purpose and multi-reservoir flood control operation problems.</jats:p>",

To preserve their structure and function, biopharmaceuticals such as cells, proteins and enzymes, RNA molecules, and RNA-based drugs (e.g., mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines) require low temperatures for proper handling, storage, and transport. Due to the sensitivity of these products transported through cold chains and the lack of traceability, risks associated with the stability, efficacy, safety, tardiness, quality, and waste are significant. For this reason, the ability to quickly find, connect, and do business with a new supply chain partner, such as in cold chain partnering is essential. Many researchers suggested various approaches to improve the effectiveness of cold chains. However, standardization and interoperability remain open challenges. Motivated by the biopharma risks and the need for interoperability, this paper presents a preliminary investigation into a novel approach for automating the onboarding of new supply chain partners. Based on the analysis of previous efforts in the cold chain domain, the notion of external context is recognized. In addition, the paper introduces the notion of business context which is proposed as a basis for a novel approach to achieve agile supply chain via automatic supply chain partner onboarding. Cold chain networking is used as a specific case study. The investigation results show that, with identified improvements, the approach has a potential to increase the automation in supply chain integration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Background\n Efficient health supply chain management contributes significantly to the accessibility of medicines. Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) face challenges in maintaining an uninterrupted health supply chain of health products including non-communicable diseases (NCDs) medicines and nutrition products where stock-outs and shortages are evident. This study aimed to gather perspectives of policy implementers on the supply chain of NCDs medicines and nutrition products in Rwanda.\nMethodology\n An observational cross-sectional study collecting qualitative data was structured. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 51 individuals involved in the supply chain of NCDs medicines at different levels including central institutions, peripheral level, and hospital level. All interviews were in English and after transcribing the recorded information, a thematic analysis was employed for the emerging theme.\nResults\n Policy implementers at the central level identified key challenges in the management of NCDs medicines, such as supplier delays, poor data quality from health facilities, and difficulties in handling unexpected donations. At RMS Ltd branches and district pharmacists, challenges included limited storage space for nutrition products, transportation issues, inconsistent availability of products, unforeseen additional costs, and data quality concerns. The healthcare professionals (HCP) addresses these challenges through effective stakeholders communication, available resource management, early planning, selecting reliable suppliers, increasing sponsorship, supervision and capacity building of the staff at health facilities.\nConclusion\n The management of NCD drugs and nutrition products in Rwanda's health supply chain faces challenges related to medicine stock-outs, budget constraints, and inadequate inventory data recorded by health facilities, hindering informed decision-making. Policy implementers showcased various approaches to mitigate these challenges. However, investment in the quality of inventory data is crucial, as it can inform a risk-based inventory approach and foster the optimal utilization of available funds.</p>"

Therefore, this project intends to conduct an in-depth discussion on income distribution and equity in the big data environment from the game perspective, using \"game\" and \"principal-agent\" theories as tools. The results of the game show that if both parties have fair motives in the monopolistic income distribution game, they can get reciprocal distribution results and reduce the income difference. On the contrary, the two parties will not be able to obtain reciprocal distribution results, so the income difference may become larger. In the context of big data, the gap between the rich and the poor can be reduced from the aspects of system construction and justice concept.</jats:p>"

The classical time series forecasting methods compared are the moving average, weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, adjusted exponential smoothing, linear trend line, Holt’s model, and Winter’s model. The Mean Absolute Percent Deviation (MAPD) value was determined for the various forecasting methods to find the forecasting method with the least MAPD and hence the highest forecasting accuracy. The tracking signal measure was also used to determine the forecasting models which were biased. The results showed that though the weighted moving average method began to underforecast demand in the final period, it had the lowest MAPD value of 2.25%, making it the forecasting method with the highest accuracy for predicting the 50cl bottled water demand. On the other hand, though the exponential smoothing forecasting method had the highest MAPD value of 3.43% and least accuracy for predicting the bottled water demand, its forecasts were consistently within the tracking signal control limits. This study will aid supply chain analysts in implementing accuracy assessment of classical time series forecasting models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The notion of responsible packaging innovation has become a key tenet in the current supply chain architecture. This essay examines the complex interplay between cost, usability, and sustainability in the context of packaging methods. The shifting nature of packaging trends from traditional uses to modern sustainable solutions emphasizes the role's flexibility. The sustainability imperative is examined, with a focus on how packaging materials affect the environment and how the regulatory environment is changing. Responsible packaging integration into supply chains necessitates multi-stakeholder cooperation, where manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and consumers all work together to influence the course of sustainable projects. By transforming packaging from a passive defender to an active player in the customer experience, functional packaging innovations are being driven by advances in material science and user-centric design. The complicated balance between sustainability and financial feasibility is revealed by taking into account cost, including both initial investments and long-term consequences. Case studies from leading businesses in the sector highlight effective methods for implementing sustainable packaging while also highlighting the lessons discovered from difficulties encountered. Technological advancements transform the packaging industry by merging IoT-driven data and cutting-edge materials that support ecological obligations. The significance of packaging as a communication tool that communicates brand values and encourages loyalty has increased as a result of consumer perception and demand. The importance of packaging that connects with sustainability-conscious values is highlighted by the influence of the conscientious consumer on purchase decisions. But navigating problems like cost, convoluted supply networks, and consumer education calls for tact. The view for the future predicts trends including improved materials, digital integration, the adoption of the circular economy, and eco-design principles that will continue to influence supply chain packaging innovation. As a result, striking a balance between sustainability, usability, and cost within responsible packaging is not only a transformative journey but also a crucial step towards a more sustainable and resilient global supply chain landscape.</jats:p>"

In terms of the effectiveness of carbon abatement, comparative studies on coordination mechanisms are absent in the existing literature. On this basis, aiming at the cooperative abatement strategy between power generation generators and sellers under the carbon tax policy, this paper has developed four decision models: the Stackelberg game led by power generation enterprises, the simultaneous Nash bargaining decision by both parties, the vertical integration decision by supply chain enterprises, and the cooperative carbon emission reduction game by supply chain enterprises, to analyze the changes in electricity price, sustainability level, power sales, and profits of supply chain members. The results of the numerical analysis show that user preference for blockchain technology and an increase in the proportion of low-carbon electricity information uploaded to the blockchain can significantly improve the sustainability level of the electricity supply chain. The level of investment in green technologies by electricity producers under cooperative abatement decision-making increases compared to the electricity producer-dominated Stackelberg game model. The sustainability level of the electricity supply chain is higher under the Nash simultaneous decision than under the abatement cost-sharing decision, but the decision-maker’s profit is lower. The values of overall profit and sustainability level of the electricity supply chain are both highest under the vertically integrated decision.</jats:p>"

Penelitian ini mengkaji perubahan tutupan lahan dan pengaruh perubahannya pada pola ruang terhadap luas area banjir dengan membandingkan hasil pengolahan tahun 2022 dan tahun 2031 dengan memanfaatkan teknologi sistem informasi geografis (SIG). Hasil yang didapatkan menginformasikan kenaikan sebesar 1.081% yang berpusat di bagian timur, timur tenggara hingga selatan Kabupaten Karawang. Hal ini memberikan pengaruh pada nilai koefisien C (koefisien limpasan) yang menghasilkan nilai 0.91 (mendekati 1) yang artinya kondisi lahan semakin jenuh atau sudah sedikit memiliki daya serap terhadap air yang dapat mengakibatkan banjir di lingkungan kawasan tertinggi pada kelas tinggi (&gt; 1.5m). Jika dikaji pengaruhnya terhadap sektor industri berdasarkan studi literatur didapatkan pengaruh aktivitas rantai pasok (supply chain) diantaranya pembatasan kegiatan, naiknya biaya distribusi, rusaknya fasilitas, pasokan utilitas terhambat, efek kesehatan, degradasi tanah, dan dibutuhkannya waktu serta biaya dalam penanganan pascabanjir. &#x0D;\nKata kunci: Banjir; Tata Ruang; Tutupan Lahan; Sistem Informasi Geografis, Rantai Pasok&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAbstract&#x0D;\nIndustrial estates are areas where industrial activities are concentrated, equipped with infrastructure, facilities and other supporting facilities. The development of industrial area areas is an important thing to observe in this study, especially in industrial sectors in Karawang. There is a transfer of functions in spatial patterns that have an impact on the environment, one of which is the absorption of water, which causes flooding in the industry. This study examines changes in land cover and the effect of changes in spatial patterns on the flood area by comparing the results of processing in 2022 and 2031 by utilizing geographic information system (GIS) technology. The results obtained indicated an increase of 1,081% centered in the eastern, southeastern to southern parts of Karawang Regency. This has an effect on the value of the coefficient C (runoff coefficient) which results in a value of 0.91 (close to 1), which means that the condition of the land is getting saturated or has little absorption of water which can cause flooding in the highest area environment in the high class (&gt; 1.5m). If the impact on the industrial sector is studied based on literature studies, it is found that the influence of supply chain activities includes activity restrictions, increased distribution costs, damage to facilities, hampered utility supply, health effects, soil degradation, and the time and cost required for post-flood handling.&#x0D;\nKeywords: flooding; spatial layout; land cover; Geographic Information System, Supply Chain</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A software and information complex for modeling multi-node integrated and autonomous power and heat supply systems is proposed. The main difference of the proposed software and information complex is the possibility of a detailed consideration of the influence of economic and technological parameters contained in the power system of individual power units and nodes. These parameters can be presented both in the form of matrices on the sheets of the software and information complex, and in the form of separate attached files available for automated input by the software and information complex. The main advantages of the complex, which distinguish it from the known ones, include versatility, which makes it possible to study various models of energy systems in a short time. This versatility is ensured by the fact that the complex is developed using a combination of standard Microsoft Excel software and SolverStudio – an add-in for Excel 2007 and later versions on Windows, which allows you to explore a variety of optimization models using a large list of optimization modeling languages. With the SolverStudio add-in in the information package, the user can develop, edit, save, and debug an optimization model in an Excel workbook. The connection of source data, sets, parameters, constants and variables used in the model is conveniently organized. After editing the parameters and source data, the model is launched. Simulation results can be displayed both on model sheets and displayed as separate files. Another advantage of the software and information complex is the ability to conveniently compare many models, due to the fact that each of the worksheets can have its own model. The developed software and information complex makes it possible to calculate in detail the energy, technological and economic indicators of the optimal use of power system components, to determine the permissible limits of the operating parameters of power units of autonomous and integrated power systems. The results of these calculations make it possible to select appropriate measures for the future renewal of technologies for the production of electric and thermal energy. The ease of use and editing of both individual parameters and program texts used in modeling the development of power systems improves the quality of the resulting development scenarios. The proposed software and information complex can be used to study the prospects for short-term and long-term development of Ukraine, as well as the energy system integrated with the power systems of neighboring ENTSO-E member countries, which is relevant in these conditions.

The widely used infrared sensors in the market generally detect the temperature changes that occur when a person moves in a room to determine whether there is someone in the room. This means that when a person stays stationary for a long time, the machine may not be able to recognize the temperature changes, resulting in problems such as power outages in the room. Therefore, the existing products have some shortcomings and still need to be optimized. Therefore, in response to the problem that infrared sensors cannot respond to a stationary human body for a long time, a device capable of periodically shielding the probe of an internal pyroelectric sensor is studied in the product structure to enhance the sensor’s sensitivity to a stationary human body, thereby solving the problem of not responding to a stationary human body for a long time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles are widely used in the United Arab Emirates (UAE); however, their production and disposal adversely affect the environment. In collaboration with the private sector, the UAE government has taken serious steps to reduce these impacts, including (i) encouraging people to stop using PET water bottles and to separate their waste, (ii) establishing material recovery facilities, (iii) constructing facilities for incineration with energy recovery, and (iv) creating business opportunities to downcycle and recycle PET water bottles. This paper models the PET supply chain (PSC) using system dynamics (SD) to simulate the current PSC in the UAE and to project its possible evolution from 2023 to 2050, taking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into consideration. For decision-makers, the SD model shows that PET reductions must equal population growth to maintain GHG emissions associated with the PSC for the coming years. In addition, the separation efficiency must exceed 33% of PET consumption to meet the current demand for used PET. Moreover, if PET consumption decreases by more than 1.5%, then businesses relying on used PET will face a supply shortage in the year 2050. As for environmental impacts, it is found that if downcycling and recycling capabilities are fully utilized, GHG emissions will decrease by 35%. Furthermore, if demand for recycled PET reaches 10,000 tons, this reduction will exceed 47%, reaching 177,861MtCO2e.</jats:p>"

The finite element analysis is used to study the reason for dielectric layer cracking and discuss the improvement measures from the thickness of thermal conductive gel and the layout of components. The simulations results show that the reason for dielectric layer cracking is that the surface-mounted device (SMD) is too close to the mounting hole when the copper substrate bottom is coated with thermal conductive gel, reducing the thickness of thermal conductive gel or keeping the SMD away from the mounting holes can avoid the dielectric layer cracking, but it is easier to change the location of SMD.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on assessing groundwater quality in the Tebessa aquifer system, a primary water source for various needs. The investigation is prompted by challenges like hydric stress, aridity, urbanization, and population growth, which impact water demand and quality. Factors such as intensive agriculture and industrial activities contribute to declining groundwater quality. The study employs the Water Quality Index (WQI) method, which combines multiple parameters to evaluate water health comprehensively. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology aids in analysing spatial relationships, crucial for hydrogeological processes. The study incorporates a multiparameter approach to create maps of water quality, with parameters including pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and various ions. These maps reveal spatial variations and priority classes ranging from 'Excellent' to 'Very Poor' in groundwater quality. The main objective is to enhance understanding of groundwater quality dynamics in semiarid regions and identify management strategies. The Tebessa-Morsott Plain in Algeria serves as the study area, characterized by a semi-arid climate. Field and laboratory investigations were conducted to analyse hydrochemical characteristics. The results show diverse ranges of parameters, indicating alkalinity, salinity, and elevated concentrations of ions. By analysing interrelationships and spatial variability, the study contributes to both scientific understanding and informed water resource management. Geospatial mapping and the generation of a groundwater quality index map illustrate varying levels of water quality across the study area, guiding strategic decisions for sustainable water resource management.</jats:p>"

In order to mitigate climate change, major policies such as reducing GHG emissions are required. Many countries have proposed carbon emission reduction targets at the national strategic level. A crucial issue in achieving the target is low-carbon energy transition, which requires a large amount of clean energy metals as supporting materials. This paper summarizes the latest research results of existing literature on the supply of clean energy metals in achieving the goal of carbon reduction, including the definitions, demand changes, supply capacity assessment, supply risk evolution, supply guarantee and policy system, etc . We point out that further research should be conducted in the following three directions in the future: firstly, strengthen research on the impact of trade and geopolitics on the supply of clean energy metals; secondly, further evaluate the effectiveness of minerals security policies in various countries; finally, broaden the analysis of the clean energy metals supply to encompass the entire industrial chain perspective. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 pandemic highlighted food systems’ fragility, especially concerning global trade. On the other hand, the pandemic underlined the resilient character of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs), as citizen-consumers continued to buy through such sales channels, in order to limit virus spread, and farms developed innovations and rapid strategic responses. In a fragile context, such as that of inner areas, SFSC may represent, for farms, a significant competitive tool to increase their resilience. This study aims to investigate the degree of resilience of farms in inner areas of Campania Region (South Italy) and the role of SFSC during the pandemic. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of wineries in inner areas of Campania in order to detect their resilience score, which was measured, according to literature, through three variables: effectiveness, flexibility, and responsiveness. A linear regression was run to identify variables affecting farms’ resilience. Results show that both farmers’ and farms’ characteristics turned out to affect farms’ resilience score, such as the turnover, the use of SFSC, and farmers’ age and education. This study’s findings could be helpful for decision-making in the development of inner areas, and for providing targeted policies to manage unexpected events in different scenarios.</jats:p>"

This can lead to documentation fatigue and contribute to nursing burnout. The aim of this quality improvement project was to design and implement a supply item scanning process and evaluate the effect on intraoperative documentation completion time, room turnover time, picklist documentation accuracy, nurse satisfaction, and burnout. The sample included nine acute care hospitals throughout the United States, with 189 total circulating nurses and 31 718 procedures occurring during the study timeframe of 8 months. Results indicated that nurses were able to complete documentation on average 37.33 minutes sooner, and the operating room turnover time decreased by 1.88 minutes. Although nurses reported that their perceived picklist documentation accuracy did not improve, and the presence of new scanning technology did not influence their hospital employment decision, subjective feedback was mostly positive, with most responses citing the helpfulness of scanning for documentation. This study shows that an interdisciplinary team can effectively work to optimize documentation efficiency and performance improvement using a scanning intervention. Lessons learned through this process can translate into optimizations elsewhere in the electronic medical record.</jats:p>"

Transport has an enormous contribution to society in functioning our daily life also a cause of environmental degradation. More than 95% of containerized cargo are moving from/to Chattogram Port by using road mode that is liable for Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, congestion, and high transport cost. Rail intermodal is facing capacity constraints in Dhaka rail Inland Container Depot (ICD), and river intermodal is under-utilized for the shortage of hinterland logistics facilities, the mindset of users, and poor terminal productivity. This research applied the quantitative method to analyze the port throughput of Chattogram Port and its hinterland connectivity by nodes to get innovation and sustainability to identify environmental factors in international freight movement economically. On the basis of a literature review, and explored research gaps before data analysis, it is clear that environmental factors including SDGs are not considered in the inland freight transportation systems of Bangladesh. The research findings alerted that people in the freight movement system do not present a wide awareness of their activities and due diligence to environmental sustainability in creating a wider room for the next generations. The quantitative analysis of port throughput data indicated to increase in the share of intermodal especially river intermodal which has a wider scope to use available river ports in all parts of the country naturally. The practical impact of the research is to formulate a long-term environmental strategy in freight transport, corporate execution by all transport business-oriented companies/organizations, and enabling technologies in inland freight operations and monitoring. Overall, this paper provides a conceptual framework for the environmental sustainability of inland freight transportation systems in Bangladesh in doing international shipping and trade.</jats:p>"

The economic impact of frequent water supply disruptions from the Selangor River in Malaysia due to technical issues, water pollution, and climate-related problems was estimated using the stock flow measure to assess property at risk, and survey to estimate business loss. The findings revealed that commercial, residential, and industrial property valued at RM459,041 million in 2020 in the State of Selangor and parts of Kuala Lumpur were at risk due to frequent water supply disruptions. A survey of small and medium enterprises from the manufacturing, construction, and services sectors revealed that 46% of the respondents were affected with losses amounting to RM2,053 million. The total economic impact of water supply disruption in 2020, combining both property value at risk and business loss, amounted to RM461,094 million, which accounted for 34% of Malaysia's GDP. A number of recommendations are made to prevent the widespread occurrence of water disruptions.</jats:p>",

Therefore, indicators such as soil texture and effective porosity have been defined to measure the amount of water available to the plant. The pore size determines water energy and the plant's ability to absorb moisture, which is evaluated in this article. Multivariate regression analysis between the integral energy of water in different ranges of humidity as the dependent variable and the indices of soil pore size distribution as the independent variable has been investigated. Due to the fact that none of the indices of the pore size distribution curve have a significant relationship with the integral energy value of water in the permanent wilting point, therefore, it was not possible to estimate this index using the indices of the pore size distribution curve. The results showed that the elongation index of soil pore size distribution curve is the only factor determining the amount of integral energy of water in different soil water contents.</jats:p>",

The impact for managerial is because the lead time that has not reached a superior position has a strong relationship with volume flexibility where long waiting times will result in the inability of the supply chain to maintain the flexibility of production volume, of course, this will have an impact on daily inventory, because it still have to wait for the schedule for the delivery of raw materials plus the production and marketing process.</jats:p>"

A novel microchannel (MC) solar thermal collector and a microchannel-based hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collector (PVT) were fabricated (utilizing a microchannel heat exchanger in both cases), mathematical models were created, and performance was simulated in TRNSYS software. A water-to-water heat pump (HP) was integrated with these two collector-based solar systems, namely MCPVT-HP and MCST-HP, to improve the total solar fraction. System performance was then compared with that of a conventional solar-thermal-collector-based system and that of a PV-resistance (PV-R) system, using a monocrystalline PV collector. The heat pump was added to the systems to improve the systems’ efficiency and provide the required DHW temperatures when solar irradiance was insufficient. Comparisons were performed based on the temperature of the preheated water storage tank, the PV panel efficiency, overall system efficiency, and the achieved solar fraction. The microchannel PVT-heat pump (MCPVT-HP) system has the highest annual solar fraction among all the compared systems, at 76.7%.

This paper proposes a framework for strengthening tourism supply chain infrastructure in Jammu and Kashmir using knowledge management and the SECI model. The framework is based on the following four pillars: Creating a knowledge-sharing culture; Developing knowledge-sharing platforms; Providing training on knowledge management; and Measuring the impact of knowledge sharing. The proposed framework is a valuable tool for strengthening tourism supply chain infrastructure in Jammu and Kashmir. By implementing the framework, tourism professionals can share knowledge, create new knowledge, and improve the overall performance of the supply chain.

While MMs are applied in various fields, their scope, design, and application criteria within Supply Chain Management and Logistics (SCML) lack comprehensive studies. This article aims to address this gap through a systematic literature review. The review analyzes 137 relevant articles using both bibliometric and content analysis techniques. The bibliometric analysis identifies major contributions, popular journals, and the classification and evolution of key keywords. The content analysis focuses on critical criteria related to the scope, design, and application of MMs. The findings reveal a growing emphasis on models assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and sustainability principles. However, several gaps are identified, including limited attention to optimizing and integrating logistic processes, underutilized and unvalidated MMs, and the absence of comprehensive improvement guidelines. Based on these trends and research gaps, this study proposes five recommendations for future developments that benefit both academics and practitioners. These recommendations aim to address the identified limitations and provide guidance for comprehensive and effective improvement strategies.</jats:p>"

In the present study, conducted at one of the leading international universities in Uzbekistan, Westminster International University in Tashkent (WIUT), data on 43 students’ experiences, opinions, and expectations as well as 100 original reflective essays have been analyzed using different corpora to examine whether corpus-based data could serve the ground for material design or not and whether it can indeed function as a source of hypotheses regarding language teaching. The accumulated data along with the designed materials outline the scope for follow-up research into the effectiveness of the corpus-based approach in teaching reflective writing.

Examining financial distress and trade credit in the Australian creditor-friendly context expands on existing research. Prior research has predominantly relied on data from the United States, which has debtor-friendly bankruptcy law.

The governance structure of the plastic waste’s circular economy supply chain tends to be relational, considering historical relationships, environmental uncertainties, power imbalances, and fairness perceptions. On the other hand, recycling factories strictly adhere to a contractual governance pattern concerning risk perception.

This study proposes a novel hybrid workflow that combines machine learning and a geographic information system to identify the fewest locations where providers can initiate cargo drone services to yield the greatest initial benefits. The results show that by starting a service in only nine metropolitan areas across four regions of the contiguous United States, drones with a robust 400-mile range can initially move more than 28% of the weight of all pharmaceuticals. The medical community, supply chain managers, and policymakers worldwide can use this workflow to make data-driven decisions about where to access the largest opportunities for pharmaceutical transport by drones. The proposed approach can inform policies and standards such as Advanced Air Mobility to help address supply chain disruptions, reduce transportation costs, and improve healthcare outcomes.</jats:p>"

This research was conducted at SMES Photo catalyst Ceramics in Bali, with research objects on collaboration value innovation, supply chain capabilities, competitive advantage. The research population is all ceramic SMEs in Bali. The results of this study indicate that Collaboration of the value of innovation has no significant negative effect on competitive advantage. This indicates that there is no relationship between photo catalyst ceramic SMEs to produce an innovation, so this also provides a negative value in creating competitive advantage between business actors. Collaboration of innovation values provides positive value to supply chain capabilities, collaboration provides great opportunities in sharing information related to resources to support the development of photo catalyst ceramics. The ability of the supply chain to provide significant positive results for competitive advantage, with the capabilities of good information actors from raw materials to ceramic products will certainly provide great opportunities in achieving competitive advantage; this also shows that the mediation of supply chain capabilities becomes full mediation in relationships, collaboration value innovation and competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Frequency domain pressure response expressions for two widely used water supply systems were analyzed in dimensionless frequency and time domains. One is the simple reservoir pipeline surge tank valve system and the other is the pipeline system with pump and check valve protected by surge tank. Two different dimensionless expressions for the surge tank were developed and the performance of two expressions was compared. The frequency response pattern of impedance at the downstream valve indicated that the system resonance was determined by the lengths of the main pipeline and the connector and the locations of the surge tank and check valve for the protection of the pumping station. The difference between the simple pipeline system and that of a pump with a check valve was expressed in terms of the phase difference in frequency response distribution. The integrated pressure response for the protected pipeline section was evaluated considering the impact of surge protection in the frequency domain. A better understanding of system behavior can be obtained in terms of specific component isolation both in the frequency and time domain pressure responses. The driven responses in the frequency and time domain can be an important basis for optimum design and operation conditions of water supply systems in dimensionless space.</jats:p>"

To achieve the outlined nexus between study variables, the present study leverages on a battery of panel analysis for robust inferences. The econometric estimators employed are panel random effect regression, generalized method of moment technique. Furthermore, panel Granger causality test is utilized to analyze the direction of flow among the variables for the study. Empirical results revealed that financial development is a significant determinant of energy supply in West Africa countries while a negligible effect was reported for institutional quality and sustainable energy supply. Thus, the present study concludes that finance from financial sector is important in ensuring sufficient energy supply. To this end, this study therefore, recommends that incentives should be given to financial institutions that fund energy generation and transmission as financial development is seen to be significant on energy supply.</p>"

Using random effects ordered logistic regression on panel data from 2017 to 2022 for 2811 companies, we show that companies with long-term investment sources demonstrate a greater interest in measuring environmental variables in their supply chain compared to those financed with short-term investments. Sovereign wealth funds and other long-term investment sources exhibit a positive and significant correlation with higher utilization of ESG indicators in the supply chain.

This study aims to identify the leading factors driving PHFL and construct a practical decision-making framework for the fisheries industry's development. Employing the fuzzy TOPSIS method, we scrutinized the critical causes of PHFL. Our literature review revealed four aspects and 13 operational processes contributing to PHFL across the supply chain. Among these processes, four drivers were the primary culprits: excessive fish capacity in shipping baskets, inadequate ice cooling during transportation to suppliers, insufficient ice cooling during supplier sorting, and the absence of appropriate tools for small retailers. To alleviate PHFL and enhance the fishery industry, priority should be given to addressing excessive fish capacity in shipping baskets, which poses a risk of physical damage during transit. Moreover, inadequate ice-cooling techniques, particularly in transportation and supplier sorting stages, raise public health and food safety concerns. Stakeholders must prioritize these critical factors for PHFL reduction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the design of supply chain networks should be based on environmental issues as well as the needs of customers since the main driver of a supply chain network is customers. Continuous innovation of products requires understanding the features that are most important to customers, and product pricing should be carried out in a way that includes the satisfaction of both customers and manufacturers. This study uses the Kano model to classify product features into different categories. The design of the green supply chain network based on the Kano model has not been investigated in the literature so far. This study examines a green supply chain network including multiple manufacturers, product types, distributors, and carriers that is designed based on Kano’s conceptual model of multiple needs. In the proposed mathematical model of this paper, customer demand is a function of the selling price of the product, transportation pollution is minimized, and a solution based on the Cooperative Game Theory approach is used to solve the mathematical model using the GAMS software. One of the advantages of the proposed mathematical model in this research compared to other supply chain models is that the design needs of the supply chain network based on the Kano model (“must-be”, “one-dimensional”, “attractive” and “indifferent”) can be determined based on customer satisfaction. In addition, the price of the product can be determined according to the satisfaction of both customers and the manufacturers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While it is understandable that lean and green practices are mostly sensible for large companies, it is also important to bring these practices to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as they are the dominant players in various industry sectors. SMEs are part of larger supply chains and contribute substantially to the economy, and thus perhaps there is a need for a workable model that attracts them to the lean and green practices. This study aims to find gaps in the lean-green research area that require development in future studies, especially for SMEs. This study uses an analysis of systematic literature reviews (SLR) and involves carefully selected articles from different databases or sources. This SLR was conducted in an effective and structured way using keywords entered into the search engine and found as many as 157 peer-reviewed journal articles, which were studied further using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The bibliometric analysis carried out made it possible to observe research trends on lean and green from 1996 to 2022. To find different research dimensions on lean and green topics, an in-depth evaluation was carried out on the linkage between lean, green, supply chain management, sustainability, and other management approaches. This study finds a lack of empirical research studies that comprehensively focus on investigating the impact of lean and green practices on the supply chain sustainability performance of manufacturing SMEs and involve all three aspects of the triple bottom line (3BL). Our review suggests such a robust and workable model for SMEs is not currently available. A limitation of our review is the use of keywords or “terms” to select articles, as well as the subjectivity of the researcher. Finally, we identify the research streams, criteria, findings, limitations, and enablers or challenges of 17 selected published journal papers on lean-green studies in SMEs and propose a number of research questions for future research directions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An integral aspect of global businesses and economic activities is the supply chain networks. Importantly, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic scenario has further shown that the outbreak of diseases can create a global network-scale disruption to supply chain or logistics, thereby damaging several aspects of economic activities and business life. Hence, this study aims to assess the resilient supplier selection (RSS) process in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. A two-stage hybrid decision model using Pythagorean fuzzy sets was proposed as a case study from the automotive industry to deal with RSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the first stage, significant criteria and their corresponding sub-criteria were determined through a vast review of the literature and nominal group technique, while the relative weights for RSS were obtained through the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PFAHP) method. In the second stage, nine suppliers were evaluated with Pythagorean Fuzzy VIKOR (PFVIKOR) method. The results of the hybrid approach revealed that flexibility is the most important criterion among resilience criteria that constitute the most significant dimensions for RSS. In many studies, strategic criteria such as quality, cost, and delivery are found to be the most important criteria in supplier selection, however, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the opinions of decision-makers were significantly changed as the present study reveals that flexibility is the most important criterion to improve the operations of the supply chain for RSS. Next to flexibility is process capabilities, while quality (Q), and cost (C) existed as the first and second in the category of influential criteria for strategic supplier selection criteria, respectively. The managerial and practical implication is that, in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions, suppliers need to be re-evaluated based on resilience-related indicators.</jats:p>"

However, the specific mechanisms of how digital transformation and green supply chain development interact still need to be clarified, which can help supply chain business operators to enhance supply chain sustainability more effectively. This paper focuses on how the companies’ organization structure and the socio-economic environment interact with digital technologies under the process of green supply chain development. Based on the “Technology–Organization–Environment” (TOE) framework, this paper analyze how digital transformation can drive green supply chain development. To test the TOE theoretical analysis framework, this paper calculates the digital transformation and green supply chain development index at the provincial level in China and conducts an empirical study. The main findings and implications of this paper can be summarized in the following aspects: First, according to the TOE theory, the external environment dimensions, such as the market and policy environments, affect the role of digital technology in promoting GSC development. Second, in the organizational dimensions, labor–capital relations, company size, and ownership factors can all affect the contribution of digital transformation to green supply chains. Third, there are differences in the impact of different types of digitization technologies on GSC development.</jats:p>"

To bridge this gap, we employ marginal effects analysis based on the binary logit model to examine the effect of SC factors on market participation among smallholder cereal crop producers in Tanzania. Data were sourced from 359 smallholder cereal crop producers using a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The findings of the study indicate that SC infrastructure negatively and significantly affects smallholders’ market participation decisions ( β = −0.0918, p &lt; .0013). Furthermore, the results of marginal effects suggest that market participation by smallholder cereal crop producers is positively and significantly affected by the extent of competition between agricultural SCs ( β = 0.1729, p &lt; .0001), SC distribution strategies ( β = 0.2911, p &lt; .0015) and collaborative SC ( β = 0.1856, p &lt; .0002). These findings provide sufficient evidence to conclude that SC factors are significant predictors of market participation among the surveyed smallholder cereal crop producers. Consequently, streamlined measures should be undertaken to help smallholders increase their odds of market participation. These measures may include upgrading road infrastructure to tarmac or bitumen standards, especially in rural areas where farming takes place, infusing farmers’ associations and agricultural extension services, promoting collective marketing and strengthening long-term relationships between farmers and traders. Finally, the study offers valuable information to policymakers and agricultural stakeholders regarding addressing smallholders’ market participation challenges from a SC perspective. </jats:p>"

To overcome this, the authors integrate twin support vector machine into it. A manager's attitude toward risks also plays an essential role in efficiency improvement and value generation, but numerical messages do not convey such information. Textual messages with elastic natures thus bring information beyond just numerical messages. To assist users in quantifying risk types, the authors introduced an advanced text analyzer to conjecture a manager's attitude toward each risk. The results show that the performance evaluation model with forecasting capability can shift the manager's role from monitoring the past to planning the future.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Decision-making in the design of Manufacturing Supply Networks (MSNs) is complex owing to the need to account for decisions made by groups at multiple levels and the interactions that include potential conflicts and uncertainties. Decisions are made based on information available from simulations that employ computational models. These models are abstractions of reality and are therefore sources of uncertainty. This necessitates that the focus be placed on design space exploration to identify a robust satisficing solution set. Hence, the need to support the efficient exploration of multilevel design/solution spaces, simultaneously.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many of the frameworks that facilitate multilevel design employ optimization-based iterative approaches that are computationally expensive and ill-suited for design exploration. Frameworks that support robust design exploration are limited by their capability to support the efficient exploration of multilevel design/solution spaces, simultaneously. Hence, the requirement to facilitate the ‘multilevel robust co-design and solution space exploration’ of MSNs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, we present a framework that allows designers to: i) model robust decision-making and their interactions across multiple levels, and ii) visualize and systematically carry out co-design exploration of multilevel design/solution spaces. In the framework, we combine a Preemptive formulation of coupled Decision Support Problem with robust design constructs and interpretable-Self-Organizing Maps (iSOM) based visualization to facilitate multilevel robust co-design. We use a steel MSN problem with decisions being made at two levels to test the framework. Using the problem, we demonstrate the utility of the framework in supporting designers in modeling multilevel decision-making under uncertainty and their interactions, and efficient co-design exploration of the robust design/solution spaces in MSNs. The proposed framework is based on information and decision flows, making it generic and capable of supporting designers in the robust co-design of multilevel systems.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a system dynamics model was proposed by creating a cause-effect curve to increase supply chain (SC) performance with an emphasis on agility and flexibility (AAF) indicators. The proposed model aimed to reduce cost and delivery time and increase customer satisfaction by considering AAF indicators. To this end, the concepts used were first introduced. Afterward, the important goals were identified by reviewing the existing literatures and interviewing experts in the field of AAF indicators in the studied SC. In the next step, the model was constructed by determining the cause-and-effect (CAE) relationships between the variables. Finally, by developing and simulating different scenarios, the results showed that AAF alone and absolutely cannot enhance profitability. By implication, to increase profitability, AAF do not need to be enhanced to the highest level, but an optimal point must be found. Finally, an optimal level of AAF was estimated. by using this system and considering that this system supports the production line, the ability to respond to sudden demands is increased and as a result, the speed of covering these demands increases.</jats:p>",

It is native to Australia, where it is an abundant species living across the whole continent in stable populations. Outside its natural habit, the red kangaroo is a common species found in zoos and as patients in wildlife rehabilitation centers. Reports on kangaroo anatomy are scarce. Describing detailed anatomy is a base for establishing diagnostic and treatment protocols for different species of animals. Cardiovascular diseases and pathological changes suggestive of hypertension have been previously described in kangaroos. This creates a necessity for detailed studies on species’ vascular anatomy. New reports in the field of detailed vascular anatomy can bring considerable information that complements numerous studies on the evolution or biology of individual species. In this article, we describe the arterial vascularization of the brain and nearby regions of the cranial cavity using various anatomical techniques.

In addition, the neutral section exists at each power supply section, which restricts the development of the high-speed and heavy-haul railway. This paper proposes a novel co-phase traction power supply system (TPSS) based on a YNvd balanced transformer, which can not only solve the above problems but also save one single-phase coupling step-down transformer, thus reducing the cost and space of the whole system. In addition, the voltage level of the converter switching device can be reduced by the rational design of the transformer tap position, which enhances the reliability and feasibility of the system. The compensation principle and control strategy of the co-phase TPSS based on the novel YNvd balanced transformer are analyzed in detail in this paper, and the compensation current detection and integrated power flow controller (IPFC) control methods are given. Simulation and analysis show that the proposed topology structure and control method are correct and feasible.</jats:p>",

Through the production, processing, recycling, and reprocessing of composite materials, the sustainable supply chain model of four different schemes is designed, and the data results of each scheme model are calculated and analysed. The tool can support supply chain modelling solutions that seek best practices for sustainable supply chains and optimize resource efficiency through cost and carbon dioxide emissions. The sustainable supply chain model was designed, created, and optimized in AnyLogic software using System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation modelling methods based on the supply chain model established by previous researchers. According to the analysis results of the model data, the reasonable design of the whole process can effectively reduce the cost and carbon dioxide emissions and achieve the effectiveness and implementation of the sustainable supply chain. The results of this study will provide reference for more sustainable supply chain models in the future.

We construct demand functions for online and offline, considering promotion and substitution relationships by a revised Bertrand model. We first consider three classic models: the decentralized decision model, the equilibrium decision model, and the centralized decision model. In the decentralized decision model, the platform decides both the promotional effort and the online discount; in the equilibrium decision model, the platform decides the online discount, while the food service provider decides the promotional effort. In the centralized decision model, the takeaway platform and the food service provider have maximized the overall profit as the decisive goal. We find that the online discount decreases in price when the impact factor of the online promotion is high but increases in price when the impact factor of the online promotion is low. Then, we analyze and compare the results under three models. We find that when the substitution factor is low enough, or the impactor factor of online promotion is low enough, the global optimal platform discount is higher than the equilibrium platform discount and the decentralized online discount; otherwise, the results are the opposite. In addition, the global optimal promotional effort is always higher than the optimal promotional effort in the decentralized model. When the substitution factor is low enough, or the impactor factor of online promotion is low enough, the global optimal promotional effort is higher than the equilibrium optimal promotional effort; otherwise, the result is the opposite.</jats:p>"

Previous studies on SSFs mainly focused on their application in commercial or other scenarios. However, SSFs in residential areas have not been thoroughly studied. This study develops an analytical framework for assessing both the supply and demand for SSFs in residential areas. The study evaluates 2693 residential communities and 479 smart parcel lockers (SPLs) in Tianjin, China. The results show that the high-demand area for SPLs is within 300 m of home, while the high-supply area is 300–600 m from home. Further analysis using the Gini coefficient and location quotient shows that the top 20% of the population have access to 80% of SPLs, and most residential communities experience an oversupply. Our study suggests that a mismatch between the supply and demand of SPLs may result in massive public space waste, resource waste, and inequity. Given the many uncertainties of the future, this study highlights the need to consider the dynamic supply–demand relationship of SSFs. This may encourage urban planners, policymakers, and experts in other related disciplines to work towards a more service-efficient and equitable utilization of SSFs in residential areas.</jats:p>"

Therefore, four types of ESs were chosen for the Hexi region in this study: food supply, carbon sequestration, water yield, windbreak and sand fixation. This study evaluated the supply-demand and matching relationships between various ecosystem services tapping into the InVEST model, the supply-demand ratio of ecosystem services, and the four-quadrant model. It also analyzed the supply-demand ratio of comprehensive ecosystem services and their cold and hot spots. The findings suggest that (1) the overall ESs supply showed an increasing trend, with a spatial pattern of “high in the southeast and low in the northwest”. The demand for food supply and carbon sequestration services has been increasing annually, while the demand for water production and wind and sand prevention services has been declining. The demand space is characterized by a layout similar to the distribution of population, production and living areas, and ecologically vulnerable areas; (2) From the perspective of quantity matching, with the exception of windbreak and sand fixation services which are in short supply, all others are in a state of oversupply. Regrading spatial matching, all ESs are primarily dominated by low-low spatial matching zones, with large areas concentrated in the northwest desert region; (3) The supply-demand ratio of overall ESs shows a fluctuating upward trend. The proportion of cold spots and sub-cold spots, which are mainly concentrated in the northwest region, accounts for more than 50%, while that of hot spots and sub-hot spots is relatively small and mainly appears in the Qilian Mountains of the southern region and a few oasis areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the importance of green entrepreneurship and sustainable supply chain management practices has become increasingly recognized. Green EO refers to a firm's proactive approach towards incorporating environmental considerations into their business strategies. Green supply chain management, on the other hand, involves incorporating environmentally friendly practices throughout the supply chain, from raw material procurement to product delivery. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between green EO, green supply chain management practices, and environmental performance. Additionally, the study aims to investigate the mediating role of environmental performance in this relationship. The results of the study suggest that green EO positively influences green supply chain management practices, which in turn leads to improved environmental performance. Furthermore, our findings indicate that environmental performance serves as a mediating variable, strengthening the relationship between green EO and green supply chain management practices. These results provide important insights into the importance of green EO and sustainable supply chain management practices for enhancing environmental performance. They also emphasize the need for firms to adopt a proactive approach towards incorporating sustainability into their business strategies.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Dutch networks focus on water quality and use smaller diameter pipes in branches. The branched network discharges much less water after a burst, which may reduce local flooding, traffic disruption, and product loss. In addition, high velocities and transient pressures are shown to be much localized in the branched Dutch network after a burst, reducing the risks associated with the intrusion of contaminants. However, despite improved water quality, less water loss, and more localized transients, the branched network cannot meet water demands downstream of the burst until the pipe is repaired, unlike a traditional looped network. For modern buildings that meet current design guidelines, the Dutch are content with much lower fire-flow requirements that provide the flexibility to improve water quality and reduce the consequences of pipe bursts, especially water loss.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing population growth rate in Bali Province has led to the depletion of water sources, while the demand for providing clean drinking water continues to rise each year. To improve water supply, the Central Government, Provincial Government, and Local Authorities are undertaking an effort to construct the Titab Dam with an associated water supply system called the Burana Drinking Water Supply System (SPAM Burana) with a flow rate of 350 liters per second. Considering this situation, a research study is needed to analyze the water demand over the next 15 years based on the projected population using Arithmetic, Geometric, and Least Square Methods in five service areas: Penyabangan Village, Musi Village, Sanggalangit Village, Gerokgak Village, and Patas Village. According to the analysis results, the Geometric Method was used for population projection, with the smallest standard deviation of 185.368 and the coefficient of correlation (r) closest to 1, with a value of 0.877. The water demand for the next 15 years was found to be 82.39 liters per second in the five service areas. To optimize the provision of clean drinking water, the analysis recommends using GIP (Galvanized Iron Pipe) with diameters of 40cm, 20cm, and 25cm, starting from the Gerokgak Reservoir to Patas Village, with a total distribution pipeline length of 15,438 meters. WaterNet, a computer program, is required for simulating water flow in the distribution network with minimal relative errors. The WaterNet analysis results showed that the criteria for flow velocity (0.3 – 1 m/s), headloss (&lt; 10 m/km), and pressure (15 – 100 m for GIP) were all met. The required capacity of the Gerokgak Reservoir for the water supply service is 1400m3.</jats:p>"

Further, an improved normalized normal constraint (INNC) Pareto method is developed to address the optimal financing strategy of the bi-objective model. We then conduct a numerical case of a Taiwanese steel firm to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Results show that our model provides a portfolio of optimal solutions on Pareto frontier which can be applied as an effective decision support system when designing a GSCF.

Amid changing livelihood context due to migration, transition to a federal governance structure, and social hierarchies, communities face persistent inequities in access to safe water, while its supply continues to diminish. In this context, increasing competition for water has in many instances resulted in the fulfillment of water needs of some groups, while compromising the water needs of others.  In such instances, it is usually the poor and marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected. Moreover, understanding the factors affecting equitable access to an adequate supply of water now particularly after Nepal’s entry into the new federal governance system, and COVID-19 pandemic is paramount.\r\nBased on the learnings of 3-year research project that seeks to understand the role of gender and power dynamics in the functionality of community water systems, this paper will provide insights on collective water management practices. A mix of qualitative inquiries such as focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, social and institutional mapping, and observation were utilized to collect the data. This paper will present evidence from the project sites highlighting how community institutions are managing the supply and distribution of water particularly by discussing factors influencing equitable water supply.</jats:p>"

However, having the complete and consistent information needed to quickly investigate sources and identify affected material has proven difficult. Food trace-ability is challenging for a variety of reasons including diversity and heterogenicity of participants, complexity of the supply chain and its processes and lack of a common understanding of steps in a supply chain, and incompleteness of data, and unwillingness of actors to expose information of their internal operations. The objective of this work is to address the traceability challenge by developing a formal ontology that can provide a shared and common understanding of the traceability model across all stakeholders in a food supply chain. In previous research, an ontological approach was adopted to address the traceability problem in the context of a use case related to harvest to on-farm storage activities. This work extends the Supply Chain Traceability ontology by introducing additional critical tracking events including transform event, sampling event, observation event, custody change event, and ownership change event in the context of a scenario involving shipments of commodity grain from a primary grain elevator to a processor of grain such as a feed manufacturer. A knowledge graph is generated based on a simulated dataset and the ontology is validated through query, reasoning, and visualization conducted in the RDFox environment.</jats:p>",

We found that the digital supply chain was positively associated with trade credit provision. Specifically, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1) the digital supply chain strengthens trade credit provision, including to customers and suppliers; (2) top management team power positively and significantly moderates the effect of digital supply chain; (3) among the sub-indicators of the digital supply chain, the dimensions of logistics, products and information have significant and positive impacts, while cash is insignificant; (4) curbing financialization and enhancing asset specialization are the mechanisms of the effect of the digital supply chain; and (5) the effect is more pronounced in firms with higher agency costs and lower supply chain collaboration and non-state ownership, and it is more salient in industries with higher competition and non-national support. We extend the theory of trade credit and enrich the literature on the digital supply chain. Our study offers managerial insights into the digital supply chain for emerging countries and enterprises.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose:  This paper aims to investigate medicines' supply and demand challenges at Princess Marina Hospital in light of the prevalent shortage and unavailability of medicines in both the public and private sectors globally. Despite this, medicines remain essential commodities to healthcare systems. For Botswana, the unavailability of medicines situation has worsened over the past years due to complications from HIV, and AIDS. There was a need to investigate the supply and demand challenges of medicines at Princess Marina Hospital, Botswana's largest hospital.\nMethodology: A quantitative methodology using a close-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 41 pharmacy personnel at Princess Marina Hospital. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel.\nFindings: The supply and demand challenges identified are low manufacturing capacity by manufacturers, shortage of raw materials, poor supply chain management by local suppliers, Botswana’s uneconomical small market, inefficient logistic supply system, irrational use of medicines, Just-In-Time- Inventory, tendering system of awarding the lowest bidder, unexpected increased marketing strategies, long regulatory timelines, limited registered medicines, inadequate supply chain management skills, insufficient personnel, and poor collaboration between Princess Marina Hospital and Central Medical Stores.\nOriginality/Value: This paper identifies the supply and demand challenges of medicines specifically in Princess Marina Hospital. To attain the purposes of the study, an inquiry was created containing two components related to investment decisions, including financial literacy and economic factors. The inquiry was delivered to a sample of 85 people. Descriptive data were used to expound on study samples in the way that frequency, mean, and standard deviation. In addition, of highest quality-sample t-test and a natural linear regression reasoning were used to test the study theory at a consequence level of 0.05. The main findings of this study include (I) the impact of financial knowledge and literacy on investment decisions and (II) the impact of economic factors on investment decisions. The focus was on investment and savings-related decisions and preferences. Banks, financial institutions, and investors can benefit from understanding the impact of financial literacy, behavioral, and individual factors, thus inviting investors to other financial options. The study provided many recommendations, the most important of which, is by communicating financial factors and knowledge of finance to financial literacy, allowing decision-makers to anticipate economic events and plan for the future.</jats:p>"

Based on previous research, a centralized decision model (DM) and four kinds of decentralized DMs are constructed according to the differences in the supply chain decision order and the return loss bearers. Moreover, the impact of quality control on the return rate and market demand is also considered in the model research to achieve the optimization of the model. Using Stackelberg game knowledge to compare and analyze supply chain decisions, profits and influencing factors in different models, the final conclusions are drawn: (1) the decision is optimal and the profit is the highest in the centralized DM; (2) when the manufacturer dominates the supply chain decision, the difference in return loss bearers does not affect the supply chain decision and profit; (3) compared with other decentralized DMs, when the retailer dominates the supply chain decision and the manufacturer bears the return loss, the supply chain decision is better and the profit is higher; (4) the quality control level and the total profit in the five supply chain models are proportional to the quality control effect and the consumer perception of quality control. In addition, this paper introduces a joint contract to coordinate the supply chain under the decentralized DM and achieves the desired results. Finally, the relevant research findings and the validity of the contract are verified in the arithmetic analysis.</jats:p>"

There are numerous studies suggesting that the urban population, rate of growth, and population percentage residing in agglomerations all have a statistically notable and constructive effect on Human Development Index (HDI). Industrialization has historically encouraged urbanization by fostering economic expansion and job opportunities that entice people to relocate to cities. This article exclusively focuses on strategic planning regarding how to build and improve supply chain networks. It also looks at how factories built in a location increase demand for manufacturing and managerial workers personnel, resulting in a population inflow. Following the factories, other businesses such as construction makers, retailers, and service providers follow to meet the workers’ product demands. As a result, more jobs and housing demand are created, forming a city. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the feasibility of using a standard fog collector (SFC) to collect fog water for complementary irrigation of rainfed wheat in the Abi-beyglu area was investigated. For this purpose, collected water volume was measured on a daily basis during fog time in 2021. The water demand of the winter wheat was estimated by the FAO Penman–Monteith equation under dry and normal conditions. Then the contribution of the collected water to supply the water demand of the wheat and the resultant increase in the yield under two different scenarios, namely complementary irrigation with 30 and 60 mm of collected water, was estimated using the AquaCrop model. Results showed that it is feasible to obtain an average water production of 3.6 L/m2/day over the studied period. Upon irrigation with 30 and 60 mm of collected water under dry and normal conditions, 26 and 34% of the water deficiency for wheat farming was supplied, leading to increased crop yields by 0.6 and 1.7 ton/ha, respectively.</jats:p>",

The main points of findings regarding the chosen analyses are as follows. First, according to the TF-IDF analyses, numerous studies including a keyword of hotel were conducted between 1999 and 2016, whereas more attention has been paid into cruise, food, service, technology, etc. Second, as a result of co-occurrence keyword analyses, destination-specific environment and use of resources in the tourism supply chains were found to be noticeable in the period of 1999 and 2016, the frequently appearing research theme has been related to food-tourist, supply-chain, and sustainable-tourism since 2017. Third, various keyword network analyses show that keywords such as management and destination, positioned in the center of the keyword network, have activley mediated the terms in the period of time between 1999 and 2015, while service-related issues in tourism supply chains have proliferated since 2017. It is suggested that the current study has provided a basis for understanding a shift in the research trends on the chosen research topic by analyzing tourism supply chain research articles for two sub-periods (1999∼2016; 2017∼2023).</jats:p>",

Additionally, the use of technology is increasingly being regarded as a means of reducing complexity and increasing transparency within these supply chains. While much research has been conducted to understand the impact of the textile industry on sustainability and the impact of technology on the overall performance of the textile supply chains, little attention has been placed on the following question: How do technologies affect transparency within the textile supply chains? Methods: We conducted seven interviews with actors from the textile industry. Based on these collected data, the relevance of selected technologies for improving transparency is established and the challenges of their implementation and impact on the industry are assessed. Results: Digital technologies, such as blockchain, the Internet of Things and dialog platforms, are promising instruments for transparency, even though their current implementation is not ideal. Furthermore, great skepticism on platforms for reporting (audits and complaint systems) is still prevalent. Conclusions: Since the influence of transparency on sustainability is conditioned by the goal orientation with which the technologies are implemented and used, we propose a framework for the implementation of the selected technologies that account for the interaction between said technologies in the textile supply chains.</jats:p>"

The components and processes that have a direct impact on the development of the export potential of the aviation complex are analyzed. It is revealed that the issue of ecology as a factor of competitiveness of aviation enterprises remains out of the question. The purpose of the article is to determine the impact on the formation of the competitiveness of aviation complex of such a factor as ecologization. At the present stage, processes of ecologization of transport infrastructure are irreversible, and in the conditions of high non-environmental aviation transport they will have an impact on the subjects of the aviation complex market. Innovative and ecological activity in the conditions of the modern economy plays an important role in the timeliness and professionalism of making economic and ecological decisions for the development of the enterprise, the region, and the state. Limited resources, highly qualified personnel, uncertainty in the economy, changes in the market, all this has a huge impact on innovative design, but if we consider the design problem from a methodological point of view, then one of the important and defining problems is the inconsistency of the basic design models of the industry. Therefore, in each specific case, it is necessary to determine the model and adapt it according to the results of the analysis of the industry and the enterprise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Minimizing a company’s operational risk by optimizing the performance of the manufacturing and distribution supply chain is a complex task that involves multiple elements, each with their own supply line constraints. Traditional approaches to optimization often assume determinism as the underlying principle. However, this paper, adopting an entropy approach, emphasizes the significance of subjective and objective uncertainty in achieving optimized decisions by incorporating stochastic fluctuations into the supply chain structure. Stochasticity, representing randomness, quantifies the level of uncertainty or risk involved. In this study, we focus on a processing production plant as a model for a chain of operations and supply chain actions. We consider the stochastically varying production and transportation costs from the site to the plant, as well as from the plant to the customer base. Through stochastic optimization, we demonstrate that the plant producer can benefit from improved financial outcomes by setting higher sale prices while simultaneously lowering optimized production costs. This can be accomplished by selectively choosing producers whose production cost probability density function follows a Pareto distribution. Notably, a lower Pareto exponent yields better supply chain cost optimization predictions. Alternatively, a Gaussian stochastic fluctuation may be proposed as a more suitable choice when trading off optimization and simplicity. Although this may result in slightly less optimal performance, it offers advantages in terms of ease of implementation and computational efficiency.</jats:p>"

Previous MPP research has focused on the Industry 4.0 manufacturing processes and technologies required to make personalization a feasible method. Inherently, MPP necessitates a configurable supply chain that accommodates fluctuating product requirements. However, there has been little effort to examine the resilience and robustness of MPP supply chain networks in instances of external disruptions such as the ongoing COVID-19 supply chain crisis. This research takes a formal qualitative approach to investigate three MPP focal firms and the pandemic’s impact on their supply chain network through interviews with industry leaders. In doing so, we address research questions centered on MPP robust and resilience against external disruptions. The study finds that faced COVID-19 disruptions, MPP firms with centralized, specialty suppliers were vulnerable, while firms with increased supplier redundancy, network transitivity, and amplified visibility were robust and resilient. Evidence indicates that MPP capabilities provided robustness advantages over other production methods. Further, This work discovered that MPP FFs were particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 disruptions when using non-redundant, centralized suppliers. However, FFs taking advantage of MPP technologies to increase visibility and supplier redundancy were robust to disruptions and quick to recover from interruptions.</jats:p>",

The study’s main goal was to analyze the characteristics of the tobacco and tobacco supply chain in Serbia and determine comparative advantages and levels of integration with the world market. The methodology used in this study included the index of concentration of tobacco manufacturers, followed by a panel regression analysis to determine factors that affected profitability in this industry. Also, foreign trade performances were analyzed using the indices of revealed comparative advantages and integration. The research was conducted for the period from 2013 to the last available year. The results indicate the growth of tobacco production despite the decline in the number of farms, the highly concentrated production of tobacco products, and the significant intensification of foreign trade despite modest comparative advantages.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on machinery international production networks in East Asia and tries to find quantitative evidence on supply chain decoupling by using international trade statistics, particularly from the viewpoint of middle powers such as Japan. While data on the sectoral level of trade do not show any clear evidence of supply chain decoupling, some specific US export controls indeed affect international transactions when examined at a finely disaggregated level. We econometrically measure the effect of some of the US policies on Japanese exports to China. The recent strengthening of US export controls related to supercomputers and advanced integrated circuits is likely to generate further effects. Nevertheless, the supply chain decoupling seems to end up as a partial one, and a large portion of International Production Networks (IPNs) may remain active.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p><bold>Purpose</bold>\nSupplying off-grid facilities such as astronomical observatories with renewable energy-based systems (RES) instead of diesel generators can considerably reduce their environmental impact. However, RES require oversized capacities to counter intermittency and comply with reliability requirements, hence shifting the environmental impact from operation to construction phase. We assess whether 100% RES scenarios are favorable from an environmental point of view, and discuss the trade-offs in systems with backup fossil generators versus 100% renewable ones.\n<bold>Methods</bold>\nIn this comparative life cycle assessment (LCA), we study various RES supply systems to power a new telescope in the Atacama desert, Chile. We compare six setups, including 100% RES scenarios, namely photovoltaics (PV) with batteries and hydrogen energy storage; high-renewable scenarios, with fossil fuel power generation next to RES and storage; and a system combining PV with diesel generation. We base system sizing on a techno-economical optimization for the start of operation in 2030. Foreground data stem from recent life cycle inventories of RES components and 2030 electricity mix assumptions of production places. We assess environmental impact in the categories climate change, mineral resource depletion and water use.\n<bold>Results and discussion</bold>\nWe find that 100% RES and high-renewable scenarios result in emissions of 0.077-0.115kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh supplied, compared to 0.917kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh in the reference case with solely diesel generation. 100% RES scenarios have a lower CO<sub>2</sub>e impact than high-renewable scenarios. However, the latter lower the mineral resource depletion and water use by about 27% compared to 100% RES scenarios. Applying hybrid energy storage systems increases the water use impact, while reducing the mineral resource depletion.\n<bold>Conclusions</bold>\nNone of the six energy systems we compared was clearly the best in all environmental impacts considered. Trade-offs must be taken when choosing an energy system to supply the prospective off-grid telescope in Chile. We find high-renewable systems with some fossil generation as the better option regarding power reliability, mineral resource depletion and water use, while inducing slightly higher greenhouse gas emissions than the 100% RES scenarios.\nAs remote research facilities and off-grid settlements today are mainly supplied by fossil fuels, we expect to motivate more multifaceted decisions for implementing larger shares of RES for these areas. To advance the LCA community in the field of energy systems, we should strive to incorporate temporal and regional realities into our life cycle inventories. To ease the path for upcoming studies, we publish this work’s inventories as detailed activity level datasets.</p>"

In RAPS systems that utilize solar and hydrogen power, which typically include photovoltaic modules, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, hydrogen gas storage, and PEM fuel cells, the cost of these systems is currently higher compared to conventional RAPS systems that employ diesel generators or batteries. URFCs offer a potential solution to reduce the expenses of solar hydrogen renewable energy systems in RAPS by combining the functionalities of the electrolyzer and fuel cell into a single unit, thereby eliminating the need to purchase separate and costly electrolyzer and fuel cell units. URFCs are particularly well-suited for RAPS applications because the electrolyzer and fuel cell do not need to operate simultaneously. In electrolyzer mode, URFCs function similarly to stand-alone electrolyzers. However, in fuel cell mode, the performance of URFCs is inferior to that of stand-alone fuel cells. The presented review summarizes the past, present, and future of URFCs with details on the operating modes of URFCs, limitations and technical challenges, and applications. Solar hydrogen renewable energy applications in RAPS and challenges facing solar hydrogen renewable energy in the RAPS is discussed in detail.</jats:p>"

Nigeria as a country is faced with challenges of poor electric power supply due to the challenges from the power holding company of Nigeria (PHCN) which have left many households and isolated areas with no access to electricity. The fact that fossil fuel generators contributes to climate changes, renewable energy such as wind could be the best alternative. This paper presents the numerical design of an off-grid wind energy systems for powering load demand of two bedrooms apartment. The load demand of two bedroom flats were estimated and sizes of wind turbine, storage batteries and inverter with respect to typical load demand were numerically estimated. The performance of three 1 KW horizontal axis wind turbines of the same capacity but from different manufacturers namely; Bergey’s (BWC XL.1), Wind energy (WE.7) and Hummer wind energy (H3.1) were numerically tested  using the average monthly wind speed data of Aliero Kebbi state, Nigeria. The result shows that integrating 1 kW wind turbine with 6 pieces of 200 Ah batteries on 24 V system and 1 kVA inverter would be feasible for 505 W (4.37 kWh/day) load demand with two days autonomy. The  annual mean energy generated by the  BWC XL.1, WE.7 and H3.1 using annual mean wind speed 5.03 m/s were 1782 kWh/yr, 1451kWh/yr and 1909 kWh/yr, attaining  efficiencies of 44.45 % 33.22 % and 33.22 % respectively. Based on these results, BWC XL.1 could be best alternative wind turbine for the location because of its optimum efficiency. In addition, its energy generation of 1782 kWh/yr is 11.72% greater than 1595 kWh/year, the typical residential household load demand.</jats:p>"

The error of the estimated network should be back propagated from the output to the input to correct the weight.

However, there has been limited research on how nanoparticles (NPs) and various irrigation regimes affect the nutritional value and overall quality of rice. In the present study, the effects of different irrigation regimes and foliar spray of NPs on the yield, nutrient concentration, and amino acid profile of milled rice in two rice cultivars were evaluated. The results showed that the Shirodi cultivar had a higher yield and nutrients compared to the Hashemi cultivar. Reducing irrigation significantly lowered the grain yield, nutrient elements, and some amino acids (asparagine, glutamic acid, serine, alanine, histidine, and arginine) in milled rice while increasing other amino acids. However, NPs treatments, especially ZnONPs + SiO2NPs treatment, increased grain yield and amino acids in milled rice. Regarding mineral nutrients, SiO2NPs and ZnONPs + SiO2NPs treatments decreased mineral nutrients in milled rice, while ZnONPs treatment increased Ca, Fe, Mg, and N and decreased the content of other elements in milled rice. Therefore, our findings showed that SiO2NPs and ZnONPs are promising NPs that can improve the yield and nutritional quality of milled rice, especially in water-deficient conditions.</jats:p>",

However, due to the special power separation model, the autonomy of the foundation is poor, and there may be serious agency conflicts, ultimately leading to listed companies becoming beneficiaries of the foundation's charitable activities. We have found from the perspectives of commercial credit, sales, and cooperative relationships that social responsibility initiating organizations (listed companies) can obtain potential benefits from social responsibility fulfilling organizations (listed company public welfare foundations) in supply chain commercial relationships, that is, listed companies that establish public welfare foundations have good supply chain commercial relationships. When a listed company and a public welfare foundation have a close relationship in terms of fund donation, decision-making, business, and naming, the public welfare foundation has a strategic preference in selecting project names, project service areas, project beneficiaries, and project service areas.

This study aimed to determine suitable tank locations by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). Factors such as elevation, slope, population, land use land cover, and distance to the road are considered for this analysis. Thematic maps are created in ArcGIS and weights are determined using the AHP method. From the weighted overlay analysis, the result shows that 15.59, 52.36, 31.31, and 0.63% of the areas are suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable, and unsuitable, respectively. Since the area has an elevation range of 27–87 m, it is divided into three zones. An unsuitable location falls only under one zone; therefore, the results are tested in EPANET by locating the tanks in suitable and least suitable locations. Locating the tanks in suitable locations reduces the size of pipes economically and maintains the pressure successfully while locating the tanks in the least suitable locations creates a negative pressure and increases the pipe size. This study helps the designers to obtain an effective design of a water distribution network by evaluating suitable tank locations.</jats:p>",

This demonstrates the necessity and importance of undertaking empirical research on the variables influencing GSCM adoption from the perspective of Pakistan small and medium enterprises (SMEs). To close the gap in GSCM research, this study tries to pinpoint the variables influencing GSCM adoption among Pakistan SMEs. SPSS software version 23 is used to apply statistical techniques to the primarily obtained data. The survey form was administrated to 600 target respondents from all administrative levels. There were 210 complete and usable survey forms, showing a response rate of around 35%. First, the reliability of all questions is checked; second, we use multiple regression analysis to identify which factors are affecting the implementation of green supply chain management in Pakistani SMEs. The findings suggest that environmental factors and organizational factors have a great influence on managers’ intention to adopt GSCM.

Agricultural cooperatives help smallholder farmers enhance their bargaining power via revenue and risk sharing and are a significant bridge between farmers and retailers. Therefore, this study aimed to design a contractual mechanism considering a cooperative’s participation in the coordination of ASCs that face random yield and demand in pursuit of risk and benefit equivalence. We first compared two- and three-echelon decentralized ASCs with a centralized system, and the results indicate that the cooperative’s participation is conducive to redistributing profit between the retailer and farmer. As a verified revenue-sharing (RS) contract cannot coordinate a two-echelon ASC under uncertain yield and demand, we developed a double revenue-sharing (DRS) contract, which has been demonstrated to coordinate an ASC system with the cooperative’s participation. A numerical analysis was conducted to show that the cooperative can influence profit distribution among the upstream and downstream members via wholesale prices. Therefore, equivalence of risk and benefit is realized and fairly allocated among the members under the DRS contract, which is of great significance to the ASC system’s stable and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The methods of content analysis, structural and logical, comparison, generalization, marketing analysis were used.\r\nResults. Modern approaches to the classification of types of EB were studied; epidemiological indicators were analyzed; recommendations of clinical protocols were summarized. It has been found that currently there are no available specific MT in the world for the treatment of this severe chronic disease. International clinical guidelines recommend the use of medicines and medical products to relieve symptoms (wound care, reduce pain and itching), prevent secondary pathologies and improve the quality of life of patients with EB. The cost of treating EB depends on the severity of the disease and the patient’s age. The burden of the disease and the impact on the budget are assessed to be high. The state cannot provide 100 % of the need for the necessary medicines and medical products due to budget constraints. The analysis of the national legal framework for providing patients with rare (orphan) diseases, including EB, with the necessary medicines and medical products was carried out. It has been determined that only 9 INNs of the seven groups of medicines recommended by the protocol are included in the National List and can be purchased for budget funds. The annual need, nomenclature and volumes of purchases of drugs for the treatment of EB were studied. According to the State Enterprise “Medical Procurement of Ukraine” in 2023, for patients with EB it is planned to purchase eight groups of medical products for skin and wound care under 20 names in the amount of UAH 119.8 million.\r\nConclusions. In order to improve approaches to the pharmaceutical provision of patients with EB, it is extremely important to use health technology assessment (HTA) to identify the most effective and economically feasible medicines and medical products.</jats:p>"

In this study, the effect of calcium supply on Src degradation was investigated to confirm underlying mechanisms and anticancer effects targeting TNBC. MDA-MB-231 cells, the TNBC cell line, were used. Calcium supply was feasible through lactate calcium salt (CaLac), and the applicable calcium concentration was decided by changes in the viability with different doses of CaLac. Expression of signaling molecules mediated by calcium-dependent Src degradation was observed by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, and the recovery of the signaling molecules was confirmed following calpeptin treatment. The anticancer effect was investigated in the xenograft animal model. Significant suppression of Src was induced by calcium supply, followed by a successive decrease in the expression of epithelial growth factor receptor, RAS, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and nuclear factor kappa B. Then, the suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 contributed to a significant deactivation of the prostaglandin E2 receptors. These results suggest that calcium supply has the potential to reduce the risk of TNBC.

The catchment area of the Klimkówka reservoir on the Ropa River, a tributary of the Wisłoka River, located within the Polish Carpathians was selected for the study. The analysis carried out, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modelling among other techniques, showed an increase in the importance of low-flow outflow from the upper Ropa catchment and a negative balance of inflow to the reservoir (Q &lt; 2 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> <jats:sup>s−1</jats:sup>), manifested by a prolonged duration of low flows and an increase in outflow deficit during the year. The duration of flood flows and the runoff excess during these periods show a constant or decreasing tendency, while the length and excess of runoff increase during large floods. Thus, in the upper Ropa catchment, an increase in the intensity of extreme hydrological phenomena is observed. The prepared forecasts indicate an increase in annual runoff from the catchment in the decades 2021–2030 and 2031–2040 and a marked decrease in the decade 2041–2050. In the annual cycle, the projected changes in the coming decades will take different directions. In December only, throughout the entire period 2021–2050, the outflow will increase, whereas in May it will systematically decrease.</jats:p>",

Considering the effectiveness of transformational leadership traits in motivating subordinates in every organization, the purpose of the current research was to criticize how transformational leadership facilitates motivating employees in supply chain workplaces. A mixed approach methodology based on qualitative-interpretive and quantitative-positivism research design was chosen to gather data from the participant’s group. A randomly selected sample of 12 top, middle and bottom-level managers from supply chain organisations was chosen as the participants for the qualitative open-ended in-depth interviews and the quantitative survey-based questionnaires. Interview findings were analysed using thematic analysis. On the other side, statistical analysis of the survey findings reported the impacts of transformational leadership on enhanced employee productivity, employee motivation, employee turnover and supply chain management business. The study found that all the transformational leadership characteristics are necessary to motivate alongside improving operational efficiency among the employees in a supply chain workplace. Overall results concluded that with their Intellectual simulation, Idealised Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Individualized consideration, Contingent Reward, and Expectation Management. transformational leaders and managers ensure employees are motivated to pursue agility and overall performance of supply chain management is improved via brand position in the market. In terms of practical implications, the study recommended that SCM organisations need optimized procurement and allocation of resources at different processes to leverage on impacts of transformational leadership.</jats:p>",

Constructing an age-friendly environment actively addresses population aging and ensures the well-being of the elderly. This study employed panel data from 31 provinces (municipalities) in China spanning the years 2014 to 2020. The research utilized a coupling coordination degree model, Theil index, Moran index method, and spatial econometric model to empirically examine the level of coupling coordination development, regional differences, and spatial spillover effects of age-friendly environments. The findings indicate the following: (1) In terms of coupling and coordination development, the degree of coupling and coordination of age-friendly environments in China shows a consistent upward trend over the years. The eastern region exhibits the highest level of development, surpassing the national average, while the western region has the lowest level, followed by the northeast and central regions. (2) In terms of regional development disparities, inter-regional differences gradually intensify due to variations in development status and resource endowment, playing a significant role in overall variations. Within regions, the highest intra-regional differences occur in the eastern region, while the lowest occur in the western region. (3) Considering the spatial spillover effect, the coupling coordination degree of age-friendly environments demonstrates positive spatial autocorrelation. Various development clusters and variables exert diverse influences on the coupling coordination degree of age-friendly environments within the region, while the spatial spillover effect of surrounding regions manifests distinct development patterns. The findings of this study contribute to enhancing the quality of age-friendly environment construction and promoting coordinated development among different regions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate oscillations ranging from years to decades drive precipitation variability in many river basins globally. As a result, many regions will require new water infrastructure investments to maintain reliable water supply. However, current adaptation approaches focus on long-term trends, preparing for average climate conditions at mid- or end-of-century. The impact of climate oscillations, which bring prolonged and variable but temporary dry periods, on water supply augmentation needs is unknown. Current approaches for theory development in nature-society systems are limited in their ability to realistically capture the impacts of climate oscillations on water supply. Here, we develop an approach to build middle-range theory on how common climate oscillations affect low-cost, reliable water supply augmentation strategies. We extract contrasting climate oscillation patterns across sub-Saharan Africa and study their impacts on a generic water supply system. Our approach integrates climate model projections, nonstationary signal processing, stochastic weather generation, and reinforcement learning–based advances in stochastic dynamic control. We find that longer climate oscillations often require greater water supply augmentation capacity but benefit more from dynamic approaches. Therefore, in settings with the adaptive capacity to revisit planning decisions frequently, longer climate oscillations do not require greater capacity. By building theory on the relationship between climate oscillations and least-cost reliable water supply augmentation, our findings can help planners target scarce resources and guide water technology and policy innovation. This approach can be used to support climate adaptation planning across large spatial scales in sectors impacted by climate variability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most popular commercial varieties of mango in India is the Alphonso variety. Due to its limited and specialised production zone, this cultivar attracts interest for its supply chain management research. Only a few studies on the management of the mango supply chain in India could be discovered in the literature. In order to better understand supply chain management and pre- and post-harvest losses for the Alphonso mango, a survey was conducted. To acquire the data, 123 observations from farmers, FPOs, retailers, exporters, and government officials were recorded. A socioeconomic study revealed that farmers who were young and educated (less than 50 years old and graduates) produced mangoes of higher quality and were more committed to exporting mangoes.The findings indicate that preharvest losses are primarily caused by variables including climate change, global warming, numerous illnesses and pests, spongy tissue, and fruit fly problem. During the harvest season, spongy tissue and abrupt, unseasonal rain have a negative impact on mango quality and supply. Mechanical damage, storage conditions, transportation, and mango handling all had a major impact on postharvest losses.According to the study, pre-harvest factors were responsible for 30 to 40% of mango loss, and post-harvest handling was found to be responsible for 15 to 20% of mango loss. The revenue of farmers is remains poor due to the current trading channels and lack of facilities for value addition.The results of this study provide insight on the current state of the supply chain and Alphonso mango losses. Researchers, governmental organisations, and policymakers can benefit from this study's findings by taking the appropriate actions to boost farmers' incomes, balance the market's supply and demand, and lower losses in other perishable fruits.</jats:p>"

Using data from credit rating actions of Chinese‐listed firms over the period between March 2007 and May 2020, we examine the spillover effects of supply chains by focusing on the market reactions of event firms to the action announcements. We find strong evidence of spillover effects driven by the market reactions of event firms, which are enhanced through information diffusion channels as supply chain partners receive more investor attention. Moreover, the effects are stronger when event firms' market reactions are negative, event firms are non‐stated‐owned, the industry concentration of event firms is higher, or the supplier‐customer business relationship is closer. Overall, these findings highlight the role of investor attention and network characteristics in supply chain spillovers.</jats:p>",

Store brand competition induces the supplier to quote lower wholesale prices for national brands. In multi‐period selling environments, retailers may complement this wholesale price reduction by carrying strategic inventories. Hence, store brand carrying retailers face the following dilemma. On the one hand, strong store brand competition might be sufficient to lower the national brand's wholesale price substantially. In this case, the retailer need not carry any strategic inventory. On the other hand, the wholesale price reduction induced solely by store brand competition might not be substantial. In this case, the retailer might want to carry either national brand or store brand strategic inventory to complement the wholesale price reduction. We address the above dilemma by investigating the effect of store brand competition on the strategic inventory decision using a two‐period game‐theoretic framework. We enhance the current understanding of the retailer's strategic inventory by incorporating the impact of store brand competition. Our analysis reveals that it is never optimal for the retailer to carry store brand as strategic inventory even when the store brand and the national brand are close substitutes. We also find that a store brand selling retailer may become worse off when being endowed with the option of carrying strategic inventory. However, when the holding cost is sufficiently low, we show that the strategic inventory and store brand competition complement each other and benefit the retailer.</jats:p>",

It is an experimental, numerical analysis carried out in an Indian industrial setting to derive some empirical truths, which have profound implications for the community of professional practice and academic and policy research towards inclusiveness in ecological governance. The analysis is centred on a conceptual model based on causal interdependencies. This model conceives stakeholders' demands from the outside in the form of numerous environmental, economic and social externalities triggering pressures for integrating innovative sustainable responses in logistics operations in the supply chain to eventuate desirable state transformation of the society, environment and economy. The model, as proposed, is validated through primary data collected through a structured questionnaire survey from Indian logistics service providers (LSPs) and analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM) with coding in the R engine platform. The empirical result shows that sustainable performance is influenced less by green practices than logistics operations, and the direct impact of logistics operations is much less on green practices than on supply chain sustainability. This study attempts to study contemporary sustainability practices. It transcends to contribute towards regenerative inclusive human welfare, adding the scope of activity from merely environmental management to sustainability in ecological governance.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this study is to model and perform quantitative analyses of a range of SC disruption risks affecting the UK online retailer. We have attempted to study how UK retailers responded to the first and second waves of the pandemic and the effect on multiple products. Six scenarios are developed based on SC disruption risks and their impacts on SC performance are analysed. The quantitative analysis of two strategies used by grocery retailers during the pandemic, namely vulnerable priority delivery slots and rationing of products, illustrates that rationing of products had a greater SC impact than the use of priority delivery slots. The effects of two resilience strategies, backup supplier and ramping up distribution centre capacity, are also quantified and discussed. Novel managerial insights and theoretical implications are discussed to make online grocery SC more resilient and robust during future disruptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reverse osmosis is efficiently used for producing drinking water from groundwater sources containing dissolved impurities, including fluoride, ammonia, lithium, strontium, boron, arsenic, etc. The principal problems of utilizing reverse osmosis include scaling on membrane surfaces, concentrate discharges, and low permeate TDS that often require conditioning. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate the viability of a newly developed methodology that relies on low-rejection nanofiltration membranes to improve product water quality by increasing its TDS and calcium content, and its economic efficiency compared to conventionally used reverse osmosis. Disadvantages of employing reverse osmosis for the production of drinking water are attributed to the fact that several pollutants (including lithium, ammonia, and boron) are monovalent ions and, as such, are poorly rejected by membranes as compared to calcium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride ions. Thus, in cases in which lithium or ammonia are present in high concentrations, high rejection membranes are usually used that result in low TDS of the product water. This article presents the results of research aimed at developing a new approach to changing the ratio of monovalent and divalent ions in product water. The new method described in this paper relies on low rejection membranes in a two-stage application that enables us to reduce monovalent impurities and increase the concentration of calcium and TDS values in product water while leaving lithium concentration unchanged. This is achieved by applying a two-stage scheme with low-rejection membranes instead of the reverse osmosis stage. The two-stage treatment using nanofiltration membranes results in the same rejection of lithium and product water quality as reverse osmosis. However, the ratio value of calcium and lithium concentrations in the concentrate of nanofiltration membranes appears to be significantly higher compared with the ratio measured in the feed groundwater. This can be attributed to different rejections of these ions by membranes. Therefore, concentration (reduction of volume) of the feed water with nanofiltration membranes and further dilution of the concentrate with deionized water produce the same concentration of lithium and are associated with an increase of 2–4 times the concentration of calcium. Treatment of this water in the second nanofiltration membrane stage produces drinking-quality water with the required lithium content and increased calcium concentration. We focus on the real-world example of groundwater treatment in Yakutia, Russia, an area where lithium concentration exceeds drinking standards by 24 times. The paper presents a technique of ion separation and demonstrates experimental results that provide lithium removal while increasing the calcium concentration and TDS value. The resulting concentrations are 2–5 times lower than those obtained via conventional use of reverse osmosis membranes. A series of experiments were conducted to remove lithium from groundwater and demonstrate the efficiency of the newly developed method of ion separation. Experimental results of the concentration of obtained values of lithium, calcium, and TDS in permeate and concentrate flows at each membrane stage demonstrate that they provide separation of monovalent and divalent ions and increase product water TDS without increasing lithium. This experimental approach increases calcium and TDS values in product water by 2–4 times compared with the use of reverse osmosis membranes. Calculations of operational costs for different options (the use of reverse osmosis, two-stage nanofiltration, and ion separation in a two-stage approach) are presented. These results confirm the economic advantage of nanofiltration membrane applications to remove lithium as compared to the use of high-rejection reverse osmosis membranes. The increase in product water TDS facilitates the further reduction of concentrate flow rate and operational costs. The economic comparison involved the calculation of the required membrane area and number of membrane elements at each stage, calcium carbonate scaling rates, reagent consumption to prevent scaling, and amounts of concentrate discharged into the sewer. Experimentally obtained results confirmed the feasibility of increasing the calcium concentration and TDS values in product water by 2–5 times while leaving the lithium concentration at the same level. Design characteristics to calculate operational costs for conventional and new options are calculated and demonstrate a sufficient (30–40%) reduction of operational costs compared to conventional use of reverse osmosis. The reduction in reagent consumption is attributed to the utilization of low-rejection nanofiltration membranes that have lower scaling propensities compared with reverse osmosis membranes and a smaller payment for concentrate discharge. The developed approach to using two-stage nanofiltration instead of single-stage reverse osmosis provides multiple advantages that include improved product water quality, lower concentrate consumption, and lower reagent consumption that are attributable to the use of low-rejection membranes. Different case studies are planned to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques to reduce ammonia, fluoride, and boron in drinking water.</jats:p>"

A drone may quickly fly over sports grounds, scan the area for potential dangers, and offer aerial footage and still photographs. Although UAVs provide benefits to their operators, there is a possibility that they may also pose cybersecurity threats. This guide offers recommendations for best security practices, intending to assist sports operators in protecting their networks, materials, and staff for Qatar’s mega sporting events. The literature comprises several theoretical frameworks and conceptual models for security supply chains. Unfortunately, there is no practical model for measuring the behavioral intentions of professional IT and security experts. Therefore, this study conducted research in two stages. In the first stage, an in-depth systematic literature review was conducted to identify the factors and themes of UAV-based SCM for security measures. In the second phase, a survey questionnaire (N = 712) was implemented, comprising the themes and items from the literature review among professional IT and security experts. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out with IBM SPSS, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed with IBM AMOS. This study proposed and developed a UAV-based SCM model to provide security for Qatar’s mega sporting events, which comprised five factors: traceability, security and privacy, trust, acceptability, and preparedness. This study also confirmed the validity and reliability of the newly developed scales, offering practical and proposed implications for the IT and security industries. The key findings of the study are: (1) a valid and reliable UAV-based cybersecurity framework for FIFA mega sporting events was developed; (2) five critical factors were identified, including traceability, security and privacy, trust, acceptability, and preparedness; (3) all factors were significantly and positively correlated, highlighting the complexity of managing security systems in mega sporting events.</jats:p>"

Numerous studies have extensively researched the supply and demand of natural gas. The main purpose of this study is to explore the supply‐demand balance mechanism for natural gas security. A system dynamics model is constructed to assess the supply and demand of natural gas in Sichuan Province, China. A new system dynamics model based on domestic gas, production gas, ecological environment and natural gas supply is proposed. The study considers four scenarios: natural development, economic priority development, environmental priority development and coordinated development. The results show that the rapid economic development has led to an excessive environmental carrying capacity, a larger gap between natural gas supply and demand, a decline in the quality of life of residents, and even affected the energy security of Sichuan Province and China. The findings also show that people's overprotection of the environment can lead to slow economic development, which prevents it from achieving its desired goals. The coordinated development scenario in this paper not only ensures the production of natural gas and the quality of life of residents, but also is an optimal scheme with low energy consumption and pollution. According to the research conclusions, considering the overall situation of China's energy security and the situation in Sichuan Province, the author proposes reforms from the supply and demand sides of natural gas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The spatial flows of school-age children and educational resources have been driven by such factors as regional differences in population migration and the uneven development of the education quality and living standards of residents in urban and rural areas. This phenomenon further leads to a supply–demand imbalance between the area of school land and the number of school-age children in the geographical location of China. The georeferenced data characterizing supply–demand imbalance presents an obvious spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, a spatial data analysis technique named the Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approach was employed to identify the driving factors of the supply–demand imbalance of school land. The eigenvectors generated by the geographical coordinates of all primary schools were selected and added into the ESF model to filter the spatial autocorrelation of the datasets to identify the driving factors of the supply–demand imbalance. To verify the performance of the technique, it was applied to a county in the southwest of Shandong Province, China. The results from this study showed that all the georeferenced indicators representing population migration and education quality were statistically significant, but no indicator of the living standards of residents showed statistical significance. The eigenvector spatial filtering approach can effectively filter out the positive spatial autocorrelation of the datasets. The findings of this research suggest that a sustainable school-land-allocation scheme should consider population migration and the possible preference for high-quality education.</jats:p>"

A causal design research model was originated to take on board the three (3) hypotheses formulated for the study. The survey research method was adopted for the study. The Population of the study is 85 Clearing and Forwarding firms in Rivers State, and the study field is the Clearing and Forwarding Industry in Rivers State of Nigeria, while the respondents are 258 management staff of 55 Clearing and Forwarding firms domiciled in Rivers State that were sampled through the Taro Yamane’s formula. A structured questionnaire anchored on a 5-point likert-scale was used for data gathering, and the key informants constitute the marketing managers and transport/logistics managers of each company. The accurate questionnaire sent out were 258, from which 235 (91.1) responses were received, and after ascertaining the validity of the questions 227 (96.6%). The 227 questionnaires produced the functional response rate. The multivariate analysis by means of the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis through the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS version 22.0) was used for data analysis, and it was established that green supply chain management practices dimensions were practical in influencing environmental sustainability. However, the effects are moderated by government initiative. The results revealed that green purchasing; eco design and reverse logistics have a strong, significant and positive influence on environmental sustainability. The study therefore concludes that, there is a significant influence of green supply chain management practices on environmental sustainability of clearing and forwarding companies in Rivers State of Nigeria and recommends that clearing</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Non-convex optimization problems belong to a class of classical nonlinear optimization problems, which are often difficult to solve. An optimization problem becomes non-convex due to the presence of non-convex functions in the objective function or constraints. A function is a convex function if its Hessian matrix is positive and semi-definite for all values; otherwise, it is a non-convex function. A Hessian matrix is called positive semi-definite when the eigenvalues of the matrix are non-negative. A non-convex function can be either a concave function or a function that is neither a concave nor a convex function. A concave function is always negative semi-definite, indicating that the eigenvalues of the matrix are non-positive. This chapter starts with a short introduction to non-convex problems, followed by a discussion on different non-convex problems arising in supply chain and finance. Thereafter, the authors discuss different algorithms used for solving non-convex problems. Finally, the chapter conclude with the limitations of different algorithms.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this article conducts a quantitative analysis of RWR to ensure the sustainable development of the economic and social (EAS) coupling system. An evaluation system was constructed based on feasibility analysis using the principal component analysis theory and entropy method. The results indicated that the interaction between RWR and EAS was relatively strong. In the seven-year survey, the coordinated development of the two showed an upward trend. The coupling and coordination indexes reached their lowest point in 2015 and have shown an upward trend. The coupling index increased by 0.34, and the coordination index increased by 0.21 to obtain a highly coordinated development state.</jats:p>",

Our framework reveals the highest‐priority sectors and transactions, and the best strategies for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission reduction in the global supply chain. The strategies identified focus on cross‐border transactions and highlight the need for inter‐sectoral and international collaboration. The results indicate that the United States and China have different priorities and characteristics (even vis‐à‐vis the same industry), and that joint emission reduction policies should be coordinated to take advantage of each country's emission reduction potential. Our findings suggest that, in the United States and Europe, policies to promote the reduction of direct emissions from production of goods for exports through carbon taxes are important. Contrarily, in Asian countries, carbon emissions originate mainly from intermediate goods trades, suggesting the need for mandatory life cycle assessment reporting and emissions disclosure. Our analytical framework thus proposes specific policies that could effectively reduce specific sectors' and transactions’ carbon footprints.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine determines the socio-economic development of the state, and is an integrated production and economic system, uniting a number of agricultural, industrial, scientific-production and educational sectors aimed at obtaining, transporting, storing, processing and selling agricultural products. However, at the current stage of development of the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine, a significant obstacle to ensuring the appropriate level of competitiveness of enterprises and their products on the foreign market is the high level of energy consumption. A separate problem is the complete dependence on the electric power system, which mainly uses traditional fuel resources and has a number of disadvantages, which creates risks for the effective functioning of a strategically important sector of the state economy and substantiates the relevance of scientific research aimed at improving the optimization of the structure of energy consumption and energy supply, in that including due to the introduction of elements of alternative energy at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine. Thus, by implementing DRG and RES, agro-industrial complex enterprises increase their capacities, which contributes to the attraction of investments and increases their competitiveness. This state of affairs leads to a review of the issue of the active introduction of RES into the electricity supply structures of agricultural enterprises, which is associated with negative effects on the electricity supply systems of electricity consumers. But the analysis of previous studies shows that with a certain combination of disturbances on the same and different harmonic components of energy processes of different types of generators, mutual compensation or mutual reinforcement of one or another harmonic component in loads may occur [1]. In addition, three-phase power transformers with a \"star-zero-delta\" group of connections are widely used in the power supply systems of agro-industrial complex enterprises to power electric machines and other powerful consumers. In this case, the supply voltage from distribution networks of 6-10 kV is supplied to the transformer windings connected by a delta, and consumers are connected to the low side of 0.4 kV, the windings of which are connected in star with neutral. However, recently, quite often generating power is installed on the low side of the transformer in the power supply system. These can be photovoltaic plants, biogas power plants or diesel generator plants, which began to be installed en masse after the power supply crisis associated with Russian aggression. The paper examines the advantages, problems and prospects of DRG based on renewable energy sources at Ukrainian agro-industrial complex enterprises, which proves its economic feasibility in power supply systems. The proposed approach is that the introduction of DRG based on renewable energy into the power supply system of agro-industrial complex enterprises contributes to reducing the level of energy dependence of these enterprises and is one of the factors of increasing the competitiveness of manufactured products on the domestic and foreign markets due to the reduction of the cost of their production. The introduction of RES into the structures of the centralized power supply system of agricultural enterprises increases the reliability of power supply systems by providing electricity from two independent power sources. In addition, the amount of electricity received from the power supply company is significantly reduced. The use of artificial intelligence technology in the construction of control systems for the combined power supply systems of agro-industrial complex enterprises will increase the quality of electric energy, optimal use of RES and reduce abnormal modes of operation of the electrical complex of agro-industrial complex enterprises as a whole.</jats:p>",

The universal serial bus (USB) soldering iron available in the market operates on a 5-volt direct current (DC) supply. Essentially, it can be powered by any cell phone charger that is capable of providing an output power of not less than 8 watts. Absence of constant power supply from the national grid at times inhibit effective use of this soldering iron. To power it directly from storage battery is inappropriate as most batteries are rated as 2.7, 3.7, 6, and 12 volts. This paper deals with the design and construction of an inexpensive portable regulated power supply to power a USB soldering iron from a 12 volt power supply. The circuit was designed and simulated using Proteus software “intelligent schematic input system (ISIS)” before the construction procedure. Deep discharge protection that safeguard storage battery against under voltage and reverse polarity protections were added to the design. These special features distinguished it from those available in the market. Two light emitting diodes (LED) serve as indicators for low and normal condition of battery while sound from a buzzer shows that the input terminals of the circuit were wrongly connected. The system was tested and found to work as anticipated.</jats:p>"

To design, construct and evaluate the DOSMPS using forward converter topology are the objectives of this article. In this work, a 556 timer was picked as the pulse width modulator. The 556 timer was picked because it is widely used, cheap and capable of producing stable dual pulse width modulations. Since, this work targeted dual DC outputs, two forward converter circuits were built. However, switching frequencies at two transistors were controlled by only one 556 timer. The complete circuit of the DOSMPS consist of full bridge rectifier, smoothing capacitor, two high frequency transformers and two forward converter circuits. At the first stage of this work, the DOSMPS circuit was designed using Proteus software. Later, the complete DOSMPS circuit was constructed on two breadbroads after all of the electronic components and devices were available. Important parameters such as the input and output voltages and duty cycles were measured using digital oscilloscope and multimeter. Results from these measurements have shown that the designed circuit can convert single-phase 24 Vrms 50 Hz AC voltage input into dual and stable 5±0.1 V DC outputs. Also from this work, it was observed that, pulsed DC voltages with peak value of 2 V and frequency less than 20 kHz are sufficient in controlling the switching frequencies of both BJT transistors. This allows the regulation of the output voltage within the desired range. Analysis carried out after the measurements has shown close correlation between the theoretical and experimental results, where the calculated and measured switching frequencies had only deviated by 1.1%.</jats:p>",

The stock markets of ten emerging and developed countries were used in the study. The Markov-Switching regression methodology was utilized for this study. The results suggest that for the developed stock markets, in Regime 1, a positive shock to the money supply stimulated a significant rise in the stock returns while in Regime 2, a positive shock to the money supply induced a drop in returns. This suggests that for the developed stock markets, the effect of money supply shock on returns is state-dependent. In the developing stock markets, the coefficient for exchange rate was negative and significant in Regime 1, while it was insignificant in Regime 2. Therefore, the effect of exchange rate on returns is state-dependent in developing countries. Also, the coefficient for volatility in the exchange rate was negative and sizable in both regimes, indicating that the returns effect of volatility is not state-dependent. Basically, each day the exchange rate appreciates, stock returns rises in the developed stock markets while a devaluation policy executed in developing countries stimulated some decline in returns of emerging markets. In both regimes, a rise in money supply shock had positive and significant returns. The effect of money supply on stock returns is not state-dependent. Consequently, developing countries need flexible approaches to managing the variations in the exchange rates and money in circulation. While policymakers in developed markets may need to focus more on reducing volatility rather than adjusting exchange rates to influence stockpiling, those of emerging countries could benefit more from policies that stabilize exchange rates.</jats:p>"

The country's current plantations are inadequate to meet the demand for wood products. The country only exports a small amount of wood, accounting for about 1.45% of all imports, while importing over 3 million m3 round wood equivalent (RWE), amounting to about USD 182.53 million. This showed that there is a large gap between import and export bills, which indicates a negative trade balance. The goal of this study is to examine supply patterns as well as existing and prospective demand for wood products, particularly industrial wood and wood fuel. First, a collection of all relevant documents indicating supply and demand was done.  Then, two groups were created out of official records and study papers. Literature that is pertinent and related to the topic was chosen from among the groups. Different publications between 2010 and 2022 a total of 37 were utilized for this review. It was found that Ethiopia consumes more than 130 million m3/year of round wood equivalent, of which about 92.3% is used as wood fuel and the remaining is used to produce industrial goods with added value. Nowadays, imports provide a significant amount of Ethiopia's wood demand, and in 2015 alone, more than 30% of industrial needs were satisfied by imports. The review helps in determining the resource potential, supply-demand imbalance, and current level of demand for wood products.</jats:p>"

In view of an ever‐growing gap of unmet humanitarian needs, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the behavior of humanitarian supply chain systems. Despite a growing academic output in this field, there is a lack of empirical studies that take an integrated view on humanitarian supply chains and support decision makers with fact‐based evidence. Based on four extensive case studies and existing literature, we developed a system dynamics model that reflects the operational reality of humanitarian organizations in form of their centralized, hybrid and decentralized settings. The model provides a holistic supply chain view and measures the operational performance with regard to response cost, delivery lead time and impact on the local economy. Furthermore, we studied the impact of preparedness investments to enhance operational performance in the supply chain and deliver more humanitarian assistance with the limited resources available. Finally, we used our model to analyze the impact of major shocks such as the COVID‐19 pandemic to assess the vulnerability of humanitarian supply chains. The results indicate that operational settings, product and disaster characteristics have a major influence on the supply chain performance both in the noninvestment case as well as in the case where preparedness investments have been made. Specifically, for low‐value items, we find that decentralized settings have the lowest supply chain costs while for high‐value items the price difference between local and international procurement determines which setting is the most cost‐effective one. The preferability of the supply chain setting strongly depends on the indicator chosen. Hence, ultimately, the findings emphasize the need to apply appropriate indicators and identify their trade‐offs to comprehensively analyze the performance of humanitarian supply chain settings. The newly introduced Humanitarian Return‐on‐Investment concept can play an important role in this context. </jats:p>",

Taiwan’s geographical advantage of being surrounded by the sea provides a thriving environment for marine resources and migratory fish. This study is motivated by the increasing demand for diverse fish products, driven by the growing need for high-quality protein. Recognizing the importance of meeting this demand, this study aims to investigate the capacity of logistics systems and cold storage in the offshore fishery industry, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. To tackle the optimization challenges prevalent in the offshore fishery supply chain, this study employs the bat algorithm (BA), a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the remarkable echolocation behavior of bats. Additionally, a systematic literature review methodology is utilized to gather relevant articles and establish a comprehensive understanding of the study domain. This study culminates in proposing an optimized fishing model for the offshore fishery supply chain, highlighting the significance of evaluating supply chain value from a management perspective and identifying existing deficiencies and bottlenecks in current research. By focusing on optimizing the offshore fishery supply chain, this study aims to enhance the industry’s efficiency and effectiveness, providing valuable insights and recommendations to improve the capacity of logistics systems and cold storage. Furthermore, this study presents the results of the BA, showcasing its effectiveness in approaching optimization challenges, thereby validating its utility for the offshore fishery industry. Sensitivity analysis reveals the potential for higher profits by raising the inventory limit of the manufacturer, enabling the supplier to provide materials to more profitable trading partners. While this study is based on a revenue and cost model, it acknowledges that the objectives and constraints would become more complex in varying logistic system circumstances. The future study aims to expand the scale of the model and incorporate practical cases to further enhance its applicability.</jats:p>"

The water supply system is divided into three parts: water sources, aboveground infrastructures, and underground pipeline network, and importance factors for the different parts are quantified. Resilience demand is expressed as the desirable functionality loss and the recovery time of the water supply system after an earthquake. First, seismic fragility models are established for the different components of the water supply system. A water quality index is utilized to represent the impact of earthquakes on the water sources, the seismic performances of aboveground infrastructures are represented by fragility curves, and the repair rate in terms of number of repairs per kilometer is adopted for the pipeline network. Then, the post-earthquake functionality of the water supply system is quantified based on seismic fragility analysis. Changes in the water quality index are used to indicate the functionality losses related to water sources, the functionality losses of aboveground infrastructures are represented by the economic losses derived from component fragility curves, and post-earthquake functionality losses in the underground pipeline network are quantified by hydraulic simulations. The functionalities of the three parts are calculated separately, and then the overall system functionalities are obtained as the sum of the weighted functionalities of the three parts. Finally, a repair strategy is developed and the recovery time is calculated considering the system damage scenarios, system functionality analyses, and resource reserves. The proposed resilience assessment model considers all components of the water supply system, and the results are reliable when the basic information is complete and accurate.</jats:p>"

The study employs the AHP-Entropy Weight method to calculate the comprehensive weights of various indicators, revealing the sustainable supply capability of the resources and the challenges they confront. The research unveils that the domestic supply potential and the international commercial extraction environment are pivotal influences on the sustainable supply capability of tin resources. Firstly, since 2010, China has started to import net tin ores and concentrates, leading to a substantial increase in external dependency. However, China’s tin resource reserves have gradually decreased, posing challenges to the stability of the tin resource supply. Secondly, the stability of supply countries and the security of import channels critically affect the stability of the tin resource supply chain. A comprehensive analysis of the outcomes indicates a consistent decline in China’s sustainable tin resource supply capability since 2010, primarily due to the deterioration of resource supply conditions, growth in demand, and the escalation of geopolitical risks. Thus, the evolving foreign extraction environment, domestic resource supply potential, and the alteration in the global tin resource extraction landscape require significant attention.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supplier selection is a critical decision-making process for any organization, as it directly impacts the quality, cost, and reliability of its products and services. However, the supplier selection problem can become highly complex due to the uncertainties and vagueness associated with it. To overcome these complexities, multi-criteria decision analysis, and fuzzy logic have been used to incorporate uncertainties and vagueness into the supplier selection process. These techniques can help organizations make informed decisions and mitigate the risks associated with supplier selection. In this article, a complex picture fuzzy soft set (cpFSS), a generalized fuzzy set-like structure, is developed to deal with information-based uncertainties involved in the supplier selection process. It can maintain the expected information-based periodicity by introducing amplitude and phase terms. The amplitude term is meant for fuzzy membership, and the phase term is for managing its periodicity within the complex plane. The cpFSS also facilitates the decision-makers by allowing them the opportunity to provide their neutral grade-based opinions for objects under observation. Firstly, the essential notions and set-theoretic operations of cpFSS are investigated and illustrated with examples. Secondly, a MADM-based algorithm is proposed by describing new matrix-based aggregations of cpFSS like the core matrix, maximum and minimum decision value matrices, and score. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is implemented in real-world applications with the aim of selecting a suitable supplier for the provision of required materials for construction projects. With the sensitivity analysis of score values through Pythagorean means, it can be concluded that the results and rankings of the suppliers are consistent. Moreover, through structural comparison, the proposed structure is proven to be more flexible and reliable as compared to existing fuzzy set-like structures.</jats:p>"

In the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system, the battery is in a floating state for a long time, so the aging of the battery is approximated by calendar aging, and its decay rate is slow and difficult to estimate accurately. This paper proposes a particle filtering-based algorithm for battery state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. First, the calendar aging modeling for the batteries used in the UPS system for the Shanghai rail transportation energy storage power station is presented. Then, the particle filtering algorithm is employed for the SOH estimation and RUL prediction for the single-cell battery calendar aging model. Finally, the single-cell SOH and RUL estimation algorithm is expanded to the pack and group scales estimation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve accurate SOH estimation and RUL prediction results.</jats:p>"

We project demand for such mid‐skill migrants over the next three decades by combining data on trends in the demand for basic tasks with data on trends in native investment in education commensurate with those tasks. We estimate that the Australian economy growing at historical rates through the year 2050 will demand approximately 1.6–2.1 million foreign workers with Technical and Vocational Education and Training. A large share of these could be supplied from the Pacific Islands with sufficient investment in training, with direct cooperation from Australian employers, and targeted access to the Australian labour market.</jats:p>",

A promising way to solve this problem is to use DC-DC converters based on resonant structures with switched capacitors. Improvement of energy indicators of the converter is achieved due to soft-switching mode of semiconductor elements providing reduction of dynamic power losses and increasing the level of the primary source. Improvement of weight-size parameters of the converter is provided due to the following: multi-cycle principle of the design providing a significant increase of frequency conversion up to several hundred kHz due to multiple reduction of installed capacity of semiconductor elements; high specific energy indicators of modern multilayer ceramic capacitors, more than two orders of magnitude higher than similar indicators of reactors and transformers; optimization of parameters of semiconductor and reactive elements, which also contributes to significant reduction of weight and volume of power supply systems. The authors have conducted the analysis of weight-size parameters of the step-up DC-DC converter and the value of its efficiency under the assumption of proportionality of weight and volume of reactive converter elements to the maximum accumulated energy and proportionality of weight and volume of semiconductor elements to their installed capacity. The authors have proposed and studied the circuit of multipolar DC-DC converter based on structures with switched capacitors, which has the space symmetry. The space symmetry provides a significant improvement of weight-size parameters due to two-fold reduction of the total installed capacity of semiconductor elements. The volume and energy indicators of the converter under study as a part of power supply system have been evaluated. A method to design a power circuit of a capacitor converter with improved energy and weight-size parameters as a part of an autonomous power supply system is proposed. The authors have established the most effective ways to improve the weight-size and energy indicators of DC voltage converters. The improvement of weight-size parameters is achieved due to a twofold reduction of the installed capacity of semiconductor elements and optimization of the parameters of reactive elements. Improvement of energy indicators is achieved due to increasing the input voltage level of the converter and soft switching of its semiconductor elements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>THE PURPOSE. Consider the problems of estimating the cost of services for the transmission of electricity through the electric networks of territorial grid organizations (TGOs), including large industrial enterprises with the status of TGOs and their own generation. Develop a methodology for calculating the cost of electricity losses in the elements of the power supply system of such enterprises, taking into account the technical and economic characteristics of the sources. Develop a methodology for determining the share contribution of individual sources and consumers to electricity losses and their cost. Calculate the cost of electricity losses and the structure of the contribution to it of power sources of an industrial TGO enterprise and draw conclusions. METHODS. When solving the tasks set, methods for calculating steady-state modes of power supply systems were used. RESULTS. The article describes the relevance of the topic, created calculation methods, in the conditions of a large industrial power center, the system of payment by sub-subscribers of an industrial enterprise for services for the transmission of electricity and its relationship with the flow distribution is considered. The structure of the contribution of power sources to the losses of electricity in the power supply system is analyzed. An approach has been formulated to adjust the individual tariff for the purchase of electricity losses, taking into account the placement of power sources in the power supply system. Recommendations are given to reduce the degree of undercompensation of the cost of electricity transmission services by third-party consumers. It is proposed to use for these purposes the norms of technological losses of electricity (NTLE), determined by the cost of losses. CONCLUSION. Under the current regulatory framework, it is in the interests of TGO enterprises to distribute sub-subscribers in the scheme in such a way that their actual NTLE, determined taking into account the targeting of losses, does not exceed the calculated NTLE. In this case, there is no transfer of the cost of losses from sub-subscribers to the own consumption of the TGO enterprise. At the same time, sub-subscribers do not incur additional costs, since they pay off with the guaranteeing supplier at the boiler tariff. NTLE for these purposes must be determined by the cost of losses, taking into account the characteristics of the sources. The share of payment for losses in the networks of an TGO enterprise, which goes to its own consumption and is not compensated by sub-subscribers, is reduced. Consequently, the amount of costs for electricity and their share in the cost of finished products of the TGO enterprise is reduced.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

Methods: Excel was used to conduct a descriptive statistical analysis of the main indicators of TCM service supply and utilization from 2010 to 2019. Results: In 2019, there were 100 TCM hospitals in the nine cities of the Pearl River Delta in the Greater Bay Area, with the number (0.155) of TCM hospitals for every 100,000 people; and the numbers (0.97 in Zhuhai and 0.19 in Dongguan) of TCM hospital beds for every 1,000 people. The utilization rate of TCM hospital beds was the highest in Zhongshan (93.3%), and the lowest in Huizhou (71.9%) for 10 consecutive years. The city with the highest average daily medical visits was Foshan (4051.2). Conclusion: In Shenzhen and Zhuhai, the input of TCM service personnel and materials is large but the utilization rate is low. The supply of TCM services in Dongguan is insufficient, and there is a huge gap between the demand and the supply. Thus, it is necessary to rationally allocate TCM medical resources, increase the supply of TCM services in some areas, and improve the utilization efficiency of TCM resources.</jats:p>"

Willingness to see an NP was assessed in 2 ways. First as an overall preference over a physician and the second as a preference given 2 clinically significant scenarios in which participants imagined they were experiencing either coughing or a headache (presentation order randomized).

This work investigates a green supply chain (GSC) consisting of one environmentally regulated manufacturer and one capital-constrained retailer who faces stochastic market demand. The manufacturer needs to make decisions on the green input level, which is related to the investment cost as well as supply disruption risk. The retailer has to determine product order quantities and financing decisions. We derive the operational equilibriums for the GSC system under three scenarios: no financing, trade credit financing (TCF), and bank credit financing (BCF), and recommend the optimal financial selection for the retailer via the comparison of three financial modes. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the manufacturer should improve the green input level within the financial capability to enhance the sustainable operation level of the supply chain. In addition, we find that the capital-constrained retailer will choose financing, since either BCF or TCF will result in a higher profit than no financing. Moreover, we obtain the threshold of green input level, with which we can decide whether to choose TCF or BCF under the given corresponding parameters.</jats:p>"

The continuous enrichment of spatial‐temporal flexibility resources on both the power demand and supply sides provides a new idea for the dynamic dispatching of distribution network. This paper proposes a spatial‐temporal migration method of mobile power sources (MPSs) on the supply side and internet data centres (IDCs) on the demand side, based on the power‐transportation and power‐computation network coupling models respectively. Then, the dynamic dispatching potential of MPSs and IDCs is evaluated, and the dispatching models against extreme events of MPSs and IDCs are established. With the objective of maximizing system resilience and minimizing dispatching costs, an optimization model considering spatial‐temporal migration of data loads and MPSs dynamic dispatching strategy is formulated. Finally, the proposed method is tested in the modified IEEE 33‐node test system and IEEE 69‐node test system, and the economy and resilience enhancement are verified with comparison of different dispatching schemes.</jats:p>",

This study is conducted to examine the mediating role of road safety compliance in the relationship between road transport infrastructure and SC performance among manufacturing firms in emerging economies.\n \nDesign/methodology/approach: Drawing from the system and knowledge-based view perspectives, a framework was proposed and validated using survey data from the beverage manufacturing firms in Ghana. Data were gathered from 359 managers of firms in Ghana. The model was validated by PLS-SEM.\n \nFindings: The results showed a direct significant relationship between road transport infrastructure, road safety compliance, and SCP. The findings further revealed that the influence of road transport infrastructure on SCP is not just a bivariate relationship but also mediated through road safety compliance. The outcome of this study provides evidence that though road transport infrastructure remains crucial to driving SCP, superior SCP could be achieved in the presence of road safety compliance.\n \nOriginality/value: The outcome of this study offers an important extension to the frontiers of literature on supply chain performance. It also provides practical insight to practitioners in the manufacturing setting by emphasizing the need to pay crucial attention to road safety compliance as well as invest in road infrastructure development in the quest to achieve efficient SC performance of firms.</jats:p>"

In particular, restrictions had important consequences for drinking water consumption. The present work analyses this influence in the Soccavo district of Naples (Campania), in Italy, during the two periods of strongest restrictions in 2020: the national Lockdown (March 11–May 3) and the autumn Red Zone (November 16–December 6). A large amount of data, referred to single-household flowmeters connected to a Smart Water Grid acquisition system, was collected for the years 2019 (considered the average reference year) and 2020. The first step was the preliminary filtering of the data, by identification and elimination of anomalies and outliers, as well as anomalous annual patterns, through clustering and classification. The second step consisted of the comparison of the same meters in two consecutive years considering the daily and weekly average hourly patterns, the average daily patterns of midweek days, Saturdays, and Sundays, respectively, and the total daily volumes. The results are consistent with those in the literature. Some general trends in literature data were sought and pointed out in the present paper.</jats:p>",

We discover that enhancing bank branch supply fosters rural income growth through financial utilization and economic growth, and the process is also negatively moderated by rural financial utilization and economic levels. We then prove the inverted U-shaped relationship between bank branch supply and rural income growth, indicating that the marginal effect of bank branch supply increases at the earlier stage where rural bank branch supply lags behind the bank branch demand in boosting regional economic growth, and decreases at the later stage where the rural bank branch supply has exceeded the “optimal point” of bank branch supply. Further, bank branch expansion is more efficient than FinTech development in accelerating rural income growth, particularly in impoverished counties. The findings imply the necessity of enhancing bank branch supply in rural areas, especially in underdeveloped rural areas, to accelerate rural income growth. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores why a sustainable cycle is induced when manufacturers implement auditing in combination with lean production. Furthermore, it verifies whether this sustainable cycle enhances process integration and risk resilience, thereby allowing the manufacturer to build strong cooperation with suppliers, which further produces a positive effect on the green supply chain. Sociotechnical systems theory is our theoretical basis, and calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and estimating PLS regressions are the main methods used. The results show that the implementation of auditing induces two driving forces: internal responsibility and the ability to respond to emergencies. These two forces drive suppliers to actively and positively cooperate with lean practices to ensure that the effect of those practices is strengthened. Moreover, stronger lean practices also produce two feedback forces – expanded tolerance for auditing and expanded acceptance of auditing interventions – that strengthen auditing practices. As a result, the mutually continuous strengthening of lean production and auditing practices is produced, which further becomes a sustainable cycle. This cycle can continue to enhance process integration and increase risk resilience, build strong cooperation with suppliers, and improve the green supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The efficiency of vacuum-piston type dough dividing machines is determined by the suction mechanism of the dividing device, when the parts of which are worn out, vacuum loss occurs due to which the accuracy of the dough weight is violated. The most promising method of restoring worn surfaces of parts of the suction mechanism is electric spark treatment. (Research purpose) The research purpose is developing a repair site for dough-dividing machines with the restoration of parts by the method of electric spark processing and proposing a methodology for calculating the energy supply system. (Materials and methods) Recommended the route of the technological process for the repair of dough dividing machines, which consists of the following operations: washing, defect, locksmith, mechanical, surfacing and control. The analysis of the process under consideration at the site showed that the health of the worker is affected by a complex of harmful production factors, such as noise, vibrations, dustiness, light exposure, release of chemicals into the air of the working area. Performed in the process of experimental research with the help of modern high-precision instruments measuring the level of indicators of these factors at the repair site of dough dividing machines. (Results and discussion) Measurements in the conditions of the implementation of the technological process allowed us to draw the following conclusions: the noise and vibration level is below the maximum permissible; air pollution is twice as high as the maximum permissible concentration. It was recommended, based on the data obtained, to provide workers with overalls and personal protective equipment. Using the example of supply and exhaust ventilation, we calculated the choice of technical parameters of the electric motor and ventilation ducts. It was noted that the introduction of the proposed energy supply system significantly reduces the level of harmful impurities in the air to optimal and acceptable values and eliminates serious diseases and poisoning of the human body. (Conclusions). The developed method of calculating the energy supply of production sites for the repair of dough-dividing machines allows to identify and eliminate harmful factors of the projected technological process. This technique can be used to determine dangerous and harmful factors in the design of production sites for the repair of other facilities.</jats:p>",

For evidence, we analyze the response of Danish government bond risk premia to a temporary halt in government debt issuance announced by the Danish National Bank. The data suggest that declines in longterm yields during its enforcement reflected both reduced term premia, consistent with supply-induced portfolio balance effects, and increased safety premia, consistent with safe assets scarcity effects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tThe integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) in hybrid power generation systems offers the opportunity to achieve higher electric efficiencies. In the SOS-CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cycle [1], a newly developed cycle for blue power production (i.e., power generated starting from natural gas while capturing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), the SOFC cathode is supplied with mixtures of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, up to 79% CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> molar fraction, while the anode is supplied with a reformate feed, containing H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, CO, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and water vapour. Aim of this work is to experimentally evaluate the performance and the durability of industrial 5x5 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs under the SOS-CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cycle conditions, focusing on the effects of the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-rich cathodic atmosphere. The cells mounted a LSCF-based (La<jats:sub>0.6</jats:sub>Sr<jats:sub>0.4</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>0.2</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>0.8</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) single phase cathode, coated by a current collection layer of LSC (La<jats:sub>0.6</jats:sub>Sr<jats:sub>0.4</jats:sub>CoO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). Laboratory tests were performed at 700°C, acquiring polarization (I/V) curves and EIS spectra by means of a Horiba – FuelCon C50 Evaluator test station. Initial investigations with 7% humidified H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and 21/79 O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cathodic mixture revealed 25% power loss compared to the base case with cathodic air. The test showed not only that the loss of performance was stable in time, but also that the power reduction was reversible since the initial performance in air was recovered. The EIS spectra showed an increase of the polarization resistance and of the ohmic resistance upon feeding CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. This latter observation suggested a reduction of the electronic conductivity of the cathode, compatible with the formation of Sr carbonates on the perovskite surface [2–4].<jats:sub> </jats:sub>To assess the performance of the SOFC under the operating conditions of the SOS-CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cycle, the anode was supplied with reformate. Compared to the base case with humidified hydrogen and air, the current density at 0.7 V decreased by 37% (490 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>). When supplying the 21/79 O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mixture at the cathode, the current density stabilized at 420 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (Figure 1). Durability tests (over 300 h) at 700°C with reformate and 21/79 O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mixture highlighted a moderate decrease of the current density at 0.7 V. After these tests, the cathode was characterized post-mortem with XRD, SEM and Raman to analyse the consequences of the prolonged exposure to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. To further quantify the effect of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the cathode, symmetric button cells were also characterized with EIS, measuring ohmic and polarization resistances. The results suggested that the adsorption of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is reversible and indicated a better suitability of LSCF- compared to LSC-based cathodes for operations with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-rich mixtures. Experiments performed between 550 and 700°C at varying CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> partial pressures allowed to describe the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction and extract its activation energy. Overall, the results provided key elements for the integration of SOFCs in the SOS-CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> blue power technology.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] R.

It includes a comprehensive analysis of the direct effect of SE on CA, the contingent effects of organizational structure and collaborative networks on this impact and the interaction effect of exploration and exploitation strategies under SE. An integrated conceptual model is proposed and the hypotheses are tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) using survey data from 432 manufacturing firms in China. The results confirm the positive impact of SE on CA, which is moderated differently by decentralized, formalized and specialized organizational structures. Meanwhile, vertical and horizontal collaborations lead to different types of advantages, and firms need to balance exploration and exploitation strategies across functional domains to achieve strategic ambidexterity, which further improves CA and facilitates sustainable supply chain innovation. Theoretically, this study is original in applying SE to the collaborative advantage in a supply chain context, while taking into account the high complexity of supply chain collaboration with a contingency approach. Practically, this study provides important managerial implications and specific recommendations for different firms to achieve sustainability in supply chain collaboration and innovation.</jats:p>"

The specific objective of the study was; to determine the effect of buffer stocks practices on supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. The research study was anchored on supply chain road map theory. The research study methodology followed a descriptive approach where; the target population of the study was 241 respondents. A census survey was conducted on all the 15 registered sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. From the study, 20 respondents were selected for the pilot study, constituting 8%, which is within the recommended range of, 1% to 10% of the population. Data collected was analyzed by both descriptive and inferential statistics using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Version 28). Descriptive statistics involved calculation of means, frequencies, percentages and standard deviation. Model diagnostic tests such as Normality test, Multicollinearity, Heteroskedastity were also executed for determination of fitness of regression models. Inferential statistics further included the use of Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the extent of relationship between the independent study variables, while multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. The results from the analyzed data were then presented using figures, charts, tables and histograms to facilitate data interpretation. Findings from data analysis indicated that green stocks practices significantly affect supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. This yielded a regression model Y = 2.507 + 0.117X. The findings from the regression models indicated that buffer stocks practices, significantly affected supply chain leverage of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study further recommended that sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya, to keep buffer stocks to overcome any uncertainties in the demand and supply markets and support continuous production even with seasonal variation in the supply of raw materials to ensure full capacity of operations, production efficiency, cost control and environmental protection. As a result idle time for the machines and people will be completely zero rated, through continued production process without a halt, even when there is shortage of raw materials in the market, hence continued supply of sugar products in the market.</jats:p>"

This study was carried out to address the effects of procurement sustainability on reverse logistics. It considered four objectives: to establish the relationship between environmental procurement sustainability and reverse logistics, to examine the relationship between economic procurement sustainability and reverse logistics, to examine the relationship between social sustainability procurement and reverse logistics, and to examine the moderating role of government policy. Methods: This study applied structural equation modeling to check the research hypotheses. A purposive sampling technique was used. A structured questionnaire was used to gather primary data. The data gathered were analyzed using descriptive and inferential analysis. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 21. The study found that environmental, economic, and social procurement sustainability has a significant and positive effect on reverse logistics. Government policy moderates the relationships between environmental, economic, and social procurement sustainability and reverse logistics. Conclusions: This study recommends that organizations team up with environmental protection agencies to produce environmentally friendly products. Social interventions that can help protect society from damage should be acknowledged. Good economic policies that ensure that organizations increase their wealth should also be acknowledged.</jats:p>"

However, most studies in the field of supply chain digital twin have only focused on what-if analysis that compares several different scenarios. This study proposes a data-driven evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the service constrained inventory optimization problem using historical data that generated by supply chain digital twins. The objective is to minimize the total costs while satisfying the required service level for a supply chain. The random forest algorithm is used to build surrogate models which can be used to estimate the total costs and service level in a supply chain. The surrogate models are optimized by an ensemble approach-based differential evolution algorithm which can adaptively use different search strategies to improve the performance during the computation process. A three-echelon supply chain digital twin on the geographic information system (GIS) map in real-time is used to examine the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the data-driven evolutionary algorithm can reduce the total costs and maintain the required service level. The finding suggests that our proposed method can learn from the historical data and generate better inventory policies for a supply chain digital twin.</jats:p>",

However, precipitation series are influenced by multiple factors, exhibiting significant ambiguity, chance, and uncertainty. In this research, we propose a combined model that integrates adaptive noise-complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN), variational modal decomposition method (VMD), and bidirectional long- and short-term memory (BILSTM) to enhance precipitation prediction. We apply this model to forecast precipitation in Fuzhou City and compare its performance with existing models, including CEEMD–long and short-term memory (LSTM), CEEMD–BILSTM, and CEEMDAN–BILSTM. Our findings demonstrate that the combined CEEMDAN–VMD–BILSTM quadratic decomposition model yields more accurate predictions and captures the real variation in precipitation series with greater fidelity. The model achieves an average relative error of 1.69%, at a lower level, and an average absolute error of 1.32 m, with a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.92. Overall, the proposed quadratic decomposition model exhibits excellent applicability, stability, and superior predictive capabilities in monthly precipitation forecasting.</jats:p>",

In 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward China’s carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals (i.e., dual carbon goals), which is a guideline for the development of Chinese power systems. Thus, a supply and demand estimation system that includes dual carbon indicators and considers the long-term supply capacity is needed. To address these gaps, this study put forward an estimation model and provided the solutions. First, a supply and demand estimation indicator system is established to meet the dual carbon goals. Second, with minimizing cost being the main objective and several constraints, a chance-constrained linear programming model is used to estimate the supply and demand of electricity in 2030, 2040, and 2050. Finally, with model relaxation, we obtained the estimation results with Matlab-Cplex, which verified the efficiency and validity of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

We illustrate the application of our model using a real-world case study of one of the largest and most reputable pharmaceutical companies in Iran. The results affirm the credibility and feasibility of the proposed model when juxtaposed with a non-integrated model.

Therefore, the use of modern technologies to increase water-saving in paddy fields is critical to global food security. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different planting methods and irrigation systems on growth, yield and water productivity in rice. The experiment was arranged as a split-plot in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experimental treatments included the main plot assigned to three planting methods (transplanting at puddled bed [TPB], transplanting at non-puddled bed [TNPB], and direct-seeded rice [DSR]) and the sub-plot assigned to three irrigation systems (continuous flooding irrigation (CFI), alternate wetting and drying [AWD], and drip irrigation [DI]). The results showed that the highest grain yield (3962.7 kg.ha−1) and more-water-saving (17.3%) was achieved in the TPB treatment. Total water productivity for TPB, TNPB, and DSR methods were calculated to be 0.56, 0.43, and 0.34 kg.m−3, respectively. Grain yield in CFI (3457.6 kg.ha−1) and AWD (3410.3 kg.ha−1) systems was significantly higher than DI treatment (3150.7 kg.ha−1), while no significant difference was observed between CFI and AWD treatments in terms of rice production. However, the AWD system increased water-saving by 24.8% compared with CFI. Our results highlight that combined application of AWD system and TPB method has a great potential to reduce total water input without negatively affecting yield.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, a long-distance intelligent liquid supply method based on liquid demand prediction for coal mining faces is proposed to ensure stable liquid supply. The method integrates parameters such as the mining machine’s position, the hydraulic support’s column pressure before and after the mining machine, the forward travel distance, and action codes to construct a feature vector. Based on the Transformer Model, a Liquid Demand Prediction Model for hydraulic support is established. Attention mechanisms are combined to solve the problem of time prediction for long sequences. The model is validated using real measured data from a hydraulic system in a coal mine, and the experimental results show that the model can accurately predict liquid demand and achieve long-distance intelligent liquid supply for coal mining faced by combining pump station control strategies.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the process from component production to assembly also puts forward higher requirements for data between the subjects of each project. As a powerful database storage system, blockchain technology (BCT) can meet the needs of it, but the BCT has not been widely used. In addition, the Chinese government has issued a series of policy documents in recent years to promote smart digital technologies such as BCT, which have not been well implemented. Therefore, this paper analyzes the decision-making behavior mechanism of stakeholders and the factors that affect the implementation of BCT by establishing an asymmetric evolutionary game model. The model results reveal how to effectively promote the application of BCT in the supply chain of prefabricated buildings and help the government to stimulate the enthusiasm of other stakeholders to use BCT. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusivity in supply chain management. This includes a focus on promoting diversity and inclusivity within the workforce, as well as in the supply chain itself. Governments while deploying public funds for the provision of goods, works and services have realized the need to use supply chain function to advance social and economic development by ensuring the inclusion of otherwise excluded. However, there is little research done to establish whether inclusivity practices improve organization performance. This study therefore sought to establish the influence of supply chain inclusivity on the performance of state corporations in the energy sector. Specifically, the study aimed at determining the influence of discriminatory procurement, stakeholder involvement, supply chain diversity and supply chain integration on performance of state corporations in the energy sector in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The target population for this study was nine (9) State Corporations operating in the Energy sector in Kenya. Due to the limited number of target population, a census approach was adopted. Thus, all the 9 state corporations operating in Energy sector were included. The research purposefully targeted employees in the procurement and finance departments. A total of 20 employees were involved per organization arriving at a total of 180 respondents. A questionnaire was used in collecting data. With the study being quantitative in nature, both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were employed. The study used SPSS version 26 to facilitate the analysis of data. Inferential data analysis was done using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis method. Data was presented using a combination of statistical techniques and graphical techniques. The study established that jointly, discriminatory procurement, stakeholder involvement, supply chain diversity and supply chain integration influence the performance of state corporations in the energy sector. The study recommends that state corporations should institutionalize procurement plans with a total reservation of at least 30% of the procurement budget to the special groups. The study also recommends that state corporations should authenticate tender awards and purchase orders and enter into agreements with relevant financing institutions with an undertaking that the contracted special enterprises be paid through the account opened with the financier. Consequently, the study recommends that local firms be offered more protection to enable them stand chance against the mega global entities. Further, the study recommends for involvement of citizens, local communities and civil society organizations in the process of purchasing goods and services by the state corporations through provision of input on procurement plans, monitoring procurement processes, and providing feedback on the quality of goods and services purchased. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended to state corporations that for them to effectively embrace supply chain diversity there is need to access and mitigate any barriers and bottlenecks that may hinder fair treatment, equity and justice in supply chain processes. The study also recommends to state corporations to explore and embrace advanced and emerging technologies in exchange of strategic supply chain information for improvement in the relationship and integration between the supply chain partners. The study further recommends for collaborations within the supply chain to allow firms to partner by combining core competencies and expertise as firms derive more benefits from working together than individual firms can gain on their own.</jats:p>"

Such coordination, which involves pricing a destination card, is challenging when a foreign tour operator is present. Though the literature shows that cooperative pricing between a destination management organization and a tour operator increases total profits, the most advantageous profit sharing for a destination has not been addressed. With a theoretical model of base and add-on products, this paper identifies the arrangement between a public destination management organization and a foreign tour operator that will accrue the highest profits for a destination. It is found that the most profitable option for a destination is a cooperative agreement in which the foreign tour operator is offered the same profits as a price leader under non-cooperation. This result comes from the fact that non-cooperation entails an unstable situation in which the tour operator is not willing to relinquish price leadership. The findings are of practical interest to help achieve economic sustainability in tourism destinations that rely on foreign tour operators and seek to coordinate their complementary tourism supply. </jats:p>",

Individual supply-side characteristics are found to be a key determinant of wages for native workers, and are relatively more important in explaining the wage variation than demand-side effects. In contrast, individual supply-side characteristics are found to explain noticeably less of the wage variation for immigrant workers. Therefore, this study reveals that native and immigrant wages do not solely reflect the workers’ productivity, although this effect is far more pronounced for the migrant workers.</jats:p>"

Recognizing the poor financial scenario of the systems at the moment, it is deemed necessary to adopt necessary measures/interventions to help improve the existing financial situation and to ensure the optimum level of operation and maintenance. To further substantiate the findings and assessments, a case study for Thimphu Water supply systems was carried out through a conventional approach to examine specific interventions that are deemed vital to address key issues and challenges. In conclusion, based on overall findings and assessment, recommendations have been proposed that are in principle, implementable across all existing urban water supply systems in Bhutan because of the reasons that all water utilities across the country are managed/operated in the same manner as Thimphu Thromde including the organizational set-up of the existing water supply management, mode of financing, availing donor assistance for capital investments, seeking tariff revisions, system designs, amongst others and such parameters are regulated by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. The adoption of the proposed measures, particularly addressing of the ‘non-revenue water’ and conduct of advocacy measures on water conservation would significantly help the water utilities enhance the financial sustainability of the systems thereby resulting in overall improvement in the delivery of water services to the consumers.</jats:p>"

It is important for a modern company to qualitatively form a list of personal priority areas for improvement, based on its own strengths, financial capabilities and available resources. It is obvious that today logistics plays a huge role in our lives and the environmental impact of its activities is very serious as it involves a huge number of enterprises, different companies, vehicles and customers. For a long time, people simply did not pay enough attention to the gradual process of environmental pollution and climate change. It is not surprising at all that today the effective concept of sustainable development has gained special popularity, as it wishes that both present and future generations can not only live in a healthy environment with an adequate standard of living, but also be able to satisfy all their possible needs and ambitions, using the available resources of the Earth with maximum rationality, respect and efficiency. The most effective way to follow this concept is the creation and gradual implementation of «green» business strategies.

Building on contingency theory, the study employs focus‐group interviews with various experts to generate new insights into fitting supply chain capabilities and enabling technologies. Data collected in the focus groups helped us to identify five supply chain capabilities as prevalent and mostly fitting the external contingencies, i.e., customer‐driven, urban‐centered, resource‐efficient, fast reactive, and human‐centered supply chain. Moreover, this study highlights and compares the potential of I4.0 technologies and their applications in supporting specific supply chain capabilities. The findings of this study can inform supply chain managers in the definition of capabilities to be enhanced at the supply chain level and contribute toward understanding the extent of I4.0 technologies in empowering supply chains to face turbulent and changing conditions.</jats:p>",

The study was guided by the following objectives: to establish the effect of customer integration on the performance of fast-moving consumer goods firms in Kenya, to determine the effect of internal integration on the performance of fast-moving consumer goods firms in Kenya and to examine the effect of supplier integration on the performance of fast-moving consumer goods firms in Kenya. The study was anchored on the following theories: transaction cost economies theory, contingency theory, and the resource-based view theory. The study adopted a descriptive research design, and the target population was 261 employees from 8 departments. The sample size was 158 respondents who were selected through stratified and simple random sampling technique. The study used questionnaires to collect primary data. Data analysis was done using the SPSS   software v.25. A multivariate regression model was used to determine the relative importance of each variable of the study and correlation analysis was carried out to find the relationships between the variables under the study. The study concluded that integrated supply chain practices had a positive and significant effect on the performance of fast-moving consumer goods firms in Kenya at Unga limited. The study recommended that FMCG firms enhance the utilization of supplier integration practices to improve organizational performance. Further, the study recommends that internal integration and customer integration be strategically used as policy tools for coordination, production planning and scheduling, customer order management, and demand planning as this will enhance the overall organizational performance.</jats:p>"

To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: calculation of the dependences of the delivery water cooling in the supply and return pipelines on the air temperature, construction of temperature and flow rate schedules of delivery water adjusted for heat losses during transportation, calculation of energy efficiency indicators for the operation of a model CHPP with various options for correcting schedules of delivery water. The most significant results are the following. Firstly, for the first time the method of the degree-by-degree calculation of heat losses during transportation and their distribution between pipelines of heating networks was used. Secondly, the dependences of the delivery water cooling in these pipelines on the outside air temperature are calculated. Thirdly, it has been established that the specific reference fuel consumption for electricity supply significantly decreases when switching to more efficient temperature schedules for heating regulation, but changes slightly when switching from natural regulation by flow rate to regulation by the temperature of the delivery water. The significance of the obtained results lies in the possibility of their use for an accurate assessment of the efficiency of heat supply systems with different heating control schedules and for determining the feasibility of correcting temperature schedules in order to take into account the cooling of delivery water during transportation.</jats:p>"

This study aims to investigate the impact of money supply increases on the capacity of secondary sources of financing and to achieve the goals of expansionary monetary policy. In 2011, 399 non-financial firms were listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, after excluding those firms that did not provide complete information between our selected periods excluded from the sample. Data from 156 non-financial firms were finally used for analysis. Panel data have been collected from the non-financial firms of Pakistan. After applying the Fixed Effects Model, the results provide evidence that an increase in the money supply in the economy of Pakistan would lead to an enhancement in the financing channels, like trade credit. This study explores the relationship between monetary policy adopted by the central bank and the use of trade credit. Collectively, the results also favor positive relationships between access to the capital market and trade credit patterns. This study recommends that during the time of monetary expansion, firms with better access to financial institutions were more willing to enhance credit sales. For future research, it suggests comparing the use of trade credit during the tight and expansionary monetary policy. </jats:p>"

Different quantities of nitrogen, green manure, pressmudbiocompost, goat manure, seaweed extract, and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) were employed in the eight treatments. The treatments were replicated thrice, and the field trial was laid out using randomised block design (RBD). According to the research outcome, among the different treatments, 100% RDN + 25% N as Pressmudbiocompost + PSB resulted in higher morphological characters, including plant height (124.11cm), leaf area index (4.84), dry mater production (13012 kg/ha), number of tillers/hill (33.30), chlorophyll content (30.66), root length (28.39 cm) and volume (23.64 cc/hill) and yield characteristics, including productive tillers/hill (31.30), grains/panicle (153.70), and filled grain/panicle (147.40),grain yield (6693 kg/ha) and straw yield (7865 kg/ha)of rice. Multiple parameters in the control treatment scenario indicated lower production and inadequate growth and development.

Such an integration perfectly fits telecom tower power supply needs, both in off-grid and grid-connected sites. In this framework, a model-based tool enabling both optimal sizing and proper year-through energy management of both the above applications is proposed. Respectively, the islanded optimisation is performed considering two economic indices, i.e., simple payback (SPB) and levelised cost of energy (LCOE), together with two strategies of hydrogen tank management, charge sustaining and depleting, and also accounting for the impact of grid extension distance. On the other hand, the grid connection is addressed through the dynamic programming method, while downsizing PEMELS and HST sizes to improve techno-economic effectiveness, thanks to grid contribution towards renewables curtailment issues mitigation. For both the above introduced HST management strategies, a reduction of more than 70% of the nominal PEMELS power and 90% of the HST size, which will in turn lead to SPB and LCOE being reduced by 80% and 60% in comparison to the islanded case, respectively, is achieved. Furthermore, the charge depleting strategy, relying on possible hydrogen purchase, interestingly provides an SPB and LCOE of 9% and 7% lower than the charge sustaining one.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Formulation of the problem. The structure shown in Figure 1 is widely used to build spacecraft power supply systems. It contains a solar battery in series and voltage regulator, which a load is connected to its output. To supply power to the load when the solar panel has no or insufficient capacity, the power supply system uses a battery pack which is charged and discharged by means of a charge-discharge device connected between the output of the voltage regulator and the battery pack. The power supply can be used to build power supply systems for a wide range of autonomous objects, such as unmanned aerial vehicles with long flight times, unattended weather stations, and environmental monitoring stations.  In a power supply system with the structure shown in Figure 1, each of the devices can stabilize the output voltage: a voltage regulator, a discharge device and a battery charger. In such a power supply system, the operation of the charger and the discharger are separated in time, allowing them to function together.  The use as a charge-discharge boost-decrease reversible pulse voltage converter with a high efficiency allows minimizing the number of elements in the power circuit of the device due to the possibility of reversing the energy flow reversal, which will improve the weight and size characteristics of the system and increase to increase its reliability.  The purpose is to show the feasibility of using a converter with a high efficiency factor and the possibility of reversing the energy flow as a charge-discharge device as part of the power supply system of an autonomous object. To develop a model and confirm the possibility of operating the pulse converter as a charger in two modes: in the mode of providing a given charging current of the battery and in the mode of charging the battery with a decreasing current at a given voltage on the battery.  Results. The expediency of using a reversible pulse converter with a high efficiency factor and the possibility of reversing the energy flow as a charger in the power supply system of an autonomous object is shown. A model has been developed and confirmed of the converter as a charger in two modes: in the mode of providing a given charging current of the battery and in the mode of charging the battery with a decreasing current at a given voltage on the battery pack.  Practical Significance. The use of a reversible pulse converter as a single charge-discharge converter in the power supply system of an autonomous object will improve the mass-size characteristics, efficiency and reliability of the power supply system and increase life time of active operation of autonomous object as a whole Keywords: power supply system, autonomous object, solar battery, accumulator battery, pulse converter, charge-discharge device.</jats:p>",

This paper considers a closed‐loop supply chain (CLSC) with MC, in which the manufacturer sells the new, modular MC products via the retailer and also actively recycles the used ones for remanufacturing. We study the optimal modularity level for new MC products and the best recycling channel for used MC products in a CLSC. One centralized and two decentralized recycling decision models are formulated, and then the equilibrium solutions among proposed models are compared and analyzed. The government subsidy and channel leadership are further discussed in extension. Different from the traditional view that outsourcing the recycling activity to retailer is best because of its proximity to consumers, our results suggest that the manufacturer directly recycling used MC products can be optimal in terms of modularity level, recycling rate, supply chain profits, total social surplus, and decision‐making speed.</jats:p>",

The research investigates the impact of the circular supply chain (CSC) and big data implementation on firm performance, specifically in the Pakistan Manufacturing Sector. Further, it has investigated digital technologies' mediating role in the firm's performance in the Pakistan manufacturing sector. The research was conducted using quantitative data from the questionnaire survey from 400 participants (i.e., firm managers) working in the Pakistan manufacturing sector. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling comprising confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis using SmartPLS. Findings show a negative and significant influence of CSC practices on firm performance in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. On the contrary, big data implementation positively and significantly impacts the firms' performance. Further, the mediating role of digital technology over firm performance through CSC practices and big data implementation was also found to be positive and significant. The research has contributed to the present state of literature in different ways. First, the research presented the mediating role of digital technologies in the relationship between CSC and big data implementation and firm performance.</jats:p>",

However, the shortage of water resources in coastal cities has become a bottleneck for sustainable economic, social and ecological development. As a typical coastal city in Liaoning province, China, Yingkou has a relatively developed economy, but faces increasingly serious water shortages. Taking Yingkou as a case study, this study analysed the current situation of urban and rural water supply and conducted a rational estimation of the water supply and demand based on the time series method in the short‐term (2025) and long‐term (2035). Then, the allocation of urban and rural water supply was carried out on the principle of priority use of surface water, sufficient use of diverted water, expanding use of unconventional water and limited use of underground water. To achieve the optimal scheme, the method of ‘allocation‐feedback‐regulation‐reallocation’ was adopted to coordinate the water sources and consumption in different districts and sectors. Overall, the results clarified the red line of water consumption in 2025 and 2035 and defined water consumption and water sources in different sectors and districts. Finally, the water supply and demand balance in Yingkou and its subdistricts was achieved with surplus water rates of 6% and 7% in 2025 and 2035, respectively. Based on these results, suggestions for the sustainable development and utilization of water resources in Yingkou and coastal cities were proposed.</jats:p>",

The majority of the existing security models work effectively on small to medium-sized datasets with a homogenous data structure. In contrast, Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems in the real world utilize heterogeneous databases. The heterogeneous databases include a massive quantity of raw SCM data and a scanned image of a purchase quotation. In addition, as the size of the database grows, it becomes more challenging to provide data security on multi-user SCM databases. Multi-user datatypes are heterogeneous in structure, and it is complex to apply integrity and confidentiality models due to high computational time and resources. Traditional multi-user integrity algorithms are difficult to process heterogeneous datatypes due to computational time and variation in hash bit size. Conventional attribute-based encryption models such as \"Key-policy attribute-based encryption\" (KP-ABE), \"Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption\" (CP-ABE) etc., are used to provide strong data confidentiality on large textual data. Providing security for heterogeneous databases in a multi-user SCM system requires a significant computational runtime for these conventional models. An enhanced integrity-based multi-user access control security model is created for heterogeneous databases in the cloud infrastructure to address the problems with heterogeneous SCM databases. A non-linear integrity model is developed to provide strong integrity verification in the multi-user communication process. A multi-user based access control model is implemented by integrating the multi-user hash values in the encoding and decoding process. Practical results proved that the multi-user non-linear integrity-based multi-access control framework has better runtime and hash bit variation compared to the conventional models on large cloud-based SCM databases.</jats:p>"

Our research tries to identify the potential causes behind the price-increasing issues of vegetables in the existing vegetable supply chain in Bangladesh.

In this study, we tried to mention the reasons behind the price-increasing issues after conducting surveys. To conduct our research, we spoke with farmers and middlemen who are actively involved in the vegetable supply chain. Through our survey and after having conversations with them, we found out that both parties (farmers &amp; middlemen) are dissatisfied with the current state. We came to know that the farmers feel the necessity of having a central supply chain system, and the middlemen are talking about the government's involvement in the whole process. When it comes to recommending a solution, we can't do a practical solution regarding the government's involvement.

The development of the eroded clayey sandy soil area, which expands over time, is the cause of the formation of a sinkhole under the road, which is dangerous for vehicles and people. In this study, the authors apply finite element software (Plaxis 3D) to model water supply pipelines in sandy soil in case the pipeline leaks water with different pressures.

In parallel, meteorological weather systems such as midlatitude cyclones are often organized in a way that naturally shapes where areas of greater energy need (e.g., regions with more cold air) are with respect to windier or sunnier areas, and these are generally not collocated. As a result, the best places to generate renewable energy may not be near consumption sites; these may be determined, however, by common meteorological patterns. Using data from a reanalysis of six decades of past weather, we determined the complementarity between different sources of energy as well as the relationships between renewable supply and demand at daily averaged time scales for several North American cities.

Richards’ equation was adopted to describe groundwater flow in the vadose zone. Laplace transform and cosine Fourier transform were chosen to derive a semi-analytical solution of the governing equations. A finite-element numerical solution built with COMSOL software was used to test the semi-analytical solution. The buildups of the hydraulic head were investigated for different hydraulic parameters. Some noteworthy conclusions were obtained. The vadose zone parameters (constitutive exponent (κD) and specific yield (Sy)) have a significant effect on the buildups in the vadose zone and saturated zone. A larger κD value and smaller Sy value both lead to higher buildups in the vadose zone, while a larger κD value and a larger Sy value resulted in smaller buildups. As for the specific storage (Ss) of the saturated zone, the influence on buildup is more obvious in the saturated zone rather than in the vadose zone. The analysis further indicates that Media Anisotropy (Kz/Kx) value exhibits opposite influences on the hydraulic head in vadose and saturated zone. The present solution offers a valuable basis for further research of groundwater recharge and better design of MAR engineering.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ability to swiftly restore functionality following an extreme event is an essential characteristic of a disaster resilient infrastructure system. However, the restoration of functionality of a single infrastructure system often depends on the functionality of other systems that provide resources the considered system needs to operate and recover. Furthermore, infrastructure systems are crucial for the post-disaster functional recovery of the building stock of a community. Thus, community resilience assessment and improvement require a system-of-systems perspective, considering the post-disaster performance of several interdependent infrastructure systems and the building stock at the same time. One of the principal issues in resilience assessment and improvement is that such system-of-systems consideration may require detailed information on the vulnerability and recoverability of numerous components. While such information might be available for certain systems (e.g., housing), for others, the information might be unavailable due to privacy and security concerns (e.g., electric power supply systems or buildings housing important functions). In this paper, we propose a supply/demand interface between the system-of-systems simulator, defined within the interdependent Resilience - Compositional Demand/Supply (iRe-CoDeS) framework, and the individual infrastructure system simulators. Such an interface can be used for regional recovery simulation and resilience assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems, while allowing infrastructure system operators to maintain system’s privacy and/or security. We define a tiered supply/demand interface, where the amount of information provided by individual systems can range from system-level to component-level post-disaster evolution of resource supply and demand, assessed using expert opinion or confidential in-house models. The proposed supply/demand interfaces are illustrated in a semi-virtual case study, assessing the seismic resilience of North-East San Francisco, focusing on the effect of interdependent infrastructure on the functional recovery of residential buildings.</jats:p>",

They have the potential of maintaining a stable supply load during failure periods when using islanding operations. Therefore, DG and ES have capacity value, i.e., improving the power supply capability of the system. However, there are strong fluctuations in DG outputs, and the operations of ES devices have sequential characteristics. The same capacity of DG has different load-bearing capabilities compared to conventional thermal or hydroelectric units. This paper proposes a method for evaluation of power supply capability improvement in DNs. First, the temporal fluctuation in both power source and load demand during fault periods is considered. A DN island partition model considering the secondary power outage constraint is established. Then, a modified genetic algorithm is designed. The complex island partition model is solved to achieve accurate power supply reliability evaluation. And the incremental power supply capability associated to DG and ES devices is calculated. Finally, a case study is conducted on the PG&amp;E 69-bus system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is found that with a 20% configuration ratio of ES devices, the power supply capability improvement brought about by 6 MW DG can reach about 773 kW.</jats:p>"

This research examines a green supply chain problem influenced by eco-label policies, focusing on two prevalent market eco-label types. One allows the manufacturer to determine product greenness, while the other requires compliance with standards set by a non-governmental organization (NGO). We also explore the variability in consumer comprehension of eco-label implications and purchasing behaviors with different eco-labeled products. Through consumer utility and manufacturer profit models, we discover that the manufacturer's production and pricing choices significantly impact consumer behavior. Increased investigation costs may enhance consumer utility through improved product greenness, potentially boosting manufacturer profit via price hikes. However, if investigation costs are minimal, the NGO-label may be rejected due to decreased utility and profit. These insights could help direct supply chains by providing a theoretical foundation for green production decisions and future eco-label policies, whether determined by an NGO or the manufacturer.</jats:p>"

Using the panel data of SMEs listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020, we employ robust estimations of panel-corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust fixed-effects methods to analyze the issue. Our cash–cash-flow sensitivity model points out that listed SMEs in China show significant cash–cash-flow sensitivity, and financing constraints are prevalent. We document that the development of SCF has a mitigation effect on the financing constraints on the SMEs. Our robustness test with Yohai’s MM-estimator is also supportive of the main finding. Our study indicates the importance of supply chain finance development in alleviating the financing constraints on SMEs and, subsequently, supporting their sustainability journey. Overall, our findings have important policy implications for the stakeholders involved in emerging markets, and there are lessons to be learned from the Chinese experience. There is still much to be explored in the nexus of SCF and the financing difficulties of SMEs in China at present, with much of the extant literature concentrating only on specific financing mechanisms.

While, unlike other development projects, these projects face unique supply chain challenges that agriculture development projects focus primarily on increasing crop production to ensure food security in a country, which is affected not only by social or national context issues but also by natural environments. Since no previous research has investigated the supply chain issues of ID agriculture projects, this study makes a significant contribution to the literature by identifying the key supply chain challenges of ID agriculture projects in a developing country context and proposing specific solutions to these challenges. Initially, the study conducted a literature review to generate a primary list of project supply chain challenges. To identify more significant and relevant challenges, the study conducted focus group discussions and consulted with an expert panel; it identified seventeen critical challenges and provided specific recommendations to address each challenge. The recommendations were then ranked using the fuzzy Delphi method based on their importance. Certain critical challenges, such as political influence, are exacerbated by the unique project and context environments. While others are the result of donors’ incompatible strategies and influences (e.g., donor-incompatible regulations). Some of them are created by both the host nation and the donors (delayed project launch, for example). Moreover, the projects face specific challenges posed by natural environments (such as natural disasters). To ensure value for money within the project’s scope, it is recommended that the professionals adopt the most important strategies to address the challenges. Not only are the findings impressive for industry professionals, but also policymakers, development partners, academics, and future researchers.</jats:p>"

Knowledge management (KM) practices and their adoption in single firms to manage inter-firm relationships can be of great help, but the current studies on this aspect are very fragmented. There is still insufficient knowledge of what practices are adopted to manage knowledge and how intensely these are used in inter-firm relationships and especially in supply chains. This study contributes to filling this gap by measuring the level of adoption and intensity of use of KM practices in companies. Also, it provides a comparison between their use at the intra- and inter-firm level. A survey of a sample of European large- and medium-sized manufacturing firms was used. A descriptive statistical analysis and a correlation analysis were performed. The study confirms that KM practices are used in companies, but with a varied level of adoption and intensity of use among firms. Especially, it resulted that KM is less used at an inter-firm level, and there is a relatively higher variation among firms in the inter-firm use rather than the internal context. On the other hand, the correlation analysis revealed that the more intensely firms used KM internally, the more likely they will intensely employ them to manage knowledge in SC relationships. The usefulness of the study lies in the fact that improving the awareness of business managers and consultants, both at firm and inter-firm, can facilitate introduction and development of KM programs. </jats:p>",

Here we show an electrochemical path for the 3‐propyladipic acid synthesis from 4‐propylcyclohexanol implementing a semi‐technical electrochemical continuously stirred tank reactor. Following a <jats:italic>Design of Experiments</jats:italic> approach, we found a strong influence of the biphasic electrolyte mixing and the continuous feeding in of the substrate. By switching to an electrolyte recirculation mode and efficient mixing, the isolated product yield could be increased up to 31 % for a 10 L total reaction volume, indicating the potential for further scale‐up into the technical range. This reaction proceeds while forming several by‐products, which have not been fully described yet. A proposal for the formation mechanism is included.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pandemics, trade frictions, and military conflicts may disrupt manufacturers' production capacity. This paper develops a two‐period supply chain model with supply disruption risk in the second period to investigate inventory decisions and the manufacturer's commitment strategies. We consider three strategies: no commitment, price commitment, and inventory commitment. Inventory holding within the supply chain is investigated under each strategy, and the dominant strategy is determined by comparing them. Distinct results arise due to supply disruption risk. First, the retailer may have two opposite motives for inventory holding: inventory‐building motive and inventory‐shifting motive (i.e., shifting inventory burden to the manufacturer by decreasing order quantity), where the latter is exclusive to situations with supply disruption risk. Price commitment suppresses both motives, and inventory commitment suppresses only inventory shifting. Second, the retailer never holds inventory under price commitment. Under no commitment and inventory commitment, for high (low) holding cost and disruption risk, only the manufacturer (retailer) holds inventory. Furthermore, the manufacturer's inventory may decrease as disruption risk increases. Third, regarding strategy choice, while each strategy can be the dominant choice for the retailer and the supply chain, the manufacturer (weakly) prefers inventory commitment to the other two strategies. However, the implementation of inventory commitment demands high supply chain transparency, as the manufacturer always has an incentive to secretly deviate by holding less inventory. When inventory commitment is infeasible, the price commitment strategy's performance varies compared to no commitment, contrasting with the disruption risk‐free literature where wholesale price commitment never outperforms no commitment. </jats:p>",

There is an emphasis on how adept cost management can determine the economic feasibility of exploiting residual biomass. Methods: The research delves into crucial areas including collection, transportation, storage, and processing of biomass, highlighting their respective roles in the total cost. The influence of factors such as seasonality and biomass quality variations on the supply chain's cost and efficiency is explored. To provide an in-depth analysis of these factors, mathematical models are presented that allow for the examination of a variety of scenarios and optimization strategies. Techniques such as linear programming, genetic algorithms, and tabu search are contextualized within these models. Results: The study provides in-sights into individual cost contributions of different logistical operations. It also reveals how seasonality and biomass quality variations directly affect the cost and efficacy of the supply chain. Conclusions: Proficient logistical cost management is crucial for the successful exploitation of residual biomass. The findings have substantial implications for managing the residual biomass supply chain, paving the way for a transition to a low-carbon economy.</jats:p>"

Especially in the case of sudden load increase, virtual synchronous generator bears too much load in the transient process because of its fast adjustment speed, and even causes short-term overload, which makes the capacity of virtual synchronous generator can not be fully utilized. In view of this problem, firstly, the mechanism of transient power uneven distribution of two heterogeneous power sources is explained from the differences of frequency modulation, voltage regulation and output impedance. Secondly, virtual speed regulation, virtual excitation and dynamic virtual impedance are added to the traditional virtual synchronous generator control to simulate the speed regulation characteristics and electromagnetic transient characteristics of the synchronous generator, so as to realize the transient and steady-state power equalization between heterogeneous power supplies when the virtual synchronous generator and the synchronous generator run in parallel. Thirdly, in order to ensure the fast dynamic response characteristics of the virtual synchronous generator in independent operation mode, the traditional virtual synchronous generator control algorithm is still maintained in independent operation mode, and the mode switching control link based on state tracking is designed to realize smooth switching between the two working modes. Finally, the hardware in loop experiment results based on RT-LAB show that the proposed control method can realize the transient and steady-state power equalization when the virtual synchronous generator and the synchronous generator operate in parallel, it can keep the fast voltage regulation and frequency modulation ability when the virtual synchronous generator operates independently, and can realize smooth switching between independent and parallel operation modes.</jats:p>"

This is because the world suffers from a lack of potable water. Water and energy are adjoining linked fields. The present work aims at investigating the performance of a reverse osmosis (RO) plant integrated with Pelton Wheel under various operating conditions. The main reason for using Pelton turbine instead of the pressure exchanger (PX) is the low cost of Pelton compared to that of PX. The RO system integrated with the Pelton Wheel was tested under various operating pressures of 650, 700, 750, 800, and 850 kPa. Changing the feed water pressure affects the pressure of the reject entering the Pelton wheel and this, in turn, affects the velocity of the water jet. Also, the impact of varying the feed water salinity (total dissolved solids (TDS) = 400, 500, 600, 700, and 850 ppm) and temperature (20–39 °C) on the permeate and reject of RO was tested. In addition, a theoretical modeling was built to predict the performance of the RO system. The permeate flow rate was increased by raising the RO operating pressures. The permeate flow rate was augmented from 2.5 to 4.3 L min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when increasing the operating pressure from 650 to 850 kPa, respectively. Therefore, the permeate flow rate is enhanced by around 72% when increasing the operating pressure by only 30%. Besides, increasing the pressure by 30% (from 650 to 860 kPa) decreased the generated power of the Pelton Wheel by approximately 72% (from 960 to 270 W, respectively). Also, increasing the feed water salinity leads to raise the salinity of RO permeate, and vice versa. The RO permeate salinity is raised from 165 to 285 ppm when increasing the operating pressure from 650 to 850 kPa, respectively. As well, the more the increase in feed water temperature, the more improve in the permeate flux and salinity. The permeate TDS was decreased from 140 ppm at feed-water temperature 20 °C to 56 ppm at feed water temperature 39 °C. In this study, the Arduino program circuit was used to supply the required emergency loads by controlling the pressure values of high-pressure pump due to easy and open code program. Finally, the theoretical modelling results are in good correspondence with the experimental results. The average deviation among the theoretical and experimental results was 3.5%.</jats:p>"

Several countries have magnified their efforts to reach carbon neutrality goals. The increased attention to carbon‐neutral goals has been enabled by United Nations (UN) calls for a carbon‐neutral economy. In this context, supply chains will have greater responsibilities to reduce the network's carbon footprint. To achieve carbon neutrality goals, decision‐makers must be well‐informed and facilitated with suitable theoretical frameworks. In literature, the adoption of intelligent technologies is suggested to construct efficient and smart supply chains. However, there are uncertainties regarding the impact of this transformation on the carbon neutrality goal. The present study caters to the uncertainties by discussing its potential impact on carbon neutrality goals and how to use adopted technologies to achieve the same. A list of 11 potential strategies is identified and modelled to provide a strategic roadmap for smart supply chains' adoption. The proposed framework aims to facilitate carbon neutrality goals. The findings indicate that decision‐makers must pay significant attention to circular economy practices. Additionally, green transportation is an impactful area with significant potential to support carbon neutrality goals. Critical insights have been extracted regarding stakeholders' training and process innovation. The study findings can help decision‐makers achieve carbon neutrality goals.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a study to examine the characteristics of supply chain among Bumiputera entrepreneurs in the wood industry registered with the Malaysian Timber Industry Board was conducted. The results revealed that most of the respondents were micro- and small-sized enterprises, with a sales focus on the domestic and contract-market. They were predominantly wooden furniture manufacturers, who had a relatively low level of knowledge about supply chain management. The respondents also indicated that their major challenges include lack of finances, small volume of production, and the lack of government support. The factor analysis and regression analysis conducted revealed that for Bumiputera entrepreneurs to gain better supply chain management they need to improve their frequency of engagement, trust, culture, and maturity with their supply chain actors and partners. The results of this study are unique, as it implies that policymakers should take heed of improving supply chain management, to reverse the flagging fortune of Bumiputera entrepreneurs in the Malaysian wood products and furniture sector.</jats:p>"

In this paper, an extreme learning machine model was developed with the objective function of wheat production maximization. The constraints defined for this problem are divided into three categories: technical parameters of production in agriculture, climatic stress on water resources and land limits. The water, land and food nexus was simulated using 23 experimental farms in Henan province during the 2021–2022 cultivation year. Root-mean-square error was used as an error criterion, and Pearson's coefficient was incorporated into the decision-making system as a correlation index of variables. Harvest index, length of the growth period, cultivation costs and irrigation water were the criteria to evaluate the impact of the sustainable model. The harvest index and the length of the growth period showed the highest and lowest correlation with the production rate, respectively. Furthermore, the optimal management of irrigation water and cost had the most significant impact on increasing crop production. The method proposed in this paper can be a virtual cropping model by changing the area under cultivation of a crop in the different farms of a study area, which increases yield production.</jats:p>",

It is particularly difficult in small municipalities that lack the human and financial resources to maintain complex and/or expensive water treatment systems, especially in regions where the water is naturally contaminated with toxic substances such as arsenic. This paper analyses two municipalities (Kanjiža and Senta) in northern Serbia with groundwater arsenic concentrations significantly higher than the 10 µg/L maximum allowable concentration. Two different water supply approaches are compared: (1) local supply, where each settlement has their own treatment plant using existing sources; (2) creation of a centralised network, which connects several settlements together with better quality water sources. The analysis considers techno-economical aspects and the quantity and quality of available water, as well as the yields investment and exploitation cost projections for both approaches. The results demonstrate that for small municipalities, a holistic approach to decision making is necessary to find the best solutions for drinking water supply, which in the case of the two municipalities studied is connection to a centralised system supplied from better quality water sources and the creation of connections beyond municipal administrative boundaries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sierra Leone is suffering from a persistent electricity gap that has crippled its economic growth and prevented it from attaining several health and education development goals. This persistent electricity gap has generated significant interest in tackling the country’s long-lasting energy deficiency. Providing electricity in a reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective manner in Sierra Leone requires adopting robust integrated energy planning and appropriate technologies. Despite various interventions by the government, a balance between electricity demand and supply has yet to be achieved. Using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP), this work assesses Sierra Leone’s energy supply and demand for 2019–2040. We developed three case scenarios (Base, Middle, and High) based on forecasted demand, resource potential, techno-economic parameters, and CO2 emissions. The Base case considers the electricity sector as business as usual, the Middle case examines the electricity sector reform roadmap and the prospect of integrating renewable energy into the power system, and the High case examines the sustainable development of the power generation system considering the electricity sector roadmap. As part of this study, we analyze potential alternatives to conventional electricity generation systems aimed at providing electricity in a sustainable, reliable, and affordable manner, including the use of renewable energy sources and technologies with less CO2 emissions. Model results estimate an increase in electricity demand of 1812.5 GWh, 1936 GWh, and 2635.8 GWh for Base, Middle, and High cases respectively. Also, there is a reduction in production, fuel cost, and CO2 emission in the High case to the Base case by 67.15%, 35.79%, and 51.8%, respectively. This paper concludes with recommendations devised from the study results for the power system of Sierra Leone.</jats:p>"

Despite several reports highlighting its benefits, there is still a lack of concrete and proven studies examining the importance of institutional pressures for the transition towards CE in food supply chains. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the drivers and barriers to the institutionalisation of CE in food supply chains, and to propose practical and managerial implications for achieving this transition through institutional pressure. We reviewed 25 studies and conducted a descriptive analysis of papers per year and journal, followed by a categorical thematic analysis. The results indicate that normative pressures were the most frequently identified among the different institutional pressures, followed by mimetic and coercive pressures. Therefore, promoting CE in food supply chains may require the implementation of laws, policies, and strict governance to reduce risks. This paper contributes to the existing literature and provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners interested in the transition towards a CE in food supply chains.</jats:p>",

The lack of proper nutrient intake leads to the development of bladder cancer because insufficient nutrients are consumed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this review was to analyze the nutrients closely linked to the onset and advancement of bladder cancer and to explore the relationship between dietary nutrients and bladder cancer. Particular emphasis was placed on nutrients that are frequently ingested in daily life, including sugar, fat, protein, and others. The focus of this research was to analyze how nutritional intake before and after surgery affects the recovery process of patients who have been diagnosed with bladder cancer. This article seeks to increase awareness among both society and the medical community about the significance of implementing appropriate dietary nutrition to reduce the chances of developing bladder cancer, enhance perioperative care for patients with bladder cancer, and aid in their recuperation.</jats:p>"

The improper disposal of these items poses a serious environmental threat. The present study explores the potential of recycling PPE to not only enhance the profitability of the supply chain but also address the environmental challenges associated with disposal. Specifically, it focuses on implementing a closed‐loop approach involving the manufacturer, the customer, and the collector. An extensive literature review on inventory models was conducted, resulting in a comprehensive data set. The numerical analysis, conducted using the Generalized Reduced Gradient Solver, validates the findings. The proposed model suggests that investing in a closed‐loop supply chain, employing an energy‐efficient approach, can effectively reduce carbon emissions at every stage of the system. This can be achieved by leveraging intelligent machinery and skilled labor to meet the growing demand for PPE while minimizing energy consumption. Furthermore, this research emphasizes the importance of implementing the reduce, reuse, and recycle (3Rs) phenomenon to manage waste effectively. This study provides valuable insights for businesses aiming to optimize waste management practices and contribute to economic‐environmental‐social sustainability.</jats:p>",

Indeed, sustainable hydrogen production exploits the excess of renewable energy sources, after which temporary storage is required. The conventional approaches to hydrogen storage and transport are compressed hydrogen (CH2) and liquefied hydrogen (LH2), which require severe operating conditions related to pressure (300–700 bar) and temperature (T &lt; −252 °C), respectively. To overcome these issues, which have hindered market penetration, several alternatives have been proposed in the last few decades. In this review, the most promising hydrogen carriers (ammonia, methanol, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and metal hydrides) have been considered, and the main stages of their supply chain (production, storage, transportation, H2 release, and their recyclability) have been described and critically analyzed, focusing on the latest results available in the literature, the highlighting of which is our current concern. The last section reviews recent techno-economic analyses to drive the selection of hydrogen carrier systems and the main constraints that must be considered. The analyzed results show how the selection of H2 carriers is a multiparametric function, and it depends on technological factors as well as international policies and regulations.</jats:p>"

For development stage differences, the impact of LGCLS strategies on urban innovation exhibited an inverted U shape with economic growth. The inflection point occurred when the per capita GDP equaled approximately RMB23,101 in 2008. For regional differences, the inflection point in eastern China is higher and earlier than that in central and western China; before the inflection point, the positive influence was more obvious in the central and western regions, whereas after the inflection point, the negative influence was more obvious in the eastern region. For the eastern Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations and the northwestern resource‐based urban agglomerations with relatively high per capita GDP, the negative impact of LGCLS strategies on urban innovation occurred earlier and showed spatial agglomeration characteristics.</jats:p>",

From dimensional analysis, the sequent flow depth ratio of a hydraulic jump over the right-triangle basin is derived as a function of the inflow Froude number and relative length of the basin front. The proposed structure stabilized the hydraulic jump at the toe of the chute spillway and hydraulic jump characteristics were investigated for the Froude number ranging from 4.4 &amp;lt; F1 &amp;lt; 7. The results obtained from both numerical and experimental simulations yielded increased efficiency in the energy dissipation performance of this novel design. The modeling showed the formation of two large recirculation regions at the jump roller and jump bed at the beginning of the downstream channel, which resulted in intense energy dissipation in the right-triangle basin. The relative energy loss is approximately 37% higher for relative basin front lengths larger than three compared to the classic jump. Practitioners and academia on the usefulness of a right-triangle basin for hydraulic purposes and further experimental tests are needed to estimate the scalability and cost–benefit of this modified system for implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tSpacecraft often have instances where they are required to operate for long periods of time with significant power requirements and no access to solar power. While a battery system could be designed to meet these occasional, and possibly unexpected requirements, creating a power supply to meet these infrequent demands results in having a battery system that is excessively large, massive, and inefficient. A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system capable of running on the same fuel and oxidizer as the onboard thruster of a bipropellant thruster equipped spacecraft can eliminate much of the added mass and volume needed to enable batteries to meet extreme power demands and create more operational flexibility on how the chemical energy in stowed bipropellants are used. If the spacecraft needs thrust, the bipropellant can be ignited to provide thrust. If the spacecraft needs electric power, the spacecraft can consume bipropellant to generate auxiliary power. In this work, the proven bipropellant pair ammonia (NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) are shown to be a viable fuel and oxidant for hydrogen (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) consuming air breathing SOFCs, as spontaneous NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> decomposition will generate H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and spontaneous N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O decomposition will generate O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. A scale up to a 5-cell SOFC stack fed NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O produced power up to ~89W. Higher power can be achieved by scaling up the number of cells in a stack to achieve required power demands. The results of this study demonstrate the potential and feasibility of integrating SOFCs with a bipropellant thruster to creating a dual functioning spacecraft system that can satisfy operational power requirements and on-orbit maneuverability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory under agreement number FA9453-21-C-0060.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban residents’ well-being relies on fair access to living service amenities. To plan better living service amenities, planners need to balance supply and demand and find gaps and opportunities. We performed a spatial analysis of 2645 residential complexes in Xi’an, Shaanxi, China’s built-up area, using POI (Point of Interest), AOI (Area of Interest), and census and property data. We measured the supply status of 14 living service amenities by their number and distance and estimated the demand status of residents by their number and age. We also used location entropy and coupling coordination degree to measure the balance status. The results showed a spatial mismatch between supply and demand, with more amenities in the urban center where fewer and older residents lived, and fewer amenities in the suburbs where more and younger residents lived. The urban center had a location benefit but a lower coupling degree. The imbalance was mainly due to land finance and geographical segregation from unequal resource distribution. We also gave a visualization tool for planners to check any residential complex’s status and make informed decisions for amenity planning and construction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, the multi-mode resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problems (MMRCMPSPs) considering supply management and sustainable approach in the construction industry under uncertain conditions have been investigated using evidence theory to mathematical modeling and solving by multi-objective optimization algorithms. In this regard, a multi-objective mathematical model has been proposed, in which the first objective function aims to maximize a weighted selection of projects based on economic, environmental, technical, social, organizational, and competitive factors; the second objective function is focused on maximizing profit, and the third objective function is aimed at minimizing the risk of supply management. Moreover, various components, such as interest rates, carbon penalties, and other implementation limitations and additional constraints, have also been considered in the modeling and mathematical relationships to improve the model’s performance and make it more relevant to real-world conditions and related issues, leading to better practical applications. In the mathematical modeling adopted, the processing time of project activities has been considered uncertain, and the evidence theory has been utilized. This method can provide a flexible and rational approach based on evidence and knowledge in the face of uncertainty. In addition, to solve the proposed multi-objective mathematical model, metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as the differential evolution (DE) algorithm based on the Pareto archive, have been used, and for evaluating the results, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has also been employed. Furthermore, the results have been compared based on multi-objective evaluation criteria, such as quality metric (QM), spacing metric (SM), and diversity metric (DM). It is worth noting that to investigate the performance and application of the proposed model, multiple evaluations have been conducted on sample problems with different dimensions, as well as a case study on residential apartment construction projects by a contracting company. In this respect, the answers obtained from solving the model using the multi-objective DE algorithm were better and superior to the NSGA-II algorithm and had a more favorable performance. Generally, the results indicate that using the integrated multi-objective mathematical model in the present research for managing and scheduling multi-mode resource-constrained multi-project problems, especially in the construction industry, can lead to an optimal state consistent with the desired objectives and can significantly improve the progress and completion of projects.</jats:p>"

Following bankruptcy, the remaining supplier may serve as a backup option. Our research identifies settings in which the manufacturer should support the distressed supplier. We also find that in some cases, a nondistressed supplier may charge price premiums due to its competitor's distress, while in other cases, it may use predatory pricing to drive its competitor into bankruptcy.

Methods: The study used test results of 41 centralized water supply stations collected from Quang Ngai Center for Disease Control in December 2022 and compared them with QCVN 01-1:2018/BYT.  Results: 58.5% of stations had water quality that met QCVN 01-1:2018/BYT; 65.9% and 80.5% of stations with physicochemical and microbiological parameters met the standards. The parameters not meeting the standards were mainly nitrate content, hardness, chloride, taste, residual chlorine, Coliform and E. coli. In particular, 34.1% of stations did not meet the standard for the nitrate parameter. Private enterprises had the highest rate of meeting the standard (85.7%), followed by state enterprises (79.0%), private stations (25.0%) and cooperatives (14.3%). The Chi-square test showed that water supply stations had water quality checked, applied the right prices, trained operators in water supply, had a system of settling, filtering, disinfecting, and cleaning facilities and stations with operating time within five years had better water quality.  Conclusion: Water supply facilities, especially private stations and cooperatives need to improve their management, comply with regulations on internal inspection and pay attention to treating nitrate contamination. There should be a plan to send operators to specialized training in water supply. It is necessary to invest in the construction of a treatment and disinfection system, to replace the degraded, leaking distribution pipeline and to make an annual plan for the maintenance and cleaning of water supply facilities. The authorities need to provide specialized training on water supply and guide the management regulations for facility owners and operators. At the same time, there should be sanctions and strict handling measures for domestic water supply stations that violate regulations.</jats:p>",

Although some studies have suggested the efficiency of Web 3.0 in promoting a green supply chain, lack empirical evidence explaining how this efficiency is generated remains scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate this matter. By drawing upon relevant literature and leveraging the natural resource‐based view, a conceptual model is constructed and validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM). The analysis reveals that Web 3.0 can foster the formation of consensual thinking through its decentralized mechanism. This, in turn, enables firms to generate perceived value based on the efficiency of consensual thinking, leading to an increased intention to build mutual trust and facilitate green knowledge sharing among firms. Furthermore, the controllability provided by a permissioned mechanism enhances information security, guiding mutual trust among firms to evolve into trustless cooperation. As a result, firms exhibit full trust in each other, facilitating smoother green knowledge sharing. The influence of mutual trust and trustless cooperation in promoting green knowledge sharing contributes to the resilience of the supply chain and ultimately leads to superior green performance, contributing to environmentally sustainable development. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of the green supply chain and Web 3.0, filling a gap in the existing literature.</jats:p>",

However, in this endeavour, there are increased instances of uncertainties i.e. speeds of delivery, flexibility and environmental factors that affect the services rendered to the end consumer. This drives the concept of supply chain agility which focuses on the speeds of response to any changes in the consumer demands. The healthcare sector has undergone significant changes within the past decades. Amidst these changes, attaining efficient and effective healthcare service delivery remains a distant prospect among multiple nations. This study therefore sought to find out the moderating role of procurement governance on the relationship between supply chain agility and service delivery in the Public health care sector in the county governments of the western region. The hypothesis for the study was: - Procurement Governance has no significant influence on the relationship between Supply Chain Agility and Service Delivery of the Public Health care sector in the County Governments of Western Region The study was anchored on three theories, theory of Human Service Delivery, Dynamic Capability Perspectives and Institutional Theory. The study adopted a Positivist research philosophy and a descriptive survey research design and the target population was 284 respondents of the four level 5 county hospitals in the western region. Questionnaires and interview schedules were used for data collection and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Data was presented using tables, scree plots and scatter plots.  The study is of value to researchers and academicians, County government authorities and residents of the four counties. 258 respondents participated in the study and preliminary data checking, screening and cleaning was done. Validity and reliability statistics were done and they indicated that the research instruments were adequate for their purpose. Diagnostic tests were also conducted and none of the variables violated these assumptions. Regression analysis was done for the Supply Chain Agility and service delivery. Supply chain agility accounted for 44.5% of the changes in Service Delivery, but with the introduction of procurement governance as a moderator, the R2 value rose to 59.4% with p˂0.05. This indicated that Procurement Governance was a significant moderator of the relationship. The study recommended that hospitals to should pay attention to three main aspects of procurement governance. First, they should set rules and policies that describe the authoritative position regarding the standards, principles, and objectives of the procurement process. Such standards include transparency and Accountability.</jats:p>"

The search for information was carried out by means of an initial selection based on the abstracts and titles of the available information, identifying potentially eligible articles in the different Google Scholar and SciELO databases. The population consisted of 25 documents registered under the format of articles/books consulted, selected through criteria, being conformed by a total of six (06) documents. It has been found in the bibliographic review that the use of pesticides in tomato, not only affects its quality, but also that of traders and the ecosystem itself; however, it was found that the expenses produced by the investment lead the farmer to look for mechanisms to increase his profit, such as the use of substances that can reduce the pests that naturally affect this type of vegetable. It was discovered that growers lack techniques for spraying, and that spraying is carried out profusely, as well as inadequate post-harvest vegetable handling techniques. Finally, it was determined that there are factors that are considered as determinants of tomato quality such as characteristics; firmness, durability, uniformity and area of origin; however, in most retail markets this denomination is identified more with commercial aspects.</jats:p>"

The paper conducts a systematic review of various works of erudition on the subject, with the models being identified based on their application. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) and the 3-stage approach by Arksey and O’Malley.  The study design was chosen because it helps in the identification of articles through predefined criteria. Electronic searches were conducted via Web of Science and Scopus, with articles published between 1980 and 2022 being identified. The articles were then screened for relevance, applicability, validity, and reliability. The review identified at least five GAPS under the GAP model, which include knowledge, policy, delivery, communication, and consumer. Subsequently, the SERVQUAL model shows that the public drinking water supply systems fall below the set expectations of reliability, assurance, empathy, tangibles, and responsiveness. Contrarily, the government has set up programs like PROME and the Citizens’ Initiatives for General Water Law aimed at improving citizen participation and comprehension of key GAPS in the water supply system. The research is novel as it prods the subject of service quality models in Mexico.  This topic is an unexplored area, especially with regard to the GAP and SERVQUAL models.  The insight derived from this paper will bridge the existent dearth of knowledge while improving policy formulation and implementation.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the hydraulic performance of the Yeka Abado supply zone in Addis Ababa and suggest corrective measures to the problems obtained through the evaluation. A computer model was created in WaterGEMS to simulate the water distribution network. An intermittent scenario was created based on customer meter data to check the ability of the system to meet the current demand in the study area. Two scenarios were developed to evaluate the system's ability to satisfy the current and future demands in a continuous supply. The model analysis results indicated that pressure below the acceptance criteria at some junctions during peak hours, shortly after the supply, had resumed during intermittent operations. The performance remained satisfactory at other time steps. Furthermore, analysis in a continuous supply scenario for predicted future flows in 2044 indicated that the system is unable to meet the increasing demands in the study area, requiring system expansion works at some point. The results for a continuous supply model for 2021 indicated an excellent performance, with almost all the acceptance criteria being met.</jats:p>",

We then introduce a two‐part tariff contract to coordinate the supply chain for both periods. We suggest that optimal decisions in the second period depend on the reference point of the first period in the decentralized supply chain. A higher reference point leads to the increased environmental quality of products, prices, and profits of supply chain members in the second period. However, when the reference point is sufficiently high, the environmental quality will be lower to avoid excessive environmental investment costs. Furthermore, consumers' loss aversion reduces the environmental quality of products when the reference point is low. As consumers' loss aversion increases, the manufacturer's profit rises, while the wholesale and retail prices and the retailer's profit show a decreasing and then increasing trend. Finally, we find that a two‐part tariff contract enables the two‐period supply chain to be coordinated and achieve Pareto improvements in profit and environmental quality. This study sheds valuable light on understanding consumer environmental preferences and irrational behavior for supply chain decision‐making and green product design.</jats:p>",

We selected four companies and a comparative analysis of their ESG practices in the supply chain in terms of environmental and social perspectives. The analysis was based on the 2021 Sustainable Management Reports of the four selected companies, using the ‘K-ESG Guidelines’ criteria. The study findings revealed that sustainable environmental management activities and energy consumption analysis were common practices in the environmental dimension. In the social dimension, efforts to create social value, activities for mutual growth, developing safe work environments, and digital transformations were common practices. Although differences were observed based on industry characteristics, the fundamental direction of ESG practices in the supply chain was found to be similar. In addition, while ESG practices should be implemented without discrimination across industries, it is also necessary to improve the evaluation criteria according to the characteristics of industry type. The results of this study provide theoretical and practical implications that can shed important insights for the planning and implementation of ESG in supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, five research hypotheses are tested using samples from food manufacturers and other related supply chain partners. Covariance‐based structural equation modelling technique is used in this study, and necessary tests were done to ensure the high quality of findings. Buyer–supplier partnerships demonstrate both direct and indirect effects on the CE performance in FSC. The findings supported the serial mediation effect wherein buyer–supplier partnerships are found to exert their impact on the CE in FSC through commitment contracts and innovation performance in a successive way. The uniqueness of this study lies in the use of behavioural economics concepts to enhance CE performance. The study advances knowledge of commitment contracts by indicating whether and how it connects to CE performance results.</jats:p>",

The study found that the water quality varied significantly, depending on the geological conditions and water quantity, with the south portal of the tunnel dominated by Mg cations and bicarbonate anions. The water was found to be suitable for tunnel support systems, including concrete and steel installations, with negligible corrosion observed over the study period. However, the water coming out of the tunnel at the south portal was found to be unsuitable for drinking due to its low pH value. The Wilcox plot classified the water samples as excellent for irrigation, which could benefit local agriculture in the area.

For comprehensive insights into the effects of water supply suspension–restoration, this study characterized the variations of the pathogen community composition of the tap water and their infection risk under different water supply scenarios. Metagenomic sequencing revealed a significant change of the human pathogen profiles, among which the most dominant pathogen changed from <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic> (4.91%) to <jats:italic>Acinetobacter johnsonii</jats:italic> (0.59%). Furthermore, absolute quantification of pathogens by propidium-monoazide-qPCR revealed that the abundance of the three typical pathogens (<jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mycobacterium avium</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic> sp.) showed an increase of 2.44 log to 3.60 log immediately after water supply suspension–restoration and did not return to the normal level even after 2-h supply restoration, except for <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>. Quantitative microbial risk assessment suggested the infection risks of the three pathogens arising from direct utilization of tap water under stable water supply, including dermal exposure and oral intake, were all above the threshold of 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup>, and evidently increased after water supply suspension–restoration. This study warns us against the risk induced by the pathogens in tap water, especially after water supply suspension–restoration.</jats:p>"

Natural gas supply and consumption indicators forecasting is an important decision-making support for the government and energy companies, which has attracted considerable interest from researchers in recent years. In order to deal with the more complex features of the natural gas datasets in China, a Grey Wavelet Support Vector Regressor is proposed in this work. This model integrates the primary framework of the grey system model with the kernel representation employed in the support vector regression model. Through a series of mathematical transformations, the parameter optimization problem can be solved using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm. The Grey Wolf Optimizer is used to optimize its hyperparameters with the nested cross-validation scheme, and a complete computational algorithm is built. The case studies are conducted with real-world datasets from 2003–2020 in China using the proposed model and 15 other models. The results show that the proposed model presents a significantly higher performance in out-of-sample forecasting than all the other models, indicating the high potential of the proposed model in forecasting the natural gas supply and consumption in China.</jats:p>"

Regular cyanobacteria monitoring in water systems is crucial to prevent and manage health risks associated with toxin exposure. Surface water samples were collected from the Jundiai River in São Paulo State, Brazil for 3 years (2018–2022) to study the seasonal changes and species diversity of cyanobacteria. The study also aimed to understand the relationship between cyanobacteria abundance, climate, water quality, and hydrological parameters. Data analyses revealed a pattern of significantly elevated cyanobacterial cell counts during the dry season (DS), accompanied by an increase in the cyanobacterial species. The identified species poses a threat to water safety owing to the potential production of toxins, as well as causing unpleasant taste and odor. The DS is marked by higher nutrient concentrations and lower water flow. Phosphorus levels remain high, allowing cyanobacteria to grow without being limited by nutrients. In future scenarios, the primary concern for the Jundiai River is not temperature rise but droughts that create a stable environment for cyanobacteria proliferation. This research provides valuable data for river water users and contributes to a broader understanding of the global cyanobacterial dispersion.</jats:p>",

A topology in which a closed‐loop charge pump biases the gate of two‐stage cascode NMOS pass transistors is proposed to increase immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) capability for automotive applications. Furthermore, a power‐down protection circuit is proposed to maintain the reliability of the system, and a novel implementation of the charge pump unit is presented to improve the influence of the body effect. Detailed derivation regarding the analyses of the simplified small‐signal model of the closed‐loop charge pump, the loop stability, and the PSR at various frequency bands is given. Simulation and measurement results show that the proposed LDO can operate with the input voltage from 5 to 40 V, providing up to 60 mA current drive capability, and its minimum operating voltage is 2.5 V with a 10 mA load capacity. Moreover, results verify that measured PSR is better than −45 dB at 1.5 kHz, and measured PSR is better than −30 dB at 15 MHz. The results confirm that the obtained parameters of line and load regulations are significantly improved to 1.86 mV/V and 1.75 mV/mA, respectively.</jats:p>",

This may induce additional financial stress on the latter, specifically if it is a small company with lack of budget to begin with. In this study we analyze whether direct finance within a supply chain, where the user lends money to the servitizing provider, can alleviate this problem, when compared with a more traditional bank finance option. We find that improved access to finance indeed enables the servitizing provider to induce high effort by the user through lower servitizing fees. This also makes the servitizing model economically more attractive for both firms involved. Besides those economic implications, direct finance increases consumer demand and surplus, while at the same time resource consumption for satisfying this increased demand increases.</jats:p>",

The data and reports of government agencies, scientific journals, and websites were analysed in order to determine the prevailing situation in goat production and marketing. Goats are mainly raised on small-scale farms (73.4% of the total goat population). Goat production is transforming from extensive grazing to cut-and-carry intensive systems. Goat meat and milk supplies have not fully met domestic demand. However, the scale of the domestic market is difficult to ascertain, due to the lack of market research and statistics. Goat marketing is mostly informal and overwhelmingly conducted by small-scale producers and traders, although there are numerous governmental agencies at both the national and local levels regulating formal marketing. The major challenges facing the goat industry are feed shortage; supply inconsistency; limited market infrastructure and research; a lack of sustainable breeding programmes, price incentives, and processing facilities; and competition from foreign suppliers. However, there are opportunities to expand and develop the industry, such as consumers’ health consciousness, increasing demand, high-value adding, and strong government support.</jats:p>"

Numerous methods, including chemical precipitation and ion exchange, have been used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions, but all of them have drawbacks, such as low metal removal effectiveness, significant reagent loss, excessive energy use, and the need for further development of the current techniques. Membrane-based technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are gaining popularity in the removal of heavy metals due to their high rejection and low formation of secondary pollutants. Among the methods under consideration, the membrane-based approach holds the most promise for wastewater treatment with a focus on heavy metal ion removal due to its ease of manufacture, superior qualities, and increased separation effectiveness. Since membrane performance is typically hampered by fouling, low permeability, and significant contaminant permeation when compared to strict selectivity criteria, the development of novel membrane materials has emerged as an important area of research for academia, industry, and national laboratories. We have therefore reviewed previous initiatives and technological developments in order to achieve more effective heavy metal removal and recovery from industrial wastewater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Promoting sustainable production and consumption practices in the construction machinery industry is crucial for achieving energy savings and reducing carbon emissions. However, there is a lack of targeted studies addressing the challenge of scaling up leasing and recycling while maximizing economic benefits for enterprises. To fill this gap, this paper presents a lease-oriented closed-loop supply chain model that incorporates a carbon tax policy to investigate the impact of the carbon tax rate and consumer preferences for remanufactured products on the supply chain and introduces a leasing compensation–cost apportioning combined contract to achieve supply chain coordination in the construction machinery sector. The model considers differential selling and leasing prices for new and remanufactured products, as well as the recovery rate, under both centralized and decentralized decision-making approaches. The study explores the interrelationships between various parameters through sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation. The results demonstrate that within a certain range of the cost apportioning proportional coefficient and leasing compensation proportional coefficient, the combined contract can lead the supply chain to achieve Pareto optimality. As the carbon tax rate increases, it was observed that the profits for all parties in the supply chain tend to decrease. However, due to the increased demand for remanufactured products, the product recovery rate improves, resulting in a reduction in total carbon emissions in the closed-loop supply chain of construction machinery. Moreover, the profits of all parties and the total supply chain profits initially decrease and then increase with an increasing preference coefficient for remanufactured products among consumers. By leveraging these factors and adopting effective strategies, such as enhancing consumer recognition of remanufactured products and optimizing pricing and cost allocation, it is indeed possible for the profits of all parties and the total profits in the supply chain to surpass the initial values, even in the face of increasing carbon tax rates. This demonstrates the potential for aligning sustainability objectives with economic benefits in the construction machinery industry.</jats:p>"

We argue that Patagonia's relational and discursive work are crucial to understanding how Patagonia (a) pursues sustainable supply chain practices, (b) influences its stakeholders to support sustainability, and (c) has positive spillover effects beyond its primary stakeholders. Incorporating a social‐symbolic work lens draws attention to important theoretical and managerial insights—in particular, the need for a holistic rather than reductionist approach and the merit in creating self‐reinforcing positive feedback loops—which are prone to be overlooked in conventional studies of sustainable supply chain management.</jats:p>",

This paper explores the karst water flow system from a hydrogeochemical perspective. It has been discovered that in the recharge area, the hydrochemical effect of karst water is primarily influenced by dissolution and filtration. In the fault zone and concentrated discharge area, it is primarily influenced by mixing. In the geothermal area, the dominant factors are dissolution, precipitation, and dolomitization. From the southern to the northern area, the hydrochemical type of karst water gradually changes from HCO3-Ca type to SO4·Cl-Ca·Na type. Atmospheric precipitation is the primary recharge source of karst water, with a recharge elevation range of 181–1,495 m. According to geological drilling statistics, the groundwater transport depth transits from the shallow transport in the south to the deep transport in the north, with a depth range of 3,000–3,500 m, and using isotope data to obtain the groundwater retention time range is 6–27,000 years. The groundwater transport mode is divided into three levels: open-shallow transport karst cold water phreatic flow, semi-open-medium-deep transport karst cold water confined flow, and weak open-deep transport geothermal water confined water flow.</jats:p>",

We use a large watershed area as a case to map and analyze ES supply, demand and the coordination relationship, and identify the associated socio-ecological driving variables. This study assessed the supply and demand of five ESs (crop production, water retention, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and outdoor recreation) in 2000 and 2020, and evaluated the coordination between them employing the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM). Additionally, we utilized the geo-detector model (GDM) to identify driving determinants and their interactive effects on the spatial pattern of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between ES supply and demand. The results showed that mountainous regions with abundant forest coverage were high-value areas for ES supply, while the ESs were predominantly required in city center areas within each basin area. From 2000 to 2020, there was a slight decline in ES supply and a significant increase in ES demand. Counties were grouped into four coordination zones in the study area: extreme incoordination, moderate incoordination, reluctant coordination, and moderate coordination. The number of counties with extreme incoordination linked to regions with a mountain ecosystem is increasing, where the ES supply is much greater than the demand. The moderate incoordination counties dominated by a cropland ecosystem exhibited slightly higher levels of ES supply than demand. The moderate and reluctant coordination were linked to counties with distinct ecological characteristics. Construction land played a major role in the characteristics of the CCD, followed by grassland. The interaction between construction land and all other factors significantly increased the influence on the CCD. These findings offered valuable insights for land managers to identify areas characterized by incoordination between ES supply and demand and understand associated factors to develop optimal ES management strategies.</jats:p>"

However, fuel consumption and refueling behavior are not well discussed in disaster scenarios compared with the extant literature on these topics during normal conditions. This study used an emerging data source to report when fuel demand (indicated by gas station visits) deviated from a normal variation range during Hurricane Ida (a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane in 2021), how long the deviation lasted, and which area(s) experienced greater deviations. Gas station visits are likely to surge within 2 days before storm landfall, while evacuation destinations and intermediate trip connectors had longer surges. Using univariate linear regression, this study also statistically explored what factors might affect the fuel demand deviation at an aggregate level. The testing results revealed that zones of higher vehicle ownership, more daily commuters driving alone, lower residential stability, more mobile homes, and less storm impacts tended to have more gas station visits (i.e., greater fuel demand). Then, this study analyzed data at a more disaggregate level to identify the characteristics of gas stations that are more likely to have more visitors. Gas stations near interstates/highways attracted more visits, especially within 2 days before storm landfall. Gas stations farther away from interstates/highways attracted more visits after storm landfall. Overall, this study contributes to our knowledge about fuel consumption and refueling location preferences during hurricanes. These findings could help public agencies and private companies in their fuel supply planning (e.g., fuel distribution) and response (e.g., providing power generators to focal locations). </jats:p>",

We adapt the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to study this empirically, with case studies from India, Spain and the United States that centre around a large reservoir and its reoperation. Results show the importance of financing power in all cases, and also suggest that cities may lack the positional power needed to implement drinking water priorities. The ‘hybrid equity approach’ reveals the diversity of equity considerations on rural-to-urban water reallocation, both in terms of local perspectives and also regarding universal equity principles.

This study explored the chemistry of groundwater in Qixing Town and the influencing factors. Statistical evaluation, ion correlation, Entropy-Weighted Water Quality Index (EWQI) assessment, and human health risk evaluation were conducted on data derived from 25 groundwater samples. The main groundwater chemistry types were HCO3–Na and HCO3–Ca. The results of ion and geological modeling analysis indicated that major ion concentrations were mainly determined by cation exchange. The study on the variation of heavy metal concentration in groundwater with depth shows that the heavy metal content in groundwater decreases first and then increases with the increase of depth, and the EWQI suggested that groundwater was suitable for drinking. The total carcinogenic health risks for Cr and As for both adults and children were higher than the highest permissible hazard value suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The categorization of hazardous ingestion (HI) by the USEPA indicated a negligible non-carcinogenic hazard to human health by toxic metals. The results suggest the need to increase Cr and As contamination monitoring in shallow groundwater. This study can facilitate the rational development of groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Knowledge payment is an emerging business mode that has developed in the era of social media. With the impact of Internet technology, the knowledge payment market is rapidly expanding, especially in China. However, piracy leads to more intense competition and affects the profits of knowledge providers and knowledge payment platforms. Government policies combined with the anti-piracy measures of these platforms have become effective methods to combat piracy. This paper investigates the impact of government subsidies and anti-piracy efforts on a knowledge provider’s and platform’s optimal decisions. We develop a two-stage knowledge payment product supply chain with a knowledge provider and a knowledge payment platform. The platform in the leader position of the supply chain has anti-piracy efforts and the government subsidizes the platform. Stackelberg game models are constructed and compared to examine the equilibrium solution in relation to three modes (no government subsidies and no anti-piracy efforts; only anti-piracy efforts; and both government subsidies and anti-piracy efforts). Our analysis shows that (1) both government subsidies and anti-piracy efforts increase the quality level and unit quality signing bonus of the knowledge payment product. Meanwhile, the product’s retail price increases with anti-piracy efforts but decreases within a certain subsidy range. (2) The knowledge provider’s profit always increases with the anti-piracy effort level, while the platform’s profit is an inverted U-shaped relationship with the anti-piracy effort level. (3) Government subsidy behavior can always increase a knowledge provider’s profit but may not necessarily increase the platform’s profit. Moreover, there exists a certain threshold: when subsidies are lower (higher) than this threshold, it is more beneficial to the knowledge provider (platform). In addition, we also find that the method of high subsidies combined with a low anti-piracy effort level benefits both parties and that the subsidized party will be more sensitive. The results will provide knowledge providers and platforms with new market management insights from the perspective of government subsidies and anti-piracy efforts and guide them to make optimal decisions.</jats:p>"

The IWS consumers commonly adapt to flexible consumption behaviors characterized by storing the limited water available during shorter supply periods in intermediate storage facilities for subsequent usage during more extended nonsupply periods. Nevertheless, the impacts of such consumer behavior on the performance of IWS systems have not been adequately addressed. Toward this direction, this article presents a novel open-source Python-based simulation tool (EPyT-IWS) for WDS, virtually acting like an IWS modeling extension of EPANET 2.2. The applicability of EPyT-IWS was demonstrated by conducting hydraulic simulations of a typical WDS with representative IWS attributes. Different IWS operation cases were considered by varying the amount and consistency of the water availability to the consumers. EPyT-IWS outputs showed that domestic storage of water within underground tanks and subsequent pumping into overhead tanks allows consumers to cope with the intermittent water availability and suitably meet their demands. Besides the interval, the clock time of the water supply was predicted to influence IWS consumers’ ability to meet water demands.</jats:p>",

The present study goal was to assess the drinking water quality from source to household tap water. To characterize and analyze drinking water quality parameters, 21 water samples were collected, of which 11 water samples were collected from sources (spring, borehole, and river), 4 from service reservoirs, and 6 from tap water. The mean values of the parameters were as follows: total dissolved solids (TDS) (142.79 mg/L), temperature (22.08°C), turbidity (9.49 NTU), electrical conductivity (EC) (250.14°μS/cm), pH (7.45 mg/L), fluoride (1.15 mg/L), nitrate (NO3−) (2.91 mg/L), total hardness (TH) (57.45 mg/L), calcium (41.7 6 mg/l), magnesium (10.74 mg/L), phosphate (0.44 mg/L), sulfate (3.99 mg/L), residual chlorine (1.53 mg/L), alkalinity (196.39 mg/L), and microbiological (total coliform and coliform/CFU) which were the main physiochemical parameters analyzed for the study. The findings revealed that the majority of the water quality parameters tested were within the WHO and National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). However, some of the parameters such as temperature, turbidity, fluoride, and residual chlorine did not meet the standards. The mean temperatures at the source, reservoir, and tap water were 22.01°C 22.5°C,and 21.83°C, respectively. Turbidity levels in source samples ranged from 10 to 45 NTU, with a mean of 24.5 NTU, exceeding the WHO’s recommendation of less than 5 NTU. The Boko Alamura well had a high fluoride content (3.9 mg/l), which was above the WHO and NDWQS permissible limits. There was no free residual chlorine in the tap water sample. The results show that the Hawassa drinking water supply did not contain total or fecal coliform in any of the samples tested. The overall WQI for the water source, reservoir, and tap water was also determined to be 89, 71, and 69.7 points, respectively. Therefore, based on the WQI result, Hawassa drinking water quality is good for the source, reservoir, and tap water.</jats:p>",

As a result of the analysis, the variables that affect the successful bid price rate are identified as housing construction permit records, the real estate sentiment index, the current status of unsold homes, and interest rates. Specifically, in the case of housing construction permits, it initially has a negative(-) effect on the successful bid price rate, and then shows a positive(+) effect after a 3-month lag. The real estate sentiment index initially has a negative(-) effect on the successful bid price rate, and then has a positive(+) effect. As a result of the impact response function analysis, the influence is the largest in the negative(-) direction in the second period, the influence is in the opposite direction from the third period, and the influence converges to zero after the ninth period. In the case of unsold housing, it has a negative(-) effect on the successful bid price rate. As the number of unsold pre-sale houses increased, the successful bid price rate decreases, and the risk of land sale increases. Lastly, in the case of interest rates, it has a negative(-) effect on the successful bid price rate. What is unusual is that the effect of the loan interest rate on the successful bid price rate is greatest in the 5th period, and the direction is consistently confirmed as a negative(-) effect. It is interpreted that the impact of interest rates on the sale risk of land is consistently large.</jats:p>",

WDN optimization focuses on the nonlinearity of the discharge head loss equation, the availability of discrete properties of pipe sizes, and the conservation of constraints. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed and successfully applied in the field of WDN design optimization. Previous studies have focused on comparing the optimization effects of algorithms in water distribution networks, ignoring the problems of unbalanced pressure distribution and water hammer at the nodes of the pipe network caused by the complex terrain in mountainous areas. In this paper, a multi-objective water supply optimization model that integrated cost, reliability, and water quality was established for a mountainous WDN in real engineering. The method of traversing the nodes to solve the water age was introduced to find a more scientific and practical water age solution model, with setting the weight function to evaluate the water age of the water supply model comprehensively. Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) were adopted to optimize the WDN design model in the mountainous complex terrain. The significance levels of the number of Pareto solutions (NOPS) and running time are 0.029 and 0.001, respectively, indicating that the two algorithms have significant differences. Compared to NSGA-II, SPEA-II has a better convergence rate and running time in multi-objective water supply optimization design. The solution set distribution of SPEA-II is more concentrated than that of NSGA-II, also the numerical value is better. The number of SPEA-II optimization schemes is larger and the scheme is more effective. Among them, the Pareto solution set of SPEA-II can obtain more desirable optimization results on cost, reliability index (RI) and water age. In summary, the study provides valuable information for decision makers in WDN with complex terrain.</jats:p>"

Stakeholders (for instance, community stakeholders) have been observed to be unaware of the focal firm's circular supply chain activities. Because this gap has not been generally reflected in the literature, it is critical to perform an empirical study to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The goal of this research was to determine whether new technologies such as big data and predictive analytics might influence an organization's propensity to share information related to circular economy practices with stakeholders as well as to increase connectivity with those stakeholders in the Industry 4.0 era. We also investigated whether these actions could increase stakeholder trust and engagement and social sustainability as a result. We tested our theoretical model using samples from food supply chain firms in South Africa. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using WarpPLS 7.0 software. The findings show that firms that deploy big data and predictive analytics are more likely to share information related to the circular economy with stakeholders and that these firms are also well‐connected with those stakeholders, resulting in increased trust and engagement. This, in turn, contributes to the social sustainability of supply chains. Our research has made a significant contribution by encouraging a theoretical debate regarding the willingness to share information regarding the circular economy and the social sustainability of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Using data from Germany in spring 2021, we investigate how individuals’ vaccination status related to feelings of (1) being excluded by others (interpersonal level) and (2) being excluded by the government (societal level) at a time when vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals had different rights. We find that being unvaccinated is associated with feeling excluded by others and by the government and that individuals generally report higher levels of exclusion by the government than by other people.

However, with the increasing prominence of privacy protection and information security issues, traditional data sharing solutions are no longer able to meet the requirements for highly reliable secure storage and flexible access control. In response to this demand, we propose a secure data storage and access control scheme for the supply chain ecosystem based on the enterprise-level blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric. The design incorporates a dual-layer attribute-based auditable access control model for access control, with four smart contracts aimed at coordinating and implementing access policies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits significant advantages under large-scale data and multi-attribute conditions. It enables fine-grained, dynamic access control under ciphertext and maintains high throughput and security in simulated real-world operational scenarios.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the joint optimization problem of facility locations and inventory for assembly manufacturing enterprises’ multi-echelon supply chain networks, considering the locations of facilities, the selection of suppliers, transport mode choices, and inventory decisions simultaneously. A corresponding integrated optimization model is proposed, which aims to minimize the total cost, consisting of the fixed open cost of facilities, the inventory cost of the open plants and distribution centers, and the transportation cost of vehicles in the entire supply chain network as well as the cost of CO2 emissions. Based on the characteristics of the proposed optimization model, a hybrid genetic algorithm embedded with a local search is developed to solve the proposed model. Numerical examples and a case study are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the corresponding algorithm. The findings show that the model is reasonable and applicable, and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is more efficient than the standard genetic algorithm (SGA). In addition, plants’ maximum lead-time has a significant impact on the total cost of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The present study aimed to assess the ecological and human health risks associated with the contamination of cyanotoxins and heavy metals in a drinking water supply reservoir, the Tri An Reservoir (TAR), in Vietnam. Results demonstrated that the concentrations of individual heavy metals varied in the following order: iron (Fe) &amp;gt; lead (Pb) &amp;gt; arsenic (As) &amp;gt; zinc (Zn). Although the ecological potential risk of heavy metals was low during the study period, the concentration of Fe sometimes exceeded the Vietnamese standard for drinking water. Toxic cyanobacteria and microcystins (MCs) frequently occurred in the TAR with the highest density of 198.7 × 103 cells/mL and 7.8 μg/L, respectively, indicating a high risk of health impacts to humans. The results of the study indicate that exposure to heavy metals does not pose any non-carcinogenic health risks for both adults and children. However, the contamination of MCs in the surface water posed a serious disease enhancement to both adults and children through direct ingestion and dermal absorption.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the closed-loop supply chain system of component remanufacturing, new parts suppliers are likely to be affected by certain factors that lead to sudden increases in supply prices, and this sudden increase in new parts prices may trigger the chain collapse of the closed-loop supply chain system and impact the stability of the closed-loop supply chain. Therefore, this paper combines closed-loop supply chain theory, evolutionary game theory, and system dynamics theory, which are internalized to construct a complex system model. Furthermore, the impact of different price increases of new parts on the stability of the closed-loop supply chain is analyzed through scenario simulation. The results show that a 25% increase in the price of new parts will delay the time for remanufacturers and retailers to reach a stable state of product flow, reduce the profitability of remanufacturers and retailers, and inhibit the willingness of remanufacturers to carry out high-green production in the early stage. A 50% increase in the price of new parts can break the closed-loop supply chain from the remanufacturer, severely undermining the stability of the closed-loop supply. According to the simulation results, this paper presents a timely government dynamic reward and punishment optimization scheme for remanufacturers to improve the tolerance level of the closed-loop supply chain for the price increase of new parts and to provide a reference for enhancing the stability of the closed-loop supply chain and optimizing the government supervision strategy.</jats:p>"

Solar heating has received a lot of attention due to its reduction of environmental pollution and ensuring future energy security. Moreover, it is cost-effective in the long run. Given the importance of the above, there is a lack of a comprehensive review of the potential for heat supply at the residential scale in different US states. In addition, finding the most suitable place to use SWHs has not been studied so far. Therefore, in the present work, for the first time, the energy-environmental assessment of 50 US state centers during a one-year period has been done using TSOL commercial software. Furthermore, using step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) computational methods, the weighting of criteria and ranking of studied stations were performed, respectively. The results indicated that of the eight parameters studied, the parameters “total solar fraction” and “solar contribution to domestic hot water” have the highest and lowest final normalized weight, respectively. Moreover, the WASPAS method using the decision matrix showed that Phoenix, Santa Fe, and Tallahassee stations are the top 3 stations in terms of using SWHs, respectively, and Juneau, Olympia, and Montpelier stations are three inappropriate stations in this regard, respectively. The VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR), intelligent transportation system deployment analysis system (IDAS), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods also validated the results of the present work, which were completely consistent.

Ecological replenishment is one important measure to enhance water quality in reservoirs. To address the severe pollution and ecological degradation problems of the Luhun Reservoir, this paper uses MIKE21 software to construct a coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model. Six recharge scenarios were designed to compare and explore the enhancement of reservoir water quality for these scenarios. The water quality status of these options was evaluated using the single-factor index method and the combined pollution index method. The results show that due to the ecological replenishment, the pollutant concentration leads the phenomenon of gradient diffusion to the center of the reservoir, and the average improvement rate of water quality is up to 40.22%. Schemes 2 and 5 have the lowest integrated pollution index. The most significant improvement in water quality was achieved at the same total recharge conditions, using 0.5 times the flow rate and two times the recharge time of the actual recharge project. The study results provide theoretical and technical support for the future management of the reservoir water environment.</jats:p>",

The framework uses spatiotemporal information from monitoring pressure and unsupervised learning model. This approach employs three stages: (1) benchmark dataset acquisition, (2) spatiotemporal information analysis, and (3) burst detection model construction. First, the benchmark datasets were the normal dataset initially obtained by the clustering algorithm. Second, spatiotemporal information features are extracted from multimoment time windows from multiple sensors, including the distance and shape features. Third, burst detection was performed based on the isolation forest technique. A WDN is used to evaluate the performance of the method. Results show that the method can effectively detect the burst.</jats:p>",

However, there are surprisingly few within-species tests of whether metabolic rate and gill area scale similarly. We examined the relationship between oxygen supply (gill area) and demand (metabolic rate) by making paired estimates of gill area with resting and maximum metabolic rates across ontogeny in the relatively inactive California horn shark, Heterodontus francisci. We found that the allometric slope of resting metabolic rate was 0.966±0.058 (±95% CI), whereas that of maximum metabolic rate was somewhat steeper (1.073±0.040). We also discovered that the scaling of gill area shifted with ontogeny: the allometric slope of gill area was shallower in individuals &amp;lt;0.203 kg in body mass (0.564±0.261), but increased to 1.012±0.113 later in life. This appears to reflect changes in demand for gill-oxygen uptake during egg case development and immediately post hatch, whereas for most of ontogeny, gill area scales in between that of resting and maximum metabolic rate. These relationships differ from predictions of the gill oxygen limitation theory, which argues that the allometric scaling of gill area constrains metabolic processes. Thus, for the California horn shark, metabolic rate does not appear limited by theoretical surface-area-to-volume ratio constraints of gill area. These results highlight the importance of data from paired and size-matched individuals when comparing physiological scaling relationships.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the analysis focuses on the dramatic abandonment of coca cultivation and its replacement by alternative crops such as cocoa. Emphasis is placed on the centrality of agents’ normative coherence and coordination. For over 50 years, the civic–market compromise has framed agents’ discourses and actions, although it has sometimes been ostensibly distorted. This framing effect has also occurred in circumstances with considerable recourse to violence and armed conflict. Thus, this article focuses not only on justification processes but also on what happens ‘after justification’ and on how violent situations can coexist with discursive constructions with a relevant normative element. </jats:p>",

Water shortage is a key factor that restricts the high-quality development of cities, while the coordinated and optimized allocation of urban raw water is an important measure to alleviate the water supply–demand imbalance. The current research on urban water supply issues and their underlying causes still needs to be further strengthened. Similarly, the formulation of rules for multi-source and cross-district water supply should pay more attention. This paper proposes a general analytical process consisting of four main stages: problem identification, system generalization, rule formulation, and model construction and solution for the joint optimal scheduling of raw water in a complex urban water supply system. This study investigates the significant water resource wastage and structural water shortage in the reservoirs of Lanxi City. The optimal scheduling plan is proposed by formulating rational rules for inter-district water supply and establishing a multi-source and multi-objective joint optimization scheduling model. Compared to the current independent scheduling scheme and multi-water source joint dispatching scheme based on the current dispatch diagram, the optimal scheduling plan effectively reduced the cumulative water shortage by 68.04 million m3 and 29.72 million m3, respectively, and increased the urban water supply guarantee rate in all districts of the city to over 90%. This study offers valuable insights to urban water resource managers, empowering them to develop optimal multiple water source supply rules that align to the specific characteristics of other case studies.</jats:p>"

However, current research on RECC lacks consideration of the supply-side industrial structures and factors, and the relationship between RECC and supply-side reform remains unrevealed. In order to measure the RECC in China at the provincial level from 2005 to 2019, this study constructs an evaluation index based on industrial structure. It utilizes the TOPSIS model coupled with the supply-demand balance method and environmental capacity method while gathering and summarizing the indicators related to natural resource support, socio-economic support, and environmental factor accommodation. The analysis of evolutionary characteristics and spatial heterogeneity is carried out by statistical and spatial econometric methods, and the impact of the supply-side reform policy on RECC is examined using a bidirectional fixed-effect model. The findings indicate the following: (1) China’s RECC demonstrates a clear upward trend, with higher values in the west and lower values in the east. The average annual growth rate from 2016 to 2019 (18.12%) is nearly three times that of the period from 2005 to 2010 (6.28%), indicating a significant acceleration in the increase in RECC post-supply-side reform. (2) The spatial agglomeration of RECC and its sub-system support is observed, as the allocation of nature resources and markets promotes the convergence of regional differences and enhances the spatial convergence of the RECC. (3) The implementation of supply-side reform policies has a positive impact on RECC, with industrial upgrading playing a particularly significant role. This study provides a new idea and method for the selection of evaluation indicators, quantitatively assessing province-level RECC and understanding the potential effects of national supply-side policies on RECC.</jats:p>"

This study evaluated the effect of 10 years of rice straw return on rice yield, soil P budget, P fractions, and phosphatase activity to establish the relationship between soil P fractions and related microbial communities. Four treatments, i.e., no rice straw return (S0), low amount of rice straw return (S1), high amount of rice straw return (S2), and abandoned farmland (AL), were used in the evaluation. The results showed that rice straw return had no effect on the rice yield and P uptake, and the P budget was positive in the S2 treatment. Rice straw return increased the phosphatase activity and content of soil Olsen-P, total P, NaHCO3-, and NaOH-extractable P, and the phosphatase activity and P fractions were both increased with the amount of straw returned. There was a positive correlation between most soil P fractions and active organic carbon fractions. Rice straw return changed the composition and abundance of soil phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB). The findings showed that straw return decreased the proportion of soil nonlabile P, enhancing the soil P supply capacity, and they further showed that the abundance of PSB was not consistent with soil P content.</jats:p>"

This paper analyses the food security strategies of Qatar (one of the six countries that make up the GCC), especially since 2017 when the blockade of the country by its neighbors began. Qatar’s current food sufficiency was made possible by the country’s swift and profound changes in its food production strategies to ensure food security for its population. In order to provide locally sourced foods to the population, private and public initiatives were activated to support small farmers to distribute and supply their farm produce to local markets. The results show that Qatar has shifted from importing some food commodities to locally producing a high proportion of its foods to the extent of becoming an exporter of some farm produce. However, this increase in the local food production was achieved at the cost of depleting the local groundwater at a rate higher than the natural recharge. This paper thus critically assesses the specific situation of food security in Qatar that could be used as an example for other countries aiming to strengthen their food security, especially during transnational crises when international food supply chains suffer from unavoidable disruption (e.g., COVID-19 crisis).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The price of pork, as an important livelihood indicator in China, and its price fluctuations have a significant impact on the lives of residents and social stability. Therefore, it is vital to study the main factors that affect pork price fluctuations and implement targeted regulatory measures in a timely manner. In the context of the increasing number of pig epidemics and increased pork imports, it is necessary to consider the impact of pig epidemics and imported pork on pork price fluctuations, which can more accurately reflect actual pork price fluctuations in China. In this paper, a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model was applied to analyze the main factors affecting pork price fluctuations from the aspects of the pork price, supply and demand changes, and pig epidemic shocks. The results indicated that the impact of the pork price on pork price fluctuations was the largest, with the largest contribution rate, whereas the current month’s pork price had a 29.60% impact on the pork price 18 months later. The supply factor that affected the pork price was the pig herd, with the current month’s pig herd having a 34.85% impact on the pork price after 18 months. Imported pork had a relatively small structural impact on pork price fluctuations, with a positive impact in the first four months and a subsequent negative impact. However, pig epidemics mainly caused pork price fluctuations by changing the market relation between demand and supply, with the current month’s epidemic depth index having a 9.78% impact on the pork price 18 months later. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended to focus on the monitoring and early warning of the pork price by analyzing big data, promoting large-scale farming, and strengthening the implementation of early prevention and control measures during disease outbreaks to stabilize pig herd and achieve a stable pork market supply and price.</jats:p>"

An Online survey was conducted among pediatric dentists. The questionnaire was subdivided into ‘general characteristics’, ‘number of dental treatments and working days per year’, ‘proportion of covered services’, ‘perceptions of supply and demand of pediatric dentists’. Through the Korean Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Services, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), and the Korean Statistical Information Service, the current state of pediatric dentists, the number of claims for covered services, and the decrease in births per year were investigated. Dental clinics claiming to be pediatric dentistry reached half of all medical institutions, but only 3.78% of pediatric dentists actually worked. 61.36% of all pediatric dentists were concentrated in the metropolitan area, showing a national imbalance. Although the population of children and adolescents have continuously decreased over the past 20 years, the number of NHIS-covered services has shown a continuous increase. Over the past 10 years, the optimal supply of pediatric dentists has been maintained at around 4,000. According to the analysis, 92.15% of pediatric dentists thought that it was necessary to prepare policies and support measures at the government level. This study is expected to be used as basic data for establishing a demand estimation method for pediatric dentistry specialists in the future.</jats:p>",

Based on data from 2000 to 2019 on five critical metals in China (copper, aluminum, nickel, antimony, and titanium), this study employs a series of econometric methods, such as fixed-effects regression and moderating effects, to examine the influence of green eco-innovation on primary and recycling supply of critical metals, as well as the underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate: (1) Green eco-innovation has an inverted U-shaped impact on the primary supply of bulk critical metals, and it is currently in the declining phase of the curve. (2) Green eco-innovation has a U-shaped impact on the recycling supply of critical metals and the primary supply of minor critical metals. The former is currently in the rising phase of the curve, while the latter is in the declining phase. (3) The impact of green eco-innovation on the supply of critical metals is stronger in industrially underdeveloped regions. (4) The improvement of energy efficiency, optimization of energy structure, and strengthening of environmental regulations enhance the impact of green eco-innovation on the supply of critical metals. Finally, the optimization of the energy mix is conducive to securing the supply of key metals. This study provides a theoretical basis for utilizing green eco-innovation to achieve a green supply of critical metals and enriches the theoretical research on green eco-innovation.</jats:p>"

The particular role played in this process is assigned to heat supply systems whose reliable and uninterrupted operation is fraught with various problems. The main ones are related to increased costs for the purchase of organic fuel and its delivery to remote areas. This circumstance leads to the fact that the prime cost of thermal energy is higher than the rates level, resulting in unprofitable activity of heat generating facilities, so their continued existence becomes impossible without government subsidies. Under these conditions one of the ways to save imported organic fuel and therefore reduce the prime cost of thermal energy can be the utilization of wind power plants (WPPs) in conjunction with boiler houses for heat supply in remote areas with increased wind potential. <jats:bold>THE PURPOSE. </jats:bold>It should be shown on the example of the Murmansk region that the utilization of WPPs in conjunction with boiler houses for heat supply in remote areas is a good decision to reduce the prime cost of thermal energy. <jats:bold>METHODS. </jats:bold>The comparison of the prime cost of thermal energy in a case of heat supply only from boiler houses with the one when utilizing WPPs in conjunction with boiler houses for heat supply. <jats:bold>RESULTS. </jats:bold>It is shown that the utilization of WPPs in conjunction with boiler houses with a capacity of more than 0.1 Gcal/h for heat supply in remote areas of the Murmansk region saves 60-90% of organic fuel worth 25,000-72,000 rubles/tce at boiler houses and thereby reduces the prime cost of thermal energy by 10-60%. An effect of the utilization of WPPs is reduced for boiler houses of lower capacity, with the lower the boiler house capacity, the more the utilization of WPP being economically impractical compared to a case of heat supply only from a boiler house. <jats:bold>CONCLUSION. </jats:bold>The results obtained allow us to assess the prospects of the utilization of WPPs in conjunction with boiler houses for heat supply in remote areas of AZRF in terms of the effectiveness of such utilization.</jats:italic></jats:p>"

However, remanufacturing practice can be subject to deficient consumer perception, production capacity constraint, uncertain demand and government intervention. This paper considers outsourced remanufacturing mode to establish and investigate a remanufacturing supply chain (RSC) network consisting of multiple manufacturers, retailers and remanufacturers. Optimality conditions with RSC network members are derived utilizing variation inequality. Numerical examples based on data accumulated from a remanufacturing enterprise and questionnaire survey on consumer perception for remanufactured products, are presented to put the proposed model into practice. Influences of product heterogeneity (new and remanufactured products), consumer preference, production capacity constraint, product price competitiveness, market demand fluctuation, and government financial measures on RSC network production and pricing strategies are investigated through numerical analyses. Analytical results indicate that pricing for the remanufactured product would be equivalent to that of the new product when consumers value the remanufactured product at a relatively high level, however an excessive penchant for the remanufactured product is less profitable especially from the perspective of the remanufacturer. In general, an upper-middle level of consumer preference for the remanufactured product is the most favourable scenario. When remanufacturing industry is just emerging, a high tax will be imposed on the manufacturer to accumulate remanufacturing subsidy for the government to achieve its balanced budget. As the remanufacturing industry develops and consumer environmental awareness enhances, it is especially essential for the government to establish a levy-subsidy mechanism to maintain sustainable progress of the industry. Combining main conclusions with the background of Chinese remanufacturing industry, managerial implications are provided from respective perspectives of enterprises’ remanufacturing operation, government financial regulation, and consumer awareness enhancement. The analyses and results are especially relevant as a reference for remanufacturing decision-makings as well as government financial regulations, thus enhancing production sustainability as well as environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

Two varieties, three N rates (120 [N1], 240 [N2], and 360 [N3] kg hm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) and two light intensities (100 and 70% light transmission) from 10 to 35 days after the end of flowering were set as experimental parameters. Shading decreased the pod wall chlorophyll content, ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity and glucose content at 25 and 35 days after flowering (DAF). Decreased sucrose synthase (SuSy) and sucrose phosphate synthase activity caused by shading reduced sucrose and fructose content. They are responsible for the decline in the 1000‐seed weight and a 22.1–37.6% decline in seed yield. More N under shading promoted pod elongation and pigment content, improved chloroplast ultrastructure, increased Rubisco and SuSy activity at 35 DAF, thus contributing to pod wall photosynthesis and fructose and glucose levels in shaded rapeseed plants. Similar trends were observed in pod number, pod weight, and seed weight, while the greatest increase in seed/wall ratio was observed under N2 for shaded rapeseed plants. The results indicated that N can reduce the yield difference between different light conditions and balance partitioning and conversion of photoassimilates in pod wall, but avoid applying an excessive amount of nitrogen.</jats:p>",

High ImmunoScore (IS) (positive cells/mm2 for each marker (CD8+, CD3+, Foxp3+) in the Core Tumour and Invasive Margins) is strongly related to better prognosis of GC patients in terms of Disease-Free Survival and Overall Survival. ICs activation and consequent immunogenic TME requires high nutrient absorption and synthesis accumulation of protein, lipid and nucleotides. However, tumour cells (TCs) promote their own proliferation by stealing the available micronutrients to ICs therefore leading to an immunosuppressive TME phenotype. Methods: This is a translational, prospective, non-randomized study. Primary endpoint is to assess if enteral immune nutrition (EIN) supplementation during the acme of the activity of cytotoxic of perioperative FLOT (docetaxel, oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil) in stage II-III GC can revert the TME in favour of ICs over TCs, witnessed by an increase of IS in surgical specimen over biopsy controls. A steady amount of EIN with Arginine, Omega-3-fatty acids, Glutamine and ribonucleic acid, will be added to patient’s diet from day 3 to 8 of each FLOT cycle, twice a day. We plan to use Image analysis software for automatic tumor detection and quantification of CD3+ and CD8+ stained cells whose densities will be converted into IS with pre-defined cutoffs. IS utilizes standardized percentile values (0 to 100%). We identify IS as Low, Intermediate (Int) and High with a mean percentile of 0-25%, &gt;25-70%, &gt;70-100% respectively. Two-group classifications are planned, corresponding to IS Low and Int-High. To better define the kind of tumor infiltrating cells (TILs) and assess the amount of immune suppressive cells, more IHC scoring will be evaluated: helper T-cells CD4+, CD8 T memory (CD 103+), T regulatory (both CD4+ and Foxp3+/CD105+), Macrophages M1 (CD 68+) and M2 (CD 163+). Results: Based on historical controls the rate of Int-High IS (&gt;25-70%, &gt;70% respectively) is about 64%, we expect to find a 20% increase of Int-High IS GC over biopsy control (internal validation cohort). To detect an increase in the percentage of high IS among patients treated with EIN (estimated around 85%) compared to biopsy controls (estimated around 64%) assuming a probability α and β of 0.2, the required sample size will be of 21 patients with resectable GC receiving EIN supplementation plus standard CT. To define the sample size a single proportion test was used. Conclusions: Our hypothesis is that EIN given during perioperative CT might prevent the establishment of an unfavourable TME for ICs in both auxotrophic and non-auxotrophic malignancies, thus leading to an increase of GC immunogenic pattern. </jats:p>",

We propose clear search and screening criteria based on 4 research questions and finally obtain 591 target studies. We conduct a detailed study on the distribution of the target literature in this research area, country/region, institution, and journal. Different countries/regions cooperate with each other and, thus, are clustered into five significant countries regions’ cooperation networks. There is a strong coupling relationship between research institutions, forming four major institutional cooperation networks. According to the analysis of those papers with a high number of citations, most of such papers were published in 2019, while the cross-citation phenomenon between papers occurred more frequently in 2021 and 2022. We use VOSviewer for visual coupling analysis of all keywords, which are automatically clustered into three research hotspots. Using CiteSpace to perform timeline-based keyword cooccurrence analysis, we find that scholars have gone through a “discovery-acceptance-question-improvement” process for the application of blockchain technology in supply chain management. According to the intensity and duration of burst detection words in different years, we draw three key points for future research. (i) Blockchain technology should be used to restructure and optimize the high-end food and medical cold chain supply chains. (ii) Blockchain technology should be used to enhance the cooperative relationship between supply chain members and the overall competitiveness of the supply chain. (iii) Innovate blockchain encryption technology that should be used to reduce the risk of information and privacy leakage in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

The suitability for irrigation of groundwater samples collected and analyzed during dry and wet seasons from Ajegunle, Akufo and Eruwa farm settlements of southwestern Nigeria were assessed using several irrigation water quality indices (IWQIs). The parameters were analyzed statistically and subjected to correlation. Seasonal spatial distribution maps were generated via GIS. All the water samples from the three farm settlements were found to be mostly soft, fresh, excellent, and suitable for irrigation in both seasons. Meanwhile, soluble sodium percentage (SSP) and Kelley's Ratio (KR) revealed them as unsuitable while other parameters showed different degrees of suitability for different samples from different farm settlements in different seasons. Significant correlations were seen between the selected parameters in both seasons. The distribution maps reveal the spatial distributions of selected parameters within Ajegunle and Akufo farm settlements. Utilizing these findings will enhance systematic groundwater exploitation for irrigation within the settlements. Furthermore, systematic irrigation management practices and crop choices, based on the concentrations and distribution of the parameters viz-a-viz crop requirements should be considered to limit potential dangers that may arise with the use of the water over a long period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last 20 years, the extensive integration of digital technologies has led to considerable changes in all industries, including agriculture. As a result, the agricultural sector has undergone a digital transformation. This shift has become increasingly necessary due to the many challenges faced by modern-day agriculture, such as rising temperatures, changing seasons, frequent extreme weather conditions, low availability of water resources, and decreased soil fertility. It is now evident that traditional farming methods are inadequate for achieving efficiency in agriculture, and innovative methods are essential. One such approach is digital agriculture, also known as smart agriculture or e-agriculture. This cutting-edge method utilizes digital technologies to collect, process, analyze, and disseminate information, enabling real-time decision-making in response to changing external factors. Considering given factors, the paper discusses the main directions of the digital economy that could impact agriculture. It evaluates existing examples and models of digital agriculture, while identifying possible ways to apply digital technologies in the agricultural sector. Based on thorough research, the final section of the paper offers practical recommendations that can serve as useful tools for developing countries as they transition towards the digital transformation of agriculture. The research findings make it clear that digital technologies have become a critical component of modern-day agricultural activities. Without their integration, it would be impossible to sustain productive agricultural activities, meet the global demand for food, and respond adequately to changing environmental factors.</jats:p>",

The main factors affecting the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain are sorted out first on the basis of Hall’s 3D theory and related research results. Then, the relationships between these factors and the dynamic change of influence of these factors on the resilience of the supply chain are studied through simulation by combining the fuzzy set theory, decision-making experimental analysis, and the system dynamics method. The results show that 10 s-level factors, such as disruption risk prediction and supply chain information sharing level, are active causal factors, while 9 s-level factors, such as disruption response time and disruption contingency plan, are passive result factors. Among the second-level factors, the disruption response time has the highest influence on the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain, and component design versatility has the lowest influence on the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain. The influence of the first-level factors, i.e., evolutionary ability, efficiency, and adaptability, descends in sequence. At last, specific suggestions for improving the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain are put forward.</jats:p>",

Given China’s status as the world’s largest energy consumer, achieving a balance between energy supply, demand, and sustainable development is crucial. This study quantifies the influence of international relations on the energy market, particularly the uncertainties arising from geopolitical events and international tensions that affect energy supply and prices. The research findings indicate that, in a long-term cointegrated relationship, a 1% change in the geo-political risk (GPR) index leads to a 0.229% change in China’s crude oil imports. Additionally, the impact of China’s GDP growth, carbon emissions, and sustainable energy consumption is −2.176, 0.723, and 0.167, respectively. This study also discusses the reasons behind the differential impact of crude oil prices on the United States and China. Recognizing the interplay between China’s energy security and international relations is vital for effective policy formulation. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to ensure a sustainable and secure energy future.</jats:p>"

Here, we use artificial selection under contrasting nitrate supplies to dissect the genetic architecture of this complex trait, where loci identified by association mapping failed to explain heritability estimates. We found a consistent response to selection for high branching, with correlated responses in other traits such as plasticity and flowering time. Genome-wide scans for selection and simulations suggest that at least tens of loci control this trait, with a distinct genetic architecture between low and high nitrate treatments. While signals of selection could be detected in the populations selected for high branching on low nitrate, there was very little overlap in the regions selected in three independent populations. Thus the regulatory network controlling shoot branching can be tuned in different ways to give similar phenotypes.</jats:p>"

Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of this crop and has low production costs but high logistical costs, which are influenced mainly by transport costs. Added to these characteristics, the disputed grain supply, the possibility of crop failure, and the randomness of some parameters that influence the soybean supply chain make decisions even more challenging. Methods: To mathematically model this problem, we carried out an analysis of the scientific production related to grain supply chain and the models used to address the problem, as well as a document analysis and a case study. Results: This paper proposes a new two-stage stochastic linear programming model with fixed recourse for tactical planning in the soybean supply chain from the perspective of the shipper under take or pay contracts over a one-year time horizon. The first-stage variables are the grain purchasing decisions and the volumes of rail and road transportation hired in advance. The model addresses 243 scenarios derived from four uncertainty sources: the purchase and sale prices of raw agricultural products on the spot market, the probability of crop failure, and the external demand. Conclusions: The model is successfully applied to a soybean trade firm in Brazil with expected gain of US$4,299,720 when using the stochastic model instead of the deterministic model. The stochastic model protected the firm from take or pay fines and crop failures, contracting a smaller volume of rail transport than what the company does.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify, develop, test, and verify the significant antecedents that affect the adoption of supply chain analytics and its consequences for achieving the circular economy. We have divided the conceptual framework into two parts. In the first part, the relationship among data integration and scalability, organizational readiness, and policies and regulations as Technological–Organizational–Environmental factors as antecedents in adopting supply chain analytics. In the second part, the dynamic capabilities view grounded the relationship among supply chain analytics, supply chain integration, and sustainable supply chain flexibility effect directly and indirectly on the circular economy. Data have been collected using the survey method from 231 respondents from the manufacturing industry in Pakistan. Data have been analyzed using (i) partial least square structure equation modeling (ii) and artificial neural network approaches. The empirical findings proved that antecedents (data integrity and scalability, organizational readiness, and policy and regulation) and consequences (supply chain integration and sustainable supply chain flexibility) of supply chain analytics adoption would improve the circular economy performance. Additionally, artificial neural networks have supported these relationships. The adoption of supply chain analytics will enable organizations to supply chain integration. Additionally, organizations with more integration and analytics in their operations tend to have more flexibility and a circular economy. Moreover, organizations and society will obtain social, economic, and environmental benefits and reduce wastage and negative environmental impacts.</jats:p>"

By considering the fact that online reviews and channel preferences are the important factors that influence consumer purchasing behaviors and the decision‐making of the supply chain, this paper deals with these problems through the development of a model involving online reviews and channel preferences. It then analyzes optimal decisions under either decentralized or centralized decision‐making scenarios. The impact of online review service input and consumer channel preference on optimal supply chain decisions and profits is further analyzed. Finally, based on the developed model, a revenue sharing contract coordination scheme is designed to achieve Pareto improvements in the supply chain. The results show that the degree of consumer preference for online channels affects the best consumer decisions and the overall profit of the supply chain. The impact coefficient of online reviews is positively correlated with the manufacturer's direct selling price, the level of input to online review services, and the profit of the entire supply chain. The provision of online review services can significantly increase channel prices, market sales, and profits compared to channel preferences. The overall profit of the supply chain under centralized decision‐making is significantly greater than that under decentralized decision‐making, and the coordination model can effectively coordinate the supply chain and alleviate conflicts.</jats:p>",

This scheme involves various stakeholders (farmers, trading centers, consumers), processes (logistics, storage, monitoring), and infrastructure (traffic and road systems, negative environmental emissions) to ensure the efficient flow of agricultural products from farms to consumers. The quality of life (QoL) in the hinterland can improve with the introduction of disruptive technologies, but no comprehensive studies have explored the QoL of individuals involved in the ASC–socioeconomic system of hinterland communities. This study elucidated and compared the diversified impacts of disruptive technologies brought by the Industrial Revolution 4.0 to the agricultural supply chain and their impacts on food security, sustainability, and climate change mitigation through the analysis of the related literature. This study also mapped out the role of disruptive technologies in the QoL of hinterland communities, particularly with respect to the farmers, trading center workers, and consumers. Points of discussion emerged with respect to precision agriculture, the Artificially Intelligent Internet of Things, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, robotics, automation, and e-commerce, and how these enabling technologies enhance fresh food supply and distribution and deliberately affect stakeholders’ life quality indexes through the analysis of situational case studies in India, South America, Malaysia, China, and Europe. The identification of these points of discussion was also achieved purely based on research performed on the related literature. The positive impacts of these technologies, such as the boosting of efficiency and the ensuring of a steady supply of fresh produce, ultimately improve the overall QoL. The technical insights from the studies were synthesized to develop new frameworks for QoL anchored in the agricultural supply chain (AgQoL) in the hinterland, and a six-dimensional network emphasizing the two trifectas of techno-socioenvironmental needs was established. Food-producing communities with a relatively high AgQoL should support food security in the region.</jats:p>"

The problem involves multiple levels and commodities, encompassing four manufacturers, two intermediate storage warehouses, and four main distributors following an (s, S) inventory control approach. Shortages are permitted, leading to a partial loss or back-ordering of products. The overarching objective is to minimize the overall inventory costs within the system, accounting for holding costs at each tier, managing shortages, and the expense incurred due to lost sales.

This study presents a framework for quantitative assessment by integrating the indicators of hydrologic alteration, the whale optimization algorithm and random forest (WOA-RF), and the water erosion prediction (WEP-L) models. This framework quantifies the differences in hydrological conditions and their driving forces at multi-timescales (annual, seasonal, and monthly). The results indicate that the runoff of the Wu River has decreased since 2005. Climate factors were found to influence the interannual variation of runoff mainly. Meanwhile, human activities had a more significant impact in autumn, with a relative contribution rate of 59.0% (WOA-RF model) and 70.8% (WEP-L model). Monthly, the picture is more complex, with the results of the WOA-RF model indicating that climate change has a significant impact in July, August, and September (88.8%, 92.7%, and 79.3%, respectively). However, the WEP-L model results showed that the relative contribution of land use is significant in April, May, June, October, and November (51.24%, 64.23%, 63.63%, 53.16%, and 50.63%, respectively).

This framework generates optimal water allocation schemes while minimizing total costs. The total cost of water allocation consists of the allocated water cost, the opportunity loss for not meeting water demand, and the loss of the penalty for exceeding water demand. The uncertainties in water demand and supply are expressed by cumulative distribution functions. The optimal water allocation for each water use sector is determined by the water price, the unit loss of the penalty and opportunity loss, and the cumulative distribution functions. The model was then applied to monthly water allocation for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water use in two counties of Huizhou City, China, whose water supply mainly depends on Baipenzhu Reservoir. The water demand for each water use sector and the monthly reservoir inflow showed good fits with the uniform and P-III distributions, respectively. The water demand satisfied ratio for each water use sector was stable and increased for the optimal water allocation scheme from the newsvendor model-based framework, and the costs were lower compared with the actual water allocation scheme. The novel framework is characterized by less severe water shortages, lower costs, and greater similarity to actual water use compared with the traditional deterministic multi-objective analysis model, and demonstrates strong robustness in the advantages of lower released surplus water and higher water demand satisfied ratio. This novel framework yields the optimal water allocation for each water use sector by integrating the properties of the market (i.e., determining the opportunity loss for not meeting water demand) with the government (i.e., determining the water price and the loss of the penalty for exceeding water demand) under the strictest water resources management systems.</jats:p>"

The costs of water transfers vary considerably, depending on the composition of the water source, the target audience and the route and distance of the transfer. This study proposes a multi-scenario optimization model for the operation of inter-basin water transfer-supply systems that balances the cost–benefit relationships. A two-objective optimization model is first established including minimizing the sum of squared water supply deficits and the cost of water transfers. Three water transfer scenarios are developed for different cost–benefit relationships. Based on these scenarios, the established optimization model is further converted into a single-objective optimization model to avoid the direct calculation of complex water transfer costs. The model is finally solved to obtain water transfer schemes. The proposed model is applied to the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. The results show that with a contracted diversion of 60% of the Yangtze River, the reliability of the water supply is 78.2% and the water shortage index is 2.8%, which is a compromise between balancing the water shortage index and the volume and cost of water transfer.</jats:p>",

The competition and collaboration among the node enterprises in the sea-cargo supply chain system (SCSCS) directly impact the overall structure and efficiency of the supply chain system, introducing complexity in analysis. This research focuses on a two-level SCSCS comprising one shipping company and two competing freight forwarders, considering their altruistic preferences manifested through contributing to the shipping company’s brand building. Employing a Stackelberg game model, this study examines the effects of the shipping company’s brand investment willingness and the freight forwarders’ altruistic preferences on the decision making and profits of all stakeholders. The findings reveal that a higher willingness of the shipping company to invest in its brand building leads to increased profits for all parties involved. However, while the altruistic behaviors of the freight forwarders can enhance the shipping company’s profits, their own profits may not necessarily see the same impact. Furthermore, moderate competition between the freight forwarders can enhance the profits for all members. This research identifies the circumstances in which the freight forwarders’ altruistic preferences can lead to increased profits for themselves, achieving both altruistic and self-interested outcomes.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the clarity value was approximately 10% higher, and the recognition speed was also significantly improved. The improvement of recognition speed can effectively promote the work efficiency of the whole method. Strong edges and sparse constraints can effectively improve the accuracy of water level identification, provide scientific and effective data and information for subsequent water resource management, and meet the needs of water resource managers to effectively grasp the law of water level. This can provide technical support for identification methods in other fields, and the ultimate goal is to promote the protection and management of water resources and reduce the harm of natural disasters on people.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Within the framework of the European Green Deal, a circular economy is ensured, which is defined as a sustainable development model that preserves the value of products, materials and resources in the economy as much as possible. Waste sorting is of great importance in this process, as it enables rational management of resources and the return to circulation of already used products, which become raw materials for the production of other products. The proportion of unsorted waste in Latvia is higher than in other European countries, and the shared waste collection system operates with certain problems. In particular, this applies to the collection and management of bio-waste, which is currently one of the weakest sectors in the industry, despite the fact that the Landfill Directive of the European Parliament and the Council stipulates that a separate collection system for bio-waste must be in place by the end of 2023. In the event that the system of separate collection of biological waste is not organized during this period, sanctions may be applied to Latvia. Therefore, it is urgent to understand how to change consumer behaviour and increase involvement in waste sorting as the amount of waste increases, what opportunities and responsibilities exist for the organizations and consumers involved in this process. In this research, the study of consumer behaviour changes and their causes is analysed in the context of public communication and its opportunities. The aim of the article is to assess the importance of communication in encouraging changes in consumer behaviour in waste sorting in Latvia, especially in the bio-waste segment. In order to achieve the goal, an analysis of literature and documents was carried out on consumer behaviour, factors influencing it, consumer habits and communication possibilities for changing them. Consumer involvement and habits in biowaste sorting were investigated through a secondary analysis of previous relevant studies. In order to characterize the communication of waste management companies about waste sorting, a content analysis was carried out. In order to assess the current communication about waste management and sorting and its impact on consumer behaviour, interviews were conducted with communication experts. In general, it can be concluded that the waste management industry in Latvia is fragmented, which promotes competition between companies. However, each waste managing company has different waste sorting systems and other rules, which are not clearly explained to consumers, this communication is general and is not formed on a strategic basis, and in does not contribute to changes in consumer behaviour and an increase in waste sorting.</jats:p>",

It finds that adopting a crashing strategy improves the supply chain’s profit, while the dynamic wholesale price contract achieves supply chain coordination. Meanwhile, when consumer time and price sensitivity are low, it is easier to achieve high profits in the supply chain under unequal power distribution. Conversely, the supply chain profit is higher in the case of a Nash game. This study innovatively introduces the thought of power structure and crashing strategy into the prefabricated construction supply chain, and provides the optimal price and delivery time under three different power structures for prefabricated construction enterprises and realizes supply chain coordination.

Aiming at promoting the development of the EV CLSC, this study integrates the influence of internal and external factors, analyzes their joint impact on the performance of the EV CLSC, and explores the optimal CLSC structure. Specifically, this study develops five game theory models considering different CLSC structures and consumers’ green awareness under government subsidy and varied channel leaderships. Combining theoretical analysis with numerical simulation, the study reveals the performance of the EV CLSC and indicates the optimal CLSC decisions for different players. The result suggests that an EV manufacturer should develop an EV CLSC by itself considering the elimination of double marginalization. When a third-party player is incorporated, the EV manufacturer should undertake the collection effort by itself to optimize the benefit for both the EV manufacturer and the third-party player, especially considering the increasing green awareness of consumers. And a lift of each player’s channel power would always be a wise choice for each other. For the government which has the goals of promoting both the EV industry and the end-of-life treatment of obsolete EVs, a series of trade-offs including the CLSC structure and channel leadership should be considered prudently. This study contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the optimal decisions of the EV CLSC, and will benefit the development of the EV CLSC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ongoing climate and environmental breakdown, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian war in Ukraine are some of the key events creating a continuous convergence of crises that will likely affect most societal groups and the whole global (dis)order. Based on research within the Latvian Council of Science funded project ‘Ready for change? Sustainable management of common natural resources’, this paper explores firstly, the evidence-based impossibility of perpetual growth; secondly, the already visible signs of socio-economic hardship throughout 2020 - 2023; and thirdly, the possible pathways for actions in Latvia, based on long-term involvement in degrowth movement and participatory action research. We conclude that the early warnings for ‘Limits to growth’ 50 years ago have proven correct and dramatic reductions in emissions and material throughput are necessary to ensure a liveable planet for humans and broader biodiversity. The only substantial historical reductions have happened during the crises, and the decoupling of growth from environmental destruction remains a dangerous illusion. Therefore, the degrowth body of knowledge must be considered as a ‘vision for a better future’ with understanding and respect to planetary boundaries, social equity and other limits. Unfortunately, the lessons from crises indicate that corporate and political elites are afraid to reorganize the growth hegemony-driven economic and political systems. Still, the environmental breakdown has not yet provided such a sense of urgency that COVID-19 did, despite all warnings. The possible pathways in Latvia are not unique in this sense as our research confirms such a lack of sense of urgency and prioritisation of economic aims above environmental/existential, immediate above the more distant. There are aspects of valuable societal and environmental resilience in Latvia that are likely to be useful in adaptation to crises, but growth-based environmental destruction is generally not understood even among many environmentally active people. The strategic vision for alternative development strategies is very limited in Latvia. The high risk of degrowth by disaster remains.</jats:p>",

Because of the hybrid nonlinearity of bluff body and magnet, the symmetrically shaped bluff body can induce a greater cantilever deformation, and a stronger repulsion generates a higher swing frequency of the cantilever. Moreover, the dual lead zirconate titanate plate enhances the utilization efficiency of the magnet repulsion. The hybrid nonlinearity is studied in theoretical models, numerical simulations, and experiments. The harvester outputs a noticeable voltage at 2.5 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

This study aims to investigate the impact of consumer preferences on decision-making behavior within dual-channel supply chains. Specifically, it classifies the structure of the supply chain channels into two types: producer-led and seller-led online channels, and examines two distinct decision-making scenarios: centralized and decentralized decision-making. The study applies the game theory modeling method to analyze the differences in the selling prices, freshness, low carbon levels, and profits of agri-foods in these scenarios. The findings indicate that as consumer preference for the online channel grows, it becomes more challenging to sell homogeneous agri-foods at higher prices through physical (entity) channels. Moreover, the introduction of online channels by sellers leads to higher selling prices for agri-foods in the supply chain under decentralized decision-making compared to centralized decision-making, and the freshness and low carbon level of agri-foods primarily depend on the cost structure of the supply chain. From the perspective of enhancing produce quality, promoting low carbon development, and attaining high-quality products at a reasonable price, centralized decision-making within the supply chain and seller-led online channels are more advantageous. However, it is important to note that pursuing these benefits may result in a certain amount of sacrifice in terms of supply chain profit.</jats:p>"

Using survey data from 306 households in western Kenya, we find that supplying cricket production starter kits, granting access to credit facilities, encouraging participation in farmer groups, and fostering partnerships can enhance the adoption of cricket farming. Moreover, we provide new evidence that institutional training significantly increases cricket yields while embracing cricket consumption (i.e. entomophagy) increases market supply. These findings underscore the importance of technical training, provision of production starter kits, and raising awareness about entomophagy to achieve sustainable mass production and adoption of cricket farming.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>European Union climate policy envisages climate-neutrality by 2050 and fosters Member States to find opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. Land use is a key sector to achieve net-zero emissions. To understand how each Member State can contribute to achieving climate goals, the impact of land use change on GHG emissions should be studied at the national level. The use of organic soils for crop production has a detrimental climate impact due to the large carbon stock decrease. In Estonia, approximately a quarter of GHG emissions from agricultural soils results from cultivation of organic soils. This study aims to show the impact of a scenario that assumes part of agricultural land (AL) will be converted into forest land (FL) and green focus areas; and that AL on organic soils will be converted into grassland (GL). Furthermore, 20% of this area will be rewetted. The future scenario of AL use was created using the Shared Socio-economic Pathways methodology. IPCC Guidelines were used in assessing GHG emissions. AL use changes following this scenario would help reduce GHG emissions by 90% by 2050 compared to 2020. In case of rewetting 20% of converted organic soils, the reduction would be 82% under assumptions about Estonian conditions. It is important to convert cropland on organic soils to GL and FL in order to reduce GHG emissions. However, before designing policy measures for changing AL use, it is important to analyse the actual status of organic soils in Estonia and determine emission factors at the national level.</jats:p>",

Firstly, according to the stakeholder theory and the green supply chain theory, a conceptual model of interest linkage-influencing factors of the green supply chain of grassland livestock products was constructed on the basis of public policy effect, green business status, willingness to cooperate, characteristics of decision-making behavior, and circulation characteristics. Secondly, on the basis of 358 research data samples from participants in the green supply chain of grassland livestock products in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the structural equation model was used to empirically study the action law of each influencing factor and the mechanism of influence on the interest linkage. The results showed that willingness to cooperate had a significant positive influence on interest linkage; circulation characteristics did not have a significant direct influence on interest linkage but had an indirect positive influence on it through willingness to cooperate; characteristics of decision-making behavior not only had a direct positive influence on interest linkage but also enhanced the willingness to cooperate through the circulation characteristics of livestock products, which had an indirect positive influence on interest linkage; and green business status did not directly influence interest linkage. The public policy effect did not directly influence interest linkage but indirectly influenced the interest linkage through green business status, willingness to cooperate, characteristics of decision-making behavior, and circulation characteristics. Finally, managerial implications for constructing a reasonable interest linkage mechanism were proposed, including enhancing the willingness of subjects to cooperate, stabilizing the distribution channels of livestock products, cultivating market awareness of the interested subjects, strengthening the main body’s awareness of green development and expanding the scale of green operation, increasing government input and policy publicity to highlight the public policy effect, and improving relevant laws and regulations to effectively safeguard the interest of market entities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the increasing pollution of the environment in Ukraine as a result of energy and water resource consumption, waste management and emissions, land use, and biodiversity by agricultural businesses, the issue of implementing a sustainable development strategy is becoming increasingly important. Research results show that the ESG direction is typical for a small number of agro holdings in Ukraine, which is associated with their attraction to foreign investments and loans. Most of Ukraine's large agricultural companies either do not report on sustainable development or are completely absent from the public space, indicating a low level of interest in implementing the best sustainable development practices. Our results show that one of the reasons that hinder the implementation of sustainable development principles in agricultural businesses in Ukraine is the lack of informational support in managing its environmental activities. The information provided to management for making decisions on the impact on the environment and climate with the aim of reducing and preventing environmental risks is based on an information base that is systematized and summarized in accounting. Taking this into account, the article explores the legislation of Ukraine and scientists' proposals on organizing the environmental aspects in accounting and the place of environmental accounting in the accounting system. In modern conditions of development, agribusiness has the following peculiarities: the presence of bioenergy resources that reproduce dynamic soil fertility as a result of the biological transformation, and the intensification of production that affects the state of the land, climate, safety, and public health. Therefore, the paper investigates the information support for environmental management of agribusiness enterprises, taking into account the peculiarities of assets that are the true wealth of humanity and multiply energy on Earth, as well as assets that have an intensive impact on the state of land and climate.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology has the advantage of decentralization and non-tampering Therefore, this study analyzes the characteristics of traceability data in the grain-and-oil-food-supply chain, and presents a blockchain-based traceability model for the grain-and-oil-food-supply chain. Firstly, a new method combining blockchain and machine learning is proposed to enhance the authenticity and reliability of blockchain source data by constructing anomalous data-processing models. In addition, a lightweight blockchain-storage method and a data-recovery mechanism are proposed to reduce the pressure on supply-chain-data storage and improve fault tolerance. The results indicate that the average query delay of public data is 0.42 s, the average query delay of private data is 0.88 s, and the average data-recovery delay is 1.2 s. Finally, a blockchain-based grain-and-oil-food-supply-chain traceability system is designed and built using Hyperledger Fabric. Compared with the existing grain-and-oil-food-supply chain, the model constructed achieves multi-source heterogeneous data uploading, lightweight storage, data recovery, and traceability in the supply chain, which are of great significance for ensuring the safety of grain-and-oil food in China.</jats:p>"

The primary objective is to assess the quality of public bus transport supply and identify the most effective improvements to heighten passenger satisfaction and attract new users. To accomplish this goal, two prominent multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were employed, leveraging a dynamic questionnaire survey. The ANP method, recognized for its robustness, takes into account the interrelationships and feedback among various criteria levels, offering a systematic evaluation framework. In contrast, the AHP method overlooks these factors. The adoption of both methods was crucial in obtaining a comprehensive under-standing of experts' perceptions regarding public transport service quality. To illustrate the practical implementation of these approaches, an empirical study was conducted using a re-al-life case. This study serves as a testament to the efficacy of these decision-making methods and underscores their value in the decision-making process. Ultimately, this paper under-scores the significance of prioritizing public transport system improvements as a means to en-rich citizens' lives and bolster government investments.</jats:p>",

All statements, recommendations and background texts were reviewed and either confirmed or amended. New statements and recommendations were included where necessary.</jats:p><jats:p>Aim The use of evidence-based risk-adapted therapies to treat women with endometrial cancer of low risk prevents unnecessarily radical surgery and avoids non-beneficial adjuvant radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. For women with endometrial cancer and a high risk of recurrence, the guideline defines the optimum level of radical surgery and indicates whether chemotherapy and/or adjuvant radiation therapy is necessary. This should improve the survival rates and quality of life of these patients. The S3-guideline on endometrial cancer and the quality indicators based on the guideline aim to provide the basis for the work of certified gynecological cancer centers.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods The guideline was first compiled in 2018 in accordance with the requirements for S3-level guidelines and was updated in 2022. The update included an adaptation of the source guidelines identified using the German Instrument for Methodological Guideline Appraisal (DELBI). The update also used evidence reviews which were created based on selected literature obtained from systematic searches in selected literature databases using the PICO process. The Clinical Guidelines Service Group was tasked with carrying out a systematic search and assessment of the literature. Their results were used by interdisciplinary working groups as a basis for developing suggestions for recommendations and statements which were then modified during structured online consensus conferences and/or additionally amended online using the DELPHI process to achieve a consensus.</jats:p><jats:p>Recommendations Part 1 of this short version of the guideline provides recommendations on epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, and hereditary factors. The epidemiology of endometrial cancer and the risk factors for developing endometrial cancer are presented. The options for screening and the methods used to diagnose endometrial cancer are outlined. Recommendations are given for the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of hereditary forms of endometrial cancer. The use of geriatric assessment is considered and existing structures of care are presented.</jats:p>",
