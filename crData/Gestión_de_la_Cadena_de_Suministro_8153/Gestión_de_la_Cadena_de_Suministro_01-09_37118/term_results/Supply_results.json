This article develops a taxonomy of supply networks with a particular focus on managing network creation and operation. The taxonomy is based on a review of network literature from various academic perspectives and extensive empirical data across a variety of industry sectors including automotive, fast‐moving consumer goods, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and communications technologies. The main differentiating factors for classifying a matrix of four types of supply network are found to be the degree of supply network dynamics and the degree of focal company supply network influence. Network characteristics and different patterns ofnetworking activities are identified for each type of supply network.</jats:p>",

Without doubt, it will dramatically change the way purchasing is done in the near future. Telgen (1998) calls it a “revolution through electronic purchasing.” This article analyzes the possibilities of electronic marketplaces for buyers, primarily from a theoretical perspective. The article develops an analytical framework that is based on information economics theory, which may be the most important theory to analyz market problems in general. It is combined with a systematic approach for procurement transactions based on Williamson's (1985a) transaction theory. An e‐procurement matrix is developed that could help to systematize different e‐procurement instruments. Various data types available from electronic marketplaces are analyzed with a business model for electronic marketplaces. These business models show the real value added by e‐procurement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The problems associated with transparency in supply relationships — the two‐way exchange of information and knowledge between customer and supplier — represent chronic difficulty for managers. The sensitivity of such exchanges appears to interfere with — even to negate — their effectiveness and value. This may be because of insufficient consideration of types of transparency and a propensity for customer domination in the relationship. This research is aimed at exploring these difficulties in order to understand the dynamics and varying nature of transparency in this context (including a proposed state of value transparency) and to suggest ways in which it might be approached in practice. In addition to the social and technology‐led drivers identified for transparency, the research approach to the concept in supply has been driven by the observation that many of the traditional routines and activities occurring between industrial or commercial purchasers and their suppliers can be unnecessary and wasteful. This article presents the background to this hypothesis and records the development of a framework for discussion of the concept.</jats:p>",

Based on nationwide representative survey data (a total of 1,252 IT transactions), the research considers the problems that Dutch SMEs are faced with and the way in which these problems are dealt with. On average, 28 percent of transaction are completed without problems. If problems are encountered, they mostly involve inadequate documentation (45 percent of all transactions). Frequently mentioned problems, such as incompatibility with other IT products and being over budget, occur much less frequently (about 25 percent of all transactions). Moreover, strong support was found for the existence of a specific sequence in dealing with ex‐post problems. Nearly all SMEs at least communicate the problem to the supplier; if that does not solve the issue, it is almost always followed by active deliberation with the supplier about a solution. If that does not help, about half of the SMEs impose some kind of sanction (most of the time delaying the payment). If that still does not settle the issue, virtually all SMEs give up on it. Third parties, such as arbitration committees or the courts, are rarely invoked.</jats:p>",

This article shows how game theory explains this phenomenon and helps to solve it. When the same individuals have to deal with each other in a series of projects, cooperation is more likely to occur than when they deal with a different individual in each project. Supported by an experiment with managers in a construction firm, it was found that particularly in large construction companies, individuals rarely deal with the same individuals at subcontractors. The business recommendation following from this is to adopt an explicit policy of appointing account managers both at the purchasing side of the contractor and the marketing side of the subcontractor to deal with the mutual contacts between the organizations involved.</jats:p>",

Six configurations are identified and analyzed, varying in degree of coordination and level of purchaser integration. The configurations are illustrated by five case studies performed in different companies operating in different industries. Enabling factors, such as the purchasing organization and the competencies and skills of the purchasers, can facilitate the involvement of purchasers in a development project. Project size and project complexity can be identified as driving factors influencing the appropriateness of the purchaser involvement configurations. Dedicated, full‐time purchasing specialists in combination with a purchasing coordinator provide the strongest degree of involvement necessary for managing large and complex projects, whereas indirect, ad hoc purchasinginvolvement provides the lowest degree of involvement sufficient for small and relatively simple projects.</jats:p>",

A case study at HP validated nine sources of CPD uncertainty and identified four new important ideas that led to five key requirements for CPD across the supply chain. The concepts of degree of design customization and degree of coupling are introduced as a framework by which to evaluate the risk introduced into the product development process by suppliers. The engineering metric supplier coupling, the engineering metric deviation from target and the degree of design customization indices are defined and integrated into a process to facilitate risk assessment from the integrator’s perspective both at the system-level and supplier-level. The paper concludes by presenting the future research agenda.</jats:p>",

The contribution of each of these sources has not been studied in detail. Although maternal diet is a key factor affecting human milk composition, other factors such as gestational age, stage of lactation, nutritional status, and genetic background are known to influence the fat content and fatty acid composition in human milk. Both linoleic and α‐linolenic acids, the essential fatty acids, are present in human milk, as are several other n−6 and n−3 longer chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are required for optimal growth and development of infants. The fatty acid profile of human milk from lactating women of different countries is remarkably stable, but there is variability in some of the components, such as docosahexaenoic acid, which is mainly due to differences in dietary habits. Tracer techniques with stable isotopes have been valuable in assessing the kinetics of fatty acid metabolism during lactation and in determining the origin of fatty acids in human milk. Based on these studies, the major part of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human milk seems not to be provided directly from the diet but from maternal tissue stores.</jats:p>",

Methods: The number of practicing dentists was estimated from American Dental Association data on licensed dentists in California. Each dentist's address was geocoded and matched to a Medical Service Study Area (MSSA). Dentist‐to‐population ratios were computed, and the association between dentist supply and community characteristics was analyzed in regression models. Results: Approximately 20 percent of California communities may have a shortage of dentists. Two‐thirds of dental shortage communities are rural. Communities with a lower supply of dentists have higher percentages of minorities, children, and low‐income persons. Minority dentists were more likely to practice in minority communities. Conclusions: Geographic maldistribution of dentists may contribute to poor access to dental care in many communities, especially in rural, low‐income, and minority communities. Minority dentists are more likely to practice in minority communities, but are a small portion of the dental workforce.</jats:p>",

In the present studies, the perivenous 21% of the lobular volume was destroyed by retrograde digitonin perfusion, and antegrade perfusion restored. pHi was determined by 31P-NMR. The remaining periportal cells, the site of gluconeogenesis from lactate, had a substantially higher mean pHi (7.42) than did the intact liver (7.23). When lactate was removed from the perfusate, mean pHi decreased to 7.25. The corresponding concentration of cell bicarbonate fell with a half-time of approximately 5min. When lactate was re-introduced mean pHi rose to 7.34. We conclude that a major contributor to periportal alkalinity under these conditions is proton consumption during gluconeogenesis from lactate ions.</jats:p>",

Migrants reduce the labor supply of nonmigrant relatives, which translates into lower earnings from local labor markets. Households substitute income for more leisure – a significant and previously little recognized benefit of emigration for Philippine households. This benefit varies by gender of nonmigrants and is generally higher for men. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changes in the composition of fibre types and the capillary supply of skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior) were quantified in rats and hamsters subjected to 8‐10 weeks of cold exposure and reduced photoperiod (10 °C, 1 h light‐23 h dark). Muscle mass decreased in both species (by 12% and 17%, respectively). Following acclimation to cold there were no specific changes in fibre cross‐sectional area (FCSA) in rats, whereas in hamsters there was a substantial atrophy of Type II, but not Type I fibres. In rat muscle there was little difference between the two groups in average capillary to fibre ratio (C:F) (1.76 ± 0.15, normothermia, N; 1.69 ± 0.05, hypothermia, H) and average capillary density (CD) (188 ± 14 mm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, N; 201 ± 12 mm<jats:sup>‐2,</jats:sup> H). Similarly, the average C:F was unaltered in hamsters (2.75 ± 0.11, N; 2.72 ± 0.15, H), although the 30% smaller fibre size observed with hypothermia resulted in a corresponding increase in average CD, to 1539 ± 80 mm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> (P &lt; 0.01). However, there was a coordinated regional adaptation to cold exposure in hamsters resulting in capillary rarefaction in the glycolytic cortex and angiogenesis in the oxidative core. Following acclimation of rats to cold there was a reduction in the supply area of individual vessels (capillary domain), particularly in the cortex (9310, N; 8938 μm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, H; P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, hypothermic hamsters showed only a small decrease in mean domain area in the cortex (948 μm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, N; 846 μm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, H; n.s.) but a marked reduction in the core (871 μm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, N; 604 μm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, H; P &lt; 0.01). Rats showed little or no change in local capillary supply (LCFR) to fast fibres on acclimation to cold, while in hamsters the LCFR of Type IIb fibres showed a decrease in the cortex (2.7, N; 2.3, H) and an increase in the core (3.0, N; 3.3, H) during acclimation to cold. These data suggest that during a simulated onset of winter rats maintain FCSA and capillary supply as part of an avoidance strategy, whereas hamsters increase muscle capillarity in part as a consequence of disuse atrophy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To ascertain whether the growth rhythm of roots differs from that of the shoot, the seasonal pattern of dry mass allocation was determined in 1-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings. Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the dynamics of starch and soluble sugars were examined to understand the role of stored carbon and that of current photosynthates in meeting the sink demand of plant organs. In this growth-chamber experiment, hydroponic cultures supplied the seedlings with low (0.25 mM N) or high (2.5 mM N) nutrient level. The climatic conditions in the chamber simulated the weather conditions from May to mid-October in southern Finland. Root growth was most intense at the end of the growing season, at which time shoot growth slowed down. Nutrient level did not affect the growth rhythm of the roots, but the total production of root biomass was favoured by high level of nutrients. The response of root growth to root zone temperature (RZT) was not the same over the growing season, indicating that the sensitivity of root growth to RZT depends on the growth phase of the seedling. The growth rhythm of the roots is probably regulated by several internal and external factors and their interactions, including RZT and availability of photosynthates. </jats:p>",

Agricultural drainage and subsurface flow contribute to a complex gradient of salinity and nutrients in this eutrophic, ‘lowland type’ river.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Because of light‐limiting conditions for growth, maintenance demands of the algae exceed production during summer and autumn in the San Joaquin River where there is no inflow from tributaries. In contrast to substantial gains in concentration of inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus during the summer of normal‐flow years, net losses of algal biomass (2–4 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) occurred in a mid‐river segment with no significant tributary inflow. However, downstream of a large tributary draining the Sierra Nevada, a substantial net gain in algal biomass (6–11 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) occurred in the summer, but not in the spring (loss of 1–6 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) or autumn (loss of 2–5 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>).</jats:p><jats:p>3. The phytoplankton was dominated in summer by ‘r‐selected’ centric diatoms (Thalassiosirales), species both tolerant of variable salinity and widely distributed in the San Joaquin River. Pennate diatoms were proportionally more abundant (in biomass) in the winter, spring and autumn. Abundant taxa included the diatoms <jats:italic>Cyclotella meneghiniana</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Skeletonema</jats:italic> cf. <jats:italic>potamos</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cyclostephanos invisitatus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Thalassiosira weissflogii</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Nitzschia acicularis</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>N. palea</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>N. reversa</jats:italic>, and the chlorophytes <jats:italic>Chlamydomonas</jats:italic> sp. and <jats:italic>Scenesdesmus quadricauda.</jats:italic> Patterns in the abundance of species indicated that assembly of the phytoplankton is limited more by light and flow regime than by nutrient supply.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The phytobenthos was dominated by larger, more slowly reproducing pennate diatoms. Few of the abundant species are euryhaline. The diatoms <jats:italic>Navicula recens</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Nitzschia inconspicua</jats:italic> and cyanophytes, <jats:italic>Oscillatoria</jats:italic> spp., were the principal late‐summer benthic species upstream in the mainstem and in drainages of the San Joaquin Valley. Many of the other abundant diatoms (<jats:italic>Amphora veneta</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Bacillaria paxillifer</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Navicula symmetrica</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Nitzschia amphibia</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>N. fonticola</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>N. palea</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Pleurosigma salinarum</jats:italic>) of late‐summer assemblages in these segments also are motile species. While many of these species also were abundant in segments downstream of confluences with rivers draining the Sierra Nevada, the relative abundance of prostrate (<jats:italic>Cocconeis placentula</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>euglypta</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Navicula minima</jats:italic>) and erect or stalked (<jats:italic>Achnanthidium deflexum</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Achnanthes lanceolata</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Gomphonema kobayasii</jats:italic>, G. <jats:italic>parvulum</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>lagenula</jats:italic>) diatoms and <jats:italic>Stigeoclonium</jats:italic> sp. was greater in these lower San Joaquin River segments.</jats:p><jats:p>5. A weighted‐averaging regression model, based on salinity and benthic‐algal abundance in the San Joaquin River and segments of its major tributaries within the San Joaquin Valley, yielded a highly significant coefficient‐of‐determination (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.84) and low prediction error between salinity inferred from the species and that observed, indicating that salinity tolerance is a primary constraint on growth and assembly of the phytobenthos. The same measures of predictability indicated poor performance of a model based on inorganic nitrogen. However, with a greater representation of tributaries (including segments within the Sierra Nevada foothills) in the sample set, an inorganic nitrogen model also yielded a highly significant coefficient‐of‐determination (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.87) and low prediction error between the species‐inferred and the observed concentration. As with the salinity model (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.94) for the enlarged data set, a systematic difference (increased deviation of residuals) existed at high inorganic nitrogen concentrations. These results indicate substantial interaction between salinity and inorganic nitrogen as constraints on the structure of benthic‐algal communities of the San Joaquin River basin.</jats:p>",

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the existing research in an effort to understand the concept of “supply chain management.” Various definitions of SCM and “supply chain” are reviewed, categorized, and synthesized. Definitions of supporting constructs of SCM and a framework are then offered to establish a consistent means to conceptualize SCM. Antecedents and consequences of SCM are identified, and the boundaries of SCM in terms of business functions and organizations are proposed. A conceptual model and unified definition of SCM are then presented that indicate the nature, antecedents, and consequences of the phenomena.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT</jats:bold> The Eridanos fluvio‐deltaic system, draining most of north‐western Europe, developed during the Late Cenozoic as a result of simultaneous uplift of the Fennoscandian shield and accelerated subsidence in the North Sea Basin. This seismo‐stratigraphic study aims to reconstruct the large‐scale depositional architecture of the deltaic portion of the basin fill and relate it to external controls. A total of 27 units have been recognized. They comprise over 62×10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in the Southern North Sea Basin alone, and have an average delta surface area of 28×10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, which suggests that the size of the drainage area was about 1.1×10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Water depth in the depocentre is seen to decrease systematically over time. This trend is interrupted by a deepening phase between 6.5 and 4.5 Ma that can be correlated with the simultaneous occurrence of increased uplift of the Fennoscandian shield, increased subsidence of the Southern North Sea Basin, and a long‐term eustatic highstand. All these observations point to a tectonic control on long‐term average rates of accommodation and supply. Controls on short‐term variations are inferred from variations in rates of sediment supply and bifurcation of the delta channel network. Both rates were initially low under warm, moist, relatively stable climate conditions. The straight wave‐dominated delta front gradually developed into a lobate fluvial‐dominated delta front. Two high‐amplitude sea‐level falls affected the Pliocene units, which are characterized by widespread delta‐front failures. Changes in relative sea level and climate became more frequent from the late Pliocene onward, as the system experienced the effects of glacial–interglacial transitions. Peaks in sedimentation and bifurcation rates were coeval with cold (glacial) conditions. The positive correlation between rates of supply and bifurcation on the one hand, and climate proxies (pollen and δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O records) on the other hand is highly significant. The evidence presented in this study convincingly demonstrates the control of climate on time‐averaged sediment supply and channel‐network characteristics, despite the expected nonuniformity and time lags in system response. The presence of a clearly discernible climate signal in time‐averaged sediment supply illustrates the usefulness of integrated seismo‐stratigraphic studies for basin‐wide analysis of delta evolution on geological time scales.</jats:p>",
