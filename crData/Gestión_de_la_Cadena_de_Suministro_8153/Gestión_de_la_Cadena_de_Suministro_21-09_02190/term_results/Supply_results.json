      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organizations of the present day have directed their work patterns by acquiring the approach of green supply chain management (GSCM), in order to combat harmful environmental concerns. The most prominent reason behind the adoption of green strategy is to reduce the burden of the polluted environment. It is a concept which identifies the relationship between the supply chain operations and the natural environment. The present chapter provides a detailed discussion regarding the application of green transportation in green supply chain management, while shedding light to the evolution of green supply chain management, and its principle along with the factors that support total quality environmental management. The overall discussion is focused by elaborating the examples of green transportation in GSCM. The discussion revealed that most of the international markets prioritize the emission of gas, rather than focusing on implementing the green technologies in transportation. Slow steaming, voyage optimization, and efficiency in port operations are some of the major recent trends of green transportation identified in green supply chain management. However, some of the common examples of green transportation in GSCM Dalsey Hillblom Lynn (DHL) model of green transportation and Ingvar Kamprad, Elmtaryd Agunnaryd (IKEA) model of green transportation which serves as the major initiatives in the management of green transportation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In the preceding chapters, the focus was on simulating policies that aim to reduce poverty, generate revenue, or redistribute resources. However, many public policies also try to incentivize behaviour, such as those to improve labour participation or supply, or to change behaviours in relation to savings or pollution. Social- and fiscal-policy instruments face a fundamental trade-off. An instrument that performs well from an income-maintenance perspective may have unintended behavioural consequences. This chapter considers the structure of instruments that have an explicit goal to improve behavioural response, particularly focusing on in-work benefits. The chapter also describes how to use a microsimulation mode to simulate the inputs required for the estimation of a behavioural-econometric model, and then estimates a revealed-preference-choice model. The chapter then describes a method often used in microsimulation models to calibrate choice models for simulation purposes. In terms of measurement issues related to the behavioural analysis, we describe the design and use of replacement rates. The chapter concludes by undertaking a simulation of the introduction of a change in in-work benefits.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered unprecedented growth in digital commerce and has accelerated the digital transformation of many retailers. An unforeseen event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is often referred to as a ‘Black Swan’ event – being of low probability to occur but causing substantial disruptions to a supply chain. Lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus resulted in significant external and internal disruptions to retailers’ supply chains. Omnichannel retailer’s ability to respond to the pandemic’s disruption hinges on resilient supply chain strategies.Objectives: This article explored the major supply chain disruptions experienced by South African omnichannel retailers because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it investigated the response strategies employed by the retailers as part of their efforts to mitigate the disruptions caused.Method: This study followed a qualitative, exploratory research design. Data were collected through 17 semi-structured interviews with the senior managers from nine different large omnichannel retailers in South Africa.Results: The study found that omnichannel retailers experienced external and internal supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. The most noticeable external disruption was the drastic migration of consumers to online channels and the retailers’ inability to meet demand surges. Internally, systems constraints of both front- and back-end operations were identified as prominent disruptions. In response, the omnichannel retailers highlighted the importance of being agile to unlocking investments and scale capacity, to plan for the long-term, and to make strategic decisions, fluently.Conclusion: This article adds to the body of knowledge by being one of the first empirical studies to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on omnichannel supply chains in South Africa. In addition, this article adds to the scarce publications on the impact a ‘Black Swan’ event such as the COVID-19 pandemic can have on supply chains and possible ways retailers can react to similar disruptions in future.</jats:p>"

Using the Cameroon Business Climate Survey (BCS) for the year 2016, our analysis shows that there exist substantial differences between the green firms and non-green firms. These differentials include factors such as size and skill workers. We also find some evidence that regulatory framework, skill workers, turnover exporting activities and firm size are consistent variables that influence whether a firm will use green practices in Cameroon.</jats:p>"

The SCM strategy has enhanced supplier-customer collaboration and integration in the delivery of product/service to ultimate customers, while the enabling role of technology speeds up the information and product flow. The effectiveness and efficiency emanating from supply chain management is a manifestation of enterprises’ inclusive concern of value-creation from economic, environmental and social attributes, also referred as triple-bottom line (TBL). Such enterprises are streamlined as they utilise resources sparingly and produced less waste. Hence, they are lean, resilient and possess capacity to withstand disruptions. These qualities are derived from green initiatives and render these enterprises’ competitiveness and sustainability. This is change management through which conventional supply chain management transforms into green supply chain management (GSCM) by refocusing value-creation in embracing the triple-bottom line that drives the competiveness and sustainability of enterprises.</jats:p>"

Engagement with technology‐based SMEs as possible suppliers can be constrained by institutions (e.g., rules, regulations, and norms of conduct) embodied in the buying organization's procurement and supply chain strategy, processes, and practices. Although prior research has examined how institutional forces influence supplier‐enabled innovation, little is known about institutional failures that are particularly germane to innovative SMEs and impede collaboration between these SMEs and buying organizations. Consistent with the focus of the second emerging discourse incubator (EDI) on researching the effects of institutions (e.g., regulations) and public policies on supply chains, we investigate how enacted innovation policies address SME‐specific institutional failures in a public sector context, that of the English National Health Service (NHS). Our qualitative research reveals that public agencies responsible for policy enactment seek to promote SME supplier‐enabled innovation in the supply chain through institutional change and mitigation, SME connectivity to supply chain actors, and SME supplier development support. We synthesize our findings into a research model and set of propositions which theorize on the specific mechanisms underpinning the interventions of policy‐enacting agencies and their effects. Our study contributes to the literature on supplier‐enabled innovation and to research focusing on collaboration between buyers and innovative small suppliers. More broadly, we generate theoretical insights regarding the role of public agencies enacting policy as a class of non‐firm actors whose interventions influence the supply chain. The findings also add to our understanding of the interplay between supply chains and institutions.</jats:p>",

This transformation makes it possible to increase the efficiency, availability, quality, and cost-efficiency of the value-making chain, while the energy consumption and the GHG emission can be decreased. Within the frame of this chapter, the authors introduce the most important Industry 4.0 technologies and Internet of Things tools and demonstrate their potentials to update supply chain operations. This update of conventional operations can lead to greener and more sustainable purchasing, production, and distribution processes. The successful future of the green supply chain is based on a wide range of factors, like production management, logistics management, societal and regulatory environment. However, the Industry 4.0 technologies are expected to strongly influence the whole supply chain performance positively. This chapter aims to explore the potentials of Industry 4.0 technologies and the transformation of conventional supply chain solutions into cyber-physical systems, especially from a municipal waste collection point of view. The research findings can provide useful insights for supply chain experts, manufacturing, and service companies.</jats:p>"

Assuming that the wells are located symmetrically around the tank and directly connected to it, we derived analytically the distance between tank and wells, which minimizes the total cost. Then we compared the minimum cost of this well layout, with that of placing one well at the location of the tank and the rest symmetrically around it. Finally, we dropped any assumption on well layout, we considered that wells are connected to the tank using a minimum spanning tree and we optimized well locations and flow rates using genetic algorithms. For up to 8 wells, the resulting minimum cost is comparable to that of the symmetrical cases, even when the optimal well layout is quite different. Moreover, the analytical solution, derived for the symmetrical case, can serve to evaluate solutions achieved by sophisticated optimization techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Global production networks that took shape to optimise costs and efficiency often contain hidden vulnerabilities — and external shocks exploit those weaknesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed existing challenges across business operations and thrust an organisation’s ability to adapt to dramatic shifts in supply and demand into the spotlight. However, even before COVID-19, a multitude of events in recent years temporarily disrupted production at many companies. All of this is occurring against a backdrop of changing cost structures across countries and growing adoption of revolutionary digital technologies in global manufacturing. Organisations need a new approach to manage risk and build resiliency. This research highlights the many options for strengthening value chain resilience in response to risk and evaluates strategies to minimise the growing cost of disruption, including opportunities arising from new technologies, strengthening risk management capabilities and improving transparency, building redundanc, reducing product complexity, and improving the financial and operational capacity to respond to shocks and recover quickly from them.</jats:p>"

With transparency and access to real-time data provided by a TMS, shippers can develop smarter strategies, make quicker decisions and stay ahead of trends to ensure on-time delivery and meet operational goals. With vaccines going into arms, it is time to look toward the post-pandemic world and how TMS and the control tower approach fit into the future of the logistics and supply chain industry. This paper sets out many of the processes and practices that emerged to keep goods moving during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely here to stay. For example, consumers will continue to expect seamless transparency in shipping operations, freight transit and delivery. Having visibility through a TMS and the control tower approach can help shippers take action in a world forever changed by the pandemic. They can use the data and insight gained from a TMS to improve performance throughout the supply chain and identify opportunities to reduce costs. Shippers can undertake network optimisation studies to develop Plan B scenarios to get shipments to destinations around the world. They can find alternatives to congested ports to move product more quickly. In addition, shippers can leverage transloading service providers with TMS and control tower capabilities to find faster ways to transport products when disruptions occur — and have 24/7 visibility to their products to the very last mile.</jats:p>"

However, little is known of populist attitudes in contexts in which these supply-side factors are not salient. The present article diverges from the conception of populism that sees it as being activated or fuelled by contextual factors and, rather, conceives populism as an ideological attitudinal dimension that can have an impact on vote choice when supply-side factors are not salient. Using the particular context of the 2015 Canadian federal election as a case to test this theory, empirical analyses support this conception of populism by demonstrating that populist attitudes can be relatively prominent and even impact vote choice in a setting in which the traditional supply-side factors to activate or fuel populism are not salient. Ultimately, populism is shown to be an important demand-side attitudinal dimension even when there is little or no fertile ground for it.</jats:p>",

In the textile and apparel industries, social, environmental, and sustainability issues are frequent causes for concern, highlighting the need for effective traceability solutions. Blockchain technology has characteristics that make it attractive for supply chain traceability applications. However, the literature lacks discussion of empirical cases. We discuss current blockchain applications in the textile and apparel industries and analyze an exemplar of a prominent blockchain traceability solution adopted by a world-leading fiber producer, the Lenzing group. In this study, we identify two related objectives for traceability-product authentication and supply chain sustainability. The case study analysis has stimulated a rich discussion about the different levels of traceability achievable across the supply chain, the digital identification of products, and the extension of blockchain solutions across the whole supply network. Significant technical and business challenges exist in extending traceability to the upstream raw material supply chain and to the dispersed garment manufacturing networks downstream. More broadly, the study highlights the need to (1) clarify the objectives of a traceability initiative, and (2) scope a traceability solution appropriately, both horizontally across the supply chain and vertically with respect to the granularity of the items traced.</jats:p>"

Environmental issues have become an important integration into the supply chain management, so that each step from organization’s materials management and transportation functions to the end customer can be structured to include environmental awareness. The authors analyze the levels of application of GSCM in waste management value chain of Ghana and use our house-to-house waste collection model as case. Review of the social, environmental and economic impacts made by waste EcoCare and other solid waste management companies that incorporate circularity – at least a recovery and recycling channel at some point – into their service shows are setting a pace for understanding, adoption and replication of green supply chain management (GSCM) into waste management in the country. The authors recommend that private-public-partnerships for waste management in Goaso and other cities would be greener if they replicated the circular economy model implemented by EcoCare Waste Initiative and its H2H Waste Collection model.</jats:p>"

A new MSU has been designed and is expected to be fully mission capable and operational by the 2023 season, which is expected to increase the productivity from 2,000 squares/day up to 8,000 squares/day with double shifts and optimal conditions. This MSU supply study identifies and optimizes the supply chain logistics for increased production rates from the mat fields to the MSU. The production rates investigated for this effort are 2,000 squares/day, 4,000 squares/day, and 6,000 squares/day. RiskyProject® software, which utilizes a Monte Carlo method to determine a range of durations, manpower, and supplies based on logical sequencing is used for this study. The study identifies several potential supply and demand issues with the increased daily production rates. Distance to casting fields, number of barges, and square availability are the major issues to supply increased placement rates identified by this study.</jats:p>"

Currently, there is no systematic analysis of how the judiciary in Australia navigate the relationship between different types of supply and the consistency and proportionality of the sentence applied. This analysis maps out how current sentencing practices respond to offenders involved in ‘social supply’ and ‘minimally commercial supply’ who are charged with drug trafficking. It makes recommendations that could inform future drug law reform, including that review is needed of the system of thresholds; that sentencing objectives of general and specific deterrence be reconsidered in cases of social supply and minimally commercial supply; and that consideration be given to expanding the scope of current diversion programs to accommodate the needs of the types of offenders and offending behaviour addressed in this study.</jats:p>"

However, less is understood about the effect of unilateral commitments, when one party (the <jats:italic>committer</jats:italic>) makes a relationship‐specific investment without an established current or forthcoming reciprocal commitment by the other party (the <jats:italic>recipient</jats:italic>). This problem is particularly relevant in the supply chain management domain, where organizations often make investments in their supply chain partners, and frequently assume great risks in doing so. To help organizations understand how they can initiate unilateral commitments to their benefit, we develop theory regarding the outcomes of unilateral commitments based on their temporal duration. We evaluate our hypothesis using data collected from three distinct studies, each using different methodologies and samples: a laboratory experiment of graduate students, a vignette experiment of operations management practitioners, and a secondary data analysis of baseball contracts. We find compelling support that unilateral commitments of shorter duration successfully drive <jats:italic>recipient</jats:italic> cooperative behavior; however, a significant decrease in <jats:italic>recipient</jats:italic> cooperation results from longer term unilateral commitments. Our research contributes broadly to the literature on unilateral commitments, and in particular its manifestation within supply chain management, where this research stands to make substantial impact due to the prevalence of unilateral commitments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition : We analyze a contract in which a supplier who is exposed to disruption risk offers a supply-flexibility contract comprising of a wholesale price and a minimum-delivery fraction (“flexibility” fraction) to a buyer facing random demand. The supplier is allowed to deviate below the order quantity by at most the flexibility fraction. The supplier’s regular production is subject to random disruption, but she has access to a reliable expedited supply source at a higher marginal cost. Academic/practical relevance : Despite the prevalence of supply-flexibility contracts in practice, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous academic literature examining the optimal design of supply-flexibility contracts. As such, the level of flexibility in practice is usually set on an ad-hoc basis, with buyers typically reluctant to share risk with suppliers. Our analysis of supply-flexibility contracts informs practice in two ways: First, using analytically supported arguments, it educates managers on the effects of their decisions on the economic outcomes. Second, it shows that the supply-flexibility contract benefits both the supplier and the buyer, regardless of which player chooses how supply risk is allocated in the supply chain. Methodology : Non-cooperative game theory, non-convex optimization. Results : We derive the supplier-led optimal contract and show that supply chain efficiency improves relative to the price-only contract. More interestingly, even though the buyer lets the supplier decide how the two share supply risk, profits of both the players increase by the introduction of flexibility into the contract. Further, supply flexibility may be even more valuable for the buyer compared with the supplier. Interestingly, the flexibility fraction is not monotone in supplier reliability and a more reliable supplier may even prefer to transfer more risk to the buyer. The robustness of these findings is established on two extensions: one where we study a buyer-led contract (i.e., the buyer chooses the flexibility fraction) and the other where the expedited supply option is available to both the supplier and the buyer. Managerial implications : The supply-flexibility contract is mutually beneficial for both players and yet retains all the advantages of the price-only contract—it is easy to implement, it requires minimal operational and administrative burden, and there is evidence of the use of such contracts in practice. While our focus is not on supply chain coordination, we note that the combination of two mechanisms—the supply-flexibility contract derived in this paper to share supply risk and a buyback contract to share demand risk—yields a coordinating contract. </jats:p>",

This research investigates supply chain plasticity and a corresponding unique strategy—operational repurposing. Resource dependence theory and social network theory are used to assess the effects of firms’ network positions on firm engagement in operational repurposing. Social network analysis and econometric models are utilized to analyze 426 995 supply chain contractual relationships and 64,750 CEO network relationships embedded in 136 firms. The results show that in both supply chain and CEO networks, entrepreneurial network position increases a firm's likelihood to repurpose existing operations, while prominent position reduces it. Furthermore, CEO entrepreneurial network position enhances the positive relationship between supply chain entrepreneurial network position and the likelihood of repurposing. This research provides a deeper understanding of how structural networks affect a firm's supply chain plasticity. It helps industry and policy leaders identify suitable firms to prepare their supply chains in the event repurposing is required.</jats:p>",

It was experimentally established that for the transport time of 6 … 36 hours the stratification of the density of the drilling fluid by the depth of the cargo tank is 3.04 … 32.04 %. As a method that ensures minimal stratification of the density of the drilling fluid during its transportation, it is proposed to use additional X-shaped circulation of the drill slurry in the volume of adjacent cargo tanks. Studies have confirmed that the density stratification for the time period of 6 … 36 hours decreases to the range of 2.30 … 9.01 %. The integrated use of additional X-shaped circulation and simultaneous air supply to the bottom of the cargo tank provides a value of density stratification of 0.73 … 2.93 %.</jats:p>",

The analysis is based on a comparative analysis of the input-output tables of France, Italy, Spain and Croatia in 2005, 2010 and 2015 published by the OECD. The analysis is performed in three steps. In the first step, an analysis based on a technical coefficient matrix is made of the structure of accommodation and food service industries supply chains in four Mediterranean countries. The second step includes the calculation of the industry’s direct import dependence. The third step compares the effects of backward linkages of inputs. Results provide an insight into the factors that determine the different abilities of economies to generate added value and indicate the possibility of increasing the added value of tourism without increasing its physical volume.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The emergence of a new pandemic, known as COVID-19, has touched various sections of the supply chain (SC). Since then, numerous studies have been conducted on the issue, but the need for a holistic review study that highlights the gaps and limits of previous research, as well as opportunities and agendas for future studies, is palpable. Through a systematic literature review on blockchain technology (BCT) deployment in supply-chain management (SCM) concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, this research seeks to add to the content of previous studies and to enlighten the path for future studies. Relevant papers were found using a variety of resources (Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ProQuest). Seventy-two articles were systematically selected, considering the PRISMA procedure, and were thoroughly analyzed based on BCT, methodologies, industrial sectors, geographical, and sustainability context. According to our findings, there is a significant lack of empirical and quantitative methodologies in the literature. The majority of studies did not take specific industries into account. Furthermore, the articles focusing on the sustainability context are few, particularly regarding social and environmental issues. In addition, most of the reviewed papers did not consider the geographical context. The results indicate that the deployment of BCT in several sectors is not uniform, and this utilization is reliant on their services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the concentration of research on the impacts of the BCT on SCM differs according to the conditions of various countries in terms of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also show that there is a direct relationship between the deployment of BCT and sustainability factors, such as economic and waste issues, under the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Finally, this study offers research opportunities and agendas to help academics and other stakeholders to gain a better knowledge of the present literature, recognize aspects that necessitate more exploration, and drive prospective studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Aim: Nationally, there has always been a gap between the demand for beef and its supply, although supply growth is proportional with demand growth and even exceeds it in some regions in Indonesia. This research study aims to measure the sustainability status of the beef supply chain and applies the developed measurement system to a specific beef supply chain by identifying suitable indicators and their scale. Moreover, this research study provides some recommendations for the improvement of the sustainability status of the beef supply chain.\n\nMaterials and Methods: In this research study, 11 and nine indicators were analyzed to assess the sustainability status of the beef supply chain at the farm and slaughterhouse chain levels. A rapid appraisal for beef supply chain was applied to rapidly assess the sustainability status of beef supply chains using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The Delphi method was utilized as an iterative process to collect data and obtain consensus of experts' judgments regarding the policies that should be implemented to improve the most sensitive indicator affecting the economic, social, and environmental dimensions.\n\nResults: Analysis of ordination with MDS shows the regional sustainability index value for multidimensional approaches of beef cattle farms and beef slaughterhouses. The sustainability index value for beef cattle farms was 56.14 (moderately sustainable), 48.02 (fairly unsustainable), and 48.77 (fairly unsustainable) in Semarang, Sragen, and Boyolali, respectively. Moreover, the sustainability index value for beef slaughterhouses was 47.05 (fairly unsustainable), 54.83 (moderately sustainable), and 54.19 (moderately sustainable) in Semarang, Sragen, and Boyolali, respectively. Policy recommendation was focused on the basis of the results of leverage analysis, which highlighted the most indicative factor affecting sustainability for each dimension.\n\nConclusion: Measurement results revealed that the achievement of beef supply chain sustainability requires targeted efforts through the deployment of several policies as the current status of sustainability in beef farms and beef slaughterhouses was only inclined toward moderately sustainable and fairly unsustainable. Although all the surveyed regions in this study can meet the regional needs of beef meat on their own and even distribute the excess to other regions, none of the beef supply chains of the surveyed region indicated good sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s highly changing external environment, such as global interest rates and exchange rates, and the changing relationship between the two parties in international trade, the international trade supply chain is gradually mature and stable. In particular, remarkable progress in the development of various products related to supply chain finance (SCF) has been established thanks to the innovation of IT technology including the Internet network. Moreover, supply chain finance (SCF) has shown a breakthrough in the development of product concept and operation mode innovations in the international market with the continuous improvement of Internet technology. The top 50 global banks have all started SCF business. Meanwhile, European and American countries are developing fast, whereas China is still in its infancy in which a certain gap currently exists. However, China obtains a critical position in global supply chain, especially the manufacturing industry occupying a large proportion. Facing huge demand, many of China’s multinational manufacturing industries have been in a weak position in financing and are facing pressure on capital turnover. The ‘One Belt and One Road’ project, a land and sea road network connecting Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, which is the ‘21st century version of the Silk Road’ launched by the Chinese government in 2015, could be a great opportunity to Chinese companies. Still, one of the main reasons for not being able to be fully benefited from it can be found in the sluggish supply chain finance. With the tightening of liquidity caused by the deleveraging of supervision, the generalized SCF will build a stable liquidity tool for core enterprises, primary and secondary suppliers, and more upstream and downstream small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Moreover, it will help build a better environment of the industrial chain and thus promote the reform of the financial ecology of the supply chain. Using data of the manufacturing enterprises listed on China’s SMEs Board from 2013 to 2019, this study uses the cash-cashflow sensitivity model to empirically test the financing constraints of SMEs and the role of SCF in alleviating these constraints. From the internal individual characteristics of enterprises and external financial environment, this study introduces enterprise information transparency, external financing cost, and financial development level as moderating variables for further investigation. In the supply chain of multinational corporations, the more peripheral in the supply chain they are, the stronger financial constraints they face . This is due to the fact that in the supply chain of China-based multinational companies engaged in manufacturing, the longer the inventory cycle is, the higher the current debt ratio is, and the standardization of corporate management is insufficient. This study examines the difference in financing constraints of different types of enterprises and the varying alleviating effects of SCF on their financing constraints, and carries out a robustness test on the empirical results.\r\nThrough empirical analysis, this paper draws the following conclusions: Information transparency and financial development level negatively regulate the mitigating effect of SCF on enterprise financing constraints. In contrast, external financing costs positively regulate the mitigating effect of SCF on enterprise financing constraints.</jats:p>",

The main attention in the work is focused on the relationship between the economic activity of population and wages. The objectives of the work are, firstly, to identify differences in the behavior of men and women in the labor market in terms of economic activity, and, secondly, to test the hypothesis on the relationship between the economic activity of population and wages. The article provides an overview of the factors affecting the size of labor force and the level of participation in it, as well as statistical data reflecting male and female economic activity in modern Russia. Analysis of the labor activity dynamics leads to the conclusion that there are significant differences in male and female behavior in the labor market. The main cause of these differences is the traditional views of the population on the roles of men and women in society. Also the regression equations connecting the level of economic activity with the average real wage are determined both for the population of the Russian Federation as a whole, and for men and women separately. These equations can be considered as modified functions of the labor supply. Calculations have shown that, despite the general linear nature of the dependence of the economic activity level of population on real wages, its growth leads, ceteris paribus, to an accelerating increase in the activity of men and a slowing increase in the activity of women. The revealed low elasticity of labor supply functions indicates that any significant impact on the level of labor activity can only be provided by significant increase in real wages. First of all, the last statement applies to women.</jats:p>",

However, it is largely unknown the scenarios of agricultural practice and food supply over the years. To understand the fact, this study was designed to explore the agricultural land use changes and domestic food supply for last 50 years in Malaysia. The result showed that oil palm plantation area and yield, both are increased by folds, conforming &amp;ldquo;oil palm&amp;rdquo; mono-culture practice. Rice cultivation area remained almost unchanged but the yield increased. However, both area of plantation and yield in case of rubber, coca and coconut were decreased. When, it comes to domestic food supply, in 1973 food grain (Rice, Wheat, Maize) import was lower than domestic production. However, the import increased more than 3 times than the domestic production in 2013. Domestic production of vegetables and vegetables import was almost 50:50. Fruits import increased almost 3 times of domestic production, though domestic production was increased. In conclusion, it is understood that Malaysian agriculture economy is standing on &amp;ldquo;oil palm&amp;rdquo; wearers domestic food supply is import dependent. It is high time to reshuffle the policy for sustainable development and achieving food sovereignty.</jats:p>"

The case study presented here focuses on indigenous ‘superfood’ fruits from the forests of Senegal's Casamance region. Traidcraft Exchange has worked in partnership with two local processing SMEs and 2,200 small-scale producers in the Casamance to develop transparent and fair supply chains for these fruits. The work was catalysed by, but is not limited to, the development of a new range of Fair Trade juice drinks for the UK market. The case study highlights some of the achievements and challenges faced by the programme, particularly with reference to its post-conflict setting. It situates the work within the broader context of the ‘leave no one behind’ agenda and explores how a trade-based programme has contributed towards this aim. Of particular note here are the development of social capital, small producer negotiating power and improved value chain coordination.</jats:p>",

At the outset of 2021, as the decade of action to deliver the sustainable development goals (SDG) by 2030 gets underway, Ikuru Town is not on track to achieve Goals 6 (clean water and sanitation). Assessment of the Ikuru water supply project involved two ways. visitation to the treatment plant to observe the condition of the facility and use of the unstructured interview. Water samples were collected after treatment from the user point. Sampling was repeated three times on three different days. Physicochemical and microbial qualities of water samples were analyzed, using the standard for examination of water and wastewater by APHA. Results showed that total coliform bacteria were present in the water sample. Iron concentration was above the WHO limit. The concentration of manganese was above the recommended level and Iron bacteria were also present after treatment. In conclusion, the water is not potable and palatable due to its objectionable taste and orange brown colour. Therefore, there is needs for drastic treatment of Ikulu community water project at the point source using shock chlorination as a recommended method to improve its performance level. Moreover, supportive intervention is required from governmental institutions to overcome the challenges of this water project for sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>•There are more, bigger, better, dwellings per capita in Australia in 2021 compared to any point in history.•Multiple government inquiries at all levels over the past two decades have ostensibly sought to find the cause of house prices hidden in the pages of local zoning laws. •Dwellings are assets and are priced based on financial market conditions. •Density (dwellings per unit of land) and the rate of supply (new dwellings per period of time) are conceptually different but often confused in housing supply discussions.•This submission argues that market housing supply has exceeded household demand. State planning systems have flexibly accommodated new supply while regulating the location of different types of dwellings. •Compared to household incomes and rents, the cost of buying a home (measured by mortgage payments) in 2021 is historically cheap. This is due to lower interest rates and is why intercensal homeownership is expected to rise in 2021. However, asset price adjustments will mean that this situation will not persist. •Taxes on property are efficient and fair and do not add to housing costs but rather subtract from property values.•Affordable housing is cheap housing. Cheaper housing means lower rents and prices. Any “affordability” policy that reduces market prices will remove billions in landlord revenues each year, transferring that value to tenants, and trillions in housing asset values, with that value transferred to future buyers. •Fostering parallel non-market housing systems, just as public healthcare provides a non-market medical system, can be an effective way to improve housing affordability. •There are no local, international, or historical examples of planning reforms leading to cheaper housing. Indeed, a Productivity Commission review concluded “given the small size of net additions to housing in any year relative to the size of the stock, improvements to land release or planning approval procedures, while desirable, could not have greatly alleviated the price pressures of the past few years.” (p154)</p>"

This context was selected because these regions are prone to regular natural disruptions, and these food supply chains also play a crucial role in the disaster relief process. The data revealed that effective communication, mutual dependence, information sharing, informal financial support, and trust are some of the components of supply chain collaboration that enhance the overall resilience of supply chains in natural disasters.</jats:p>"

Because of the adaptable and flexible manufacturing and material handling solutions, the design and control of these processes require new models and methods, especially from a real-time control point of view. Within the frame of this article, a new real-time optimization algorithm for in-plant material supply of smart manufacturing is proposed. After a systematic literature review, this paper describes a possible structure of the in-plant supply in matrix production environment. The mathematical model of the mentioned matrix production system is defined. The optimization problem of the described model is an integrated routing and scheduling problem, which is an NP-hard problem. The integrated routing and scheduling problem are solved with a hybrid multi-phase black hole and flower pollination-based metaheuristic algorithm. The computational results focusing on clustering and routing problems validate the model and evaluate its performance. The case studies show that matrix production is a suitable solution for smart manufacturing.</jats:p>"

By constructing game model in which logistics provider is a leader, OEM and remanufacturer are the equal status followers, we solve chain members’ optimal services decision-making. Finally, we analyze influence of service elasticities and intensities of service competition of two manufacturers on members’ equilibrium decision-making.</jats:p>"

Over extraction and changing climate have put additional pressure to maintain water sustainability. Therefore, there is a need for proper planning of utilization and management of water resources. Recently, virtual water trade has received much attention and become an important tool for balancing the water budget. On the other hand, virtual water trade may also adversely affect the water balance of the exporter's country as well as the economy. Analysis of the virtual water trade with its implications for water resources is missing; hence, there is a need for such analysis that will help in management of water resources. In this study an attempt is made to present a quantitative analysis of the virtual water trade and its implications for water sustainability.

In this regard, many developed countries have failed to implement a framework to ensure that project success is met through newly available technologies and business initiatives to ensure the user is the most important beneficiary. This review paper provides a review of international research relating to the life cycle, firm-level operations, and collaborative business models of infrastructure projects. The review initially identified the importance that understanding key phases and procurement models has on the efficiency of a project’s life cycle. A key indicator of the likelihood of good performance across a supply chain lies with the ability to understand the efficiencies of the firm-level operations. The literature has noted that successful projects are able to perform well across an organizations end-to-end involvement and be able to share risks among mature organizations. This paper provides a review of how a collaborative business model can benefit a project lifecycle and firm-level operations. The global research currently has identified the need for a collaborative approach that reduces the risk within all organizations through common goals, effective end-to-end project systems and consideration of the entire project lifecycle. The paper provides a detailed review of international practices in an infrastructure supply chain that have the potential to address New Zealand’s infrastructure project failures.</jats:p>"

The study also found that irrespective of the huge decline in the rate of shipping/oil tanker transportation brought about by low demand in comparison with supply; shipping/oil tanker was patronized by dealers for the purpose of storage of products. Also, the study found that seaborne trade fell downward from above 3% to below a negative 8% and at a bdp rate of 100m, the demand was 3% higher than the global supply which in 2019 was at about 97%. However, in the second quarter of 2020 the supply leads demand at over 28M bdp and a 13% increase in the demand year-on-year when compared to a fall of 3.9% in the supply year-on-year.&#x0D;\nRecommendation: The study recommends that appropriate forecasting methods and proper liaison with global health will aid in averting or ameliorating the risks and negative impacts brought on shipping/oil tanker market by covid-19.</jats:p>"

It was modelled by using ratio of credit to SMEs to total credit (CSTC) as dependent variable while monetary policy rate (MPR), liquidity ratio (LQR), lending rate (LDR) and inflation (INF) were the explanatory variables. Secondary data were sourced from CBN Statistical Bulletin and the estimation was done using Auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL). The study found that monetary policy has negative and insignificant effects on credit supply to SMEs in the long run while in the short run, monetary policy has though insignificant positive but indirectly a significant positive effect through lending rate on credit available to SMEs. The implication is that, as MPR changes its effects are transmitted through lending rates of commercial banks to SMEs. Hence, the study concluded that monetary policy significantly and heterogeneously impacts on the credit supply to SMEs indirectly through lending rate in Nigeria. It was recommended among others that as the Central Bank of Nigeria continues to implement monetary policy in Nigeria, caution should be taken so that such decisions won’t be detrimental to businesses such as SMEs. In addition, MPR should be further reviewed downward in order to encourage SMEs from assessing more funds in Nigeria. Likewise, a pool of long-term funds should be created By Central Bank of Nigeria to bridge the financing gap of SMEs in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

As materials were studied the official websites of pharmaceutical manufacturers in Morocco, policy documents of industrial pharmaceutical associations, specialized pharmaceutical press of Morocco, educational resources of Morocco and France. As a result, it was found that the pharmaceutical industries of Morocco and Russia are already interacting with each other: BIOCAD supplies high-tech drugs and production technologies to Morocco, Morocco has placed an order with R-Pharm for the purchase of a vaccine against COVID-19, produced under the license of AstraZeneca, and also ordered a million doses of Sputnik V vaccine. Morocco is one of the fastest growing countries in the Middle East and Africa with an economy of $119 billion, a population of 37 million,andtotalhealthspendingof5.5%ofGDP.Expendituresforhealthcarearequitehigh-53.6%oftotalfamilyexpenditures. 31.7% of total health care expenditure is spent on drug purchases. The pharmaceutical industry in Morocco began to develop in 1960 after the end of the French protector and the introduction of the obligation to localize drugs sold in Morocco by foreign pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry in Morocco is represented by 51 factories, which cover 2/3 of the country’s drug needs. Mostly generics are produced, 10% of production is exported. The volume of the issue is $1.68 billion (2nd place in Africa). The products are of high quality and certified according to European standards. Morocco is endeavoring to transform its pharmaceutical industry into a strategic asset for influencing African countries through the creation of an «African House of Medicines» based in Morocco, which is the manufacturing and logistics center for medicines in Africa. The main documents regulating the pharmaceutical industry are: Law No. 17-04 of 2006. “Code of Medicines and Pharmacy” and Order of the Minister of Health No. 902-08 5654 of 2008. “Requirements for the premises of pharmaceutical organizations.” Thus, we conclude that the Kingdom is a regional leader with ambitious plans and a large backlog that needs new technologies, markets for pharmaceutical products, a large number of qualified personnel, high-tech drugs at affordable prices. The intensification of cooperation between Russia and Morocco will help both countries to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing pharmaceutical market in Africa.</jats:p>",

The assessment took just over a year and consisted of five phases of analysis using a methodology aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). However, the onset of Italy’s severe first wave of coronavirus in 2020 meant that the assessment team was unable to conduct the field study phase with the full rigour required of an HRIA.

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Our society has become accustomed to demanding energy whenever we want it. When decarbonising the energy system, this becomes a fundamental challenge due to the extent of energy storage required for matching the intermittent renewable supply to society's current demand. Available energy storage technologies are energetically expensive either to build - like batteries -  or to operate - like synthetic fuels. Due to these energetic costs, requiring more storage leads to a slower energy transition and consequently higher climate risks. This paper explores the energy implications of adding energy storage to fast and complete energy transition pathways. Technological innovation can mitigate the problem to some extent by focusing on reduced energy intensity of storage alongside with improved turnaround efficiency. Most influential is, however, the extent of storage that we want: reducing storage demand greatly accelerates the transition and therefore reduces the induced probability of violating 1.5°C peak heating. In addition, it can immediately be implemented with readily available and scalable technologies. However, it requires a fundamental rethinking of the way we use energy in society: aligning energy demand with renewable supply as best as we can. Following the course of the sun, just like sunflowers do, we need to schedule our most energy-intensive activities around midday and summer, while reducing demand during night and winter. The sunflower society has the potential to accelerate climate action and therewith reduce climate risks.</p>"

Based on the survey data of 185 manufacturing enterprises in Tianjin, the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fs QCA) method is used to explore the synergistic mechanism of government policy, supply chain partnership, information sharing, risk avoidance, and intelligence degree on supply chain integration and the interaction among them. The results show that: (1) a single factor does not constitute a necessary condition for promoting supply chain integration, but the formation and development of supply chain partnership plays a universal role in promoting supply chain integration; (2) the “multiple concurrent” of five factors constitute the diversified configuration of a driving supply chain integration path, that is, the driving supply chain integration path has the characteristic of “all roads lead to the same destination”; (3) there is a “sharing” type, a “cooperative” type, and a “cooperative-sharing” type three equivalent path, whereby the formation of supply chain partnership can enhance the trust between manufacturing enterprises and suppliers and customers, increase the transaction frequency of upstream and downstream enterprises, and improve the cooperation efficiency. The utility model can effectively reduce the “long whip” problem caused by the information asymmetry, and improve the operational efficiency and stability of the whole supply chain. The purpose of this study is to inspire manufacturing enterprises in the context of digital supply chain integration to improve the collaborative efficiency of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

This study deals with the development of water resource management policies in Tunisia during the last five decades, starting with supply and mobilization management programs that transferred water resources from the interior to the coastal territories where the most important cities are and most economic activity takes place. This policy resulted in the establishment of an interconnected water system that remained in place until the end of the last century. The study also reviews the success of the demand management system the government has been forced by the increase in both urban consumption of water and agricultural needs to adopt. We also review the many challenges that set the current situation apart from previous periods of stress on the system, including high demand, climate change and social movements in the inner cities demanding the right for water, protected in the 2014 Constitution, be respected. The study highlights these challenges and suggests elements for a new resource governance that would draw on the accumulated good governance of the last five decades</jats:p>",

Furthermore, we analyzed which risks were addressed in the use cases as well as how ML might shape SCRM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review. The results showed that the applied examples relate primarily to the early identification of production, transport, and supply risks in order to counteract potential supply chain problems quickly. Through the analyzed case studies, we were able to identify the added value that ML integration can bring to the SCRM (e.g., the integration of new data sources such as social media or weather data). From the systematic literature analysis results, we developed four propositions, which can be used as motivation for further research.</jats:p>"

In order to evaluate the operation and management of rural water supply projects, a comprehensive indicator system of rural water supply projects sustainable operation and management was established, and a combinational evaluation model based on a cyclic correction framework was used in 13 pilot districts of Chongqing, China. The APH method was used to calculate the weight of each index. The two indexes with the highest weights are ‘establishment of management agency (0.1436)’ and ‘assurance level of operating funds (0.1382)’. Compared with the traditional individual evaluation model, the cyclic correction framework can effectively reduce the systematic deviation and random error in the evaluation process and make the research conclusion more reliable. The ranks of the districts in the main urban metropolitan part are higher, while the districts in the southeast and northeast of Chongqing are ranked relatively low. The top five districts were Rongchang, Yubei, Banan, Liangping, and Tongliang. In the future, the sustainable operation and management of rural water supply projects should be improved by enhancing the ability of the management agencies of rural water supply projects and increasing funding for project operation management.</jats:p>",

Most mountain waters found turbidity higher than 1 NTU, and water quality was unclean to use and drink. This research applied different concentrations of alum doses to observe turbidity reduction. Optimum alum does apply to reduce turbidity for mountain water samples from Hmong, Karen, Lahu, and Lisu for three seasons. The optimum alum dose is between 20 - 40 mg/l in rainy seasons and 10 – 40 mg/l in summer. The cold season was low optimum alum dose at 10 mg/l for all hill tribe villages. Therefore, alum coagulants can be used to treat the mountain water supply and drinking that can implement the main problem of mountain water in hill tribe village.</jats:p>"

Particular care is taken concerning the power supply subsystem (here voltage shifter integrated circuit), which is part of the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) compliance of an imaging equipment embedded on spacecrafts. The proposed methodology aims at two major targets: First, evaluating the Filter Effectiveness (FE) subject concerning varying parameters (including filter topology, parasitic effects and source/load impedance variations); second, quantifying the relative importance of representative equivalent electrical components through sensitivity analyses (nominal and parasitic values). The latter point is of utmost importance considering the expected versatility of such systems, such as manufacturing tolerances, for instance. Nominal values and/or components are often badly defined for confidentiality reasons, lack of knowledge or pure ignorance of inputs. An analytical deterministic formulation (here through the transfer matrix approach) is proposed and completed with an original stochastic strategy (Reduced Order Clustering, ROC). This ensures the reliable assessment of both statistical filter performances and most influential parameters, jointly with computational resources saving relatively to brute force Monte Carlo simulations.</jats:p>"

It has been determined that the effective organization of supply chain management is an important direction of increasing the competitiveness and profitability of enterprises. The main advantages of this management approach and assessment methods (financial, non-financial and quantitative parameters) are specified. The concept of responsible supply chain management, the importance of using this approach by enterprises to support the acquired image in modern conditions of existence are defined. Conditions are presented due to which companies can create a responsibly organized supply chain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on logistics supply and the actions taken by enterprises in the new operating environment are described: improving the flexibility of supply chain strategy, digitalization of the supply chain, building reliable partnerships of supply chain participants.\nKeywords: logistics, enterprise, supply chain, effective supply chain management, responsible supply chain management.</jats:p>",

For my interlocutors, who work to design and promote these standards, surveillance comes to be seen as not only justified but also expected and necessary, leading to the tacit categorization of certain spaces (and the human and non-human actors who populate them) as surveillable. In the case of sustainability standards specifically, which are imposed almost exclusively on producers in the Global South, the notion of surveillable space raises important questions about race and gender.</jats:p>"

By solving continuity and momentum equations in the case of air-water flow for three different cases, it was confirmed that the air concentrations along the ski jet are uniquely linked to the relative black water core length. Results showed that the black water core length is also influenced by the approach flow depth, Froude number, geometrical parameters of ski jump and the chute bottom angle. Finally, an analytical equation is proposed to predict the air concentration distribution along the ski jump jet regarding different hydraulic and geometric parameters. By calculating the velocity profiles along the jet, it showed that increasing the air concentration reduces the jet velocity profile.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: The rapidly expanding interest in the application of big data analytics (BDA) in supply chain management (SCM) among academics and practitioners has prompted an assessment of current research progress in order to define a new agenda. the use of sophisticated analytics tools to improve supply chain management The apps are divided into three categories: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, as well as the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model domains of plan, source, make, deliver, and return. This review answers to the demand by offering a new classification scheme that provides a comprehensive picture of current literature on where and how BDA has been used in SCM. The classification system is based on Mayring's (2008) content analysis method and addresses four research questions: (1) In which aspects of SCM is BDA used? (2) To what extent is BDA employed in these SCM domains in terms of analytics? (3) What are the different types of BDA models utilised in SCM? (4) How are these models developed using BDA techniques? The consideration of these four topics reveals several research gaps, pointing to future study directions. Purpose - Rapid innovation and globalisation have created a plethora of opportunities and choices for businesses and consumers in the marketplace. Due to competitive pressures, sourcing and manufacturing are now done on a global basis, resulting in a huge increase in product availability. The purpose of this article is to determine whether real-time business intelligence (BI) is required in supply chain analytics. Design/methodology/approach – The paper argues for and analyses the benefits and drawbacks of BI. Findings – The article focuses on the need to review the classic BI notion of integrating and consolidating information in an organisation in order to help service-oriented businesses that want to keep their customers. Using a BI methodology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain analytics is a vital component of a company's ability to establish a competitive edge. Originality/value – This study contributes to a better understanding of the difficulties surrounding the usage of business intelligence tools in supply chains.

The results indicated that consumption of fertilizers had been increased at the rate of 4.16 per cent. The demand side determinants like area under irrigation reflected at the rate of 1.42 per cent growth, average minimum support prices showed a growth rate of 7 per cent and a short term institutional credit registered a growth rate of 17 per cent. Area under irrigation and sum of average MSP encourages the fertilizer consumption substantially. The supply side factors viz., production, import and subsidy were influencing the fertilizer consumption significantly. The total fertilizer demand is expected to reach at 57 million tons by 2030 and at the same time, rate of consumption might enhanced to 277 kg per hectare. It is concluded that import is unavoidable to meet the gap between domestic production and total demand.</jats:p>",

In the other remaining State (Osun), LGA (Local Government Authority) had the highest percentage of non-operational facilities of 34.1%. There were more operational facilities in 50% of the States compared to the non-operational.

This is due to the various physical and informational activities that accompany inventory management, primarily the holding and transportation of inventory. Companies are looking to streamline these activities and minimize the associated costs. One of the most coveted models to jointly solve these two problems is the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), which will be the focus of this study. This paper addresses the case of a deterministic replenishment demand in a distribution network consisting of a supplier and a number of customers to be served by a single vehicle over a finite planning horizon. We will first study the impact of increasing supplier lead times on network costs. Then, we will study the effects of the Lateral Transshipment (LT) technique on the overall network cost. A mathematical model is developed and solved by an exact method. The results obtained will show that LT is an effective tool capable of improving the total network cost and balancing the customers’ inventory level.</jats:p>"

The present study investigated the hydraulic characteristics of CCJs on adverse-sloped beds. The results showed that, compared to the horizontal bed, the slope didn't increase the energy dissipation rate of CCJ but reduced the return flow length and upstream depth. The velocity distribution along the depth was divided into the boundary layer region, mixing region, and reverse surface jet region. The velocity distribution in the boundary layer region and the mixing region was similar to the classical wall jet. The jet Froude number and the bed slope had no significant effect on the turbulence intensity distribution and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) distribution of CCJ. The distribution of TKE was similar to that of a submerged jump. The maximum absolute turbulence intensity appeared at exactly half of the maximum velocity. The maximum TKE appeared at the mixing region. Besides, empirical formulas for estimating length scales and maximum velocity attenuation are proposed. The results could provide a reference for the potential application of CCJ in energy dissipation in hydraulic engineering.</jats:p>",

The average inflation rate is used to project the future maintenance, operation and replacement costs. The average interest rate is used to express all the costs in Equivalent Real Annual Cost (ERAC), which is the correct cost form to compare alternatives with different life spans. The pipe diameter, material, pressure rating, surge tank size, and inlet/outlet resistances are the decision variables. A software was compiled with a commercial pipeline software to generate all the possible design alternatives based on the decision variables. Pipe initial cost as well as operation and maintenance costs are computed for each design alternative. The alternative with the least ERAC value is the optimum one. It was found that the approach can lead to substantial savings in pipeline projects cost. For pipes 800 mm in diameter or larger, and when selecting the optimum diameter, savings are between 23 and 27% in the total project cost. When imposing certain pipe material savings in overall cost will be 8.5, 16.3 and 31.3% for ductile iron, GRP and mild steel pipe material, respectively.</jats:p>",

By analyzing both parties’ benefits, we derive the model solution and provide optimal decisions to all petitioners. The results obtained in this paper show that the optimum order quantity under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) criterion declines w.r.t. the confidence level, and the wholesale price of the supplier increases w.r.t. the confidence level. The reason is that when the retailer makes fewer orders, the supplier will correspondingly increase the wholesale price to maximize their profit. On the other hand, the ordering policy with allowing backorder will make the retailer place fewer orders. Finally, the proposed model is indicated by the given numerical experiments.</jats:p>"

Use of blockchain technologies can ensure the efficiency, transparency and reliability of the food supply chain starting from the farms to forks. This study focuses on the applicability of blockchain systems to the agriculture field and provides comparative analysis among the existing methodologies that are dedicated to uplift the security, effectiveness and reliability of blockchain based food supply chains. This research has also proposed a novel model that couples blockchain and IoT based sensor modules, which can be applicable in real-life scenarios. The proposed method essentially follows a multi-layer architecture where each layer is presented by means of a blockchain technology. Each layer is fed by the ambient conditions which may impact better quality of crops. The IoT module will ensure better farming as well as the blockchain system will ensure the quality of the end product. If the packaged food degrades in quality, the reason behind the degradation can be located by the model presented in this paper. The presented framework may reach promising efficiency in practical life but the framework implementation cost may create a burden for the investors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food is more accessible and diverse than ever largely because of the food supply in the global food chain, but also are the challenges to food safety. Contamination risks, regulation differences, traceability gaps, and emerging threats (such as climate change and pandemics) exist. Contamination of one part of the world can quickly affect consumers worldwide, creating health crises and loss of trust, and taking a financial toll on businesses. Some of the major challenges are biological hazards such as Salmonella and Listeria, chemical contamination such as from pesticides and toxins and inadequate traceability systems. The regulations are very much country based and as a result of this we have enforcement gaps and it becomes very hard for business to comply. Food security is also exacerbated by climate change, which changes the way we grow, keep and transport food, and recent events like the COVID 19 pandemic have forcibly demonstrated weaknesses in ability to move and follow food around. On top of that, there’s food fraud: products being intentionally misrepresented to make a buck, at the expense of consumer health. In order to handle these challenges, innovative technologies and global cooperation are necessary. The use of blockchain and IoT helps in increasing traceability and allows the real time monitoring of the food quality. With artificial intelligence, we can predict risks that will happen before they happen, precision farming to ensure they’re sustainable and safer, and waste reduction. But if these solutions are going to be effective, governments and international bodies need to line up their food safety standards and deal with them together. Concluding, this study emphasizes on the collaboration that regulators, businesses and consumers need to come together. Through technology, harmonization of regulations and favoring sustainable practices, the food industry can develop a safer, more transparent and resilient supply chain. Through these efforts, we can safeguard public health, ensure public confidence in consumers, and confront the escalating intricacies of global food systems.</jats:p>"

However, there is a lack of consensus on the definitions of or views about the digital supply chain; thus, researchers in the academic or industrial fields propound various concepts of digital supply chains, which results in confusion during the exchange of opinions or transmission of concepts in many cases. The purpose of this study is to identify the research trends from various articles on the digital supply chain that have been published so far, summarize and analyze the theories and concepts pertaining to it, and review future topics of research. Network text analysis was conducted by extracting information from unstructured text data to identify research trends. The results of the analysis showed that many studies have examined the digital supply chain in terms of sustainable management. “Sustainability” was the most influential word in the keyword network, and the digital transformation of supply chains is essential for the sustainable viability of firms in the era of Industry 4.0 and digital transformation. Many studies have focused on technology for big data analysis and the IoT as technologies to fulfill digital supply chains and maintained that COVID-19 has increased risk factors such as global supply chain disruptions, which is why global firms must monitor the supply chain in real time by securing end-to-end visibility and making corporate-level efforts to build a digital supply chain to instantly detect and deal with related risks. The common groups of keywords were related to “supply chain integration”, “resilience”, “digital technologies”, and “digital transformation”.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the construction industry supply chain management (SCM) is a vital tool in controlling business processes in a defined and a systematic way to improve quality, time management and increase profit. Effective supply chain management has become a potentially valuable method of securing and improving competitive advantage and organizational performance since competition no longer between organizations, but between global organizations and among supply chains. This paper aims to investigate the impact of supply chain management practices on competitive advantage and organizational performance in the construction industry, Sri Lanka, due to the lack of application of supply chain management practices to determine the organizational performance in the competitive environment. Further, this study focuses five SCM practices: strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, level of information sharing, quality of information sharing, and postponement to investigate what supply chain management is, how it works in increase competitive advantage and what are its dynamics. Six hypotheses were developed based on the constructed conceptual framework derived from the supply chain management literature. The data were collected over the survey technique by randomly administering structured questionnaires from 198 respondents of construction management teams and different sub-contractors. First Multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the impact of five supply chain management practices on competitive advantage and organizational performance in the construction industry and the analysis was carried out the factor analysis to explore the significance of supply chain management dimensions. The results of the regression analysis indicated that all SCM variables have a positive impact on competitive advantages and organizational performance of the construction industry in Sri Lanka. Moreover, it suggested that the strategic supplier partnership was the most significant SCM variable which determines the competitive advantage and level of information sharing variable was the less significant variable towards competitive advantage. The results of this study provide new insights to the construction companies to better understand the significant role that SCM variables play in respect to the competitive advantages and organizational performance in Sri Lanka. The study has outlined to examine the five SCM variables in construction industry. Hence future study can be outlined to further examine the impact of SCM on competitive advantages in other industries. Moreover, the future study can be outlined to further examine the impact of SCM variables in different dimensions especially including customer perspective in respect to human variables. Besides, this study was based on the limited large scale construction companies operated in Sri Lanka and ignore the small and medium scale supermarkets.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Supply chain management practices, Competitive advantage, Organizational performance</jats:p>"

SCV is possible via the exchange of information about materials in the supply chain. Prior academic research has highlighted the importance of SCV. However, the literature lacks the detailed definition of visibility that can be easily applied to projects. This research reviewed prior studies on SCV and adopted an appropriate definition that supports relevant decision-making on industrial construction projects. From this definition, the research objective is to develop detailed operational definitions of information needed to support supply chain decisions on industrial construction projects. The study employed mixed methods that consisted of interviews, review of mini-cases of industrial projects, procurement and material tracking tool assessment, and group discussions in structured workshops with a panel of subject matter experts. The research developed 79 detailed information needs and associated definitions that support ten key supply chain decision areas across detailed design, procurement, and construction phases of industrial construction projects. These definitions were evaluated by multiple means including an external team and a case study of an industrial construction project. The definitions developed by this research will enable both researchers and practitioners to invest in better measurements of visibility and support development of new tools and techniques.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">It is important that real estate space planning be highly responsive to workforce planning. As workforce demographics, behaviours and needs change, real estate should support these changes accordingly. Pre-pandemic, there were many organisations which over-provisioned space (eg 1:1 people to seats, high ratios of individual to collaboration space, low utilisation) and operated in a business-as-usual approach when it came to facility planning. Innovative real estate solutions are rooted in a thorough understanding of the workforce and are designed to reflect how an organisation needs to work to be successful. The pandemic has revealed that a greater level of job flexibility is sustainable and desirable for many, meaning that workplace strategies will account for a broad spectrum of work locations and arrangements moving forward. With this added complexity, conducting workforce segmentation analysis is a key first step toward a more defined plan for real estate needs. This paper articulates the benefits of using workforce segmentation as a tool to support real estate decision making. In addition, it outlines a segmentation process that organisations can institute to memorialise the unique needs of their employees and better gauge how their workplace can support them. Finally, it provides examples of how organisations have leveraged the segmentation process to better understand the demand for space and accurately evaluate footprint requirements and long-term strategies.</jats:p>"

Therefore, increasing attention to the development of industry and industrial policy is one of the main trends in the modern world economy. The purpose of the paper – to analyze the sustainable development of industrial enterprises of Ukraine from the standpoint of security, using a system-structural approach. Methodology. The concept of sustainable development is a management structure that contains a general system view of the ways of transition from the current position of the object of management to the desired, includes the following steps: defining the structure of sustainable development; defining the boundaries of safe existence; identification of the level of sustainability of supply chains; identification of imbalances of sustainable development; to substantiate the methodical approach to estimating the level of sustainability of supply chains of industrial enterprises with the use of economic and mathematical tools; determining the impact of threats and developing institutional measures. The results of the study revealed disparities in sustainable development at the level of economic, social and environmental security of the enterprise, at the level of subordinate components and at the level of indicators that determine the list of major threats, which are calculated indicators of social and economic components of sustainable development. To determine the severity of the impact of threats, the coefficients of elasticity of each component and indicator on the integrated index of sustainable development were calculated and ranked, which is the necessary information for the development of priority measures. Practical implications. The dynamics of deviations of current values of integrated indices from their average optimal values determines the importance of threats to the components of sustainable development. Almost all of these industrial enterprises are characterized by complete neglect of the social status of employees, which inhibits economic growth and makes it impossible to develop domestic demand. Under such conditions, the issue of digitalization of business becomes relevant. The digitalization of business has received considerable attention from both academia and the business community, which define digitalization as a focused effort of companies to actively use digital technologies at all levels to optimize internal processes and modify the overall business model.

In most previous studies, the output flow depth has been considered equal to the critical depth. In the rockfill porous media, unlike free surface channels, the fluid weight is exerted to the aggregates in addition to the flow, and therefore, the output flow depth from the rockfill is always greater than the critical depth (flow leaves the rockfill with a specific energy greater than the critical energy), and is expressed as a coefficient (Γ) of the critical depth. In the present study, using dimensional analysis and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and experimental data in different conditions (a total of 178 experimental data for rounded, crashed, Glass artificial materials with rhomboid structure, Glass artificial materials with cubic structure, sandy natural materials), an equation was presented to calculate the mentioned coefficient as a function of the physical characteristics of the rockfill porous media as well as the flow that can be used for all experimental conditions with high accuracy. If the output flow depth is considered to be equal to the critical depth, the mean relative error (MRE) in terms of using the experimental data of the mentioned materials separately and for the data of all the mentioned materials together was equal to 84.40, 83.81, 60.62, 67.68, 74.82 and 69.96%, respectively. In the case of using the proposed equation in the present study, the corresponding values of 5.49, 4.72, 6.24, 4.41, 6.42 and 8.99% were calculated, respectively.</jats:p>",

Using a preterm piglet model of neonatal sepsis induced by<jats:italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</jats:italic>infection, we demonstrate the delicate interplay between immunity and energy metabolism to regulate the host infection response. Circulating glucose levels, glycolysis and inflammatory response to infection are closely connected across the states of tolerance, resistance and immunoparalysis. Further, high parenteral glucose provision during infection induces hyperglycemia, elevated glycolysis and inflammation, leading to lactate acidosis and sepsis, whereas glucose restricted individuals are clinically unaffected with increased gluconeogenesis to maintain moderate hypoglycemia. Finally, pharmacological glycolysis inhibition during normoglycemia enhances bacterial clearance and dampens inflammation but fails to prevent sepsis. Our results uncover how blood glucose controls immune cell metabolism and function, in turn determining the clinical fate of infected preterm neonates. This also questions the current practice of parenteral glucose supply for infected preterm infants.</jats:p>"

The digitization and flexibility of the supply chain are of great value in obtaining the sustainable development of the supply chain. When dealing with an uncertain environment and market risk, current supply chain flexibility not only functions through its internal organizational flexibility, but also through collaborative creation and an extended supply chain network which will proactively form a replenishment supply sub-chain driven by the need for change responsiveness. This article constructs an associated model consisting of digitization, supply chain flexibility, and sustainability using an empirical analysis method to explore the implicit correlation of these factors. The analysis results of the mediating effect model show that both digitization and flexibility have significant positive effects on the sustainable development of the supply chain.

The determination of the environmental fragility was carried out based on the integration of geological, pedological, geomorphological characteristics and land use, using the emergent fragility and Natural Vulnerability to Soil Loss methods. Most of the Iraí River basin was classified as weak to intermediate environmental fragility by both methods. The methods showed equal fragility ratings in 74% of the basin area. The greatest fragilities were found in areas with recent sedimentation, soils with high instability, slopes higher than 12% and land use areas with low protective potential. The emergent fragility method highlighted the effect of land use, accentuating the fragility of the most vulnerable classes. In contrast, the Natural Vulnerability to Soil Loss method attenuated this land-use effect, softening the vulnerability. The fragility maps indicated that different results might be obtained, especially on the threshold between fragility classes and polygons where land-use makes the environment more vulnerable. Thus, the method selection for determining environmental fragility depends on the relevance necessary for land-use. The emergent fragility method is advantageous for showing the fragility in areas mainly occupied by classes of land use of high vulnerability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In today’s globally driven marketplace, the endurance of supply chains is becoming increasingly critical for them to withstand long-term and short-term fluctuations of market forces. Many of the products necessary for basic needs and consumers’ discretionary spending come from complex global supply chains that face frequent external challenges and disruptions. So how can global providers build more efficient logistics practices and enduring supply chains? Humanitarian aid supply chains have discovered best practices and formulas for building resilient programmes to effectively do their work and could serve as a model. This paper explores how one organisation, Direct Relief, employs an innovative adaptive distribution strategy backed by smart maps, dashboards, other location technology tools powered by modern GIS (geographic information systems) technology. The authors provide a definition of adaptive logistics, share key examples of how it was implemented, and provide steps other organisations can take to improve their own supply chain and logistics operations.</jats:p>"

It is estimated that one-third of all food produced globally is either lost or wasted. In a world where almost one billion people are hungry, reducing food loss and waste is critical to creating a world with zero hunger and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. This study analyses how scientific research concerning food loss has evolved in recent years, with a focus on the supply chain of agri-food companies. Bibliometric techniques were used to analyse a sample of 181 publications from journals indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The obtained results show a growing interest in this topic and a clear concern for the management and prevention of food loss. An important conclusion is that a holistic approach from a supply chain perspective is needed to devise food loss reduction strategies focusing future lines of research on stakeholder collaboration, the circular economy and related regulatory changes. The study has implications for entrepreneurs and decisionmakers due to the effect that a reduction in food loss has on business strategies, as well as for policymakers in order to create updated food safety and quality regulations.</jats:p>"

Moreover, both linguistic risk assessment model and Cloud model are used to evaluate risks of supply chain. The Cloud model evaluation results are between general risk and high risk but closer to high risk. In addition, Cloud expected value of risk is 6.54 which is within the high-risk range, and evaluation results are also high risk. It is shown that when the weights are the same, the cloud model can determine the priority of risk indicators, and reflect volatility and randomness comparing with other evaluation methods.</jats:p>",

This article develops a statistical model, involving how critical SCPIs can influence firms’ export performance. The developed model is then empirically validated using top 53 firm-level data, based on market share, from the Indian pharmaceutical industry, taken for 10 years. The randomized complete block design approach is employed to confirm the variation of export intensity across firms and time. A panel data fixed-effects model is developed, associating critical SCPIs with export intensity to understand their impact on export performance. Finally, bootstrap is applied as a cross-validation procedure to carry out model authentication. This article contributes to obtaining crucial SCPIs and their impact on firms’ export competitiveness. It has revealed that firms’ raw material import efficiency, working capital efficiency, asset management efficiency, research and development (R&amp;D) capability, and the total cost to serve have a significant impact on the firms’ export capability. The proposed model can help firms make appropriate decisions about different influencing parameters of supply chain performance to improve their export competitiveness. </jats:p>"

Based on the development of a workable concept for companies, a small empirical study was carried out, which can be used to numerically measure the sustainability performance of companies. Two utility analyses were completed. One of them was supplemented by expert interviews. Well-known practitioners from the business world were interviewed and asked for their assessment of ecological performance indicators.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>BACKGROUND: Florida House Bill 21 (HB21) was implemented in July 2018 to limit Schedule II opioids prescriptions for patients with acute pain to a 3-day supply. Little is known about the potential unintended effects that such opioid restriction policies may have on chronic pain patients, who are exempt from the law.  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of HB21 on opioid utilization measures among a cohort of chronic opioid therapy (COT) patients.  STUDY DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design with interrupted time series analyses.  SETTING: Pharmacy claims from January 1, 2015 to June 31, 2019 from a large employer-based health plan in Florida.  METHODS: COT patients were those who received a &gt;= 70 days’ supply of opioids in the prior 90 days, representing 15,310 patients. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted to compare the following monthly measures among COT patients before and after HB21 implementation: 1) number of COT patients, 2) daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents [MMEs], 3) days’ supply of prescriptions.  RESULTS: There was a significant 25% reduction in the trend (pre-HB21 RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.96 versus post-HB21 RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.76) and an 8% immediate decrease (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97) in the monthly prevalence of COT patients after HB21 implementation. However, no significant change was observed in trends for monthly number of days supplied per prescription, monthly MMEs per COT patient-day, or total MMEs per prescription.  LIMITATIONS: Our study used data from employer-based private health insurance and did not include a longer post-policy period to adjust for implementation lag.  CONCLUSION: Fewer patients received COT after HB21; however, patients who continued to receive COT experienced no significant changes in their regimen. The study did not assess whether COT patients were appropriately tapered or if therapeutic alternatives were initiated for new chronic pain patients.

Structural equation modelling is used to validate and test the proposed model for supply chain performance. Cluster sampling method was incorporated. Owners of garment manufacturing firms in and around Coimbatore, Tirupur, Salem, Bargur and Bengaluru region would form the respondent group. A structured questionnaire was given to them to understand their supply chain practices, supply chain flow velocity and flow efficiency and its impact on their business performance. The firms operating under uncertain circumstances in the secondary supply line have adopted practices which lead to appropriate velocity and efficient flow of money, material and information which has been proved through the testing of the model.  The velocity and efficiency in the supply line has improved the performance thereby ensuring a more sustainable business for the firm operating in the secondary markets. This study has contributed in understanding the various dimensions of best supply chain practices and its effect on the flow velocity and flow efficiency of the money, material, and information in the secondary market garment supply chain. An assessment of the results of the study has opened a window to the operations of the secondary garment supply chain line in the Indian cloth market which have been more or less camouflaged under the primary market operations. The outcome of the research also shows that these secondary market players have evolved their own strategies to sustain in volatile and uncertain circumstances. These strategies have proved to be very effective in minimizing wastage and increasing profitability of the manufacturing firms. The implications of this study is bound to give much needed support and leverage to the frail and underperforming secondary garment cluster which is a major contributor of Gross Domestic Product and employment ratio.</jats:p>"

(Am J Epidemiol. 2022;191 (2):241–247) present a novel analysis of time trends in fentanyl concentrations in the unregulated drug supply in British Columbia, Canada. The preexisting knowledge about unregulated drugs had come from law-enforcement seizures and postmortem toxicology. As both of these data sources are subject to selection bias, large-scale drug-checking programs are poised to be a crucial component of the public health response to the unrelenting increase in overdose in North America. As programs expand, we offer 2 guiding principles. First, the primary purpose of these programs is to deliver timely results to people who use drugs to mitigate health risks. Second, innovation is needed to go beyond criminal justice paradigms in laboratory analysis for a more nuanced understanding of health concerns. We provide examples of the role adulterants play in our understanding of drug harms. We also describe the applications and limitations of common laboratory assays, with implications for epidemiologic surveillance. While the research and direct service teams in British Columbia have taken groundbreaking steps, there is still a need to establish best practices for communicating results to sample donors in an approachable yet nonalarmist tone.</jats:p>",

Robotic process automation is the application of automating the business processes using software bots. These software bots can enter data into software applications, manipulate data, and communicate with other software applications. However, most robotic process automation literature focuses on sectors such as finance, but little research focuses on supply chain and logistics sector applications. Besides, robotic process automation in the Sri Lankan supply chain context is less studied. Therefore, the study's main objectives are to identify the applicability of robotic process automation in supply chain and logistics industry in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the study aims to identify employee perception towards robotic process automation implementations in the supply chain logistics industry in Sri Lanka.&#x0D;\nThis study uses qualitative and quantitative research methods to collect data. Initially, a case study was conducted in one Logistics Company. A comprehensive feasibility framework was developed to identify the most feasible process. The AS-IS process and data flow mapping were developed to in-depth study the applicability of robotic process automation of the selected process. Findings confirm that many tasks of the selected process can be automated using robotic process automation. Moreover, a survey was conducted to identify employee perception towards robotic process automation implementations. The findings reflect that the young employees who have higher education and income levels are more likely to view robotic process automation as a positive impact on their jobs in the supply chain and logistics industry in Sri Lanka.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Robotic Process Automation, Supply Chain and Logistics Industry in Sri Lanka, Employee Perception, Feasibility Framework</jats:p>"

These methods are used to optimize the working process in the engine, improve traffic safety and simplify operation and maintenance.\nYou can adjust the chip to your liking, adjust the \"performance\" of the engine, because comfortable driving conditions give us a lot of pleasure.\nThe current control of technical conditions is carried out by the onboard system of self-diagnostics, which is an integral part of the controller. Problems that occur are signaled visually and stored in electronic memory. The full list of actual settings of codes of self-diagnostics and parameters of working process is carried out on HUNDRED with automobile indicators of brand. The problem is determined only by connecting a tester or scanner to a special diagnostic connector available in the car.\nHowever, there are often complaints about objective and comprehensive examinations.\nMisdiagnosis of \"standards\" with obvious signs of external problems is often given for many reasons. First of all, the use of information is limited electrical signals. In fact, the state of the circuit of sensors and actuators of engine automation is determined. Degradation of complex structures is usually based on the \"domino principle\": one local problem leads to another, another to a third, etc., which leads to the complete failure of the whole device. Problems with electricity may not be the cause but the consequences of other problems, including non-electrical causes. For example, the \"ringing\" of the piston fingers may indicate early inflammation and wear of the relevant components. The instability of the spark discharge in the spark plug may be the result of decompression of the working volume of the cylinder or improper preparation of the working mixture. The problem of the intake manifold or contamination of the fuel injector is usually recognized by the self-diagnostic system as a fault of the lambda detector. The list of such ambiguities can be expanded. When it is necessary to \"restore\" the accident of \"decent age\", branded diagnostic equipment may be useless.</jats:p>",

A new concept of additional skin factor is introduced in the proposed model to characterize the fluid supply. Then, the mathematical model are solved by using the perturbation transformation, point source integration method, Laplace transform, and numerical inversion, while the fracture flow equations are solved by fracture discretization and superposition principle. First, the flow regimes of multi-stage fractured horizontal wells with considering weak fluid supply are identified based on the rate transient behaviors, including wellbore storage and skin effect, bilinear flow, linear flow, pseudo-radial flow in the fractured zone, interface skin effect, pseudo-radial flow in the original zone, and boundary-dominated flow. The effect of additional interface skin makes the double logarithmic curve of production rate appear an abrupt \"overlap\". The results of the sensitivity study show that the abrupt \"overlap\" becomes more obvious with the increase of the fracture conductivity, fracture number, the stress sensitivity coefficient, especially the interface skin. Finally, the proposed mathematical model is used to perform a case study on the production data of actual tight-gas wells from the Ordos Basin. The interface skin factor, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, and boundary radius are evaluated. Through the proposed model, the characteristics of weak fluid supply in tight gas reservoirs are fully understood.</jats:p>",

This study analysed output supply and input demand of maize production using a farm survey data of 600 randomly selected maize farmers from all agricultural zones in Kaduna State of Nigeria. Data were analysed using a modified Nerlovian model and set of input demand equations. The results showed that in all estimates (yield and hectarage) long run estimates are greater than the short run values and both were inelastic. The elasticity for lagged own price of maize was 0.23% in the short run and 0.17% in the long run were positive, marginal and inelastic. The hectarage elasticity of supply response for maize is 1.04 in the short run and 0.78 in the long run. The result of the input demand equations showed that the coefficients cost of agrochemical and farm size statistically affect seed, fertilizer and labour demand. The study portrayed that the most critical issues in maize supply are the lack of improved production technology, poor capital investment, land unavailability or poor land tenure system and poor policy incentives. The study recommends that, there is a need for State policy on agricultural research and extension, and adequate input price policies. The government is advised to dissolve the agricultural extension service system to local governments. This will allow agricultural extension system to be more location specific.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The structural equation modelling (SEM) was the estimation technique employed to measure the relationships among the various variables/constructs using AMOS 22.0. It was found out that the four predictors (strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, level of information shared, information quality) of SCMP had significant impact on organizational performance. The study also revealed that of the four independent variables, three (strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, and level of information shared) had significant impact on competitive advantage, while information quality had no significant impact on competitive advantage. In response to our research questions, we concluded that the four constructs or predictors generate conditions that promote higher competitive advantage and organizational performance in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. The study recommended that manufacturing organizations should share quality, timely and accurate information to ensure their product offerings can be altered to meet customers while offering competitive prices. The study further recommended that organizations should assist its suppliers to improve product quality; regularly relate with clients to set dependability, receptiveness, and other standards; notify trading partners early when changing needs arises; and have fast product development.</jats:p>",

This choice is not clear since better information may not be attainable, and if it is attainable, it may not improve operational decision‐making. In light of this dilemma, we collaborate with a multinational division of a Fortune 500 manufacturing firm to develop stochastic linear programming models that quantify the value of disruption duration information. Our models allow us to examine characteristics of the disrupted part that may be associated with the value of better information. We focus on characteristics that are knowable at the outset of the disruption, as those can help the firm decide whether to invest in collecting better information. Using our research partner's supply chain and production data, we find that the value of information can vary materially—from &lt; 1% to over 99% of the cost of the disruption, underscoring the value of identifying disruptions that are sensitive to information quality. To address this, we use the company's data to identify several part‐related characteristics that influence the value of disruption duration information. These findings can help managers to identify parts in their own supply chains whose impact in a disruption is sensitive to different levels of duration information, and allow them to make informed decisions on whether or not to gather better information when a disruption strikes. </jats:p>",

The novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a great threat to many industries worldwide, including the ornamental fish trade. The present study was conducted to explore the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the pandemic on the ornamental fish supply chain in the Western Province of Sri Lanka with a sample size of 100 respondents representing the key stakeholders of the supply chain. The results concluded that all the stakeholders experienced a negative impact on their business process with the ongoing pandemic. There was a general reduction in sales and along the supply chain, the fish exporters were the least affected sector (7 % reduction), followed by breeders and growers (31 %), and aquarium fish dealers (38 %). The stakeholders who handled a diversified fish stock managed to do better than those who dealt with a single fish species during the pandemic. The supply of fish feeds was one of the significant constraints for all the stakeholders during a complete and partial lockdown. As a positive outcome of the pandemic, 30 % of the fish exporters received an unexpected increased number of export orders from their buyers. Government intervention is crucial to rebuild and strengthen the impacted key players within the ornamental fish supply chain under the pandemic situation.</jats:p>",

This study found that supply chain power has a significant positive impact on the environmental responsibility of upstream suppliers and downstream customers. There is a vertical spillover effect of supply chain power on corporate environmental responsibility. A stepwise regression approach was used to investigate the mediating effect of business performance between the two, and the bootstrap method was used to test the existence of the mediating effect. Firms can use their power in the supply chain to reasonably allocate profits in the supply chain, which not only helps them to fulfil their environmental responsibility but also influences other firms in the supply chain to fulfil their environmental responsibility.</jats:p>"

Most of these modeling approaches are computationally intensive, have large proprietary data collection requirements or lack precision, making them unfeasible for rapid assessment, prioritization, and allocation of emergency water resources in large, complex disasters. This study proposes a new simplified analytical method—performed without proprietary water pipeline data—to estimate water supply needs after earthquakes, and a case study of its application in the HayWired earthquake scenario. In the HayWired scenario—a moment magnitude (Mw) 7.0 Hayward Fault earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area, California (USA)—an analysis of potable water supply in two water utility districts was performed using the University of Colorado Water Network (CUWNet) model. In the case study, application of the simplified method extends these estimates of household water service outage to the nine counties adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, aggregated by a ~250 m2 (nine-arcsecond) grid. The study estimates about 1.38 million households (3.7 million residents) out of 7.6 million residents (2017, ambient, nighttime population) with potable water service outage soon after the earthquake—about an 8% increase from the HayWired scenario estimates.</jats:p>"

According to the supply-side reform on rural teacher training, there exist problems such as city-oriented supply structure, disconnected supply system, and upper-dominant supply management. Therefore, it is suggested to getting rid of the homogeneous supply structure, breaking the enclosed supply system, and improving the educational governance paths such as the centralized supply management.

As a direct result, third party logistics (3PL) fulfillment support services are rapidly growing and considered a critical part of the customer experience. 3PL fulfillment support services are not only important to completing the last leg of the e-commerce and business-to-business (B2B) transactional process, but also have an impact on customer satisfaction, long-term customer loyalty and the overall brand experience. The 3PL fulfillment market has changed significantly over the last 50 years, and the scope of the support services has also changed throughout the decades. Overall direction of the industry changed forever on 5th July, 1994, when Amazon was founded and began operations. In the late 20th century, online commerce launched a modern-day gold rush and with newfound fortunes to be made, the fulfillment market was flooded with new companies from various industries that all wanted to stake their claims. Today, understanding the 3PL market options, pricing methodologies and service level agreements (SLAs) is critically important to selecting the best 3PL partner to support your current needs and help you scale your business for the future. The 3PL contract optimisation process starts with selecting the right partner, developing the appropriate contract terms and conditions, scope alignment and performance incentives to lay the foundation for a successful partnership. Ongoing contract optimisation requires a formalised process to evaluate performance, review market alternatives and deliver efficiencies. The ideal state of fulfillment services contract optimisation is achieved when the 3PL relationship delivers maximum shareholder value from best-in-class pricing, outstanding service and long-term goal alignment.</jats:p>"

To this effect, we use the structural model of the Almost Ideal Demand System with a Cobb-Douglas home production function. The results are summarized as follows. Regarding labor supply, both women and men have the same working willingness in the labor market when women are paid as much as men. Overall, although the regional gender income gap appears different between major metropolitan areas and non-major metropolitan areas, our results indicate that the income gap would disappear by diminishing the wage gap. However, for home production, the gender gap persists when women apply the same conditions as men, although the gap is small. Policy implied that reducing the gender wage gap is an important tool to encourage single women to work as men in the workplace regardless of the area.</jats:p>"

However, it is sometimes seen more as a source of extra finance for the municipality, and, in recent years, as an issue of political debate in terms of the adequacy of one form of management or another: public or private. Currently, 35% of Spain's population is supplied by public specialised entities, 33% by private companies under a concession contract, 22% by mixed companies and 10% by undifferentiated municipal services. In simple terms, 45% corresponds to public management and 55% is fully or partially managed by the private sector. By analysing the annual accounts of the companies that operate in the Spain's principal municipalities, this study seeks to determine the role played by the private sector in the management of the mixed companies. Due to the diversity of services provided by these companies and the lack of differentiated statistics for each of them, we have used the Annual Accounts presented to the Central Mercantile Register or the data submitted to the Ministry of Finance in order to assess the influence of private participation on the results of the companies.</jats:p>"

This study is focused on the precipitation of calcium carbonate, a major constituent of scale, from calcocarbonically pure (CCP) water in HDPE pipe. Studying scaling in natural conditions is very difficult because it occurs over many years. For this, accelerated scaling is caused by the degassing CO2 dissolved in water. The kinetic study has shown that the germination time and the critical pH decrease with the hardness (30, 40 and 50 °f) and temperature (30, 40 and 50 °C) of water. On the other hand, scaling process efficiency (η) and the supersaturation coefficient (Ωcal) of CaCO3 increase with these parameters. The CaCO3 precipitation occurs both in solution and on walls of HDPE. By the weighing method, it is shown that the deposit mass increases with hardness and temperature. Calcium carbonate precipitates much more in homogeneous phase than in heterogeneous one. The study also showed that heterogeneous nucleation on HDPE is much less important than on PA, PVC, chrome and Inox. These measurements are supported by the characterization of X-ray diffraction deposits and by scanning electron microscopy, which recognizes that the precipitate obtained consists mainly of calcite.</jats:p>",

However, the RLP is complex and involves a high degree of uncertainty and difficult decisions that affect SC efficiency. One of the aspects that can help the most to reduce this complexity and to improve SC efficiency is to formalize this process. The consulted studies agree on the numerous benefits of RLP formalization, but no tools, methodologies or specific solutions were found that help companies to advance in this matter. This work aims to develop a specific tool for RLP formalization so that its efficiency can be increased, leading to an improvement of SC sustainability. The main results comprise a reference model for RLP (RM-RLP) and an associated methodology so that any company can formalize its RLP by modeling its activities. The proposed tool (RM-RLP and methodology) is applied to a closed loop SC of relaxing chairs as an example of RLP formalization, proving its usefulness and, additionally, the improvements that can be reached in three RLP key indicators: total process duration, customer response time and the perceived autonomy and trust of the workers participating in the process.</jats:p>"

Among the environmental impacts, alternatives to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions - GHG stand out due to the concerns with climate change. Then, the development and use of renewable resources become relevant. Considering that supply chains are intense in energy consumption and GHG emissions (since involves processes related to supply, production, transport, consumption), it becomes relevant to investigate if the management of sustainable supply chain are considering the renewable energies in their processes. Therefore, this paper aims at mapping the role of renewable energies in the context of sustainable supply chain, analyzing the literature published at Web of Science database - WoS about the subject. The main researchers, organizations, collaboration networks were presented, and the 21 most cited studies were mapped in this paper. The research was carried out with the papers published at WoS until 2019, using VantagePoint software to handle information. The findings show that the research about renewable energy in the context of sustainable supply chain has been growing, especially since 2010. Moreover, biomass, biofuels and photovoltaic energy were the most recurrent sources of renewable energy studied by most cited papers.

This paper addresses the potential of urban wind energy production with small wind turbines, using Berlin as an example. A complete framework from data selection to economic feasibility is constructed to enable the empirical assessment of wind energy for individual buildings and Berlin as a whole. Based on a detailed dataset of all buildings and hourly wind speed on a 1 km2 grid, the results show that multiple turbines on suitable buildings can significantly contribute to households’ energy consumption but fall short of covering the full demand. For individual households, our economic evaluation strongly recommends the self-consumption of the produced electricity. The findings suggest that while the use of small wind turbines should be continuously encouraged, exploring other renewable resources or combination of wind and photovoltaic energy in the urban environment remains important.</jats:p>"

Making full use of multi-source data and prior knowledge to quickly and economically obtain high-precision regional water demand is of great significance to the optimal allocation of regional water resources. In order to accurately predict the regional water demand, this study took Yulin City as a research area to predict the water demand of the city from 2017 to 2019. Aiming at the oscillating characteristics of the regional water demand sequence and the over-fitting problem of traditional prediction models, this study proposed the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II-fractional order reverse accumulative grey model (NSGAII-FORAGM). The regional water demand oscillation sequence was transformed into a monotonically decreasing non-negative sequence. Based on the transformation sequence, an optimization model was constructed according to the two objective functions of ‘maximum (or minimum) order’ and ‘best fit to historical data’, and the NSGAII method was adopted to solve the model. The three model structures of ‘fractional order’, ‘reverse accumulation’ and ‘obtaining order through multi-objective optimization model ‘ were tested based on the water use sequence of the three sectors (industry, tertiary industry and domestic) in Yulin City, and the performance of the method is compared with NSGAII-IORAGM, NSGAII-FOFAGM and SOGA-FORAGM. The results showed that the average relative error of the model established in this study for the simulation of industry, tertiary industry (the tertiary industry is a technical name for the service sector of the economy, which encompasses a wide range of businesses), and domestic was 15.54%, 11.20%, 9.98% respectively. The average relative error of the model established in this study for the prediction of industry, tertiary industry and domestic was 9.46%, 7.9%, and 1.8%, respectively. For the simulation of water demand sequences in three sections, the simulation average relative errors of the other three models were not absolutely dominant except for the SOGA-FORAGM model. The average relative predicted error by the model in this study was the smallest (the relative errors of the three sequence predictions for industry, tertiary industry and domestic were lower than the relative errors of the optimal results of the comparison model, which were 0.97%, 0.72% and 4.5%, respectively), indicating that the model had certain applicability for the water demand prediction of various sectors (industry, tertiary industry and domestic) in the region compared with other models, and can improve the accuracy of the prediction results.</jats:p>",

However, most studies do not consider socioeconomic aspects, which could lead to different degrees of RWH implementation and technology selection due to economic constraints and local regulations. We evaluated the socioeconomic potential for RWH as an alternative for the water supply of 24 southern Brazilian municipalities with less than 50,000 inhabitants. A total of 10,080 RWH configurations were assessed and a reliability analysis was carried out to define the RWH system configurations potentially implementable (RWH+) in each municipality. RWH economic benefits were estimated from a social point of view, based on the reduction of the monthly water payment. Overall, RWH+ supplying higher demands with higher economics savings were feasible, as expected. However, several municipalities that showed RWH+ supplying 100% of the domestic water demands obtained lower economic savings, due to low water tariff and water consumption. Still, a set of municipalities presented RWH+ for rainwater demand replacing 50% to 60% of the residential demand, for which the high water tariffs were reflected in higher economic savings. The advantages of using the RWH systems stand out even more when the investments at Federal and Local levels are considered.</jats:p>",

In a wide sense, it has been defined considering its origin and the way that intelligence is coded and transferred to devices to perform operations or to optimize processes for decision-making. In this way, it is notable the relation with multiple areas, for example, Operations Research (OR), which makes use of techniques from mathematical modelling, statistical analysis and optimization for decision-making. As it can be seen, both AI and OR have an intersection in the area known as decision-making, which does not mean that this is the only aspect where they cross.\r\n \r\nEven though many areas use AI to solve their problems, it is and will remain a branch of computer science. AI introduces efficient algorithms for computational applications to present an intelligent human-like behaviour while performing tasks with a lot more precision and speed; furthermore, AI aims to simulate human behaviours such as reasoning and even creativity, as in the case of artificial art. AI has made great progress in the last years, which has spread to many areas and also to many different places.  An area of interest where many domains, concepts, processes, etc. intersect is OR. For example, OR is usually identified as a sub-area of applied mathematics, however, it includes sundry techniques and methods to improve decision-making and the prized efficiency of a system; these include optimization, queuing theory and simulation.</jats:p>"

The subject of the study is the stratification of the density of the drilling fluid along the height of the cargo tank in which it is transported. The technology of transportation of drilling fluid on the Platform Supply Vessel is considered. A problematic point in ensuring this process is that during the transportation of drilling fluids, due to the action of gravitational forces on organic and inorganic compounds in their volume, there is a latent change in their dispersion over the volume of the fluid. This leads to the stratification and stratification of the fluid density along the height, as well as to the formation of sediments at the bottom of the cargo tanks, in which the drilling fluid is transported. The study is aimed at developing a technology that maintains a constant value of the density of the drilling fluid along the depth of the tank in which it is transported. The studies were carried out in the vessel system for transporting drilling fluid of a specialized marine vessel of the Platform Supply Vessel type with a deadweight of 5850 tons. It is experimentally established that for a transportation time of 6–36 hours, the density stratification of the drilling fluid is 3.04–32.04 %. As a method that ensures the minimum stratification of the density of the drilling fluid during its transportation, it is proposed to use an additional X-shaped circulation of the drilling fluid in the volume of adjacent cargo tanks. Studies have confirmed that the density stratification over a time period of 6–36 hours decreases to a range of 2.30–9.01 %. The complex use of additional X-shaped circulation and simultaneous air supply to the bottom of the cargo tank provides a density stratification value of 0.73–2.93 %. The proposed technology was tested on a specialized seagoing vessel of the Platform Supply Vessel type with a deadweight of 5850 tons and can be used on offshore vessels that ensure the operation of offshore oil production platforms.</jats:p>"

Within that window, the same set of firms started measuring and disclosing their supply chain carbon emissions. Does carbon footprinting influence the nature and content of a firm's disclosure on the climate change risks that are expected to affect its business? We explore this question using more than 10,925 climate change disclosures collected by the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) from 2,003 firms worldwide. We use singular value decomposition and text similarity scores to quantitatively examine the content of the CDP disclosures from 2007 to 2016. Using fixed effects and dynamic panel models, we find that measuring supply chain carbon emissions (Scope 3) explains a substantial shift in the content and nature of the disclosures. We find no evidence that measuring and disclosing direct emissions (Scope 1) are associated with substantial changes in the content of the disclosures. One explanation for this is that most of the climate change‐related risks are in the supply chain, not within the company boundaries of large, global firms. Our results show the importance of encouraging firms to voluntarily measure their supply chain carbon emissions if they are not yet aware of their contribution and exposure to climate change. Our work shows that firms’ response to climate change is dynamic, and it may take a decade to detect these shifts. </jats:p>",

In Canada, while the addition of nutrients to foods has been regulated through fortification regulations, parallel policies which aim to encourage product innovation have also allowed for the voluntary addition of nutrients and other novel ingredients to ‘supplemented’ and ‘functional’ foods. Concerns have been raised that the consumption of these products may have negative repercussions on population health, such as high nutrient intakes inappropriate for certain population subgroups (e.g., children) and the shifting of dietary patterns to include more unhealthy foods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, nutritional quality, and marketing characteristics of foods with added nutrients in the Canadian market. We found many nutritionally-enhanced foods contained high levels of nutrients beyond recommended intakes, despite these nutrients having no evidence of inadequacy in the Canadian population. Additionally, a large proportion of foods with added nutrients had poor nutrient profiles (were deemed ‘less healthy’ than their non-enhanced counterparts) and carried heavy marketing on their labels, regardless of their nutritional quality. Taken together these findings raise concerns about foods with voluntary nutrient additions and suggest the need to further investigate consumer attitudes and decision-making towards these foods.</jats:p>"

Multiple locations, time periods, transportation expenses, facility opening costs, production capacity, and demand fulfillment requirements complicate supply chains. Supply chain optimization's complexity and huge solution areas challenge traditional optimization methods. Quantum algorithms can efficiently explore bigger solution areas in quantum computing. Starting with problem identification, this research reviews quantum computing and supply chain optimization literature. The supply chain optimization problem is modeled mathematically to incorporate transportation, facility opening, production, and cost. Binary choice factors and constraints ensure demand fulfillment, facility capacity limitations, and flow balance. The mathematical theory is applied numerically. The example addresses three locations, two time periods, transportation costs, demand amounts, production capacity, and facility opening costs. A proper optimization solver optimizes the decision variables to reduce total cost while meeting demand and making efficient supply chain decisions. The supply chain optimization model reduces costs and informs transportation, facility opening, and production decisions. The numerical example shows how quantum computing may optimize supply chain topologies and reduce costs. The study explains the findings, highlights gaps in the literature, and stresses the need for more research to bridge theory and practice. This study advances supply chain optimization with quantum computing. It shows how quantum computing might improve supply chain network decision-making, efficiency, and cost.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to investigate the role of interest rate and money supply in measuring monetary policy in twelve emerging economies that target inflation through the analysis of Granger causality, impulse response function, and forecast error variance decomposition. The empirical results show that both money supply and interest rate are useful predictors for changes in inflation. Moreover, both show a comparable power to explain the variation of inflation. However, a rise in interest rate increases rather than decreases inflation, whereas money supply has a positive and expected effect on inflation. These findings suggest that interest rate may not fully capture the overall stance of monetary policy or interest rate has a limited effect on inflation.</jats:p>",

Although only 42 and 49% (of DOC) and 48 and 53% (of UV254) could be removed by MF and UF dynamic membranes, respectively, a remarkable effect on fouling alleviation was observed in high DOC synthetic (HS) water. Iron oxide did not enhance the removal of organic matter in low DOC natural (LN) water as much as it did in synthetic water. Iron oxide led to the removal of high molecular weight organics, thus reversible fouling was reduced almost 2 orders of magnitude through both types of dynamic membranes in high DOC natural (HN) water. Reversible and irreversible resistances were reduced by iron oxide to some extent in LN water. Nevertheless the effect of iron oxide on fouling alleviation was much higher in HN rather than in LN water.</jats:p>",

While the current trend of rapid surface warming of inland lakes continues, the deep waters can resist changes, depending on the nature of surface water — groundwater interactions. However, the effects of these interactions on lake processes are not fully understood. Here we investigate the role of groundwater on coupled biophysical processes in a deep, dimictic, groundwater‐fed lake using mechanistic models combined with data from field observations. Although excess nutrient inputs are the most commonly cited reason for algal blooms, here we show that algal blooms in inland lakes can also appear due to a decreasing groundwater supply while all other factors remain the same. Results indicate that decreasing groundwater supply to lakes leads to elevated hypolimnetic temperatures, enhanced algal growth rates and algal blooms, and oxygen depletion, thus exacerbating the negative effects of surface warming. Our work suggests that globally declining groundwater supplies may have a significant negative effect on water quality of inland lakes by accelerating water column warming and stimulating algal growth, especially when the groundwater contribution to the lake system is significant compared to riverine discharge. The work provides insights for management efforts to improve the resilience of groundwater‐dependent ecosystems in the face of external stressors.</jats:p>",

Transparency is deemed vital in the creation of sustainable and resilient supply chains and overall effective corporate governance. There are two distinct orientations toward the use of technology by multinational corporations (MNCs) in creating sustainability transparency within their global supply chains: control and relational. A control orientation views technology as a tool to gather the ever-increasing levels of sustainability data on supplier practices in an efficient, secure, and progressively automated manner. A relational orientation adopts a view where technology is a tool to help build social relations and improve dialogue and collaboration on sustainability throughout the supply chain. A key difference in the two orientations lies in the mindset of the MNC manager toward the development of supply chain sustainability transparency. The article illustrates the effective application of both approaches and offers advice to managers on the design choices they need to consider in choosing technologies. </jats:p>",

This is particularly relevant for vaccines, with numerous vaccines strictly requiring cold storage to remain stable. When stability evaluation is exclusively based on real-time data, it may represent a bottleneck for rapid and effective vaccine access. Stability modeling for vaccines represents a key resource to predict stability based on accelerated stability studies; nevertheless, this approach is not fully exploited for these kinds of products. This is likely because of the complexity and diversity of vaccines, as well as the limited availability of dedicated guidelines or illustrative case studies. This article reports a cross-company perspective on stability modeling for vaccines. Several examples, based on the direct experience of the contributors, demonstrate that modeling approaches can be highly valuable to predict vaccines’ shelf life and behavior during shipment or manipulation. It is demonstrated that modeling methodologies need to be tailored to the nature of the vaccine, the available prior knowledge, and the monitored attributes. Considering that the well-established strategies reported in ICH or WHO guidelines are not always broadly applicable to vaccines, this article represents an important source of information for vaccine researchers and manufacturers, setting the grounds for further discussion within the vaccine industry and with regulators.</jats:p>"

Современному жителю большого города сейчас трудно понять, но на протяжении нескольких столетий Самара испытывала серьезные проблемы из-за хронической нехватки воды. В город, стоящий между двумя реками, воду ежедневно доставляли многочисленные водовозы на конных повозках в бочках и прочих емкостях. Самара была беспомощна перед регулярно вспыхивавшими в ней пожарами, от которых периодически город выгорал почти целиком. Такая ситуация продолжалась почти до конца XIX века. Попытки построить водопровод в Самаре были, но оказались неудачными. В 1881 г. в журнале «Зодчий» был объявлен конкурс на составление технического проекта устройства водоснабжения г. Самары, в июне 1883 г. на конкурс было представлено 11 проектов. После их обсуждения первую премию в 3000 руб. получил проект заведующего московскими водопроводами инженера Николая Петровича Зимина. Строительство самарского водопровода началось сразу же после подписания договора с компанией «Торговый дом братьев Бромлей и К°» на выполнение работ. И уже 1 октября 1886 г. началась подача воды на главные улицы города. Благодаря уникальным инженерным решениям Н. П. Зимина в Самаре стал действовать оборудованный по последнему слову техники первый в России противопожарный водопровод. В то время только некоторые города Европы имели это чудо техники. Сейчас история самарского водопровода насчитывает 135  лет. Для сохранения истории создания системы водоснабжения города с 13 июля 2018 г. на площадке Городской водопроводной станции действует музей истории самарского водопровода «На Дне». Современная водопроводная система городского округа Самара снабжает питьевой водой более 1,2 млн жителей. Развитие продолжается.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The history of the creation and development of the water supply in Samara is presented. It is difficult for a modern resident of a large city to understand now; however, for several centuries Samara has experienced serious problems due to a persistent deficit of water. Numerous water carriers on horse-drawn carriages in barrels and other containers delivered water to the city located between two rivers. Samara was helpless before the fires that regularly flared up in it that resulted in almost entire city burning out. This situation preserved almost until the end of the 19th century. There were attempts, however unsuccessful, to build a water supply system in Samara. In 1881, the Zodchii magazine announced a competition to draw up a technical project for a water supply system for the city of Samara; in June 1883, 11 projects were submitted for the competition. After appropriate reviewing, the first prize of 3000 rubles was awarded to the project by engineer Nikolai Petrovich Zimin, the head of the Moscow water supply system. The construction of the Samara water supply system started immediately after the signing of an agreement with the company «Trading House of Brothers Bromley and Co.» for the execution of works. And already on October 1, 1886, the water supply to the main streets of the city began. Owing to the unique engineering solutions of N. P. Zimin, the first fire-fighting water supply system in Russia, equipped with a state-of-the-art-infrastructure was commissioned in Samara. At that time, only a few cities in Europe had this marvel of engineering. Now the history of the Samara water supply system goes back 135 years. To preserve the history of the creation of the municipal water supply system, «Na Dne» («At the Bottom») museum of the history of the Samara water supply system has been operating since July 13, 2018 at the premises of the municipal water treatment plant. The modern water supply system of the Samara urban district supplies drinking water to more than 1.2 million residents. Development continues.</jats:p>",

As water becomes scarcer, water-related tensions are imminent on different scales. It is the interplay of these tensions with a number of socioeconomic, political, environmental and cultural factors that determine the probability of conflict. Lamu, found in the coastal part of Kenya, is a unique location in that access to water is already a major challenge. Combined with the negative impacts of climate change, and the ongoing large infrastructural development in the region, Lamu is on the verge of a water crisis. As such, there is a need for research into the context-specific factors that play a part in heightening the potential for water-related conflict amidst increasing water scarcity. The focus of this study was to identify and evaluate the context-specific factors that will amplify the potential for water-related conflict in Lamu. The findings suggest religion, migration, and poverty are factors that would heighten the potential for water-related conflict in the region amidst increasing water scarcity. The study recommends that these factors need to be addressed urgently and should be part of any water management mechanism in Lamu, in order to avoid water-related conflicts. Additionally, the findings imply that anticipating the stressors for water-related conflict in Lamu will play a significant role in managing conflict and facilitating negotiations over the region's water resources.</jats:p>",

Was early Islamic mosaic manufacture related to Byzantine tradition and to what extent? Were materials and artisans gathered from Byzantium and/or territories under the Byzantine control? Based on a multi-analytical approach, glass tesserae from Khirbat al-Mafjar, the Great Mosque of Damascus, and the Dome of the Rock have been analysed. Results speak of a tale of two legacies, demonstrating that, parallel to a continuity with the manufacture of glass tesserae in the late antique Levant—pointing, more specifically, to a re-use of materials from abandoned buildings—legacies other than Byzantine occurred. It emerged that Egypt definitively played a role in mosaic making during the Umayyad caliphate, acting as a supplier of skilled artisans and materials.</jats:p>"

Specific surface area, scanning electron microscopy, and EDS analysis were used to compare the unmodified and modified omphacite, and a dynamic filtration experiment was performed to treat the slightly polluted water. The analysis of the characterization results revealed that the surface structure of the modified omphacite filter medium changed greatly. Its surface was rough and potholes increased, and the specific surface area and adsorption capacity were significantly increased. Results of the dynamic filtration experiment revealed that the average removal efficiencies of organic matter, TOC, and turbidity by quartz sand were 21.17%, 2.2%, and 94.5%. The average removal efficiencies of organic matter, TOC, and turbidity by unmodified omphacite were 23.46%, 26.7%, and 95.2%.

The retailer’s strategy is to do the screening of items received from the manufacturer; subsequently, the perfect quality items are used to fulfill the customer’s demand, and the defective items are reworked. The retailer considers that customer demand is time and reliability dependent. The supply chain considers probabilistic deterioration for the manufacturer and retailers along with the strategies such as production rate, unit production cost, cost of idle time of manufacturer, screening, rework, etc. The optimum average profit of the integrated model is evaluated for both the cases crisp and fuzzy environments.

The decentralized SCF problem has been recently cast as an optimization problem that can be efficiently approximated using max-sum loopy belief propagation. Along this direction, in this paper we propose a novel encoding of the problem into a binary factor graph (containing only binary variables) as well as an alternative algorithm.

However, quantitative studies that consider the global and economy-wide impacts of rerouting supply chains are limited. This study examines the economic and emissions impacts of reorganising supply chains, using Australia-China trade as an example. It augments the Hypothetical Extraction Method by replacing traditional Input-Output analysis with a Computable General Equilibrium analysis. The estimation results demonstrate that in both exports and imports, a trade embargo between Australia and China – despite being compensated for by alternative supply chains—will cause gross domestic production losses and emissions increases for both countries and the world overall. Moreover, even though all other economies gain from the markets left by China, many of them incur overall gross domestic production losses and emission increases. The finding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India may also suffer from an Australia-China trade embargo, despite a gain in trade volume, suggests that no country should add fuel to the fire. The results suggest that countries need to defend a rules-based trading regime and jointly address supply chain challenges.</jats:p>"

As a result, this review paper draws on actual findings and lessons learned from various places in Ethiopia to assess the country's achievements and opportunities when it comes to RWH, as well as to guide future alternatives toward its sustainability. RWH acts as to help throughout the rainy season's dry spells, as a potential asset for the dry season, aiding human and livestock consumption as well as crop production through irrigation. So, for successful well-organized rain water collection, watershed treatment, seepage and evaporation control, soil and water conservation, conservation tillage, and integration of low-cost water lifting techniques and family drip systems should all be undertaken. Given that the country has not been significantly modernized, it has outdated experience in the operation and exploitation of RWH systems. Aside from financial inadequacies, historical and political instability, lack of understanding among farmers, and resistance to new technologies, the country has opportunities and has made some progress on RWH systems. In general, RWH could enable smallholder farmers to diversify their crops, thereby enhancing household food security, dietary status, and economic return. In addition, the much-needed green revolution and climate change adaptations should combine RWH ideas with agronomic principles in the country. More work is needed to strengthen indigenous practices and share best practices to a larger scale.</jats:p>",

The monthly averaged daily energy consumption for the dwelling was found to vary between 19 and 36 kWh. The system under consideration included some subsystems, namely: the hot-water service, the space-heating facility, and the power-utility system (wind electricity supply and storage system). The optimum design was obtained by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis for each of the subsystems. The hot-water system was designed to be based on solar flat-plate collectors, and a wind tree. The optimum hot-water facility is consisted of three flat-plate collectors, a storage heat exchanger with three coils, which are attached to flat-plate solar collectors, under-floor heating systems, and a wind tree power system. The large dimensions of the house were the limiting factor when investigating the feasibility of a solar-powered space-heating system. The existence of large windows made the space heating a very dif?cult and expensive task. The results show that the cost of the system is very expensive compared to the connection to the main grid. But on the other side, there will be a return investment value each year and the system will get all its costs after 14 years. Thus, if the average life of the system is 20 years old, the system will get profit after 14 years for six more years, in addition to the clean energy out from the system and the very beneficial positive effect on the environment.</jats:p>"

Thus, preventive problems can be identified and located as early as possible and counteracting measures initiated. This paper presents a new value stream mapping (VSM) model to consider interrelated processes in a holistic manner, regarding the requirements of CE. To do so, one macro-level to consider interrelated company relationships together with a respective micro-level to consider the individual company specific processes are elaborated. The degree of circularity is determined based on the 9R framework and new visualizations and measurement indicators are added at the different levels. This new model helps to mainly identify hurdles at a product's end-of-life, which are preventing a circular flow of resources, worth sharing with the responsible of a product's beginning-of-life. The model itself is validated by an extensive cross-company PET-bottle case study in Luxembourg.</jats:p>",

Böylece ülkelerin artan enerji ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak ve sanayileşmelerinin sürekliliğini sağlamak için enerjiye olan ihtiyaçlarını kesintiye uğramadan, güvenilir kaynaklardan, uygun fiyatlı ve yeterli miktarda sağlamaları gerekmektedir. Enerji kaynaklarının çeşitlendirilmesi, bununla birlikte enerji arz güvenliği ve çevresel güvenlik günümüzde tüm ülkelerin güncel konuları arasında yer almaktadır. Bu konular arasında sorun yaşayan ülkeler her alanda birçok sıkıntıyla karşı karşıya kalmaktadır. Günümüzde enerji, ülkelerin geleceği ve gelişimi için çok önemli bir konuma sahiptir. Ülkelerin bir kısmı ihtiyacından daha fazla enerji kaynağına sahipken, diğer ülkeler kendi ihtiyaçlarını dahi karşılayamamaktadır. Türkiye de enerji ihtiyacını büyük oranda dış kaynaklardan karşılayan ve fosil enerji tüketiminin fazla olduğu bir ülkedir. Enerji konusunda dışa bağlılık risk oluştururken, fosil kaynakların yüksek oranda kullanılması ise çevresel güvenlik alanında risk oluşturmaktadır. Türkiye'nin enerji hedeflerine bakıldığında önceliğin yerli ve yenilenebilir enerji kaynaklarının kullanımının yaygınlaştırılması olduğu görülmektedir. Bir diğeri ise kaynak çeşitlendirilmesine gidilmesi ve dışa bağımlılığın azaltılmasını sağlayabilecek olan nükleer santraller gibi alternatif enerji yatırımlarına önem ve öncelik verilmesidir. Böylelikle, Türkiye’nin çevresel güvenliğe nazaran enerji arz güvenliğine önem ve öncelik verdiği anlaşılmaktadır.</jats:p>"

A well known example is sulphane (hydrogen sulfide) odour, reminiscent of rotten eggs, which naturally occurs in some underground waters. Less known and hitherto unexplained is this odour arising from hot water in water heaters. As a response to complaints by consumers we investigated 14 sites and thanks to experimental work in one of these recognised a complex mechanism at work. For production of sulphane to occur in a water heater the following conditions must be met: presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria, presence of sulphates, reduction properties of water indicated by a very low nitrate content (highest value was 10 mg/L, mostly &amp;lt;2 mg/L), and presence of sacrificial magnesium anode. We identified four possible remedial measures, some of which are less effective or only short term, or have an undesirable side-effect (corrosion). The most effective measure was replacement of the magnesium anode for an aluminium or zinc anode, which retains the anticorrosion protection of the heater.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, in Germany the leading dairy companies mainly pushed by a saturated domestic market, EU agriculture policy oriented to liberalization of markets, and increasing political and social demands are looking at markets beyond EU. In the context of the increasing globalization of agricultural supply chains, the issue of sustainability gains particular importance in companies’ internationalization strategies. By using expert interviews, this paper investigates strategies for integrating Brazilian and German dairy supply chains and how both sides can benefit from this situation also in terms of sustainability. The analyses show that problems of the industries in both countries basically complement each other at different levels and positive synergies for both sides exist when it comes to sustainable issues, positioning themselves competitively for the future and creating a good position for conquering market shares in a globally growing milk market.

The flow of seawater into freshwater aquifers is known as saltwater intrusion, and it can lead to groundwater quality contamination, including drinking water. Due to the extremely severe hydraulic interface between groundwater and seawater, saltwater intrusion can happen naturally in coastal aquifers. The aim of the study is to examine the status of seawater intrusion within the study region of the South-West zone of Surat city, Gujarat. The present study evaluates Groundwater Quality Index using a weighted arithmetic method including various chemical ions. The South-West zone of Surat city is located along the coast; seawater infiltration has a significant impact on the groundwater in the state. The conceptual model will be developed and analyzed using MODFLOW to analyze the effects of seawater intrusion analysis. The model domain is characterized by three hydro-stratographic layers and covers an area of approximately 110 km2 in a 400 m × 400 m grid size. An analytical study with MODFLOW would be carried out for three-dimensional groundwater flows with species of solute transport. This study would help profile the study area regarding groundwater quality.</jats:p>",

The spread of COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the supply chain, with a large number of enterprises experiencing difficulties in operation, resulting in increased credit risks in supply chain finance. Under the impact of the epidemic, this paper explores the transmission speed and steady state of credit risk when the supply chain finance network is affected by external impact so that we can have a more complete understanding of the ability of supply chain finance to resist risks. The simulation results show that external shocks of different degrees will increase the number of initial infected enterprises and lead to the increase in credit risk contagion speed but have no significant impact on network steady state; the speed of credit risk contagion is positively correlated with network complexity but not significantly affected by network size; core enterprises infected will increase the rate of credit risk contagion. The intensity of policy intervention has obvious curative effect on the risk caused by external shock. When the supply chain financial network is affected by external shocks, the intensity, time, and pertinence of policy response can effectively prevent the credit risk contagion.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a hybrid simulation framework for production planning using the case of the Norwegian Atlantic salmon supply chain. This hybrid simulation comprises agent-based modelling (ABM) to capture the autonomous and interacting decision making behaviour of the supply chain actors, while discrete-event simulation (DES) is employed to model the various production processes within the chain. The simulation is implemented using AnyLogic™ version 8.0 simulation software, using a case study from the Norwegian farmed salmon sector. The proposed modelling framework provides a deeper understanding of the activities in the salmon supply chain, thereby enabling improved decision making.</jats:p>"

However, the Smart Mix concept has not yet been precisely defined, which has hindered its operationalization as a means of analyzing the governance of long and complex international supply chains. The aim of this contribution is to derive a working definition of Smart Mixes and use it to create and demonstrate a generalizable analytical tool that facilitates identification of whether a Smart Mix exists in an international supply chain. To address this aim, we reviewed existing literature on Smart Mixes to define the concept, which led to a three-step process for analyzing a supply chain. In a second stage, we demonstrate the process by applying it to the example of organic imports into Switzerland, using data from expert interviews and existing public documentation. The application showed that the governance of the organic sector in Switzerland related to imported products fulfils the criteria for it to be considered a Smart Mix that enables the Swiss Government to influence the behaviour of supply chain actors outside its jurisdiction. This example shows that the proposed Smart Mix concept is sound under particular circumstances: in this case, when the interests of the public and private sectors are aligned so that binding public measures provide protection to the private sector. These circumstances are not unique to organic imports into Switzerland, which allows the conclusion that Smart Mixes may provide sustainability solutions in other international supply chains.</jats:p>"

Su aplicación permite determinar las cantidades de compra y venta y los límites de variabilidad que reducen el riesgo de pérdidas y mejora la utilidad global de la cadena. Sin embargo, existe un vacío en cuanto la distribución de ingresos, debido a que este tipo de contratos busca mejorar la utilidad global a través de acuerdos en la relación proveedor-comprador, sin analizar el comportamiento de los ingresos. Este artículo propone un método hibrido que incluye el uso del valor de Shapley asimétrico como complemento al modelo de contrato. El modelo propuesto se valida en el caso de estudio de una cadena de suministro citrícola de pequeños productores de tres eslabones: productor, intermediario y detallista; la cadena es descentralizada, está descoordinada y presenta al intermediario como jugador dominante. A partir de la aplicación del modelo se determinan las cantidades óptimas de transferencia entre los eslabones que permiten la ganancia global máxima junto con una distribución equitativa de la utilidad utilizando el valor de Shapley. Posteriormente la utilidad se traduce en términos de ingreso, tanto global como para cada eslabón de la cadena.  Se concluye que es posible desde el enfoque de teoría de juegos, equilibrar las posiciones de dominancia entre los eslabones de la y mejorar la distribución de los ingresos entre cada uno de ellos.</jats:p>"

In recent times, the rise of analytics has paved the way to rethink the structure and working of vertically connected firms within a supply chain. Big data analytics (BDA) for instance, has become a prominent tool to analyse unstructured data. This study explores the application and benefit of various types of analytics such as descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics in the process of supply chain management (SCM). Additionally, the study also looks at ways by which analytics could integrally be included within the SCM curriculum in higher education to prepare future supply chain analyst.

The supply chain transformation has been widely explored in the context of standalone case studies focusing on either systems, relationships, or implications of projects to supply or manufacturing risk. The research has been limited to address the underlying reasons for variance in organizational transformations effort. This study employs a case study in an automotive supply chain, followed by a questionnaire distributed to four automotive supply chains achieving 65 responses. The findings indicate that organizational transformation can vary based on the relationship between individual eBusiness technology and its stimulus (responsive, anticipatory, and/or proactive), its scope (evolutionary vs. radical change), and the extent of organizational transformation impact (departmental and/or business unit and/or supply chain level impact). Within this context, the current study brings forth new findings in automotive supply chains in which the individual eBusiness technologies indicated a variance across the supply chains.</jats:p>",

Customers are the source of the money and information for the entire supply chain management. The equilibrium condition of the forward and backward supply chain is tight until it is reliable. But sometimes the retailers hide information from the manufacturer and this unreliability starts to propagate to the entire supply chain management. Blockchain technology is one of the secure decentralized systems to prevent unreliability. This study eliminates the unreliability of the system. A mathematical model is derived where the vendor-managed inventory policy is used by the single manufacturer to deal with multiple unreliable retailers. The entire process of manufacturing emits carbon. The carbon emission is controlled by the cap and trade policy and by paying the carbon tax. The results are found by the classical optimization technique and the numerical studies open up a way to the blockchain to deal with unreliable retailers.

We recommend that the government should dramatically increase the capacity for oxygen production as well as the production of related equipment.

The dimensions of scouring holes and their location in the dam basin should be accurately determined. Experimental models and data-driven techniques can be effectively used for estimating the dimensions of scouring holes. The focus of this paper is evaluating the effects of splitters on the downstream scour hole of overflow spillways and providing an optimized splitter configuration. The Support Vector Regression (SVR) method performance in predicting the scour hole dimensions and its location downstream of the dam has been examined using 116 experimental data. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model, we used different statistical measures. The results show that the presence of splitters decreases the slope of downstream scouring in all situations. It is also shown that the SVR method can accurately estimate the dimensions of the scour hole and its location.</jats:p>",

An injection/recovery well was established in the Dammam Formation aquifer in Kuwait. Six observation wells were also drilled nearby to monitor the water levels and quality. A three-dimensional (3D) numerical hydraulic and transport model was set up using the coupled version of MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Four scenarios of cyclic and continuous injection with different injection and pumping rates stretching over 5,400 days were investigated. Two dispersivity values, low (10 m) and high (200 m), were used in each scenario in order to establish the minimum and maximum recovery limits of useful water that can be expected from the site. The combination of injection rate of 650 m3/d and subsequent recovery at 1,000 m3/d proved to be the optimum option for the storage of water, resulting in good recovery efficiency and acceptable water quality. Based on these results, it was concluded that aquifer storage is a feasible strategy for mitigating growing water scarcity in the State of Kuwait and other countries in the larger Middle East.</jats:p>",

However, the existing DC grounding fault model is inappropriate for LVDC supply and utilization system. In order to provide an appropriate assessment model for the DC grounding fault impact on the LVDC supply and utilization system, an LVDC supply and utilization system grounding fault model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the model is derived by utilizing capacitor current and voltage as the system state variable, which considers the impact of the converter switch state on the topology of the fault circuit. The variation of system state parameters under various fault conditions can be easily obtained by inputting system state data in normal conditions as the initial value. Then, a model solution algorithm for the proposed model is utilized to calculated the maximum fault current, the system maximum fault current with different grounding resistance is simple to acquired based on the solution algorithm. The calculation results demonstrate that grounding resistance and structure of LVDC supply and utilization system have remarkable impacts on the transient current. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified in PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is appropriate for the system fault analysis under various fault conditions with different grounding resistance and the proposed model can offer theoretical guidance for system fault protection.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, it is difficult for industry managers to obtain all the demand information. Based on this, this paper aims to investigate operations and coordination for a sustainable system with a flexible cap-and-trade policy and limited demand information. Newsvendor and distribution-free newsvendor models are formulated to show the validity of limited information. Stackelberg game is exploited to derive optimal abatement and order quantity solutions under centralized and decentralized systems. The revenue-sharing and two-part tariff contracts are then proposed to coordinate the decentralized system with limited demand information. Numerical analyses complement the theoretical results. We list some major findings. Firstly, we discover that using abatement equipment can effectively reduce emissions and increase profits. Secondly, the distribution-free approach is effective and acceptable for a system where only mean and variance information is informed. Thirdly, the mean parameter has a greater impact on profits and emissions comparing with the other seven parameters. Finally, we show that both contracts may achieve perfect coordination, and the two-part tariff contract is more robust.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tumour cells often face the stress of ischemic (nutrient paucity and hypoxia) environment and must act self-sufficient to migrate toward the nearest blood supply or die. The mechanism that supports the constitutive motility of tumour cells under stress is poorly understood. We and others have previously shown that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) plays a critical role in tumour cell migration and invasion <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and tumour formation in mice. Herein we show that depletion of LRP-1 completely abolishes the self-supported and serum-independent tumour cell motility. More intriguingly, we demonstrate that LRP-1 commands the full tumour cell motility by connecting with two independent cell surface signalling pathways. First, LRP-1 mediates secreted Hsp90α signalling via the “Hsp90α &gt; LRP-1 receptor autocrine loop” for a half of tumour cell motility. Second, LRP1 stabilizes constitutively activated EGFR signalling that contributes the other half of tumour cell motility. Only combined inhibitions of the secreted Hsp90α autocrine and the EGFR signalling reproduces the effect of LRP1 down-regulation on constitutive tumour cell motility. This study reveals a novel mechanism of how tumour cells migrate in the absence of blood support.</jats:p>"

It is argued that infrastructural designs constitute specific configurations of such assemblages. While research on infrastructure is proliferating in anthropology and STS, law as a constitutive component in all its forms and manifestations has not yet been sufficiently examined from this perspective. Infrastructures enact the ordering of their constitutive components and develop their own specific legal configurations. They combine components from various legal registers with routinized social practices and the normativity of technologies and materiality. Law in infrastructure is thus in itself inherently plural. The article exemplifies what plural law does to infrastructures and how social and legal relations take on infrastructural properties. These plural technolegal entanglements are examined using a case study of one specific strand within the infrastructure of the multilayered supply chain that brings Moroccan argan oil to the global market. This strand emerged in response to the breakdown of a supply infrastructure that was set up as a model development cooperation project. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the Shuffled Grey Wolf Optimizer (SGWO), a hybrid optimization algorithm inspired by Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithms, is introduced. The main modification in the proposed algorithm is how it divides and shuffles the population to enhance the information exchange among the individuals. The performance of the SGWO algorithm is compared to famous evolutionary algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in solving mathematical benchmark functions and multiple types of reservoir operation optimization problems with different scales. Two hypothetical 4 and 10-reservoir system, and the Dez dam in Iran as a single reservoir system were selected as the case study in this research. The capability of the algorithms was compared in terms of accuracy of derived optimum objective function values, convergence speed, and stability of answers in different implementations. The results showed that the SGWO can reach considerably better results (0.3% to 26% better than the closest rival algorithms) using significantly lower number of function evaluations. It also showed the lowest standard deviation among other algorithms for all problems, which indicated the high reliability of this algorithm.</jats:p>",

In this study, a two-stage deterministic model is proposed to design a microalgae-based biofuels and co-products supply chain network (MBCSCN). In the first stage, the appropriate locations for the cultivation of microalgae are identified through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). In the second stage, a deterministic mathematical mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model is developed for a period of five years based on the criteria of economic and environmental impacts. The economic objective function maximizes the overall profit, while the environmental impacts objective function seeks to minimize the consumed fossil fuel throughout the supply chain. Then, a multi-objective MILP optimization problem is solved using the ε-constraint method. The proposed model is evaluated through a case study in Iran. It has helped to identify appropriate locations for the cultivation of microalgae and to specify the required quantity of feedstock, the species of microalgae, the required technology, and the transportation modes in each step of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Study investigated the agribusiness opportunities, marketing channels and marketing efficiency of different supply chain systems for two important fruit crops kinnow and aonla (Indian gooseberry) in Rajasthan. Two districts, viz. Sriganganagar and Jaipur, having highest area under cultivation of these crops in the state, were purposively selected. Information was collected from 120 farmers, 30 wholesalers (traders/Contractors) and 30 retailers during the year 2009-2011 for both the crops. Further 25% of sample households were again revisited during 2019-20 to find changes in marketing of these selected fruit crops. The producers' share in consumer's rupee was 32% and 28% for kinnow and aonla, respectively. The marketing efficiency index in dominant channel was 0.48 in kinnow and 0.38 in aonla. The most common and important constraint in marketing of fruits was cartelisation among traders. The imperfect market structure forces the farmers to enter into a forward contract that sets a minimum price, rather at the dissatisfaction of the farmer, as an insurance against possible lower price at later stages. Establishment of multi-fruit processing units in production area, development of infrastructure at major market centres, and establishing export value chain for kinnow and necessary support/incentives for orchard management for timely disposal of kinnow fruits are suggested as strategies to improve the marketing efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition : We examine a dynamic assignment problem faced by a large wireless service provider (WSP) that is a Fortune 100 company. This company manages two warranties: (i) a customer warranty that the WSP offers its customers and (ii) an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranty that OEMs offer the WSP. The WSP uses devices refurbished by the OEM as replacement devices, and hence their warranty operation is a closed-loop supply chain. Depending on the assignment the WSP uses, the customer and OEM warranties might become misaligned for customer-device pairs, potentially incurring a cost for the WSP. Academic/practical relevance : We identify, model, and analyze a new dynamic assignment problem that emerges in this setting called the warranty matching problem. We introduce a new class of policies, called farsighted policies, which can perform better than myopic policies. We also propose a new heuristic assignment policy, the sampling policy, which leads to a near-optimal assignment. Our model and results are motivated by a real-world problem, and our theory-guided assignment policies can be used in practice; we validate our results using data from our industrial partner. Methodology : We formulate the problem of dynamically assigning devices to customers as a discrete-time stochastic dynamic programming problem. Because this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose and analyze a set of reasonable classes of assignment policies. Results : The performance metric that we use for a given assignment policy is the average time that a replacement device under a customer warranty is uncovered by an OEM warranty. We show that our assignment policies reduce the average uncovered time and the expected number of out-of-OEM-warranty returns by more than 75% in comparison with our industrial partner’s current assignment policy. We also provide distribution-free bounds for the performance of a myopic assignment policy and of random assignment, which is a proxy for the WSP’s current policy. Managerial implications : Our results indicate that, in closed-loop supply chains, being completely farsighted might be better than being completely myopic. Also, policies that are effective in balancing short-term and long-term costs can be simple and effective, as illustrated by our sampling policy. We describe how the performance of myopic and farsighted policies depend on the size and length of inventory buildup. </jats:p>",

Model structure and I/O device characterization along with extraction procedure were described. The last stage of the I/O buffer is modelled as nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance voltage (C-V) functions capturing the nonlinear dynamic impedances of the pull-up and pull-down transistors. The mathematical model structure of the predriver was derived from the analysis of the large-signal electrical circuit switching behavior. Accordingly, a generic and surrogate multilayer neural network (NN) structure was considered in this work. Timing series data which reflects the nonlinear switching behavior of the multistage predriver’s circuit PGSV variations, were used to train the NN model. The proposed model was implemented in the time-domain solver and validated against the reference transistor level (TL) model and the state-of-the-art input-output buffer information specification (IBIS) behavioral model under different scenarios. The analysis of jitter was performed using the eye diagrams plotted at different metrics values.</jats:p>"

The pandemic emergence has a direct effect on the health system, negatively affecting its capacity as depletion of resources are now channelled to curb the emergency of the communicable disease, especially among individuals living with HIV disease which drew our attention to how individuals suffering from HIV and people who needed to know their HIV status has not been able to visit the health facilities due to the effect of coronavirus pandemic on the supply of the test kits used in the health facilities. This study evaluated the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the supply chain of HIV test kits in Ondo State, Nigeria. The primary objective was to determine the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the supply of HIV test kits in Ondo State. The research was a sequential cross-sectional design using a quantitative method of analysis with a total sample size of 100 respondents with all samples drawn from 30 supported health facilities in the state. In addition, literature review was also used to know the effect of the coronavirus on reach of 95% of UNAIDS 2030 target.  The study used both descriptive and inferential methods of data analysis where the descriptive statistics comprise of frequency distribution, percentage distribution, weighted mean score, and standard deviation while the inferential method of data analysis used ordinal least square (simple linear regression) to determine the effect of coronavirus pandemic on the supply chain test kits. Findings from the result concluded that pandemic and the methods of supply chain management indicated a significant effect. In addition, from the review the major impacts of COVID-19 were innovation, increased technology, research and development, depletion of supply chain personnel. Therefore, there is a need to develop national guidelines on supply chain strategy for emergencies in Nigeria as well as adhere strictly to some recommendations made in the study.</jats:p>"

The only source of water to the University community is ground water extracted through boreholes constructed at different locations in the University. Eighteen (18) storage and distribution reservoirs were assessed to assess their capacity to adequately supply water for the present and future population of students and staff within the institution. FUTA had a population of 28,419 in 2019, the staff made up 9.16% of the total population while the students constituted the remaining 90.84%. A 30-year population projection was made for both staff and students using the geometric increase method of population forecasting. The study revealed that the population of FUTA will grow to 62,280 persons in 2049 from 28,419 in 2019 assuming a constant growth rate of 2.65% while the current average daily water demand of the University community is 1,475.83 m3/day. The current yield of water from the boreholes in FUTA is 1,198.07 m3/day which is not sufficient to meet the daily water demands of the University community. The maximum possible yield from the boreholes is 2,443.68 m3/day under normal conditions involving stable power supply and adequate personnel. Furthermore, it is projected that by the year 2049, the average daily water demand of the University community would be 2,995.74 m3/day. The outcome of this study revealed that there is water shortage in FUTA and the situation would worsen as the years go by if adequate measures are not put in place. The construction of a dam and water treatment plant is recommended to meet the increasing water demands occasioned by increase in population .Keywords – Potable, water, demand, supply, boreholes</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management has traditionally emphasized managing the physical flow of parts and finished goods. The next natural evolutionary step is developing the management of supply chain finance across multiple trading partners. One of these opportunities requires investigation of managing payment discounts. Traditionally, suppliers offer a discount to buyers to encourage earlier payment. Terms such as 2/10 n/30 allow for a 2% discount if the entire purchase is paid in full within the 10-day discount period instead of the customary 30 days. This 2% payment reduction translates into the equivalent of an annual return of 36%, resulting in the traditional rule of thumb to take the discount whenever possible. For a variety of reasons, only a small percentage of buyers actually are capturing these high returns. There is a disconnect between trading partners for using discounts for managing working capital across the supply. This paper explores the beneficial impact of participating in early payment discount programs, potential reasons for failing to capture discounts and possible solutions and offers research questions to guide future research to aid in improving this supply chain finance opportunity.</jats:p>"

This paper, as part of an emerging subject, reviews the literature between 2010 and 2021 that integrates sustainability and resilience on the SCND. The article classifies the literature according to the levels of the SCND, levels of the decision-making (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational), resilience and sustainability criteria, solving approach, objective criteria, contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and real-world applications. The main findings allow us to conclude that the decisions regarding the supply chain network design with sustainability and resilience criteria are mainly strategic, focusing on the forward flow. Most works address resilience through the evaluation of scenarios (risk assessment perspective), and in terms of the sustainability perspective, authors mainly focus on the economic dimension through the evaluation of income and costs along the chain. Based on the review and the proposed taxonomy, the paper proposes ideas for future research.</jats:p>"

Estimates of average per capita supply of vitamin D, as calculated using information from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) national food balance sheets (FBSs) can be used as proxy measures for vitamin D intake within a population. In the present work, FAO national FBSs (from 2004 to 2017) for 173 to 178 countries around the globe were used to generate such average per capita vitamin D supply estimates. For countries where food fortification with vitamin D was common, the estimates accounted for this. Using the 2004–2013 FBS data, there was a large range in average per capita vitamin D supply ranging from 0.3 (Ethiopia) to 17.8 (Maldives) μg/d. Globally, 40, 60, 70, four, two, and two countries had average per capita vitamin D supply estimates &lt;1.5, 1.6–3, 3.1–5.5, 5.6–7.5, 7.6–10, and &gt;10 μg/d, respectively. Pelagic fish was the major contributory food commodity (supplying 53%–86%) in countries with supply &gt;7.6 μg/d. Median per capita vitamin D supply estimates for constituent countries within Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania were 1.4, 2.7, 2.8, 4.1, and 4.7 μg/d, respectively. These overall supply trends were mirrored in the newer, 2014–2017 FBS data. Fortification of milk and dairy or wheat flour with vitamin D had an important impact on the vitamin D supply estimates (average increments of 1.6 and 3.1 μg/d, respectively). Overall, the work showed how the per capita daily vitamin D supply estimates, as surrogate for vitamin D intake data, can highlight countries where inadequacy of supply may be of concern. It also shows how fortification of food with vitamin D can have an important impact on addressing low vitamin D intake. © 2021 The Author. <jats:italic>JBMR Plus</jats:italic> published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</jats:p>",

Our results strongly support significant positive association between prices and money supply thus supports monetarist view that growth in money supply causes inflation and rising behavior of prices is detrimental to real output. The accelerated inflation has obstructed real output and reduced output levels has further caused jump in price levels during the investigated period. The empirical results also supports significant bi-directional relationship between prices and money supply. Prudent monetary policy is need of hour to stabilize prices in order to minimize its adverse impacts on real output.</jats:p>"

An overview of the main directions of domestic and foreign research in the field of using these systems to increase the capacity and energy efficiency of power supply systems is given. Modeling the operation of energy storage system in traction power supply is based on the calculation of load graphs within the boundaries of inter-substation zones, formed depending on the conditions for the passage of trains and traction load on the railway section. The main provisions of the method for choosing locations and determining the parameters of energy storage system in traction power supply are considered. On the example of one of the inter-substation zones of the Sverdlovsk railway, the influence of the power of the active sectioning station on the increase in the minimum voltage level at the pantograph of the electric rolling stock is shown. The graphs of the degree of charge and the corresponding frequency distributions are given, which make it possible to evaluate the operating conditions of the electric energy storage system depending on the conditions for the formation of the traction load, as well as the graphs of the load of the electric energy storage system and the corresponding charging characteristics for the operating conditions at the sectioning post. On the example of the section under consideration, the dependence of the discharge depth of the electric energy storage system on the nominal energy intensity is shown. Based on the results of calculations, an evaluation was made of the options for passing train batches in the even and odd direction in comparison with the schedule of the performed train operation. The range of variation of the nominal values of power and energy intensity of the electric energy storage system is obtained. Comparison of the accumulation system parameters for single- and double-track sections of railways, including those with a predominance of passenger traffic, is carried out.</jats:p>"

The scientific purpose of the study is to report, analyze and evaluate backgrounds, causes of instabilities and their effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply and demand side of the meat market in the United States of America, China and Russia. The practical purpose of the study is to present implemented measures and recommendations on how to return to meat market equilibrium. In the theoretical part of the study, the revised public source of information coming from well-known organizations such as: EC, FAO, OECD, and WB, are used. In the practical part of the manuscript, qualitative research on the People’s Republic of China, Russian Federation, and the United States of America, along with semi-structured in-depth interviews with experts and Ishikawa diagram are presented. The primary data come from authors’ own research and collection of multiple sources. The article indicates the use of qualitative systematic review, supported by a creation of a prototype of the issues of maintaining continuity of the food supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in the secondary sources, intensified by a keyword search. The results of the research are diverse and oriented toward the needs of the analyzed meat markets. In the case of the People’s Republic of China, the solution is to develop a system of subsidies and preferential rates for the use of rail transport in exports. In the case of Russia, the solution is to provide support to the meat and poultry farmers for cold storage of slaughtered animals. In the case of the USA, the solution is to develop technical and technological facilities in order to speed up the supply chain between local livestock with meat and poultry farmers. Moreover, the outcomes indicate that sustainability of the food supply chain needs well-thought-out support on agri-food supply production.</jats:p>"

Data collection was done using structured questionnaires, key informant interviews, checklists and data from the national health information system.ResultsThe response rate was 97.3% for the questionnaires and 100% for the key informant interviews. The prevailing inventory management practices were: use of scheduled inventory control model (80.95%), forecasting demand using previous consumption data (100%), keeping accurate and updated stock records for each commodity (92.31%), having essential logistical data in reports (100%), including safety stock (61.54%) when ordering and keeping ARV medicines in dedicated stores (75%). With the exception of order lead time (17.98 days), the other supply chain performance metrics namely stock out rate (52.12%), stock wastage rate (43.2%), and reporting rates (70.84%) were found to be deficient. The challenges mostly affecting inventory management included inadequate staff and training, lack of proper storage, and unreliable supply of medicines.ConclusionInventory management practices were according to the recommended best approaches despite various challenges. The supply chain performance metrics evaluated, with the exception of order lead time, were all found to be unsatisfactory owing to the high stock out rates, below par reporting rates and high stock wastage rate due to expiries discovered. Adoption of an electronic inventory system, use of data for decision making, dedicated storage of ARV medicines, and inclusion of buffer stock, are some strategies to improve inventory management.Rwanda J Med Health Sci 2021;4(2): 257-268</jats:p>"

Despite the importance of predicting future rates of coastal erosion, few prehistoric constraints exist on the relative importance of sediment supplied by coastal erosion versus rivers with respect to past sea-level change. We used detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology as a provenance tracer of river and deep-sea fan deposits from the Southern California Borderland (United States) to estimate relative sediment contributions from rivers and coastal erosion from late Pleistocene to present. Mixture modeling of submarine canyon and fan samples indicates that detrital zircon was dominantly (55%–86%) supplied from coastal erosion during latest Pleistocene (ca. 13 ka) sea-level rise, with lesser contributions from rivers, on the basis of unique U-Pb age modes relative to local Peninsular Ranges bedrock sources. However, sediment that was deposited when sea level was stable at its highest and lowest points since the Last Glacial Maximum was dominantly supplied by rivers, suggesting decreased coastal erosion during periods of sea-level stability. We find that relative sediment supply from coastal erosion is strongly dependent on climate state, corroborating predictions of enhanced coastal erosion during future sea-level rise.</jats:p>",

Ignoring financial flows, regardless of the quality of freight transport and information, could lead the organization to a state of bankruptcy, which is a situation directly resulting from a lack of control over financial inputs/outputs. This study proposes a multi-product mathematical model, which makes it possible to choose among suppliers, manufacturing sites, distribution centres, retailers, and transportation vehicles. The purpose of the model is to integrate physical and material dimensions to maximize net corporate profits through inbound and outbound financial flows; it involves payment mechanisms between the financial and physical flows through maximizing the cash flows of manufacturing sites and suppliers, as two conflicting objectives that must consider the reciprocal effects of their decisions. These objectives are calculated by subtracting costs from the revenue; this process, of course, will ultimately result in an optimization of the organization’s financial flow. To solve the proposed mathematical model, the study relies on two algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Imperialist Competition Algorithm (ICA). The sample under investigation is solved separately using the three algorithms, and results are then compared. The observations of the study reveal the better performance of PSO.</jats:p>",

Actor-Network Theory (ANT) was incorporated as a theoretical lens to make sense of how both human and non-human actors have influenced the tea export planning process. The study adopted the single-site case study approach under the qualitative methodology. Data has been mainly collected through interviews carried on with the top, middle and lower level managerial employees. In light of ANT, the findings of this study illustrate that human actors: tea department personnel, shipping department personnel, new product development (NPD) team and accounts manager influence the tea export planning process through knowledge, skills and experience. Further, the study reveals that non-human actors: auction system, multiple supplier base, supplier evaluation process, ERP system, shipment scheduling process, government entities and transactional process influence the tea export planning through providing information, facilitating communication and ensuring transparency. The study suggests that the managers and practitioners attached to export oriented companies should be conscious about the influencing factors of each human and non-human actor of the supply chain in the process of planning exports and in solving strategic and operational issues when operating within and beyond Asia. Furthermore, this study aims to fill the lacuna in supply chain and export literature through exploring the supply chain actors (human and non-human) and their influence on the export planning process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>There is clear evidence that existing preferential schemes contributed significantly to boosting least-developed country (LDC) exports (Klasen et al., 2016). Many seem to believe the multilateral trading system could offer little to LDCs as they have already obtained market access to critical markets under the current preferential schemes. Despite the LDCs’ reluctance to positively engage in recent WTO discussions, there is room for the global trading system and new multilateral initiatives to promote the participation of LDCs in global value chains (GVCs). Given that LDC exports are often further processed and ‘travel’ down the GVCs as part of third-country exports still facing tariffs, one could envisage a global preferential scheme based on LDC value-added, i.e., products originating in any WTO members should receive an ‘LDC preferential treatment’ proportionate to the value of LDC’s inputs content embodied in their exports, whenever exported to any other WTO member. We conceptualize this new ‘GVCs for LDCs’ proposal and estimate its economic potential using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework. If LDC preferential market access is changed from the simple ‘direct export’ approach (e.g., the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)-like schemes currently in operation) to a GVC approach, LDC exports would receive a considerable boost (a 2.5% annual increase worth over USD 10 billion per year) and increased market premium for their products.</jats:italic></jats:p>\n<jats:p>WTO, World Trade Organisation, CGE modelling, GTAP, development, Least Developed Countries, LDCs, global value chains, GVC, Generalized System of Preferences, GSP</jats:p>",

It is based on the upstream traditional vegetable and fruit supply chains in Sri Lanka and hopes to provide a basic understanding for future research. The research focuses on Thambuththegama and Nuwara Eliya dedicated economic centers which were established to collect vegetables directly from farmers. Research Method : Novel methods such as value stream mapping and system dynamics were used to map the supply chain and post-harvest waste for the first time in Sri Lanka. Value stream mapping was used to identify value-adding and nonvalue-adding activities. From the knowledge gained through literature and industry inputs a causal loop diagram was drafted. Findings : The causal loop diagrams show that lack of communication platforms, poor practices in handling vegetables, weather conditions and the number of intermediaries affect more towards postharvest waste. To reduce post-harvest waste, the government should invest more in awareness programs for the actors in the supply chain and relevant infrastructure. The research finds that inability to control the transpiration and respiration process of the harvested vegetables, unawareness of the issues among the value chain actors and operational inefficiencies are the main causes for post-harvest waste. Value : Future researchers can base the drafted causal loop diagram and develop a simulation model to increase operational efficiency and reduce post-harvest waste in the system.</jats:p>"

The study aimed to explore the impacts of chemical fertilizer on arsenic mobilization in the sedimentary deposition of the alluvial Bengal delta plain. It selected ten comparatively highly affected districts and the least affected two divisions as a referral study site. The countrywide pooled concentration of arsenic in groundwater was 109.75 μg/L (52.59, 166.91) at a 95% confidence interval, which was double the national guideline value (50 μg/L). The analysis results showed a strong positive correlation (r ≥ 0.5) of arsenic with NO3, NH4, PO4, SO4, Ca, and K, where a portion of those species originated from fertilizer leaching into groundwater. The results showed that PO4 played a significant role in arsenic mobilization, but the role of NO3, SO4, and NH4 was not clear at certain lithological conditions. It also showed that clay, peat, silt-clay, and rich microbial community with sufficiently organic carbon loaded soils could lead to an increase in arsenic mobilization. Finally, the study observed that the overall lithological conditions are the main reason for the high arsenic load in the study area.</jats:p>",

Methods. The study used the method of content analysis; a search was carried out in the search engines Google and Yandex for the keywords, «buy a pharmacy», «a drug store to buy a drug», «online pharmacy». TOP 25 pharma- cy websites were subjected to logical, comparative and structural analysis. The study consisted of 2 stages: an anal- ysis of the requirements of regulatory documents for pharmaceutical consulting when selling OTC drugs and an as- sessment of pharmacy websites in terms of ensuring compliance with these requirements when carrying out online commerce. Results. Studies of online pharmacy websites showed that most of the sites did not fully comply with the regulated require- ments: a pharmaceutical license is presented on 80% of sites, information on the type of pharmacy organization, on the impossibility of returning and exchanging pharmacy goods - on 76% of sites. The choice of OTC drugs based on symptoms within the framework of responsible self-medication was available on 24% of Internet pharmacy sites, but there were no indications of symptoms requiring immediate medical attention. Links to the State Register of Maximum Selling Prices were available on 8% of Internet pharmacy sites. Conclusion. Comparative analysis of information requirements in relation to pharmaceutical consulting in a pharmacy, reg- ulated by Orders of the Ministry of Health of Russia No. 80 «On approval of the Industry standard» Rules for the dispensing (sale) of medicines in pharmacies. Basic provisions «and No. 647n dated 31.08.2016» On approval of the Rules Good Pharma- cy Practice of Medicinal Products for Medical Use ”, Government Decree No. 697 of May 16, 2020“ On Approval of the Rules for Issuing Permits for Remote Retail Sale of Medicinal Products for Medical Use, Implementation of Such Trade ... ”, showed that most of the requirements for offline pharmacy were reflected in relation to Internet pharmacies, however, as a result of the analysis of Internet pharmacy websites, it was found that these requirements are not fully met. Additional criteria for evaluating online pharmacy sites corresponding to the level of pharmaceutical care in an offline pharmacy are proposed: the ability to select an OTC drug by symptoms within the framework of responsible self-medication, the presence of indications of symptoms that require immediate medical attention, the presence of instructions for the medical use of the drug in in ac- cordance with the State Register of Medicines, ensuring access to the State Register of maximum selling prices, availability of information on the actual shelf life of the medicinal products being sold.</jats:p>",

The possibility of a joint application of graphs, describing the features for the functioning of the protection system of smart power supply networks, and artificial neural in order to predict and detect cyberattacks is considered. The novelty of the obtained results lies in the fact that, on the basis of experimental studies, a methodology for managing the protection system of smart power supply networks in conditions of cyberattacks is substantiated. It is based on the specification of the protection system by using flat graphs and implementing a neural network with long short-term memory, which makes it possible to predict with a high degree of accuracy and fairly quickly the impact of cyberattacks. The issues of software implementation of the proposed approach are considered. The experimental results obtained using the generated dataset confirm the efficiency of the developed methodology. It is shown that the proposed methodology demonstrates up to a 30% gain in time for detecting cyberattacks in comparison with known solutions. As a result, the survivability of the Self-monitoring, Analysis and Reporting technology (SMART) grid (SG) fragment under consideration increased from 0.62 to 0.95.</jats:p>"

The retailer’s selling price follows a decreasing function of the free-riding behavior coefficient. while the online direct selling price does an increasing function of the free-riding behavior coefficient. Under centralized decision-making, there is no quantum entanglement, so the quantum game solution is consistent with the classical game solution. Under decentralized decision-making, the optimal price and profit of the quantum game are higher than those of the classical game when the quantum entanglement degree is greater than zero.

In this study, a new piezoelectric PVDF fiber membrane was prepared by electrospinning process, and a piezoelectric anticorrosive film was fabricated based on the internal environment of the pipeline. In the simulated water supply pipeline environment, based on the principle of the piezoelectric effect and the principle of cathodic protection, the electrochemical corrosion protection effect of piezoelectric materials in the water supply pipeline environment, under different water quality conditions, was investigated by a single factor experiment. The results show that piezoelectric anti-corrosion tablets have an obvious inhibitory effect on pipeline corrosion under different pH values, ammonium nitrate concentrations, chloride ion concentrations, and sulfate ion concentrations. Furthermore, under the conditions of pH neutral, alkaline, and high ion concentration, the piezoelectric anti-corrosion sheet can protect the pipeline by 100%. Additionally, since the piezoelectric material can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and does not cause pollution during the experiment, it has good environmental and economic benefits. The use of piezoelectric materials for preventing corrosion of pipelines is a frontier exploration. We believe that the improvement and development of material properties, and the combination of these new materials and traditional techniques, will provide new ideas and methods for pipeline anti-corrosion technology.\n</jats:p>",

A total of 27 health care workers in 27 health facilities were interviewed for availability of vaccines and their experience in using electronic immunization system in supply chain system functioning using structured questionnaires. The data from the vaccines manual ledger and electronic TImR system were also collected administered in April-June, 2019 specifically for Bacillus-Calmette Guerin (BCG), Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus-Hepatis B-Haemophilus influenza type b (DPT-HepB-Hib), bi-oral polio vaccine (bOPV), Measles-Rubella and Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine (HPV). These data were analyzed by statistical software SPSS using one sample T test and 95% confidence interval.ResultsThe study affirmed that the mean numbers of children registered at the health facilities using electronic immunization registry was 1.5-3 times higher than the target population for the three months preceding the study given by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The number of doses for the studied vaccines (DPT-HepB-Hib, measles rubella, HPV, BCG and bOPV) were found to be different in the manual and electronic TImR systems. Also, the number of doses available at the health facilities increased significantly with the number of the electronic system registered children.ConclusionThis study found that the adoption of Electronic immunization registry has improved the health supply chain in terms of improving the vaccines availability.

We carried out stakeholder consultation workshops, key informant interviews and a knowledge, practices, and awareness survey with actors of the veterinary drug supply chain. We also profiled drugs stored in 23 urban and peri-urban drug shops in Lira and Mukono districts to record the commonly sold drugs. The veterinary drug supply chain is made of several actors including wholesalers, retailers, Animal Health Service Providers (AHSP) and farmers. Nearly ninety per cent of drug retailers and veterinary practitioners did not receive specialized training in veterinary medicine, and most of veterinary practitioners have been in the drug business market for more than 10 years. Antibiotics and anti-helminthics were the most stocked drugs by retailers, with antibiotics ranking highest in terms of contribution to annual financial profits, accounting for 33%. The choice of a drug by veterinary practitioners was mainly informed by past success with efficacy of the drug, and financial capacity of the client (the farmer) to meet the treatment cost. Many veterinary practitioners were not conversant with veterinary drug policies of the country, with Mukono having a higher number (72%) compared to Lira (37%). Veterinary practitioners from Lira district compared to Mukono and those mainly serving small scale farmers relative to large scale smallholders were more knowledgeable about antibiotics and AMR. Several supply chain constraints were identified as potential drivers of misuse of antibiotics that could contribute to AMR. These included low level of education of supply chain actors, particularly drug retailers, poor handling of drugs at purchase and administration practices, low enforcement of policies and regulations, and lack of awareness of stakeholders about policies that regulate drug use. Thus, future interventions to reduce misuse of AM drugs in livestock production systems in Uganda such as capacity building, should also target veterinary input suppliers, and deliberately involve a strong policy advocacy component.</jats:p>"

It adopts the self-testing and closed-loop credit model to control funds and risks. It is an efficient route for SMEs to solve the problem of financing. However, at present, the market of supply chain finance in China still faces problems such as the inability of credit disassembly of core enterprises, which seriously hinder the development of the supply chain finance industry. Blockchain technology featuring decentralization, tamper-proofing and traceability had been widely adopted in the field of finance and provided a new vision to solve the bottleneck for the development of supply chain finance. In this paper, with regard to the characteristics of supply chain finance, we propose a novel blockchain-driven architecture to reshape the business process of supply chain finance, and we introduce the underlying technical implementations in detail. Our contributions in this paper include (1) proposing a novel technical architecture of blockchain-driven supply chain finance management system and detailing its underlying implementations; (2) designing the mechanism of the credit disassembly, which is implemented by blockchain technology, to improve financing efficiency; and (3) exploring the impact and potential of blockchain technology in traditional business models (e.g., receivables financing, inventory financing and prepayment financing) in supply chain finance. </jats:p>"

The study population comprised 12 Health Centers in Juba where inventory management was practiced. Both questionnaire‐guided interviews for staff self‐assessment, and observer assessment were used by the researcher. With regard to storage and inventory management, the researcher collected data on the condition of storerooms with regards to availability of enough storage space, availability of enough storage equipment, and temperature conditions of the medicines stores, among others.ResultsThe study found that store and inventory management practices varied widely in the different health facilities. Hospitals and central medical stores exhibited good or average inventory and storeroom management practices, respectively. The two hospitals and medical stores scored 100% in the elements in the assessment of storerooms and stock management. Some primary health care centers exhibited good inventory and store room management practice, whilst others were rated as average or poor. Most of the elements assessed scored 37% in storeroom assessment while elements assessed for inventory management scored less than 75%. There was great similarity between the observation assessment and the self-assessment.ConclusionIn conclusion, store and inventory management practices and knowledge of the respondents varied in the different health facilities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition : This paper explores the impact of competition between platforms in the sharing economy. Examples include the cases of Uber and Lyft in the context of ride-sharing platforms. In particular, we consider competition between two platforms that offer a common service (e.g., rides) through a set of independent service providers (e.g., drivers) to a market of customers. Each platform sets a price that is charged to customers for obtaining the service provided by a driver. A portion of that price is paid to the driver who delivers the service. Both customers’ and drivers’ utilities are sensitive to the payment terms set by the platform and are also sensitive to congestion in the system (given by the relative number of customers and drivers in the market). We consider two possible settings. The first one, termed “single-homing,” assumes that drivers work through a single platform. In the second setting, termed “multihoming” (or “multiapping,” as it is known in practice), drivers deliver their service through both platforms. Academic/practical relevance : This is one of the first papers to study competition and multihoming in the presence of congestion effects typically observed in the sharing economy. We leverage the model to study some practical questions that have received significant press attention (and stirred some controversies) in the ride-sharing industry. The first involves the issue of surge pricing. The second involves the increasingly common practice of drivers choosing to operate on multiple platforms (multihoming). Methodology : We formulate our problem as a pricing game between two platforms and employ the concept of a Nash equilibrium to analyze equilibrium outcomes in various settings. Results : In both the single-homing and multihoming settings, we study the equilibrium prices that emerge from the competitive interaction between the platforms and explore the supply and demand outcomes that can arise at equilibrium. We build on these equilibrium results to study the impact of surge pricing in response to a surge in demand and to examine the incentives at play when drivers engage in multihoming. Managerial implications : We find that raising prices in response to a surge in demand makes drivers and customers better off than if platforms were constrained to charge the same prices that would arise under normal demand levels. We also compare drivers’ and customers’ performance when all drivers either single-home or multihome. We find that although individual drivers may have an incentive to multihome, all players are worse off when all drivers multihome. We conclude by proposing an incentive mechanism to discourage multihoming. </jats:p>",

First, mask manufacturers are mainly small and mid-size enterprises, resulting in a lack of funds and credit lines for the introduction of equipment. Second, the periodicity and uncertainty of pandemics create overcapacity risk for the mask emergency supply chain. To solve these problems, this study incorporates financial leasing institutions and the government into the mask emergency supply chain. Based on a questionnaire survey of practitioners of financial leasing institutions, the relationship between mask manufacturers, financial leasing institutions, and the government in the mask supply chain is analyzed through a game model, and the behavior of mask manufacturers to reduce the scale of mask production after the occurrence of overcapacity is investigated using the cusp catastrophe theory. We find that in the case of masks’ overcapacity, mask manufacturers tend to continue production. Finally, we propose that financial leasing institutions should lease mask production equipment to mask manufacturers under the guarantee of the government and develop a mechanism for the three parties to jointly share the risk of mask overcapacity, aiming at ensuring the sustainable manufacturing of masks during the pandemic.</jats:p>"

Various energy sources are often explored depending on the region – for example, wind, solar, geothermal, and bioenergy. The Piedmont region of the USA has the potential to be a significant player in the production of biomass to supply a biorefinery. However, before local agencies and private biorefineries can invest in such an endeavor, the potential feedstock supply must be quantified. The goal of this study was to perform a land‐use assessment for the 166 counties spanning five states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama) that make up the bulk of the Piedmont region. For each county, the potential for producing and supplying herbaceous feedstock (i.e., switchgrass) was quantified based on 2017 land use. Only 48% of the counties had the potential to supply a biorefinery larger than 0.5 round bales per min (bpm) (97 000 Mg year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>). To supply a more reasonably sized biorefinery, the Piedmont counties were organized into 34 multi‐county zones. For these zones, the potential switchgrass production to supply a biorefinery ranged from 50 000 Mg year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> to 360 000 Mg year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. The total feedstock production for the region was 6 470 000 Mg year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, equal to a potential production of about 3.3% of the current US consumption of ethanol for blending with gasoline. The development of a bioenergy industry in the Piedmont will require local leadership and initiative; however, this study provides the first step in envisioning the potential of such an industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

The findings are that there weredisrupted supply and demand in the production-consumption chain resulting in low sales; a shortage of hired labor; and high stigmatization. Farmers had few alternatives other than to leave their food stuff to rot on the farm, use the produce to feed livestock, or smuggleof the produce across borders.

The authors suggest that partial harvesting – the removal of a proportion of timber in a mature stand several years before a final cut is carried out – is a promising opportunity in the ESB-affected area for mitigating mid-term timber supply shortages by smoothing the fibre supply over time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The water footprint (WF) concept is a generally accepted tool introduced in 2002. Many studies applied water footprinting, indicating impacts of human consumption on freshwater, especially from agriculture. Although the WF includes supply chains, presently it excludes irrigation supply chains and non-beneficial evapotranspiration, and calculations for agriculture start from crop water requirements. We present a conceptual framework distinguishing between traditional (net) WFs and proposed gross WFs, defined as the sum of net WFs and irrigation supply chain related blue WFs and as the sum of green WFs and green WFs of weeds. Many water management studies focused on blue water supply efficiency, assessing water losses in supply chain links. The WF concept, however, excludes water flows to stocks where water remains available and recoverable, e.g. to usable groundwater, in contrast to many water management approaches. Also, many studies focused on irrigation technology improvement to save water. We argue that not only irrigation technology should be considered, but whole water supply chains, also distinguishing between surface and groundwater, to improve efficient blue water use in agriculture. This framework is applied to the Pakistani part of the Indus basin that includes the largest man-made irrigation network in the world. The gross blue WF is 1.6 times the net blue WF leading to a K value (ratio of gross and net blue WF) of 0.6. Surface water losses vary between 45 and 49 %, groundwater losses between 18 and 21 %. Presently, efficient irrigation receives much attention. However, it is important to take irrigation supply chains into account to improve irrigation efficiency. Earlier WF studies showing water scarcity in many regions underestimate agricultural water consumption if supply chains are neglected. More water efficient agriculture should take supply chain losses into account probably requiring water management adaptations, which is more a policy than an agriculture task.\n                        </jats:p>"

However, with the enhancement of spatial connection, industry-oriented population flow is becoming more and more active. The floating demographic dividend will bring new opportunities to regional development. Population flow has become an important field of urban research. We selected the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration as the study area and conducted the study of the interaction relationship between population flow and industry space supply. Considering that it takes time for space supplies to be industrial entities and then to affect population flow, this study built a fixed-effects model with annual space supply and “t + 1” population flow to perform regression analysis. The main findings of the research can be concluded as below. The regional population flow was mainly rural population and floated mainly to rural areas. It is difficult to complete the urbanization of floating population through land urbanization due to China’s household registration system. The population flow is sensitive to industry space supply and its spatial development conditions. As the study area is an important global urban agglomeration and China’s political, economic, and cultural center, its regional population flow is representative and typical. Guiding its population flow to form a coordinated spatial and social network can provide scientific support for regional industry space supply and allocation, and can provide a reference for the development of other urban agglomerations.</jats:p>"

The study targeted 359 projects of various types across the constituency. However, for efficiency and accessibility, a sample of 60 projects were selected using stratified random sampling where the different categories of projects form the strata from which samples were selected. The study employed three tools to collect data; questionnaire, interviews and record analysis review. These tools were appropriate due to the nature of data which ranged from opinions, structured data and reports on project implementation. Interviews were conducted with sub-county based officers to get in- depth information on the challenges faced by NG-CDF projects particularly those that relate to procurement. The study adopted descriptive statistics to analyze data which is presented by use of bar graphs, pie charts and tables.Findings: The study established that, there is indeed a relationship between tendering processes and project performance; 47% of the projects under study that were initiated during period delayed due to factors associated with tendering processes; Similarly, 49% of the projects studied experienced cost escalations during the implementation period. 60% had to be redone at certain stages of project implementation. Further the study established that the effects of faulty processes included: late deliveries; non-purchase of required items; escalation of procurement budget; delivery of small quantities; delivery of wrong material sizes; non-delivery of ordered items; overpricing among others.Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends the need to enhance supplier performance through; cross-functional team working of relevant county and national government departments, focused supplier development processes which includes training through continuous exposure to relevant regulatory requirements and improvement in the quality of Project Management Committee membership devoid of political inclinations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain efficiency, especially for the pharmaceutical (pharma) supply chain due to its unique characteristics. However, limited data have prevented forecasters from pursuing advanced models. Such problems exist even when long history of demand data is available because historical data in the distant past may bring little value as market situation changes. In the meantime, demands are also affected by many hidden factors that again require a large amount of data and more sophisticated models to capture. We propose to overcome these challenges by a novel demand forecasting framework which “borrows” time series data from many other products (cross‐series training) and trains the data with advanced machine learning models (known for detecting patterns). We further improve performance of the cross‐series models through various “grouping\" schemes, and learning from non‐demand features such as downstream inventory data across different products, information of supply chain structure, and relevant domain knowledge. We test our proposed framework with many modeling possibilities on two large datasets from major pharma manufacturers and our results show superior performance. Our work also provides empirical evidence of the value of downstream inventory information in the context of demand forecasting. We conduct prior and post‐hoc field work to ensure the applicability of the proposed forecasting approach. </jats:p>",

Supply chain dynamic capability plays an intermediary role between network relationships and SMEs’ innovation relationships. Different geographical proximity levels of the supply chain lead to different coordination interaction and knowledge sharing efficiency between upstream and downstream, which not only positively moderates the relationship between supply chain dynamic capability and SMEs’ innovation performance, but also moderates its mediating effect.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the high risk in the business environment, supply chains must adopt a tailored mechanism to deal with disruptions. This research proposes a multi-objective formulation to design a robust and resilient forward supply chain under multiple disruptions and uncertainty. The mentioned objective functions include minimizing the total cost, environmental impacts, and the network non-resiliency associated with the supply chain simultaneously countered using an augmented ε-constraint method. A Mulvey robust optimization approach is also utilized to deal with uncertainty. Ultimately, the developed model is validated based on three datasets associated with a case study of the steel industry. The results indicate that preventive and mitigation resilience strategies have significantly promoted the supply chain’s capabilities to deal with disruptions. Controlling network resiliency <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> non-resiliency measures has also created a risk-aware and robust structure in the incidence of disturbances. Numerical results reveal that multiple sourcing, lateral transshipment, and fortification of facilities will lead to the greatest cost-efficiency in the case study. Observations also indicate that the fortified supply chain will be highly economically viable in the long run due to the reduction of costs resulting from lost sales, unnecessary inventory holding, and the company’s credit risk.</jats:p>",

The given network includes production centers, potential points for establishing of distribution centers, retrieval centers, collecting and recycling centers, and the demand points. The presented model seeks to find optimal locations for distribution centers, second-hand product collection centers, and recycling centers under the uncertainty situation alongside the factory’s fixed points. The purpose of the presented model is to minimize overall network costs including processing, establishing, and transportation of products and return flows as well as environmental impacts while maximizing social scales and network flexibility according to the presence of uncertainty parameters in the problem. To solve the proposed model with fuzzy uncertainty, first, the improved epsilon (ε)-constraints approach is used to transform a multiobjective to a single-objective problem. Afterward, the Lagrangian relaxation approach is applied to effectively solve the problem. A real-world case study is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effects of important parameters on the optimal solution.</jats:p>",

In order to ensure the good operation of the e-commerce supply chain in a low-carbon environment, a supply chain scheduling optimization method based on integration of production and transportation with carbon emission constraints is proposed; we use it to analyze the impact of centralized decision-making mode and decentralized decision-making mode on supply chain scheduling and establish a scheduling optimization model that aims at optimal carbon emissions and costs. A multilevel genetic algorithm was designed according to the characteristics of the model, and numerical examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The results show that the centralized decision-making mode plays the role of the carbon emission constraints to the greatest extent; the carbon emissions and the cost are smallest in the centralized decision-making mode. The decentralized decision-making mode leads to the overall cost preference of the supply chain due to separate decisions made by enterprises, and the carbon emissions in the supply chain are greater. Transportation experts, business managers and government departments are interesting for integrated production and transportation scheduling in e-commerce supply chain with carbon emission constraints. Further research should address integrated production and transportation scheduling in dual-channel low supply chains.</jats:p>"

One way to reduce inventory levels is to use the Just In Time (JIT) method. The Just In Time (JIT) method reduces inventory levels so asto reduce costs as efficiently as possible based on the fact that Just In Time (JIT) lowers the shipping lot, as a means of applying Just In Time (JIT) within the scope of a large Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Lot. Based on this research, it can be seen that with the same data but using the Just In Time (JIT) method, the cost of raw material inventory issued is smaller than the costs incurred previously. The total inventory cost incurred before using the method is IDR 32,359,000.00 with the frequency of ordering each raw material 24 times in one period. Meanwhile, with the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method, the costs incurred amounted to IDR 17,767,620.00 with the frequency of ordering soybean and palm sugar raw materials 13 times and 20 times in one period. Using the Just In Time (JIT) method costs Rp8,883,810.00 with a frequency of ordering each raw material 4 times in one period. Based on the results of these calculations, the Just In Time (JIT) method costs more efficient inventory.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The manufacture of raw materials to deliver the product to the consumer in a traditional supply chain system is a manual process with insufficient data and transaction security. It also takes a significant amount of time, making the entire procedure lengthy. Overall, the undivided process is ineffective and untrustworthy for consumers. If blockchain and smart contract technologies are integrated into traditional supply chain management systems, data security, authenticity, time management, and transaction processes will all be significantly improved. Blockchain is a revolutionary, decentralized technology that protects data from unauthorized access. The entire supply chain management (SCM) will be satisfied with the consumer once smart contracts are implemented. The plan becomes more trustworthy when the mediator is contracted, which is doable in these ways. The tags employed in the conventional SCM process are costly and have limited possibilities. As a result, it is difficult to maintain product secrecy and accountability in the SCM scheme. It is also a common target for wireless attacks (reply attacks, eavesdropping, etc.). In SCM, the phrase “product confidentiality” is very significant. It means that only those who have been validated have access to the information. This paper emphasizes reducing the involvement of third parties in the supply chain system and improving data security. Traditional supply chain management systems have a number of significant flaws. Lack of traceability, difficulty maintaining product safety and quality, failure to monitor and control inventory in warehouses and shops, rising supply chain expenses, and so on, are some of them. The focus of this paper is on minimizing third-party participation in the supply chain system and enhancing data security. This improves accessibility, efficiency, and timeliness throughout the whole process. The primary advantage is that individuals will feel safer throughout the payment process. However, in this study, a peer-to-peer encrypted system was utilized in conjunction with a smart contract. Additionally, there are a few other features. Because this document makes use of an immutable ledger, the hacker will be unable to get access to it. Even if they get access to the system, they will be unable to modify any data. If the goods are defective, the transaction will be halted, and the customer will be reimbursed, with the seller receiving the merchandise. By using cryptographic methods, transaction security will be a feasible alternative for recasting these issues. Finally, this paper will demonstrate how to maintain the method with the maximum level of safety, transparency, and efficiency.</jats:p>",

This has forced farmers to use fuel and electricity-based pumps, which are both expensive and unsustainable. The problems related to the distribution of power and fluctuating voltages add to the ineffectiveness of the electrical pumping system. So, as a better alternative for environment-friendly and inexpensive irrigation infrastructure, this paper proposes a design methodology of a community-operated hydro-powered pump called water turbine pump (WTP). Although introduced in the 1920s, this technology has been largely ignored nowadays. Moreover, there are insufficient literature and technical documentation to support the design decisions for developers. With an objective to induce momentum in the research and development of this technology, this work presents a well-defined methodology to design a WTP using a propeller turbine directly coupled with a centrifugal pump, in reference to a site located in Bardiya, Nepal. The WTP designed using this methodology could utilize a head of 3 m and a flow rate of 150 lps to deliver 14 lps of water to a height of 14.9 m, yielding a head ratio of 1:5, with an overall efficiency of 50.5%.</jats:p>",

Qualitative information was collected via Field Observations, Key informant interviews and Focus group discussion with stakeholders ranging from leaders to laggards. A concise index of General Service Availability, Service Specific Availability and Facility Readiness was computed along with exploratory data analysis using Principal Component Analysis. Further, determinants of facility readiness were elucidated using Generalized Ordinal Logistic Model. Qualitative findings were analyzed via content analysis. Results indicated poorest readiness in lower-tier facilities with particularly abysmal readiness for basic amenities, diagnostic capacity and preparedness for emergencies and non-communicable diseases. The estimates for logistic model revealed that degree of vulnerability of facilities, type of facility and frequency of monitoring and supervision significantly impacted the readiness. Qualitative analysis divulged lack of incentives for health workers, political interference, topographical constraints and security disruptions as major barriers stymieing service provisioning in study area. </jats:p>",

The key term here is design while mass customisation, manufacturing and supply chain are the contexts from which the respective design objectives are derived. While these three areas of design are closely related, they have different focusses, which is reflected in the broader range of approaches proposed in the literature. The authors look at the literature through the lens of the product, process, and supply chain optimisation, with a variety of objectives ranging from improving product quality and variety while reducing costs, minimising environmental impacts and optimising supplier manufacture cooperation. In addition to the reviews of the approaches to DFMC, DFM and DFSC, recommendations on their practical system implementations are provided. While the authors acknowledge that the richness of the literature of each of the three design areas warrants a dedicated literature review, the main purpose of this survey is to pursue an integrated view on the three design issues faced by modern manufacturers and provide them and other related practitioners with a summary of representative approaches in the literature. Although it was not intended to conduct an exhaustive literature review of the literature, researchers from academia may still find the work useful by looking at the interactions of the three design areas from the perspective of joint‐decision making, which is the angle from which the literature is approached.</jats:p>",

The research was conducted using the example of vertebral artery syndrome in osteochondrosis of the cervical spine and somatoform dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, respectively. Several experimental studies into the dynamics of heart rate variability and differential indicators of the coordinated work of the heart and blood vessels were carried out according to the data of electrocardiography and photoplethysmography. Three experimental groups included healthy volunteers and volunteers with cerebral blood supply disorders connected with either the loss of plasticity and narrowing of brain blood vessels or their mechanical squeezing. According to the research results, statistically significant (with a significance level of less than 0.05) differences by a number of indicators were revealed between the experimental groups. A conventional discriminant analysis of the indicators of the coordinated work of the heart and blood vessels was carried out for all experimental groups in order to determine criteria for differentiating people with vertebrogenic disorders, non-vertebral disorders and healthy volunteers. It is concluded that three variables can be used for such differentiation, each of which describes the coordinated work of the heart and blood vessels in a specific way.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on Sustainable Development Goals, the European Green Deal, and the Farm to Fork Strategy in an attempt to establish a relationship with the European Union’s trade policy. Three selected components of the agri-food sector—the food supply chain, agri-food quality standards, and global trade—are examined in relation to defined sustainability aspects. The aim is to understand the interrelationship between the three components with specific regard to sustainability, to highlight their high complexity and current relevance, to contribute to systematic analysis in this area, and to present current progress. This qualitative–explorative study is empirically supported by a survey of market experts, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States is used as an example. The results show the complexity between the relationships of the three components with a focus on sustainability and reveal a deep uncertainty. The most notable results are the limited level of knowledge and the insufficient attention from business representatives to sustainability aspects. Finally, the study identifies the state of integrating a sustainable perspective into European Union trade policy and provides suggestions for further research.</jats:p>"

A supply chain includes all the facilities, tasks and activities involved in manufacturing a product from suppliers to customers. Its various elements are planning, supply and demand management, procurement of raw materials, production scheduling, distribution and delivery of products to the customer. Special structures in the supply chain have been less studied in previous research. In this paper, the supply chain and its performance evaluation are examined in the presence of non-discretionary, undesirable and negative data. For this purpose, another model of the network DEA is presented which evaluates performance of the chain in the presence of non-discretionary inputs and outputs, undesirable outputs and negative outputs even in its internal structure. The efficiency of the chain stages is also calculated using a dual model. Subsequently, 42 cement companies listed on the Tehran stock exchange were evaluated, each of which has a chain of four stages including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers. Based on the implementation of the model, six companies were found to be efficient and the rest were introduced as inefficient. Moreover, 25 cement companies in the Supplier sector, 18 companies in the manufacturing sector, seven companies in the distribution sector and finally 17 companies in the customer service sector were found to be efficient.</jats:p>",

Городские водопроводные очистные сооружения построены по типовым проектам и рассчитаны на осветление и обеззараживание умеренно загрязненной воды. В последние годы в воде водоисточника наблюдается резкое снижение концентрации взвешенных веществ и увеличение содержания органических загрязнений (в основном природного происхождения). При низкой температуре воды, высоких показателях цветности и перманганатной окисляемости возникает необходимость в постоянном контроле оптимальных доз реагентов с целью предотвращения образования в очищенной воде остаточного алюминия и перманганатной окисляемости, превышающих значения ПДК в соответствии с СанПиН 2.1.4.1074-01. Постановлением Главного санитарного врача РФ № 3 от 28 января 2021 г. утверждены и с 1 марта 2021 г. действуют в Российской Федерации новые санитарные правила и нормы: СанПиН 2.1.3684-21 и СанПиН 1.2.3685-21, требующие более жесткого подхода к качеству очищенной воды. Срок действия данных СанПиН – до 1 марта 2027 г., однако в них отсутствует переходный период для предприятий, эксплуатирующих системы водоснабжения и водоотведения, при организации и проведении санитарно-противоэпидемиологических (профилактических) мероприятий по приведению воды питьевого и хозяйственно-бытового водоснабжения в соответствие с требованиями СанПиН 2.1.3684-21 и СанПиН 1.2.3685-21. Водопроводные очистные сооружения г. Самары в переходный период нуждаются в модернизации, а некоторые – в реконструкции. Для проведения исследований, указанных в нормативных документах, необходимо обновить оборудование производственных лабораторий и расширить область их аккредитации. Оснащение аккредитованных лабораторий современными средствами всестороннего контроля качества питьевой воды позволит повысить эффективность и надежность результатов анализа.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The main source of water supply for the urban district of Samara is the Saratov reservoir. The municipal water treatment facilities were built according to the standard design and intended for clarification and disinfection of moderately polluted water. In recent years, a sharp decrease in the concentration of suspended solids and an increase in the concentration of organic pollutants (mainly of natural origin) have been observed in the water of the source. At low water temperature, high color indices and permanganate index, the need arises for continuous monitoring the optimal doses of chemicals in order to prevent the formation of residual aluminum in the purified water and permanganate index exceeding the MPC values ​​in accordance with SanPiN 2.1.4.1074-01. By Decree of the RF Chief Sanitary Officer No. 3 of January 28, 2021, new sanitary rules and regulations have been approved and effective in the Russian Federation since March 1, 2021: SanPiN 2.1.3684-21 and SanPiN 1.2.3685-21 that require a more stringent approach to the quality of the purified water. The validity period of the current SanPiNs is until March 1, 2027; however, they do not provide for a transitional period for the operators of water supply and wastewater disposal systems that have to arrange and conduct epidemiological (preventive) measures to ensure drinking and domestic water supply meeting the requirements of SanPiN 2.1.3684-21 and SanPiN 1.2.3685-21. The water treatment facilities in Samara in the transition period need upgrade, and some of them need reconstruction. To carry out the research specified in the regulatory documents, updating the equipment of production laboratories and expanding the scope of their accreditation are needed. Equipping accredited laboratories with advanced means of comprehensive monitoring of drinking water quality will improve the efficiency and reliability of the analysis results.</jats:p>",

In this context, we propose a novel low-cost, compact inkjet-printed UHF RFID tag antenna design for liquid bottles, with 2.5 m read range improvement over existing designs along with robust performance on different liquid bottle products. The tag antenna is based on a nested slot-based configuration that achieves good impedance matching around high permittivity surfaces. The tag was designed and optimized using the characteristic mode analysis. Moreover, the proposed RFID tag was commercially tested for tagging and billing of liquid bottle products in a conveyer belt and smart refrigerator for automatic billing applications. With the help of block-chain based product tracking and a mobile application, we demonstrate a real-time, secure and smart supply chain process in which items can be monitored using the proposed RFID technology. We believe the standalone system presented in this paper can be deployed to create smart contracts that benefit both the suppliers and consumers through the development of trust. Furthermore, the proposed system will paves the way towards authentic and contact-less delivery of food, drinks and medicine in recent Corona virus pandemic.</jats:p>"

In the extreme conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vitality of supply chains has come to the fore, that is, their ability to self-support and survival in a changing environment through restructuring and rescheduling of productivity with long-term consequences. An effective information system and governance can help not only improve customer service and control costs but also facilitate planning to achieve key sustainability indicators such as environmental, economic, and social development.  The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the widespread adoption of new digital technologies on the level of efficiency of supply chains in the face of disruption caused by the pandemic.  Materials and Methods. For this study, statistical data were collected for the period from 2010 to 2019. Sources: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; The World Bank; Institute for Global Entrepreneurship and Development, etc. A logical-heuristic algorithm was used to form a system of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of information and communication technology and logistics.  Results. It has been found that countries with a high level of economic development as evidenced by persistently high values of gross domestic product in the pre-crisis period show high indicators both in terms of the efficiency of logistics systems and in terms of digital transformation of the economy. At the same time, countries with low and below-average levels of economic development do not show high results in the context of logistics systems, but they also do not demonstrate a correlation between the level of economic development and the level of logistics efficiency and the level of digital life.  Conclusion. Thus, the study has shown that the role of information and communication technology in improving the efficiency of supply chains becomes significant in favorable economic conditions in the country, and in times of crisis, the role of information and communication technology significantly increases and contributes to the restoration of supply chains and the survival of business in general.</jats:p>"

Due to the long memory property of demand, production, and stocks, a fractional-order digital manufacturing supply chain system can describe their dynamics more precisely. In addition, their control and synchronization may have potential applications in the management of real-word supply chain systems to control uncertainties that occur within it. In this paper, a fractional-order digital manufacturing supply chain system is proposed and solved by the Adomian decomposition method (ADM). Dynamical characteristics of this system are studied by using a phase portrait, bifurcation diagram, and a maximum Lyapunov exponent diagram. The complexity of the system is also investigated by means of SE complexity and C0 complexity. It is shown that the complexity results are consistent with the bifurcation diagrams, indicating that the complexity can reflect the dynamical properties of the system. Meanwhile, the importance of the fractional-order derivative in the modeling of the system is shown. Moreover, to further investigate the dynamics of the fractional-order supply chain system, we design the feedback controllers to control the chaotic supply chain system and synchronize two supply chain systems, respectively. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition : We study how to optimally control a multistage supply chain in which each location can initiate multiple flows of product, including the reverse flow of orders. We also quantify the resulting value generated by reverse logistics and identify the drivers of that value. Academic/practical relevance : Reverse logistics has been gaining recognition in practice and theory for helping companies better match supply with demand, and thus reduce costs in their supply chains. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of clarity in practice and the research literature regarding precisely what in reverse logistics is so important, exactly how reverse logistics creates value, and what the drivers of that value are. Methodology : We first formulate a multistage inventory model to jointly optimize ordering decisions pertaining to regular, reverse, and expedited flows of product in a logistics supply chain, where the physical transformation of the product is completed at the most upstream location. With multiple product flows, the feasible region for the problem acquires multidimensional boundaries that lead to the curse of dimensionality. Next, we extend our analysis to product-transforming supply chains, in which product transformation is allowed to occur at each location. In such a system, it becomes necessary to keep track of both the location and stage of completion of each unit of inventory; thus, the number of state and decision variables increases with the square of the number of locations. Results : To solve the reverse logistics problem in logistics supply chains, we develop a different solution method that allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the feasible region and identify the structure of the optimal policy. We refer to this policy as a nested echelon base stock policy, as decisions for different product flows are sequentially nested within each other. We show that this policy renders the model analytically and numerically tractable. Our results provide actionable policies for firms to jointly manage the three different product flows in their supply chains and allow us to arrive at insights regarding the main drivers of the value of reverse logistics. One of our key findings is that, when it comes to the value generated by reverse logistics, demand variability (i.e., demand uncertainty across periods) matters more than demand volatility (i.e., demand uncertainty within each period). To analyze product-transforming supply chains, we first identify a policy that provides a lower bound on the total cost. Then, we establish a special decomposition of the objective cost function that allows us to propose a novel heuristic policy. We find that the performance gap of our heuristic policy relative to the lower-bounding policy averages less than 5% across a range of parameters and supply chain lengths. Managerial implications : Researchers can build on our methodology to study more complex reverse logistics settings, as well as tackle other inventory problems with multidimensional boundaries of the feasible region. Our insights can help companies involved in reverse logistics to better manage their orders for products, and better understand the value created by this capability and when (not) to invest in reverse logistics. </jats:p>",

It improves the quality of patient care, reduces the cost of medical procedures, maintaining flawless operations and supports clinical decisions. Despite strong policy interest and vast potential benefits of IoT in the healthcare supply chain, the actual adoption rate is relatively low and it's in the nascent stage in developing countries like India. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the potential barriers which would restrain the healthcare industry from adopting IoT. Based on the review of the literature and brainstorming with experts from industry and academia, 14 barriers were identified for IoT adoption. The contextual relationship between the identified barriers was developed using interpretive structural modeling and the obtained results were used as input to fuzzy MICMAC analysis to determine the driving and dependence power of the IoT adoption barriers. From the result, Legal and regulatory standards, Lack of IT Infrastructure are major barriers influencing the adoption of IoT in the healthcare supply chain. The findings will support the decision‐makers to understand the contextual relationship between the IoT adoption barriers in the Indian healthcare supply chain.</jats:p>",

Through understanding the structural characteristics and developing status of different types of Chinese e-commerce companies going overseas, a detailed investigation to the Chinese e-commerce companies investing in Indonesia has been conducted. Findings show that the production capacity cooperation stage of the two countries has a trend of asymmetric symbiosis gradually developing towards symmetric symbiosis. To promote a continuous economic cooperation between China and Indonesia, this article proposes that the national-level collaboration policies, cross-border e-commerce value chain, as well as organizational-level coordination are the key sectors for reaching the vision of symmetric symbiosis between the two countries.

The role of ascorbate oxidase (AOx) and ascorbate peroxidase (APx) was studied. ABA was used in situ by unskilled personnel. Treatments influenced AA decay kinetics, which were linear in fresh parsley, and non-linear in fresh-cut. Two hours at 28 °C immediately after chopping, the resilience of the fresh-cut parsley was reduced, even though the cold chain was restored. Two hours at −2 °C caused a rapid loss of AA until its complete decay after 72 h. Significant differences between treatments were observed in both the expression and activity of AOx and APx. ABA registered sudden changes of parsley AA following unpredicted variations of temperature during processing or transport. It was useful to remedy the effects of unexpected flaws in the cold chain, which can be proposed for quality preservation of different fresh-cut produce.</jats:p>"

The CST condenses into fiber bundles as it descends from the frontoparietal cortex, traveling down to terminate at the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The CST is at risk of injury from vascular insult from strokes and during neurosurgical procedures. The aim of this article is to identify and describe the vasculature associated with the CST from the cortex to the medulla. Dissection of cadaveric specimens was carried out in a manner, which exposed and preserved the fiber tracts of the CST, as well as the arterial systems that supply them. At the level of the motor cortex, the CST is supplied by terminal branches of the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. The white matter tracts of the corona radiata and internal capsule are supplied by small perforators including the lenticulostriate arteries and branches of the anterior choroidal artery. In the brainstem, the CST is supplied by anterior perforating branches from the basilar and vertebral arteries. The caudal portions of the CST in the medulla are supplied by the anterior spinal artery, which branches from the vertebral arteries. The non‐anastomotic nature of the vessel systems of the CST highlights the importance of their preservation during neurosurgical procedures. Anatomical knowledge of the CST is paramount to clinical diagnosis and treatment of heterogeneity of neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, cerebrovascular, and skull base tumors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The industrial development alongside inadequate planning in the energy sector put demand-side pressure on Pakistan's energy demand. Similarly, the excessive dependency on fossil fuels has an ecological footprint. Moreover, the abuse of energy tariff subsidies and deficits had a detrimental effect on department earnings, limiting the sector's emergence and intensifying its crisis. This research examines the electric demand and supply imbalance in the context of the China–Pakistan economic corridor investments using the system dynamics modeling approach, highlights the renewable resources, and discusses the hurdles in the way of green conversion. Moreover, the study forecasts the production capacity, electric demand, and supply up to 2040. The results show that China–Pakistan economic corridor investments will uplift the production capacity up to 12.9%, whereas the average production will reach 15.8%, variables that were 5% and 4.8% before China–Pakistan economic corridor. As a result, the energy sector will be able to meet the energy demand after 2021. However, the current investment in the renewable industry will not help in achieving policy targets. The study provides targeted implications to overcome potential barriers to the green path. </jats:p>",

The results of this study indicate that both methods, both EOQ and JIT can work appropriately and optimally at UD Ulinnuha. But the two methods are not suitable if applied to UD Ulinnuha because if using the JIT method, the storage warehouse is inadequate to accommodate the raw material inventory. If using the EOQ method the warehouse can accommodate raw material inventory, but in real terms, the warehouse can`t accommodate raw materials according to the maximum inventory calculation results. So that the two methods are not recommended by researchers and are recommended to continue using company policies because company policies have taken into account the conditions in the field.</jats:p>"

To collect primary data the respondents answered questions administered to them through questionnaires. The unit of observation consisted of the Heads of Procurement, Production, Sales and Finance of the food and beverage manufacturing firms located in Nairobi County as listed by Kenya Association of Manufacturers in 2019. The sample size was 83 heads of department. Face validity was used to determine the accuracy of the study instrument while test re-test method was used to determine the reliability. The completed questionnaires were analysed with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.&#x0D;\nFindings: From the study findings Just-in-time (JIT) procurement strategy (β=0.689, t=3.469, p=0.001) had a positive effect on organization performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms. The value of adjusted R2 was 0.167 indicating that there was variation of 16.7 percent on organization performance due to changes in JIT procurement at 95 percent confidence interval.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The study concluded that JIT Procurement strategy has a positive effect on organization performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Nairobi County. The overall effect of JIT Procurement strategy on organization performance was 68.9%. The study therefore accepted the alternative hypothesis that JIT procurement strategy has significant effect on organization performance of food and beverages manufacturers in Nairobi County.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Food and beverge manufacturing firms in developing countries should consider implementing JIT Procurement strategy. This will ensure that they purchase the optimal level of items when needed to avoid keeping unnecessary inventory which ties up money and at the same time ensure that there is no shortage so that the customers have to wait. Policy makers in the food and beverage manufacturing sector should consider developing policies to promote JIT Procurement strategy in this industry. Further research should be conducted focusing on the service sector to investigate the effect of JIT Procurement strategy on organization performance for comparison.</jats:p>"

In this work, rheological experiments of water–kaolinite suspensions with different electrolyte conditions, two particle sizes and 39 solid concentrations were performed. The Bingham fluid model has been adopted to fit the experimental data, and the viscosity and Bingham shear stress values were calculated for each suspension. It has been found that an increase in electrolyte concentration and/or valence leads to a larger viscosity value of the suspension, whereas an increase in electrolyte valence yields a smaller Bingham shear stress value. A simple interpretation based on DLVO theory was presented in this study. It has also been observed that a fine-grained kaolinite suspension corresponds to larger suspension viscosity and Bingham shear stress values. Additionally, some experimental information on the viscosity–solid concentration and Bingham shear stress–solid concentration relationships were also presented in this study. For the viscosity–solid concentration data, the Krieger and Dougherty formula provided the best fit, and a simple exponential relation showed a good fit for the measured shear stress–solid concentration data.</jats:p>",

With the advancement of the environmental concerns and social economy, it is an unavoidable choice for a business to achieve sustainable growth for low-carbon supply chain management. Since the root of the chain depends upon the supplier selection and choosing an excellent low-carbon supply. Green supplier selection is one of the most crucial activities in low-carbon supply chain management, it is critical to develop rigorous requirements and a system for selection in low-carbon green supply chain management (LCGSCM). A q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (q-ROFN) is pair of membership degree (MD) and non-membership degrees (NMD) which is reliable to address uncertainties in the various real-life problems. This article sets out a decision analysis approach for interactions between MDs and NMDs with the help of q-ROFNs. For this objective, we develop new aggregation operators (AOs) named as, q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction weighted averaging (q-ROFIWA) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction ordered weighted averaging (q-ROFIOWA) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction hybrid averaging (q-ROFIHA) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction weighted geometric (q-ROFIWG) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction ordered weighted geometric (q-ROFIOWG) operator and q-rung orthopair fuzzy interaction hybrid geometric (q-ROFIHG) operator. These AOs define an advanced approach for information fusion and modeling uncertainties in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). At the end, a robust MCDM approach based on newly developed AOs is developed. Some significant properties of these AOS are analyzed and the efficiency of the developed approach is assessed with a practical application towards sustainable low-carbon green supply chain management.</jats:p>",

We consider a capital‐constrained newsvendor model to explore the impact of product returns on firms' operational and financial decisions, in which a capital‐constrained retailer can get financed from either banks or suppliers and refurbish returned products and resell them to customers. Our findings show that offering refurbishment for returned products can increase the retailer's order quantity and improve the capital‐constrained supply chain performance. Moreover, the supplier strategically designs the wholesale price to hinder the retailer refurbishing returned products although the retailer always chooses to provide refurbishment under trade credit. When only trade credit financing is available, there exists a Pareto improvement on both partners' profits under certain cases. In addition, we investigate the financing preferences of the supply chain and find that product returns have a significant influence on the unique financing equilibrium. Finally, we conduct numerical analyses to present the impacts of some key parameters on the performance of both supply chain members.</jats:p>",

Self-sufficiency in the supply of plant protein is a concern that has been recognized and widely discussed in the national and European scientific community among practitioners involved in the production of livestock feed and, above all, among politicians of the European Commission, which decides the final shape of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. The strategy adopted by the European Commission, referred to as the European Green Deal, proposes restrictions on the use of plant protection products and mineral fertilizers. This will not take place without having an impact on production and the economic situation in agriculture. The research was conducted based on Statistics Poland data and the results of scientific studies. It was concluded that the implementation of the proposed strategy could be a factor that activates the production of native leguminous plants due to their nitrogen-fixing properties. Consequently, this may contribute to an increase in the production of native plant protein for animal feed, and thus to a greater sovereignty in the supply of this raw material for feed purposes.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global value changes continued to expand until the late 2000s. On the other hand, regional value chains have formed around major regional hubs due to the expansion of domestic demand in emerging economies, such as China, and strengthened trade protectionism since the global financial crisis. Such changes lead to the reorganisation of value chains, focusing on domestic markets (reshoring) or neighbouring countries (nearshoring). In particular, the importance of supply chain risk management has been highlighted following disruptions to the supply network due to the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019. In this regard, major countries such as the USA and the EU are rapidly shifting to regional value chains for stable and sustainable production, rather than primarily aiming for production efficiency targeted at reducing costs. Industries in particular are more exposed to such supply chain risks under the existing structure and it now has become extremely important for businesses to take reaction to such risks. This is especially important for major industries in a country such as automobile or semiconductor manufacturing industries in South Korea. The aim of this study, therefore, is to establish the basis for the simultaneous growth of ports and linked industries by examining the existing structure of the global value chain for the automotive industry, which has a strong presence in South Korea’s domestic economy. In this regard, this research carries out a supply chain analysis focusing on the imports and exports of automotive parts. It also analyses the current structural risks and suggests risk management measures to secure a stable supply chain.</jats:p>",

By the features of the model, the biobjective genetic algorithm was improved based on elitism selection, aiming to improve the quality of noninferior solution in biobjective model. Finally, the influence degree of the lead time of delivery, unit inventory cost, and unit transport cost on the total cost of the system was quantified through the analysis of examples and sensitivity of model parameters.

Results of the study showed that under SW conditions, corn yield increased by 38.72 and 44.09% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Further, it was found that dry matter accumulation, economic coefficient and photosynthetic rate also increased by 31.24 and 25.67%, 5.45 and 15.38% as well as 29.60 and 31.83% in 2019 and 2020 respectively. However, the results showed that both the activity of antioxidant enzymes and content of osmotic adjustment substances decreased in maize under SW conditions. When compared with soil moisture content of dry and wet alternation (DW) conditions, SW could not only significantly promote growth and yield of maize but also increase the economic coefficient. Transcriptome profiles of maize leaves under the two conditions (SW and DW) were also analyzed and compared. It was found that 11 genes were highly up-regulated in the photosynthesis pathway. These genes included photosystem II protein V (<jats:italic>PsbE</jats:italic>), photosystem II protein VI (<jats:italic>PsbF</jats:italic>), photosystem II protein D1 (<jats:italic>PsbA</jats:italic>), photosystem II protein D2 (<jats:italic>PsbD</jats:italic>) and ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit (<jats:italic>atpB</jats:italic>).

In developing countries, significant resource constraints hamper the effective and efficient delivery of health commodities, leading to supply chain failures such as “stock‐outs.” While the prevalence of commodity stock‐outs is well‐acknowledged, there is little by way of systematic and rigorous empirical research that sheds light on the factors that drive such stock‐outs in developing countries. The study documented in this article is anchored in the “logistics cycle” framework that is well‐accepted and widely adopted by organizations involved in managing public health supply chains. Using this framework, we empirically investigate how commodity range and a health facility's logistics management information system (LMIS) practices impact the likelihood of stock‐outs. We estimate our models using a novel field dataset spanning 4000 health facilities across five developing countries. Our results indicate that the likelihood of stock‐outs increases with an expansion in the range of health commodities offered through the public health supply chain. However, the detrimental impact of offering a wider range of health commodities is more severe in resource‐constrained rural facilities relative to their urban counterparts. Further, we find that urban facilities can significantly reduce the likelihood of stock‐outs by updating their LMIS records on a daily basis. However, in rural facilities, daily LMIS updating is beneficial only when used in conjunction with an electronic LMIS. Our findings have implications for resource allocation to reduce the risk of health commodity stock‐outs in developing countries. </jats:p>",

In this study, analytical methods for 25 micropollutants for which insufficient or no data on their occurrence in surface waters and on their behavior during drinking water treatment were available, were developed. More than 120 surface water samples were analyzed and laboratory tests were performed to evaluate the compounds' behavior during aerobic bank filtration (BF), activated carbon treatment, and ozonation. Ensulizole, 1,3-diphenylguanidine and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid revealed the highest detection frequencies in the Rhine river. Concentration level and detection frequency correlated positively with the wastewater fraction. However, street run-off is likely an additional discharge pathway for 1,3-diphenylguanidine. In simulated BF, seven (six) substances could be classified as persistent (very persistent). By applying powdered activated carbon, 42% of the substances were well removed as was the case for 50% of the compounds when applying 0.2 mg/L O3. In total, eight of the substances detected in surface waters were weakly removed by at least one of the investigated removal processes and may cause problems for drinking water suppliers.</jats:p>",

Some countries have proposed plans for urban stormwater management, such as Low Impact Development (LID), Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). As a country with relatively underdeveloped urban stormwater management, China's government proposed an ambitious urban stormwater management plan in 2014, called the Sponge City Programme, which means that a city is designed to act like a sponge, with good ‘resilience’ in adapting to environmental changes and coping with natural disasters. As of 2021, this programme has led to SCP projects in 30 pilot districts all over China, the Sponge City Programme construction impacts both urban development and residents' lives. However, there are risks and challenges associated with these projects. Using government research documents as a framework, this paper carefully reviews the progress of the Sponge City Programme in recent years and shows the main challenges faced by the Sponge City Programme in terms of connotation, investment, and technology. On this basis, the paper puts forward practical suggestions for the development of the Sponge City Programme and details potential opportunities of new technology, ideology, planning, and flexible investment.</jats:p>",

Cross-border supply chain management is one of the most important supports for cross-border e-commerce. Compared with domestic e-commerce, the supply chain of cross-border e-commerce faces more risks. In order to effectively identify and avoid the operational risks in the cross-border e-commerce supply chain, this article firstly analyzes the cross-border e-commerce supply chain risks from the operation process of the cross-border e-commerce supply chain. The risks include product selection management risks, cross-border transaction risks, and customs clearance risks that exist in the operation of cross-border e-commerce. Secondly, the cross-border e-commerce supply chain risk evaluation index system is established based on the risk elements. Finally, the risk evaluation is carried out through the FUZZY-ISM evaluation method, and the internal connection of each risk factor and the risk generation mechanism are revealed through structural model analysis, which provides a theoretical reference for cross-border e-commerce enterprise supply chain risk management.</jats:p>",

There are simultaneous decision-making, manufacturer-dominated market and retailer-dominated market. The decision mechanism for order quantity of manufacturer and dual-channel retailer, is discussed. Meanwhile, their complex dynamic characteristics are studied. It is found that when the government implements dual low-carbon subsidies, the supply chain system in which the manufacturer dominates the market is more stable. The government should pay attention to the power structure of the market to determine an appropriate subsidy rate. The over-adjustment of order quantity from manufacturer’s direct sales channel and retailer’s online channel both will lead to large periodical fluctuations in the system, and even bifurcation and chaos. These will cause substantial fluctuations and even loss in the profits of supply chain companies. This analysis shows that delayed feedback can effectively stabilize the periodic bifurcation and chaos in the system. </jats:p>",

Pakistan is included in top 50 countries which are estimated to face serious agriculture and food deficiency related challenges due to the world-wide pandemic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to study the effects of COVID-19 on food security and agriculture in Punjab, Pakistan using space-time scan statistic (STSS). A survey was conducted at 720 points in different districts of the province. The STSS detected “active” and emerging clusters that are current at the end of our study aera – particularly 17 clusters were formed while adding the updated case data. ArcGIS 10.3 software was used to find relative risk (RR) values; the maximum RR value was found to be 42.19 and maximum observed cases 53265 during June 15th – July 1st. Due to the highest number of cases of COVID-19 and RR vales during July, mostly farmers faced many difficulties during the cultivation of cotton and rice. Mostly farmers (72%) observed increase in prices of inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) during lockdown. The timely results (attained through STSS and RR) can inform decision makers and public health officials about where to improve the allocation of resources (including those for farming community), also, where to apply stricter quarantines and travel bans. If the supply chain of agriculture related inputs is disturbed, farmers may find it quite difficult to access markets, which could result in a decline in production and sales of crops and livestock in study area. It is suggested that to protection of food security and to decrease the effect of the lockdown, Punjab government needs to review food policy as well as analyze how market forces will respond to the imbalanced storage facilities and capacity, supply and demand, and price control of products. The findings of this study can also help policy-makers to formulate an effective food security and agriculture adaptation strategy.</jats:p>"

In response to the post-2008 affordable housing crisis, YIMBYs have emerged in support of orthodox economic policies that deregulate land use, expedite construction, and intensify financial accumulation in rental housing. Using detailed empirical analysis collected from YIMBY housing activists, this paper examines how the market-based logics they advance take root in local land use issues. It focuses specifically on the impact of YIMBYs on existing divisions within urban politics, including the scale at which housing is contested. By conceptualizing the YIMBY position as one that facilitates financialization, this paper reveals the ways financialization is more than a mode of accumulation: it is a political process embedded in the state from the bottom up and inside out. </jats:p>",

The lockdown imposed by the government of India from 25 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 particularly affected the supply chain of perishable agricultural products, including tomatoes as one of the major vegetable crops in the study area. The classical time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) intervention models and artificial intelligence (AI)-based time-series models namely support vector regression (SVR) intervention and artificial neural network (ANN) intervention models were used to predict tomato supplies and prices in the studied market. The modelling results show that the pandemic had a negative impact on supply and a positive impact on tomato prices. Moreover, the ANN intervention model outperformed the other models in both the training and test data sets. The superior performance of the ANN intervention model could be due to its ability to account for the nonlinear and complex nature of the data with exogenous intervention variable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recruitment is a key demographic process for maintenance of local populations and recovery following disturbance. For marine invertebrates, distribution and abundances of recruits are impacted by spatiotemporal variation in larval supply, settlement rates and post-settlement survival. However, for colonial and modular organisms, differences in survival and growth between settlers and colonial recruits may also affect recruitment patterns. In the Caribbean, shifts in the benthic community structure favoring octocoral’s have been detected, and recruitment has been suggested as key for octocoral’s resilience. Hence, we studied octocoral recruitment dynamics, and evaluated the role of pre-settlement, settlement and post-settlement processes in recruit’s densities. We performed the study at two sites with different octocoral densities, on the south coast of St. John, United States Virgin Islands, and distinguished between processes occurring to recently settled polyps and to colonial recruits. At both sites, we monitored<jats:italic>P. homomalla</jats:italic>settlers on settlement tiles for 3 months, and colonial recruits of two of the most abundant genera (<jats:italic>Eunicea</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Pseudoplexaura)</jats:italic>for 3 years. In addition, we assessed whether recruits morphological traits affected recruitment and divided recruits of the genus<jats:italic>Eunicea</jats:italic>based on the presence of large calyces. The major contributor to both, single-polyps and colonial recruit densities was larval supply. Single-polyp densities were not limited by the availability of space, settlement cues, or early post-settlement survival. Height was the only predictor of survival and growth of colonial recruits, with potential growth rates increasing with height. However, large recruits suffered partial mortality often, distorting the relationship between recruit age and size, and causing most recruits to remain in the recruit size class (≤5 cm) longer than a year. Octocorals have been resilient to the conditions that have driven the decline of scleractinian corals throughout the Caribbean, and recruitment has been key to that success. Our results are crucial to understand early life history dynamics of Caribbean octocorals, and highlights the need to standardize the definition of recruit among colonial and modular taxa to facilitate inter-specific comparisons, and to understand future changes in coral reef community assemblages.</jats:p>"

Issues of food security and functional availability of food are still of particular relevance. At the same time, the issues of self-sufficient development of regions, including in the branches of the agro-industrial complex, are of strategic importance. Acceptable levels of ensuring food independence and physical availability of food with agricultural products are noted in the directions of the Doctrine of Food Security of the Russian Federation. Nevertheless, a number of unresolved problems remain in terms of the level of affordability and rational norms of food consumption: there may be an abundance of products, but at a very expensive price. Given the limited purchasing power of the population, burdened by the pandemic, it is important for consumers to be able to purchase quality products in sufficient volume to ensure an active and healthy lifestyle. In the sectoral context, there are still unresolved issues of low profitability of production, preservation of the gene pool of farm animals, reduction in the number of cattle, insufficient level of technical and technological equipment, low level of average monthly wages in agriculture. The guarantee of the economic availability of food is possible with the stabilization of the general economic situation in the country and, accordingly, the growth of real incomes of the population, which, in turn, will give positive dynamics to new points of growth in the agro-industrial complex. The main measures to increase the economic affordability of food can be implemented through regional programs to support the poorer groups of the population, for example, the provision of subsidies for catering.</jats:p>",

The assessment was conducted considering operating mode of control and heat supply temperature impact of the system. In the literature, ASHP system experimental development with variable speed mode (VSM) of control in comparison to fixed speed mode (FSM) of control at low to medium and high heat supply temperature in the context of UK was found with very limited number of studies, but without considering retrofit application. The focus of the earlier studies was on the individual components and performance improvement. The designed heat pump (HP), developed, and tested at constant heat load, simulating the real domestic heat demand under the controlled laboratory conditions and numerical modeling is utilized for the analysis purposes. The HP performance, energy demand, carbon emissions, and cost varies significantly due to changing heat supply temperature (35 °C, 45 °C, and 55 °C), control mode and accordingly the carbon emission and cost savings are achieved. The oil and gas boilers ranges from conventional to highly efficient type and evaluated in terms of annual running cost, energy consumptions, and carbon emissions in comparison with the HP system. Additionally, a comparative study with the existing retrofitted very high temperature ASHP inside the house is conducted. The developed HP at 55 °C could not defeat the very high heat supply temperature HP system (75 °C supply temperature) in performance and cost savings but become attractive at low supply temperature (35 °C). The HP system in VSM at low heat supply temperature instead of gas boiler (90% efficiency) could cut the annual carbon emissions by 59% but with additional 6% running cost for the Mid terraced test house in Belfast climatic conditions.</jats:p>"

And whether the issuance of green credit can effectively promote the improvement of the environment and economy is not well understood.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec002\">\n<jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Previous research has found that green credit promotes economic growth through improvement of the industrial structure and green technological innovation. However, these studies have not considered the positive externality of environmental improvement even though environmental improvement and economic growth are requirements of the sustainable development concept.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec003\">\n<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n<jats:p>We use the chain-mediated model to estimate the impact of green credit issuance on the economic growth of different provinces since the large-scale implementation of green credit in China with data from 2008 to 2016.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec004\">\n<jats:title>Results and conclusion</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper shows that the issuance of green credit can improve labor supply rather than labor productivity through the improvement of air quality to achieve regional economic growth. Such a chain-mediated path is different from the economic growth caused by industrial structural adjustment and green technology innovation. At the national level, every 1% increase in green credit issuance relative to industrial loans will increase the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) by approximately 4.6 yuan, or 0.012%, through air quality and labor supply, accounting for 2.875% of the total effect. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that due to regional industrial structure differences and diminishing marginal effects, the impact of green credit is stronger in the western region than in the eastern and central regions. For every 1% increase in the proportion of green credit issuance relative to industrial loans, the per capita GDP growth achieved through the chain-mediated path is approximately 30.17 yuan in the western region, approximately 6.6 times greater than that at the national level. Within a 95% confidence interval of 5000 bootstrap samples, this path is found to be true, and the chain-mediated effect accounts for approximately 12.96% of the total indirect effect.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec005\">\n<jats:title>Limitations</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The limitation of this paper is the measurement of green credit. Although green credit has a large volume, it remains underdeveloped, and there is a lack of perfect indicators. Most existing studies have adopted only alternative or reverse indicators to measure the issuance of green credit. For example, this paper takes the interest expenditure of six high-energy-consuming enterprises as the reverse indicator, which may to a certain extent lead to the overestimation of the issuance of green credit and its impact on the environment and economy. Future research can accurately explore the performance of green credit on the basis of its mature development.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

However, the relevant research is still in a preliminary stage and needs to have a supplement. Considering environmental and ecological characteristics of the karst area, this paper analyzed the relationship between IRSN projects and environmental indicators, and proposed a multi-layer indicator system that has three first-class indicators (water environment, river–lake organism, connectivity) and 15 second-class indicators for assessment of the ecosystem. The weight of each level of indicators' can be determined using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the change rate of indicators critical value is normalized, then five threshold levels are established within the range of 0–1. Refer to the established response mechanism and threshold level of the karst basin, The Wangerhe River project taken as an example can well reflect the IRSN status through this method. These results can provide scientific support for constructing an evaluation index in other karst areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A continuous mathematical model of non-invasive avascular tumor growth in tissue is presented. The model considers tissue as a biphasic material, comprised of a solid matrix and interstitial fluid. The convective motion of tissue elements happens due to the gradients of stress, which change as a result of tumor cells proliferation and death. The model accounts for glucose as the crucial nutrient, supplied from the normal tissue, and can reproduce both diffusion-limited and stress-limited tumor growth. Approximate tumor growth curves are obtained semi-analytically in the limit of infinite tissue hydraulic conductivity, which implies instantaneous equalization of arising stress gradients. These growth curves correspond well to the numerical solutions and represent classical sigmoidal curves with a short initial exponential phase, subsequent almost linear growth phase and a phase with growth deceleration, in which tumor tends to reach its maximum volume. The influence of two model parameters on tumor growth curves is investigated: tissue hydraulic conductivity, which links the values of stress gradient and convective velocity of tissue phases, and tumor nutrient supply level, which corresponds to different permeability and surface area density of capillaries in the normal tissue that surrounds the tumor. In particular, it is demonstrated, that sufficiently low tissue hydraulic conductivity (intrinsic, e.g., to tumors arising from connective tissue) and sufficiently high nutrient supply can lead to formation of giant benign tumors, reaching tens of centimeters in diameter, which are indeed observed clinically.</jats:p>"

However, sourcing seeds of native species, let alone genetically appropriate seed, is not currently possible for many restoration projects. The process of increasing and sourcing suitable seed for restoration includes many steps that need to be addressed typically years before a restoration project is initiated. These steps of seed collection, evaluation and development, field establishment, production, certification and procurement, storage, and finally restoration, need to be considered ideally at a scale larger than individual restoration projects and with research conducted in each step.

İşletmeler, özellikle son dönemde tedarikçi değerlendirme ve seçiminde geleneksel kriterlerin yanı sıra sürdürülebilirlik kriterlerine de önem vermeye başlamışlardır. Bu sebeple çalışmada, tekstil sektöründe faaliyet gösteren işletmelerde kumaş tedarikinde dikkate alınması gereken kriterlerin sürdürülebilirlik çerçevesinde belirlenmesi ve ağırlıklandırılması amaçlanmıştır. Belirlenen amaç çerçevesinde, Malatya Organize Sanayi Bölgesi’nde tekstil sektöründe faaliyet gösteren işletmeler araştırma kapsamına alınmıştır. Sürdürülebilirlik çerçevesinde tedarikçi değerlendirme kriterleri, sektörden ve literatürdeki diğer çalışmalardan bilgiler toplanarak ana ve alt kriterler olmak üzere iki aşamada incelenmiştir. Ana kriterlerin ağırlıklandırılmasında AHP (Analitik Hiyerarşi Prosesi) ve SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis - Adım Adım Ağırlık Değerlendirme Oranı Analizi) yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlara göre ekonomik, çevresel ve sosyal performans ana kriterlerin altında toplamda 37 farklı alt kriterin yer aldığı tespit edilmiştir.

In this study, a practical‐stability‐oriented general control framework with duty‐cycle‐like characteristics is deduced for such converters. First, a concept called End Point Equivalence Modulation (EPEM) is introduced to release constraints. Following this, a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) is employed to design the switching law and the relationship between the boundary of the convergence zone and the switching frequency is derived. In addition, an optimized switching strategy is presented to halve the switching frequency without degrading the control performance, which is also helpful for reducing switching loss. Finally, a single‐phase inverter and buck converter are considered as case studies and analysis show that Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and volt‐second balance guarantee their practical stability, respectively, which can be theoretically derived and proved under EPEM. All the proposed methods and controllers are validated both by simulations on MATLAB/Simulink and experiments in a rapid control prototype platform based on a FPGA module.</jats:p>",

Interestingly, an inspection will be performed to manage the quality of the items during the state of no deterioration because it is difficult to purchase items with 100% perfection. Additionally, we assume that the upstream member has the power of controlling or influencing downstream members’ decisions. That is, the supplier asks the retailer for a partial advance payment to avoid cancellation of orders and offers them a credit payment to stimulate sales; in turn, the customer must pay some cash when placing an order and pay the remainder in credit for the retailer. The goal of this article is to determine an optimal replenishment cycle and the total annual cost function, so we explore the functional properties of the total annual cost function and show that the total annual cost function is convex. Theoretical analysis of the optimal properties shows the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. Then, we obtain simple and easy solution procedures for the inventory system. Moreover, numerical analysis of the inventory model is conducted, and the corresponding examples are considered with a view to illustrating the application of the supply chain model that we have investigated in this article. Finally, in the concluding section, we have not only provided the motivation and the need for our usages of mathematical analytic solution procedures based upon the convexity, monotonicity (increasing and decreasing) and differentiability properties of the object function (that is, the total annual cost function), which involve some symmetry aspects of the object function, but we have also indicated the limitations and shortcomings in our investigation, which will naturally lead to some potential directions for further research on the supply chain model, which we have considered and mathematically analyzed in this article.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the advancement of technology, many companies provide customization facilities to customers. This facility provides a vast variety to customers which enhances the level of customer satisfaction. This approach helps various technologically advanced companies to increase their profit. In this paper, a dual-channel supply chain model is developed with the aforementioned customization strategy with the target of increasing the profit of the firm. In dual-channel, the core or standard product is provided to the customer through a traditional retail channel, whereas the customized product is made available through the online channel. This article incorporates a modification in the existing dual-channel policy on the number of customers that switch between the offline and online channels. Moreover, a preassigned threshold value is also assumed which signifies the decrease in demand that takes place if the difference between the selling price of offline and online channels crosses a fixed specified threshold value. In addition to that, due to fluctuation and uncertainty of demand, both variability and randomness may occur simultaneously. Thus, the price-sensitive stochastic demand is considered to develop the dual-channel centralized supply chain model with customization. A max-min distribution-free approach is applied to deal with the randomness and variability of demand. The model is analyzed and validated with numerical experiments and graphical analysis. Consequently, the article concluded that it is better to adopt a dual-channel supply chain policy for better profitability than the traditional single-channel supply chain as this firm will be able to provide customized products to customers. Moreover, if the difference between the selling prices of the offline and online channels is greater than the preassigned threshold value, then the shifting of customers takes place depending upon the factor that which channel’s selling is less in comparison to another.</jats:p>",

This research aims to assess the impact of climate change on the water demands for one of the most important Egyptian food crops which is the wheat crop. In addition, a number of adaptation strategies were tested to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on wheat productivity and its water relations. The current study was carried out in the Middle Egypt region. Two models were used, the first is the climate model (MAGICC/SCENGEN), which is used to simulate the impact of global greenhouse gas emissions on the rate of rise in temperature at the regional level. The second is the irrigation model (CROPWAT8.0), which is used to simulate the irrigation water requirements under current and likely climate change conditions. The results indicated that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions will cause the temperature to rise over the study area by about 2.12 °C in 2050 and 3.96 °C by 2100. As a result, the irrigation water needs for wheat crop are likely to increase by 6.2 and 11.8% in 2050 and 2100, respectively. In addition, wheat productivity will decline by 8.6 in 2050 and 11.1% in 2100.</jats:p>",

In this study, the least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) integrated with advanced optimization algorithms is presented, for the first time, in the prediction of the water quality index (WQI) at the Klang River of Malaysia. Thereafter, the LSSVM model using RBF kernel was optimized using the hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (HPSOGA), whale optimization based on self-adapting parameter adjustment and mix mutation strategy (SMWOA) as well as ameliorative moth-flame optimization (AMFO) separately. It was found that the SMWOA-LSSVM model had the better performance for WQI prediction by having the best achievement root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Comprehensive comparison was done using the global performance indicator (GPI), whereby the SMWOA-LSSVM had the highest average score of 0.31. This could be attributed to the internal architecture of the SMWOA, which was catered to avoid local optima within short optimization period.</jats:p>",

Having specified linear asymmetric vector error correction model, we exposed the long-term cumulative asymmetry in price transmission, however, the hypothesis of short-term symmetry presence failed to reject. The analysis revealed dominant position for wheat producers and wholesalers over the wheat processors. Imperfect competition and their resulting market power, as well as the existence of a huge number of illegal processors are the main causes for asymmetric price transmission on the Russian wheat market.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the current study is to examine green consumption intention in the hospitality and tourism industry as an outcome of green supply chain management and strategic green marketing orientation. It also aims to investigate the green brand image and green social responsibility in a mediated-moderation mechanism to induce green consumption. Based on the deductive approach, and cross-sectional quantitative data of 317 hotel visitors/guests in the northern tourism hotspots in Pakistan, the hypothesized relationships were tested through the structural equation modeling technique with partial least squares. The findings empirically establish that green supply chain management and strategic green marketing orientation have positive and significant effects on green consumption intention. Further, environmental concern (i.e., green image) partially mediates the relationship between strategic green marketing orientation, green supply chain management, and green consumption behavior. The results also revealed that brand social responsibility does not moderate green image and green consumption behavior. These stimulating new findings guided by the signaling theory, provide strategic insights that help to upgrade the tourism supply chains and enabling them to become green.</jats:p>"

In addition, the similarities and differences between the basic concepts often used as synonyms for sustainability are also presented. First, the sample database (39,000 records) was based on a search containing publications’ titles regarding supply chain management (SCM). After narrowing the topic from SCM towards CSCM, the considered paper characteristics were expanded, including abstract and author keywords, to get a manageable number of samples for the systematic analysis (6095 documents) and the most accurate results possible. The analysis’ base sample was divided into two periods (before and after 2012) due to a significant increase and change in the number of publications, their subject, characteristic journals and geographical location. Sustainability has emerged since 2012, while a circular approach emerged after 2017 with a significant share of research, mainly thanks to relevant EU policies. Although the role of the US has been decisive in the field, the European research bases of previous years have increasingly been replaced by Far Eastern dominance. Currently, CSCM’s most important journal is the International Journal of Supply Chain Management (Elsevier), but most articles on the impact of COVID have been published in Sustainability (MDPI). More effective policy implementation and the fight against COVID in the development of supply chains are also likely to spread the circular economic model in the future.</jats:p>"

Governments in West Africa have struggled to address the problems within their higher education systems for health professionals, and it is now generally acknowledged that private institutions can play a crucial role in revitalizing the region’s outdated universities. However, the rapid expansion of private schools raises concerns about the quality of education and adequacy of regulatory mechanisms. The USAID-funded Mali HRH Strengthening Activity, led by IntraHealth International, assisted Mali’s Ministry of Health and Social Development to deliver targeted HRH interventions to improve the quality of education in private universities, better manage available health workers, and initiate a decentralized strategy for health worker recruitment and motivation.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Case presentation</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>In 2018, the HRH activity leveraged the West African Health Organization (WAHO)’s accreditation system to support 10 private nursing schools to introduce WAHO’s regionally accepted, competency-based curriculum in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health. The project undertook a 10-step process to work alongside private nursing and midwifery schools to assess their current status against WAHO regional standards, implement action plans to address identified gaps, and support the institutions toward accreditation. As a result, eight schools in Mali are now accredited compared to only three at project inception.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This case study underscores the importance of private school accreditation in Mali to improve the quality of health worker training through a standardized local curriculum. By supporting existing regulatory bodies that oversee accreditation, local capacity for initial accreditation of private nursing schools has been increased. Engaging universities in a partnership that shows the benefits of accreditation while maintaining a focus on the need to protect communities is critical to success. If the global community is to meet the WHO’s predicted health worker shortfall, then private education providers will need to be part of the solution. Robust and engaging health worker education accreditation systems are an essential part of that future.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Some precise soliton solutions comprising dark, light and other forms of multi-wave soliton solutions are achieved via the proposed methods. Furthermore, mathematical models demonstrate the singularity of our work in comparison to current literary materials and even describe some results using the classic Peyrard–Bishop model. All the established results contribute to the possibility of extending the approach to solve other nonlinear equations of fractional space–time derivatives in nonlinear sciences.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Space availability and the maintenance of adequate phosphorus (P) supply in the root zone are essential for achieving high yield and P-use efficiency in maize production by manipulating the root morphology and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonization. A major trade-off exists between root growth and AM colonization that is influenced by soil P supply intensity and space availability. However, how soil P manipulates the root morphological characteristics and AM colonization to compensate for the limitation of root-growth space induced by high-planting density is not clear. Therefore, pot experiments were conducted to investigate interactions between the root growth and AM fungi by optimizing soil P supply to compensate for limited root growth space induced by high-planting density. Similar shoot biomass and P uptake values were obtained in P200 (200 mg P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> soil) under D = 40 (i.e., diameter of the pot is 40 cm) and P400 under D = 30, and similar values were obtained for root length, tap root length, root angle, lateral root density, and AM colonization. However, the improvement in P supply in the root zone, shoot biomass, and P uptake in P400 under D = 20 were lower than in P200 under D = 30, and there were no significant differences in the root parameters between P200 and P400 under D = 20; similarly, the root growth and AM colonization exhibited similar trends. These results suggest that optimizing P supply in the root zone to regulate the interaction between root morphological traits and AM colonization can compensate for limited root-growth space. Although P supply in the root zone increased after the root-growth space was compressed, it could not meet the P demand of maize; thus, to achieve the most efficient use of P under intensive high-density maize production, it is necessary to optimally coordinate root growth space and P supply in the root zone.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, e-commerce platforms have been acting as both a reseller and a marketplace to serve consumers. This study considers a hybrid-format supply chain that consists of a supplier who sells a product through an intermediary by a wholesale price contract. In addition, the supplier can decide whether to accept the intermediary’s offer to engage in the marketplace (if the supplier accepts, then the agency fee should be paid to the intermediary). We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the impact of supplier encroachment on the supply chain members. Then, we extend our basic model to check the robustness of our main results. Our results show that the supplier prefers to engage in the marketplace if the agency fee is low and the order fulfillment cost is relatively low, the intermediary benefits from the supplier encroachment if the agency fee is relatively low, and consumers always benefit from encroachment. Interestingly, we show that an increase in channel substitutability leads to raising the supplier’s willingness to adopt an encroachment strategy. Our findings contribute to the online marketplace literature by providing valuable insights into the operation management of online marketplaces.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Food and medication security is an unseen battle occurring during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sustainable rice supplies are crucial during a pandemic period, especially in Southeast Asian countries (SEA countries). This study analyzes the vulnerability level of SEA countries regarding rice supply, with alternative import strategies recommended. By employing RCA, CAaA, and XCA indexes, the comparative advantage and competitiveness of rice-exporting countries are analyzed. The study shows that Malaysia and Singapore are highly vulnerable regarding rice crisis, while Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei are moderately vulnerable. Thailand and Vietnam supply 76.74% of SEA countries’ rice imports. SEA importers should consider alternative import strategies in order to reduce their high-risk dependency on the supply of rice from Thailand and Vietnam. XCA analysis results show that India, Thailand, Pakistan, Vietnam, China, and the USA are more competitive and have better comparative advantages as compared to other rice exporters with a high supply volume or lower prices. The alternative rice-exporting suppliers that could be considered by SEA countries are Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Additionally, this paper introduces the XCA index and CAaA index to complement the bias of the RCA index. </jats:p>",

In the upper abyssal waters (&lt; 6000 m), FDOM<jats:sub>H</jats:sub> has a significantly positive correlation with AOU; FDOM<jats:sub>H</jats:sub> deviates from the relationship and increases with depth without involving the increment of AOU in the hadal waters.

Chemoautotrophic production and N* increases and decreases with depth in the hadal waters, respectively. This corroborates the effluxes of dissolved substances, including dissolved organic matter and electron donors from sediments, which fuels the heterotrophic/chemoautotrophic microbial communities in the hadal waters. A simple box model analysis reveals that the funnel-like trench topography facilitates the increase in dissolved substances with depth in the hadal waters, which might contribute to the unique microbiological community structure in these waters.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents a new, unconventional energy harvesting (EH) method for supplying low-power devices on electrified railway lines that utilises stray currents and the non-zero potential of the rails to the ground. The EH device gathers the energy and stores it in batteries. It could even work in extremely unfavourable weather conditions and could be easily placed in almost any location. The presented real-life data show that the average available power is less than 250 mW and the average useful power is about 100 mW. This is enough to supply ultra-low power microcontrollers, which only occasionally use energy-consuming modules to perform measurements or communicate. The disadvantage of the EH method is the introduction of resistance between the rail and the earth, which increases stray currents and could increase the electrochemical corrosion of the rail. To reduce the impact of this resistance, a method for balancing the flowing charge is proposed. After balancing, the average of the flowing current is zero and electrochemical corrosion should be reduced. The proposed charge balancing algorithms could reduce the unbalanced charge to nearly zero at the expense of energy gathering efficiency, which decreases by 20–40%.</jats:p>"

It is an integral part of interdisciplinary disciplines such as soil hydrodynamics and ecohydrology. The authors selected the optimal SWCC model for the Lanzhou collapsible loess, used classical statistics and geostatistics methods to study the spatiotemporal variability of the SWCC model parameters, and using the comprehensive comparison of the mean relative differences (MRD), standard deviations (SDRD) and an index of temporal stability (ITS) determined the representativeness measuring point. The results showed that the SWCC parameter α was medium variability in the 0–30 cm soil layer, n and θs were of low variability, and the spatial distribution of the parameters of different soil layers was consistent. Migration direction prediction of θs was very similar in each layer, α, n and θs were all strongly significantly correlated positively. Moreover, the determination coefficient of representative measuring point 16 had the highest prediction accuracy for the measured values of SWCC. The results of this paper can be used as a simple method to predict SWCC and provide theoretical guidance for soil water management and soil collapse erosion monitoring in the collapsible loess area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Northeast China (NEC) is a region sensitive to climate change. However, the adoption of long-season maize cultivars in NEC has caused a substantial yield increase under climate change conditions. It is important to determine whether such cultivar adoptions are effective throughout the whole NEC to sustainably increase grain yield. In this study, phenological observations and meteorological data at six sites from 1981 to 2018 were used to detect thermal time (TT) trends during the maize growing period. TT, as a parameter for measuring changes in maize cultivars, was used in the crop simulation model CERES-Maize to examine the variations in maize yield produced with different cultivar × climate combinations in different decades. In NEC, both TTs from emergence to anthesis and from anthesis to physiological maturity showed significant increasing trends from 1981 to 2018. Simulation results for humid areas revealed that adopting longer-season cultivars during 2000–2018 caused yield increases, ranging from 6.3% to 13.3%, compared with the 1980s. However, for stations in semi-humid areas, maize grain yield showed a decrease or a small increase (from −12.7% to 8.0%) when longer-season cultivars were adopted during 2000–2018. For semi-humid areas, decreasing trends in the ratios of rainfed yield to no water-stress yield (Yrainfed/Yno water-stress) and lower Yrainfed/Yno water-stress values during 2000–2018 indicated a growing sensitivity of maize production to water, which was attributed to changes in TT and precipitation. Our results indicate that, for the semi-humid area, maize yield was limited by water after introducing cultivars with higher TT requirement under climate change conditions. Therefore, securing food supplies will depend on increases in water-use efficiency levels and other adaptive strategies, such as varietal diversification, drought-resistant varieties, conservation tillage and irrigation.</jats:p>"

According the memoirs of the most outstanding military leaders, during planning and leadership of military operations, considerable attention was paid to the creation and maintenance of fuel and lubricants at the proper level. Understanding that without fuel, no ingenious idea can be realized, if military equipment cannot move from its place, and personnel will not be able to receive food and ammunition on time. So for the supply of fuels and lubricants it is possible to use the following types of transport: air; water; railway; automobile; pipeline. Each of the listed types of transport has certain features. Each type of transport that is used in the modern world for oil and petroleum products has its own advantages over other types of transport and limitations in its use. For example, the disadvantages of oil pipeline transport include high metal consumption, «rigidity» of the route, which can be branched by deploying field main pipelines with their connection to the existing stationary system of oil pipelines. Sometimes, when choosing the type of transport which is planned to be involved in providing military units with fuel and lubricants, it is necessary to choose not the most cost-effective, but the type that will ensure uninterrupted supply in a timely manner and in full.

In reducing urban stormwater loads of engineered plant biofiltration, an effective and self-sustaining component of green infrastructure is a treatment option. The country's extensive natural biodiversity offers untapped potential of indigenous species' use in plant biofilters. This paper presents the findings of a plant biofilter column experiment, which investigated the performance of nine indigenous plant species under varied urban stormwater pollutant load strengths. Average significant loads of dissolved Cd (&amp;gt;98%), Cu (&amp;gt;84%), Pb (&amp;gt;99%) and Zn (&amp;gt;95%), as well as NH3-N (&amp;gt;93%), were removed by the plant biofilters, whereas the removal of -N (−37 to 79%) and -P (−81 to 63%) was more variable. Biofilters equipped with indigenous plant species were on average at least 11% more efficient than unvegetated soil in the removal of urban nutrient and metal pollutants. Over time, planted biofilters improved nutrient and metal removal efficiencies. The results support the inclusion of indigenous plants in biofilters within urban stormwater green infrastructure initiatives. Further research to inform plant biofilter design practicalities and assess plant biofilter performance in the field is warranted.</jats:p>",

However, direct evidence of the combined effect of land use and anthropogenic nutrients on CDOM characteristics in river ecosystems is limited. Herein, we collected water samples from 18 sites in the Nanchong section of Jialing River in December 2019 to elucidate how the land use and nutrients affect the source and composition of CDOM through parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of excitation–emission matrices (EEMs). First, the absorption coefficient a254 (r2=0.29, p&amp;lt;0.01) and three fluorescence components (humic-like C1 and C2 and protein-like C3) (r2=0.31–0.37, p&amp;lt;0.01) significantly increased with increased urban area, and the four parameters were higher in the urban area than in the suburbs (p&amp;lt;0.05). The correlation between small-size CDOM molecule and cropland was positive (p&amp;lt;0.01). Second, the increase in nutrient levels increased the a254 (r2=0.84 and 0.33, p&amp;lt;0.01) and three fluorescence components (r2=0.30–0.84, p&amp;lt;0.01 or p&amp;lt;0.05). Third, allochthonous CDOM were prevalent in the Nanchong Section of Jialing River, and the proportions of C1 and C2 were 42 and 41%, respectively. Our findings indicated that the variability of source and composition of CDOM significantly depended on urbanization and increased nutrients in the Nanchong Section of Jialing River.</jats:p>",

The current study demonstrates a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) driven watershed prioritization in a part of Koel river basin by runoff computation during monsoon season along with assessment of Vegetation Health Index (VHI) derived from MODIS satellite data during the period from 2000 to 2017. Koel river catchment area of 7,261 sq km was divided into 82 sub-watersheds based on drainage networks derived from a Survey of India (SOI) topographical map at scale 1: 50,000. High resolution satellite image of Sentinel-2 was used to prepare a land use land cover map. Soil conservation service curve number method (SCS CN) was used to estimate runoff. The result obtained from runoff estimation of 82 sub watersheds shows high runoff (50 to 60% of rainfall) with 290,000 m3 total runoff volume in the upper and middle parts of the catchment dominated by agricultural/fallow and barren lands, whereas low runoff was estimated (20 to 30%) with 29,467 m3 in the lower catchments where a large area is covered with forests. The value of satellite based VHI ranges between 23 to 53 with major parts of the area exhibiting values less than 30, reflecting poor vegetation health. Most of the sub-watersheds in parts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Gumla and Khunti districts experienced high total runoff, with poor vegetation health index reflecting more proneness to drought. Watershed prioritization was done based on correlation among four parameters viz., rainfall, drought zones, direct runoff and total runoff through PCA. Strong correlation between total runoff volume and drought areas was used for watershed prioritization, which indicated 42 sub-watersheds (4,703 sq km) in the upper catchment required high prioritization. The outcomes of the study would help proper planning of water resources and soil moisture management to overcome the recurrent drought conditions at watershed level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The world's large rivers are facing reduced sediment loads due to anthropogenic activities such as hydropower development and sediment extraction. Globally, estimates of sand extraction from large river systems\nare lacking, in part due to the pervasive and distributed nature of\nextraction processes. For the Mekong River, the widely assumed estimate of\nbasin-wide sand extraction is 50 Mt per year. This figure is based on 2013\nestimates and is likely to be outdated. Here, we demonstrate the ability of\nhigh-resolution satellite imagery to map, monitor, and estimate volumes of\nsand extraction on the Lower Mekong River in Cambodia. We use monthly\ncomposite images from PlanetScope imagery (5 m resolution) to estimate sand extraction volumes over the period 2016–2020 through tracking sand\nbarges. We show that rates of extraction have increased on a yearly basis\nfrom 24 Mt (17 to 32 Mt) in 2016 to 59 Mt (41 to 75 Mt) in 2020 at a\nrate of ∼8 Mt yr−1 (6 to 10 Mt yr−1), where values in parentheses relate to lower and upper error bounds, respectively. Our revised estimates for 2020 (59 Mt) are nearly 2 times greater than previous best estimates for sand extraction for Cambodia (32 Mt) and greater than current best estimates for the entire Mekong Basin (50 Mt). We show that over the 5-year period, only 2 months have seen positive (supply exceeds extraction) sand budgets under mean scenarios (5 months under the scenarios with the greatest natural sand supply). We demonstrate that this net negative sand budget is driving major reach-wide bed incision with a median rate of −0.26 m a−1 over the period 2013 to 2019. The use of satellite imagery to monitor sand mining activities provides a low-cost means to generate up-to-date, robust estimates of sand extraction in the world's large rivers that are needed to underpin sustainable management plans of the global sand commons.\n                    </jats:p>"

The Shaying River Basin (Henan Section) serves as an important grain production base in China. However, conflicts for water between humans and the environment are becoming increasingly prominent. The present study analyzed the optimal allocation of water while considering ecological priorities in the Shaying River Basin (Henan Section). The ecological water demand was calculated by the Tennant and the representative station methods; then, based on the predicted water supply and demand in 2030, an optimal allocation model was established, giving priority to meeting ecological objectives while including social and comprehensive economic benefit objectives. After solving the model, the optimal results of three established schemes were obtained. This revealed that scheme 1 and scheme 2 failed to satisfy the water demand of the study area in 2030 by only the current conditions and strengthening water conservation, respectively. Scheme 3 was the best scheme, which could balance the water supply and demand by adding new water supply based on strengthening water conservation and maximizing the benefits. Therefore, the actual water allocation in 2030 is forecast to be 7.514 billion (7.514 × 109) m3. This study could help basin water management departments deal with water use and supply.</jats:p>",

In this chapter, contract-boundary-spanning governance mechanisms are defined as increasingly sophisticated hard or soft governance mechanisms in the private law sphere that can be deployed by any public or private stakeholder to govern international supply chains. We find contract-boundary-spanning governance initiatives by state and private stakeholders in the defense supply chain of the F-35 program. At the same time, we argue that while serious efforts have been made by various state actors and legislators to reduce the burden in trade compliance requirements in the F-35 program, the industry is still facing a considerable number of compliance challenges.

While corporations have increasingly sought to manage modern slavery risk in their supply chains, their understanding of what modern slavery is and what should be managed remains limited. We argue a key problem with firms’ efforts to manage modern slavery risk is that it is a psychologically distant concept for them. We apply construal level theory to explore how organizations’ psychological distance from modern slavery risk affects their management of risk. We interviewed purchasing executives at 41 global organizations in Australia, Finland, and the U.S and identified four approaches to managing modern slavery risk at different levels of psychological distance. We also identified that conflicts between organizations' approaches to risk and what they identify in their operating environment, precedes important construal shifts that help to improve organizational understanding of labor‐related risk. We highlight ways that organizations' understanding of modern slavery risk plays a role in their governance of such risk in supply chains.</jats:p>",

This study optimizes many key conditions include temperature, pH value and pressures, then establishes a new SDI detection method of ultrafiltration membranes by using MIM. We set the temperature of the test liquid to 25 °C, pH in the range of 7–8, and pressure to approximately 0.10 MPa. The results reflect that MIM can be used to effectively determine the SDI of ultrafiltration membranes using the new method and the results of the method validation are satisfactory.</jats:p>",

Our main goal was to determine the effect of stimulating Apis mellifera L. colonies with standard food supplies on the collection of kiwifruit pollen. However, honey bees can also forage other flowering species in the crop site's surrounding areas. We selected kiwifruit as a model to analyze the effects of food supply on pollen collection of the target crop. The following experimental treatments (n = 5 hives each were conducted in a kiwifruit orchard in Mar del Plata, Argentina: Group J/A: supplied with sugar syrup (2:1 + liquid protein supplements (“Apipromotor ®”; Group J/P: supplied with sugar syrup (2:1 + solid protein supplements (“patty”; Group J: supplied with sugar syrup (2:1; Group C: control, not supplied.

The supply chain of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China mainly contains three processes: collection, transportation, and disposal. The waste is sorted at the collection and disposed of according to the classification. However, it is mixed at the transportation stage. Mixed transportation remixes the separately collected waste, which seriously affects the disposal effect. The supply chain of MSW urgently needs to be redesigned to improve the MSW disposal effect. First of all, on the ground of the waste treatment situation, we redesigned the supply chain of MSW in China. Secondly, combined with the redesign of the MSW supply chain, this paper established the function allocation model for collection stations, making a collection station only gather one type of waste, and built the transportation path planning model for vehicles, reducing the impact of waste storage on residents. Finally, based on the data of Xuanwu District in Beijing, the supply chain redesigning practical example of incinerable waste was given. The supply chain redesigning model in this paper not only makes full use of the existing infrastructure but also improves the disposal effect of waste. The supply chain redesigning model has practical application value.</jats:p>"

The Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) faces changes in flow regimes due to the impacts of human activities and climate change, which may threaten its fragile ecosystem. In this study, a new comprehensive system for evaluating runoff variation was constructed to investigate the degree of runoff alternation in the YZR. Based on the data from the primary hydrological stations in the YZR from 1956 to 2000, the assessment indicators of runoff variation were selected by considering the flow, sediment, and water temperature processes. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation system for runoff variation was constructed via multiple hydrological analysis methods and vague sets. The results showed that the variation index of the YZR from 2010 to 2013 was 0.15–0.20 compared with the flow regimes of the YZR before 2000, which were within a reasonable range, indicating that the comprehensive runoff conditions of the YZR were not greatly disturbed by human activities such as reservoir construction and river regulation during this period. These results provide a tool for evaluating the runoff change in the YZR and new references for researching runoff variation in other similar watersheds.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, tourists tend to choose hotels that are really consistently implementing environmentally friendly business practices. Accommodation with a concept and environmentally-friendly management is one of the driving parameters for tourists to choose the accommodation (Rahmafitria, 2014). In line with this phenomenon, the concept of sustainable accommodation must apply the principles of environmental conservation, education, ecology, community empowerment, and utilization of local products, and minimize environmental damage. Hotels have departments according to their respective duties. The departments in the hotel have an integrated bond, need each other, and complement each other in operational activities.

Urban clusters have a growing demand for fuel, heat and electricity, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for biomass-based technologies.

We develop a systematic approach for the design, evaluation and ranking of biomass-to-X production strategies under uncertain market conditions. We assemble state-of-the-art and innovative conversion technologies, based on feedstock, by-products and waste characteristics. Technical specifications, as well as economic and environmental aspects are estimated based on literature values and industry experts input. Embedded into a bi-level mixed-integer linear programming formulation, the framework identifies and assesses current and promising strategies, while establishing the most robust and resilient designs. The added value of this approach is the inclusion of sub-optimal routes which might outperform competing strategies under different market assumptions. The methodology is illustrated in the anaerobic digestion of food and green waste biomass used as a case study in the current Swiss market. By promoting a fair comparison between alternatives it highlights the benefits of energy integration and poly-generation in the energy transition, showing how biomass-based technologies can be deployed to achieve a more sustainable future.</jats:p>"

While barter exchange is relevant to supply chain management, little is known about its impacts on the supply chain contracting and efficiency. This study explores these issues in a two‐level supply chain under a wholesale‐price pull contract, where the manufacturer undertakes the inventory risk. Stackelberg equilibriums are derived when the two supply chain agents are rational and biased, respectively. We show that barter exchange encourages the retailer to provide a lower wholesale price to the manufacturer and induces the manufacturer to produce more. Barter exchange benefits the retailer and the supply chain system, thereby improving the supply chain efficiency, but may harm the manufacturer. We further examine the impacts of the supply chain agents' decision biases in barter exchange, where the retailer and the manufacturer may overestimate or underestimate the supply rate of what the retailer needs. When the retailer believes the manufacturer holds the same level of bias, the retailer's overestimation renders it to offer a lower wholesale price, thereby leading the manufacturer to produce less. This finding implies that the retailer's overestimation enhances double marginalization and reduces the supply chain efficiency. The manufacturer's overestimation leads it to produce more. However, when the biased retailer learns the manufacturer's decision bias accurately, the retailer's overestimation brings a higher wholesale price, thereby inducing a higher manufacturer's production quantity and a higher supply chain efficiency. The manufacturer's overestimation induces a lower wholesale price and a higher production quantity.</jats:p>",

The proposed device uses AC power with the electrical grounds of the main and stimulation units separated to reduce the possibility of current leakage and to improve safety. The stimulation unit implanted in the eye cannot include large capacitor chips for ground separation. To solve this problem, large capacitor chips are mounted on the implantable control unit that supplies power, not on the stimulating device, and a cooperative mode of operation is devised. In this way, it is realised that a circuit configuration that achieves both miniaturisation and improved power supply efficiency. This study verifies the functionality of the proposed circuit. The results suggest that power supply and stimulation operations are possible through coupling capacitors. In addition, this stimulation operation can be performed continuously.</jats:p>",

Hence, their supply is necessary for a balanced socio-ecological system. This study explored the potential supply of cultural ecosystem services (science/education, spiritual, tourism, health and recreation benefits) under different land use planning (LUP) scenarios in Southwestern Ghana. Future LUP scenarios were developed and articulated with a diverse group of land-use planning actors (LUPAs) such as regional land use planners, environmental experts, researchers, farmers and landowners. The scenarios covered business-as-usual, mangrove ecosystem restoration, market-driven growth, and the establishment of an “eco-corridor” as green network. A spatially explicit modeling platform, GISCAME, which combines Geographic Information System and Cellular Automaton modules and multicriteria evaluation was used to evaluate the developed scenarios. Outcomes of the study revealed that in the coastal landscape of Southwestern Ghana, values, perceptions and preferences of LUPAs underpin socio-ecological interactions aimed at maintaining and enhancing CES supply. In addition, it indicated that future supply of CES is characterized by an interplay between multiple and diverse perspectives about plausible land-use futures. Perceptions of, and preferences for, CES align with land-use visions related to afforestation, infrastructure development, agriculture expansion and tourism. In the study area and similar contexts where an array and diversity of individual and societal values exist, effective negotiation and facilitation are essential for harnessing and optimizing land-use planning for CES supply.</jats:p>",

Our aim was to examine the mechanisms of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to acquire P and Se when the elements are heterogeneously or homogeneously distributed in soil, and how P and Se supply affect plant growth and uptake of P and Se. We conducted a split-root experiment growing alfalfa in a loess soil with two distribution patterns (i.e. heterogeneous and homogeneous) of P and Se. The application rates of P (KH2PO4) and Se (Na2SeO3) were 0 and 20 mg P kg−1, and 0 and 1 mg Se kg−1, respectively. Our results showed that plants absorbed more Se when both P and Se were supplied homogeneously than when supplied heterogeneously. Supplying Se had a positive effect on plant P content. Localised P supply resulted in the exudation of more carboxylates by roots than homogeneous P supply did. Soil microbial biomass P was significantly greater when P was supplied homogeneously. Shoot-to-root translocation of Se had a positive effect on P-uptake efficiency. These results indicated that, compared with homogeneous P supply, localised P supply promoted P and Se uptake by increasing the amount of rhizosheath carboxylates and weakening the competition between roots and microbes. Translocation of Se within plant organs was promoted by the application of P, thus enhancing the P-uptake efficiency of alfalfa.</jats:p>"

This study presents a holistic assessment of how two practices influence the supply of these ecosystem services—the use of an aerator prior to manure application in haylands, and the stacked use of manure injection, cover crops, and reduced tillage in corn silage production. Field data are contextualized by semi-structured interviews that identify influences on adoption. Causal loop diagrams then illustrate feedbacks from ecosystem services onto decision making. In our study, unseen nutrient pathways are the least understood, but potentially the most important in determining the impact of a practice on ecosystem services supply. Subsurface runoff accounted for 64% to 92% of measured hydrologic phosphorus export. Average soil surface greenhouse gas flux constituted 38% to 73% of all contributions to the equivalent CO2 footprint of practices, sometimes outweighing carbon sequestration. Farmers identified interest in better understanding unseen nutrient pathways, expressed intrinsic stewardship motivations, but highlighted financial considerations as dominating decision making. Our analysis elevates the importance of financial supports for conservation, and the need for comprehensive understandings of agroecosystem performance that include hard-to-measure pathways.</jats:p>"

In this paper, game theory is used to make the decisions for the prefabricated building supply chain with flexible cap-and-trade and different power structures, i.e., using prefabricated building manufacturers as the leader, using the vertical Nash equilibrium, and using prefabricated building assemblers as the leader. The two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and to improve the supply chain performance. Moreover, we discuss the influence of different power structures and the two-part tariff contract on the optimal decisions and profits. Finally, numerical analysis is used to verify the conclusions. This indicates that the supply chain leaders will gain a higher profit and that the power structure has a significant influence on the two-part tariff contract, which will result in an unfair distribution of profit.

Manufacturers and retailers can effectively reduce carbon emissions through low‐carbon efforts, and doing so is important for the sustainable development of low‐carbon supply chains. This paper develops a general framework that considers how bounded rationality and fairness concerns affect the manufacturer's and retailer's low‐carbon effort decisions and discusses the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) and the evolution process of the manufacturer's and retailer's low‐carbon efforts. The ESS shows that the manufacturer and the retailer will increase their low‐carbon efforts when the initial unit profit is higher. Otherwise, a smaller initial unit profit will reduce their low‐carbon efforts. This paper also analyzes different attributes of fairness concerns and finds that advantageous fairness concerns increase low‐carbon efforts, whereas disadvantageous fairness concerns reduce low‐carbon efforts. In addition, fairness concerns will speed up the manufacturer's and retailer's low‐carbon efforts to ESSs. When the manufacturer and retailer choose the “no effort” strategy, they will stop investing quickly, but when they choose the “effort” strategy, they will not invest quickly. This paper can provide decision support for using the low‐carbon effort investment strategy by supply chain members.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results of the research presented in the article relate to a fundamentally new type of continuous transport machines-conveyors with a suspended load-carrying belt and a distributed drive. The main advantages of which are due to the features of the kinematic scheme, in which the load-bearing conveyor belt is held by the sides by means of roller suspensions on rolling guides closed along the route and does not interact with its base with supporting supports, and the drive is implemented according to the distributed scheme by the equipment of individual suspensions with individual motor-gear drives. A feature of such a kinematic scheme is the nature of the failures associated with the operation of highly loaded drive suspensions, the influence of which affects the main technical characteristics of the conveyor with a sufficiently increased number. The paper presents a mathematical model designed to calculate the dynamic characteristics of a conveyor with a suspended belt and a distributed drive when the types of failures characteristic of this conveyor design occur, associated with a break in the supply electrical circuit of the motor-gear drive of the suspensions. Based on the developed mathematical model for the reference design of a conveyor with a suspended belt and a distributed drive, a series of numerical calculations of dynamic characteristics in the event of failures of drive suspensions is performed. The obtained results allowed us to establish that with a reduction in the number of groups of consistently failed drive suspensions located with an equal step along the route, the technical characteristics of the conveyor deteriorate: the speed of movement of the load-bearing belt and the total power of the drives are reduced, and the longitudinal tensile stresses in the belt are increased. With an increase in the number of consistently failed drive suspensions within one group, the power and speed of the conveyor decrease non-linearly, and the longitudinal stresses in the conveyor belt increase linearly. In general, the results of calculations of the technical characteristics of the reference idealized design demonstrated the possibility of the conveyor operation in case of failure of 90% of the drive suspensions. The actual performance indicators are determined by the technical characteristics of the used gear motor drives.</jats:p>"

A PCF of a carbonated drink product is evaluated at each of the major stages in the product's life cycle with results compared to using GHG Protocol methodology. Results from cradle‐to‐grave analysis indicate retail and distribution has the largest emissions impact along the product life cycle. Retail distribution routing optimisation model is developed and retail vending equipment are analysed to explore opportunities for reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint. Future sustainable development studies on the PCF of same beverage merchandises produced in various countries and mitigation measures using dynamic routing distribution could be carried out.</jats:p>",

By varying the patch density, the generalized results show that the hydrodynamics over deformed beds differs a lot from those over flat beds. It is found that the deformed bed topography leads to an apparent decrease in longitudinal velocity and bed shear stress in the open region and longitudinal surface gradient for the entire vegetated reach. However, the transverse flow motion and transverse surface gradient in the region of the leading edge and trailing edge is enhanced or maintained, suggesting the strengthening of secondary flow motion. Interestingly, the deformed bed topography tends to alleviate the horizontal shear caused by the junction-interface horizontal coherent vortices, indicating that the turbulence-induced flow mixing is highly inhibited as the bed is deformed. The interior flow adjustment through the patch for the deformed bed requires a shorter distance, La, which is related to the vegetative drag length, (Cda)−1, with a logarithmic formula (La = 0.4ln[(Cda)−1] + b, with b = 3.83 and 4.03 for the deformed and flat beds). The sloping bed topographic effect in the open region accelerating the flow may account for the quick flow adjustment.</jats:p>",

To study the contribution of human activities on virtual water trade quantitatively, an innovative method of quantitative comparison and analysis is put forward. At first, climates are adjusted into a unified standard. Then the impacts of increment and reduction of foreign water are studied. Additionally, the impacts of water management policy are studied according to the comparable water quotas. Results show that with the development of the economy, an N-shaped trend and inverted U-shaped trend exist with regard to the net exports of agricultural and industrial virtual water, respectively. The net imports of virtual water have beneficial effects to water environments in water deficient areas, while net exports have negative effects. In 1997, the net exports of agricultural and industrial virtual water reduced by 20.13% and 49.67% respectively due to the cut-off of the Yellow River channel compared with that under average Yellow River water diversion. In 2017, they increased by 1.32% and 41.99% respectively because of the South-to-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project and reduced by 10.01% and 20.39% respectively under the effects of the most stringent water management policy.</jats:p>",

Methods: We performed a detailed survey of the cast-iron fountain body and the pits next to it to discover the catchment basin of the fountain and establish its dimensions, assess the operation of similar fountains, analyze historical documents (old photos), and design engineering systems. Results and discussion: As a result of the study, the dimensions of the fountain and the catchment basin as well as the diameters of the orifices were obtained. The trajectories of the water jets and the scheme of the fountain’s operation were determined. Besides, we performed a hydraulic analysis of the systems and selected the necessary equipment. In this paper, we also present the scheme of the fountain’s operation in the following modes: filling with water, normal operation, and shut-down for winter.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that the permeable spur dikes installed in the spillway bend appreciably contributes to the improvement on the water surface uniformity, and the water surface uniformity can reach 90.13% with three permeable spur dikes installed in the bend. The permeable spur dike can lead to different degrees of decrease in the time-averaged longitudinal velocity in each zone of spillway bend. Different from previous study, no circulation zone is formed upstream and downstream of permeable spur dike due to the presence of permeable holes, and the flow upstream of permeable spur dikes could be divided into three distinctly different flow modes according to dye tracing. The presence of permeable spur dikes causes the concentration of TKE zone at concave bank of the spillway bend, except for TKE zone immediately next to the bottom plate. The TKE first increases and then decreases with the increase in the vertical distance from the bottom plate of the spillway bend, exhibiting a typical parabolic distribution. The energy dissipation rate in the spillway bend with permeable spur dike was calculated using a modified integral method, and the dissipation rate can reach as high as 21.08% with three spur dikes installed in the bend.</jats:p>",

The protective effects of C8 and C10 have been proposed to be driven by hepatic production of ketone bodies. However, plasma ketone levels correlates poorly with the cerebral effects of C8 and C10, suggesting that additional mechanism are in place. Here we investigated cellular C8 and C10 metabolism in the brain and explored how the protective effects of C8 and C10 may be linked to cellular metabolism. Using dynamic isotope labeling, with [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C8 and [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C10 as metabolic substrates, we show that both C8 and C10 are oxidatively metabolized in mouse brain slices. The <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C enrichment from metabolism of [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C8 and [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C10 was particularly prominent in glutamine, suggesting that C8 and C10 metabolism primarily occurs in astrocytes. This finding was corroborated in cultured astrocytes in which C8 increased the respiration linked to ATP production, whereas C10 elevated the mitochondrial proton leak. When C8 and C10 were provided together as metabolic substrates in brain slices, metabolism of C10 was predominant over that of C8. Furthermore, metabolism of both [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C8 and [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C10 was unaffected by etomoxir indicating that it is independent of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1). Finally, we show that inhibition of glutamine synthesis selectively reduced <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C accumulation in GABA from [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C8 and [U-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]C10 metabolism in brain slices, demonstrating that the glutamine generated from astrocyte C8 and C10 metabolism is utilized for neuronal GABA synthesis. Collectively, the results show that cerebral C8 and C10 metabolism is linked to the metabolic coupling of neurons and astrocytes, which may serve as a protective metabolic mechanism of C8 and C10 supplementation in neurological disorders.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, irrigation has primarily focused on soil water deficit. Observational evidence demonstrates that stomatal conductance is co-regulated by soil moisture and VPD from water supply and demand aspects. Here we use a validated hydraulically-driven ecosystem model to reproduce the co-regulation pattern. Specifically, we propose a plant-centric irrigation scheme considering water supply-demand dynamics (SDD), and compare it with soil-moisture-based irrigation scheme (management allowable depletion, MAD) for continuous maize cropping systems in Nebraska, United States. We find that, under current climate conditions, the plant-centric SDD irrigation scheme combining soil moisture and VPD, could significantly reduce irrigation water use (−24.0%) while maintaining crop yields, and increase economic profits (+11.2%) and irrigation water productivity (+25.2%) compared with MAD, thus SDD could significantly improve water sustainability.</jats:p>"

The first phase operated as a conventional membrane bioreactor to achieve the removal of organic matter [chemical oxygen demand (COD)], the CECs and phosphorus. A removal rate of 96.3% for COD, 94.5% for IB, 37.1% for CBZ, 87.1% for DCF and 96% for EE2 was obtained. In the three subsequent phases, current density (CD) of 5, 10 and 15 A/m2 was applied successively in the eMBR with the aim of investigating the effects on the removal of the former components and the fouling of the membrane. After the application of 5 and 10 A/m2 CD, the removal rate of COD decreased. Regarding phosphorus, a CD of 5 A/m2 was enough to achieve the rate of 97% and the membrane fouling suffered a substantial reduction too. Finally, the experimental results were subject to statistical analysis using the Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon tests to validate the influence of each CD.</jats:p>",

The results are as follows: first, none of the pollutants exceeded the standard, except for total nitrogen; second, the highest comprehensive evaluation score was 1.04, so the water quality level was good; third, the health risk assessment showed that health risk value of water quality in the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River is on the high side, which is mainly caused by Chromium(Cr); fourth, the carcinogenic risk is five orders of magnitude higher than the non-carcinogenic risk, and the total carcinogenic risk is higher than the maximum acceptable risk level (10−5 a−1), while the total non-carcinogenic risk is lower than the acceptable health risk level (10−6 a−1). Therefore, to ensure the safety of its drinking water, Cr pollutants in the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River should be properly treated and controlled.</jats:p>",

Statistical and metagenomic analyses of the raw water samples of the year 2020, were performed. Organoleptic data allowed to signal the presence of these taste and odor (T&amp;O) compounds in the drinking water, and the mean values of taste intensity were above the maximum allowed value of the Brazilian legislation, on average 37.5 times in 2020 and 5 times in 2021, indicating that the measures did not eliminate the problem.

Metagenomic data, from raw water in the year 2020, for the mtf, mic and glys genes indicated 2-MIB as responsible for T&amp;O.

Various socio-hydrological approaches have been developed to improve the adaptive capacity of local people to deal with water-related issues. In this study, a social-hydrological approach was developed to enhance the water supply resilience in Con Dao Island, Vietnam. We used a water-balance model, involving the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool, to conduct a scenario-based evaluation of water demands. In doing so, we assessed the impacts of socio-economic development, such as population growth and climate change, on increasing water demand. The modelling results showed that the existing reservoirs—the main sources to recharge the groundwater (accounting for 56.92% in 2018 and 65.59% in 2030)—play a critical role in enhancing water supply resilience in the island, particularly during the dry season. In addition, future water shortages can be solved by investment in water supply infrastructures in combination with the use of alternative water sources, such as rainwater and desalinated seawater. The findings further indicate that while the local actors have a high awareness of the role of natural resources, they seem to neglect climate change. To meet the future water demands, we argue that upgrading and constructing new reservoirs, mobilizing resources for freshwater alternatives and investing in water supply facilities are among the most suitable roadmaps for the island. In addition, strengthening adaptive capacity, raising awareness and building professional capacity for both local people and officials are strongly recommended. The research concludes with a roadmap that envisages the integration of social capacity to address the complex interaction and co-evolution of the human–water system to foster water-supply resilience in the study area.</jats:p>"

Due to stagnation of water in plumbing systems, exposure concentrations of heavy metals from tap water can be higher than water distribution systems (WDS), which is often ignored by the regulatory agencies. In this study, concentrations of a few heavy metals (arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe)) and water quality parameters were monitored in WDS, plumbing pipe (PP) and hot water tanks (HWT). Multiple models were trained for predicting metal concentrations in PP and HWT, which were validated. Heavy metal concentrations in HWT were 1.2–8.1 and 1.4–6.7 times the concentrations in WDS and PP respectively. Concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Hg and Zn were in the increasing order of WDS, PP and HWT. Concentrations of Cr and Fe were higher during summer while Cu and Zn were higher in winter. The models showed variable performances for PP and HWT (R2: PP = 0.61–0.99; HWT = 0.71–0.99). The validation data demonstrated variable correlation coefficients (r: PP = 0.45–0.99; HWT = 0.83–0.99).

In this paper, we present the first zooarchaeological study of the wartime faunal remains from German military camps in Lapland. This illustrates the supply situation of both the German soldiers and their multinational prisoners. The official military supply was substantially supplemented with local food sources, namely, with the local semi‐domesticated reindeer that dominates the bone assemblage. Bones of cattle, ovicaprines, and pig occur in lower numbers and appear to represent the German long‐distance supply chain stretching from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean. The remains of reindeer and wild species remind of the close interactions with locals and of the prisoners' hunting activities to supplement their meager diet. Even if the reindeer bones dominate both the soldiers' and prisoners' faunal assemblages, there are notable differences in the body parts, with bones from meatier portions always found in the soldiers' food waste. Besides highlighting a tension between the military supply and everyday demands, the faunal remains can draw attention to wider anthropological questions that reach beyond the information available in historical documents, such as adaptations into an alien northern environment. This emphasizes the importance of zooarchaeological analyses of recent past faunal materials from superficially familiar contexts.</jats:p>",

Evaluation of the subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR, also known as Buckberg index) by invasive recording of left ventricular and aortic pressure curves represents a valid method to estimate the degree of myocardial perfusion relative to left ventricular workload.

However, this “traditional” method does not account for the intra‐ventricular diastolic pressure and proper allocation to systole and diastole of left ventricular isometric contraction and relaxation, respectively, resulting in an overestimation of the SEVR values. These issues are considered in the novel method for SEVR assessment tested in this study. SEVR values estimated with carotid tonometry by \"traditional” and \"new” method were compared with those evaluated invasively by cardiac catheterization. The “traditional” method provided significantly higher SEVR values than the reference invasive SEVR: average of differences±SD= 44±11% (limits of agreement: 23% – 65%).

Reservoirs bring many benefits to flood control, power generation, shipping etc., but their attenuation effects on runoff flood pulses should not be ignored. Ecological operation can effectively reduce some negative ecological impacts brought by the reservoir. However, the inability to quantitatively assess ecological effects hinders the promotion of ecological operation in reservoir management. To solve this problem, we proposed 11 flood pulse indicators (FPI), a random simulation method and an ecology-economy coupling model in this study. In addition, we used four major Chinese carps as indicator species and the Three Gorges Reservoir as a case study to test the role of flood pulses in improving the ecological operation effects of the reservoir from the fish protection perspective. The results show that: (1) FPI can be controlled by the reservoir and reflect the flood pulse characteristics of runoff. (2) Random simulation method guides managers to optimize the discharge and formulate eco-friendly operation schemes. (3) Ecology-economy coupling model helps managers analyze the relationship between ecological operation effects and economic benefits. A comprehensive assessment can improve the acceptance of ecological operation, which is conducive to the sustainable development of river ecosystem.</jats:p>",

It affects communities that are reliant on freshwater bodies contaminated with Schistosome cercariae for their daily water activities. Whilst treatment with the drug praziquantel is relatively effective, it does not prevent reinfection. One option for reducing schistosomiasis infection is providing at-risk communities with treated water, thereby reducing contact with cercaria-infested water for activities such as bathing or doing laundry. This study aims to establish design guidance for sand filtration to remove schistosome cercariae from water. Four sand filters were tested, varying from 300 to 2000 μm in sand grain size. Each filter was tested with a sand depth of 20 cm, which was increased until no cercariae were detected in the effluent. The required filter depth to remove 100% of cercariae ranged between 40 and 70 cm depending on sand grain size. Cercaria removal was more effective in filters with smaller sand grain size and larger filter depth. These results are valid for intermittent flow, for up to six cycle flushes. While more rigorous testing is needed, these initial results suggest that sand filters can be an effective way to treat cercaria-contaminated water in low-income settings.</jats:p>",

The application of flow cytometry still remains utility-specific and a huge need for standardization of data analysis and interpretation exists in order to achieve a better cooperation of water utilities.</jats:p>",

Field monitoring was conducted in nine plots located parallel on a 15° purple slope in southwest China. Three slope lengths (20-, 40-, 60-m) combined with measures of artificial disturbance and natural restoration were implemented. The highest N concentration was observed in soft rainfall events across all plots. The highest P concentration was recorded in heavy rainfall events for the artificially disturbed plots and in soft rainfall events for the naturally restored plots. Land disturbance caused orthophosphate concentration to differ in the 20-m plot, and affected N and P loss amounts in different forms. Slope length caused total dissolved phosphorus concentration to differ in naturally restored plots, and also caused the loss amounts of total dissolved nitrogen and orthophosphate to differ in artificially disturbed plots. Natural restoration reduced loss amounts of total nitrogen and total phosphorus by 62.14–79.05% and 79.28–83.43% relative to artificial disturbance, respectively. Concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus were closely correlated with rainfall and runoff variables, respectively, in artificially disturbed plots. Our results highlight the dominant role of natural restoration in reducing erosion and nutrient loss in sloping land.</jats:p>",

It was found that the infiltration process curve has an obvious fluctuation in the late stage of unsaturated seepage (after 18:00 p.m. on March 20th) which not only reflects the temporal variation of infiltration rate, but the spatial variation of rock structure. The lateral soil water of soil and rock dual-texture mainly flows in the interface of soil and rock. The infiltration rate of soil water can be as high as 2.42 × 10−4 cm/s, accounting for about 20% of the stable infiltration rate. After the water infiltrated in the lower rock layers, the water was mainly stored and flowed in the fissure network in the rocks, but did not completely fill the whole fissure network. Firstly, the local priority channel is adopted to infiltrate. With the increasing of rock saturation, the local priority channel will also expand and finally extend to the whole fissure network. The permeability coefficient of the soil and rock dual-texture in the study area is 1.26 × 10−3 cm/s.</jats:p>",

Effective and efficient cold chain management maximizes utilization of healthcare resources, reduces cold chain products wastage, and improves the quality of health services. It eventually guarantees that clients receive cold chain products they need at service delivery points. The objective of this study was to evaluate cold chain management performance for temperature-sensitive medicines at public health facilities in Southwest Ethiopia supplied by the Jimma Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency hub. Method and Materials. The study used an institution-based cross-sectional study design. Forty-seven (47) public health facilities in Southwest Ethiopia were evaluated using checklists adopted from the Logistic Indicators Assessment Tool, Vaccine Management Assessment Tool, and Logistic System Assessment Tool. Results. The study revealed that the mean availability of essential cold chain products was 72.1 ± 14.8% while the average stock-out rate was 26.2 ± 8.6%. The median stock-out duration was 23 ± 21 days for all visited public health facilities. Two hundred and sixty-three (43.06 ± 15.3%) of the public health facilities’ stock records were found accurate, and the wastage rate due to expiration was 9.2 ± 7.8% for all visited health facilities. Thirty public health facilities (63.8 ± 36.2%) had acceptable storage conditions. Conclusions and Recommendations. Supply chain performance at the study facilities was not adequate overall, and focused efforts need to be directed at managing the availability of critical cold chain medicines. Some cold chain management challenges demand the attention of the top management, while the rest can be addressed by operational management at the facilities through provision of appropriate training and supervision of the cold chain pharmaceutical handlers.</jats:p>",

Phosphorus (P) deficiency often occurs in saline soil, and their interaction inhibits plant growth and seed yield for canola (Brassica napus L.). P supply is considered an effective way to alleviate the damage of salt stress. However, the knowledge of how P supply can promote plant growth in saline environment was limited. A field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of P rate on accumulation, and partitioning, of biomass and P, leaf photosynthesis traits, and yield performance in saline soil in the coastal area of Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China, during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 growing seasons. P supply increased biomass and P accumulation in all organs, and root had the most increments among different organs. At flowering stage, P supply increased the biomass and P partitioning in root and leaf, but it decreased the partitioning in stem. At maturity stage, P supply facilitated the biomass and P partitioning in seed, but it decreased the partitioning in stem and shell, and it increased the reproductive-vegetative ratio, suggesting that P supply can improve the nutrients transporting from vegetative organs to reproductive organs. Besides, P supply improved the leaf area index and photosynthetic rate at the flowering stage. As a result, the seed yield and oil yield were increased. In conclusion, P supply can improve the canola plant growth and seed yield in a saline environment. P fertilizer at the rate of 120 kg P2O5 ha−1 was recommended in this saline soil.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The existing methods of diesel engine start up using gas engine fuel imply either introduction of design changes to implement spark ignition, or maintaining the supply of a certain proportion of diesel fuel in the air-gas mixture. The second method is more preferable, since it leaves the possibility of an easy return to the initial state, allows work only on the diesel process and does not require significant changes in the design. This method attracts the greatest attention of modern researchers, however, the final technical solutions and methods of work on such a gas-diesel process have not yet been developed, and the existing practices are expensive to implement or are not effective enough. The issues of ensuring high ecological parameters also remain in abeyance. Studies show that in order to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, it is necessary to achieve the elimination of residual oxidant in combustion products, which is possible due to formation of a stoichiometric mixture in the cylinder. For this purpose, as well as to increase the overall combustion efficiency and improve the thermal balance of the engine, the authors propose a system for injecting gas in the liquid phase directly into the combustion chamber at the compression stroke. The described system assumes the maximum usage of standard engine components of MMZ D-245 type with seats for glow plugs in the cylinder head, where nozzles for supplying liquid gas will be installed. In this case, gas injection is possible by standard means of the Common rail system. Concurrently, there are already the necessary technical solutions that improve the operation control of the injection pump and ensure prevention of detonation combustion. The appropriate balance of the amount of both fuel types is calculated according to the known relationships. The analysis of the results of early studies showed that such a scheme deserves attention. Thus, the authors substantiated the currently absent approach, which makes it possible to improve the environmental performance of an engine operating on a gas-diesel process, implemented by available means.</jats:p>",

This study explores how this recalcitrance can be reduced during the supply chain unit operation of storage, which is required for seasonally harvested agricultural residues to maintain constant throughput at a biorefinery. In this work, partial alkali pretreatment was performed just prior to corn stover entering storage, which had the benefit of providing a high pH environment entering storage such that soluble sugars were preserved and saponified acetyl groups in hemicellulose. This work investigated a range of viable conditions where saponification and preservation occur simultaneously by varying the moisture content (40% and 60%) and concentrations of sodium hydroxide (low and high) during aerobic and anaerobic storage. Anaerobic conditions preserved overall dry matter below 5% in the three scenarios evaluated, and the highest alkali loading solubilized up to 15% lignin, 18% xylan, and 50% of acetate, meanwhile doubling the extractable components. Scanning electron microscopy images highlighted potential physical impacts including cell‐wall disruption near vascular bundles, pitting within parenchyma cells, and cell‐wall distortion. Techno‐economic assessment indicated that this storage approach and associated logistics system is economically competitive with a conventional approach using low‐moisture bales. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

This article examines the study of the connection of renewable energy sources (RES) as part of the own needs of micro--hydroelectric power plants. The analysis of possibility of power supply of own needs of micro-HPP by wind power installation with use of the frequency Converter for the purposes of regulation of tension of own needs of station was carried out. The first part of the article is devoted to the analysis of publications on the current problem of the use of small and micro--hydroelectric power plants, as well as the description of the purpose and objectives of the study. The second section of the article presents mathematical models describing the connection of the wind turbine with a frequency Converter to work together with consumers of the station's own needs, for which the function of voltage regulation in the network is supposed to be performed. The law was formulated and an algorithm was constructed for the operation of the wind turbine with a load as part of the station's own needs. Note that this algorithm assumes continuous operation of the wind turbine without switching it according to the scheme of automatic reserve input, which leads to an increase in the installed capacity utilization factor. In the third part of the article the oscillograms of transient processes in the mode with and without wind turbines are considered. The short-circuit mode on the load and the influence of the wind turbine on the value of the recharge current are also considered.

Because of chilli products generally perishable characteristics, its price has become unstable.The growing number of agricultural safety and risk issues has revealed a substantial need for an effective traceability solution, which serves as an essential agricultural supply chain method to ensure adequate product safety. Blockchain is the technology that disrupts goods in supply chains of agriculture and offers a revolutionary solution for their traceability. Today, farm supply chains are a dynamic ecosystem with multiple stakeholders, making it difficult to verify a range of main parameters, including the country of origin, stage in crop production, quality compliance, and yield monitoring. This paper suggests using the Ethereum blockchain and intelligent contracts to monitor and traceability operations across the agricultural supply chain effectively. Our proposed solutions remove the need for trustworthy centralized subjects, intermediaries, transaction records, performance, and security enhancements that are highly integral, accurate, and stable. The approach suggested focuses on using intelligent agreements to monitor and manage all communications and transactions between all actors in the supply chains ecosystem. All transactions are registered in the immutable blockchain lead with connections to a decentralized system (IPFS), ensuring the ecosystem is safe, confident, reliable and booming for everyones high degree of transparency and traceability.</jats:p>"

While graph applications have significant parallelism, their characteristic pointer indirect loads to neighbor data hinder scalability to large datasets on multicore systems. A scalable and efficient system must tolerate latency while leveraging data parallelism across millions of vertices. Modern Out-of-Order (OoO) cores inherently tolerate a fraction of long latencies, but become clogged when running severely memory-bound applications. Combined with large power/area footprints, this limits their parallel scaling potential and, consequently, the gains that existing software frameworks can achieve. Conversely, accelerator and memory hierarchy designs provide performant hardware specializations, but cannot support diverse application demands.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>To address these shortcomings, we present GraphAttack, a hardware-software data supply approach that accelerates graph applications on in-order multicore architectures. GraphAttack proposes compiler passes to (1) identify idiomatic long-latency loads and (2) slice programs along these loads into data Producer/ Consumer threads to map onto pairs of parallel cores. Each pair shares a communication queue; the Producer asynchronously issues long-latency loads, whose results are buffered in the queue and used by the Consumer. This scheme drastically increases memory-level parallelism (MLP) to mitigate latency bottlenecks. In equal-area comparisons, GraphAttack outperforms OoO cores, do-all parallelism, prefetching, and prior decoupling approaches, achieving a 2.87× speedup and 8.61× gain in energy efficiency across a range of graph applications. These improvements scale; GraphAttack achieves a 3× speedup over 64 parallel cores. Lastly, it has pragmatic design principles; it enhances in-order architectures that are gaining increasing open-source support.</jats:p>",

Under the context of increasingly severe water shortages, studying the relationship among crop water requirements (ETc), actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa), irrigation water requirements (Ir), yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) would be beneficial to improve the agricultural application of irrigation water. Based on the daily data of 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015, this study used the calibrated AquaCrop model to calculate the ETc, ETa, Ir, and yield of maize (Zea mays L.) in different hydrological years (extremely dry years, dry years, normal years, and wet years) along with WUE to evaluate the mass of yield produced per unit mass of crop evapotranspiration (ET) under rainfed and irrigated scenarios. The results showed that ETc and ETa decreased first and then increased from the west to the east during the four types of hydrological years. Ir exhibited a decreasing trend from the west to the east. Compared with the irrigation scenario, the rainfed scenario’s average yield only decreased by 2.18, 0.55, 0.03, and 0.05 ton/ha, while the WUE increased by 0.32, 0.4, 0.33, and 0.21 kg/m3 in the extremely dry years, dry years, normal years, and wet years, respectively. The results indicated that in the normal and wet years, the WUE was high in the central regions, and irrigation did not significantly increase yield; further, we determined that irrigation should not be considered in these two hydrological years in Heilongjiang Province. In the extremely dry and dry years, irrigation was necessary because it increased the yield, even though the WUE decreased. This study provides a theoretical basis for studying the regional irrigation schedule in Heilongjiang Province.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that high production supply was mostly concentrated in flat plains, whereas highly ecological farmland was frequently observed in mountains. Both urban and rural areas had the capacity to provide aesthetics and recreation. Regarding demand, high values were mainly observed near the downtown area. Additionally, supply-and-demand matching (SDM) and multi-functional coupling and coordination degree (MCCD) were evaluated. Among the four basic zones acquired by SDM analysis, two zones dominated by more than one function were further divided into four sub-regions, according to the MCCD values. Ultimately, six farmland-use zones were determined. By considering the supply, demand and relationships of multiple functions, this farmland-zoning program offers new insights into differentiated farmland protection.</jats:p>"

Contrary to the expected co‐occurrence of seasonal DO and pH declines in subsurface water, we found that the pH decline ended in June while the DO decline continued until August in mid‐Chesapeake Bay.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Conventional wisdom suggests that by including a decoy product in the choice set for consumers, a firm can drive consumers to select more profitable non‐decoy products. Explanations offered to explain such outcomes are rooted in the psychology of consumer behavior. A scan of retail practice, however, indicates that decoys might also be included in a product assortment for economic reasons. For example, products with very low sales potential are often included in offerings by bricks‐and‐mortar and online retailers. This leads us to investigate and offer an alternative supply side explanation for the presence of decoy products in a supply chain. More specifically, we show that in a distribution channel with multiple asymmetric manufacturers and a single retailer, there exists the possibility of an equilibrium which includes a decoy product. Such an equilibrium is characterized by the retailer stocking positive quantities of products from a subset of low‐cost manufacturers (active manufacturers) and negligible or even zero stock of a decoy product sourced from a higher cost manufacturer. The retailer includes a decoy product in the assortment since it helps to obtain better contractual terms from the active manufacturers. Recognizing this, upstream active manufacturers not only compete for market share but are also induced to cooperate (in setting wholesale prices) so as to ensure that the manufacturer of the decoy product is driven out of the market. We also find that the degree of product substitutability moderates which manufacturer's product is a decoy. Our findings provide theoretical support for industry practice as well as implications for retail assortment decisions. </jats:p>",

We built a probabilistic mathematical model, informed by prior beliefs and dedicated stakeholder interviews and microbiological research, to describe sources and prevalence of NTS along the beef supply chain in Moshi, Tanzania. The supply chain was conceptualized using a bow tie model, with terminal livestock markets as pinch point, and a forked pathway postmarket to compare traditional and emerging supply chains. NTS was detected in 36 (7.7%) of 467 samples throughout the supply chain. After combining prior belief and observational data, marginal estimates of true NTS prevalence were 4% in feces of cattle entering the beef supply and 20% in raw meat at butcheries. Based on our model and sensitivity analyses, true NTS prevalence was not significantly different between supply chains. Environmental contamination, associated with butchers and vendors, was estimated to be the most likely source of NTS in meat for human consumption. The model provides a framework for assessing the origin and propagation of NTS along meat supply chains. It can be used to inform decision making when economic factors cause changes in beef production and consumption, such as where to target interventions to reduce risks to consumers. Through sensitivity and value of information analyses, the model also helps to prioritize investment in additional research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cooperative and competitive (i.e., co-opetition) behavior between retailers plays a significant role in the development of operations and marketing strategies in a supply chain. Specifically, retailers’ co-opetition relationship pivotally influences the sustainable performance in a closed-loop supply chain. This study examines the impact of retailer co-opetition on pricing, collection decisions and coordination in a closed-loop supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers. Based on observations in some industries (e.g., electronic manufacturing, fabric and textile, etc.), the cooperative and competitive relationships between retailers can be classified into the following three different modes: Bertrand competition, Stackelberg competition, and Collusion. In this paper, we establish a centralized and three decentralized game-theoretic models under these three co-opetition modes and characterize the corresponding equilibrium outcomes. The results indicate that the Bertrand competition mode yields the highest return rate, which is also superior to the other two modes for both the manufacturer and the supply chain system in terms of profitability. However, it can be shown that which mode benefits the retailers would depend on the degree of competition between the retailers and the relative remanufacturing efficiency. Interestingly, we find that the retailer’s first-move advantage does not necessarily lead to higher profits. In addition, we design a modified two-part tariff contract to coordinate the decentralized closed-loop supply chains under three different retailer co-opetition modes, and the results suggest that the optimal contractual parameters in the contracts highly rely on the remanufacturing efficiency and the competition degree between the two retailers. Several managerial insights for firms, consumers and policy makers are provided through numerical analysis.</jats:p>"

Based on the analysis of rainfall and data of Taihu basin in the recent 30 years, a 1-D hydrodynamic model of the main inflow river network area of Taihu basin was constructed, coupled the convection-diffusion model with conservative material, the characteristics of YRD and the water inflow into Taihu Lake (WITL) in three typical years were calculated. The results show that the YRD has shown a significant upward trend in the past 30 years, accounting for 26.4, 35.6 and 42% of the total WITL in three typical years of wet, normal and dry conditions respectively. From the perspective of space, Taige River is the largest river in the western part of the lake that is affected by the river diversion (35%–72%), and Wuxi River is the smallest (1–3%). In addition, the primary flow path of YRD to Taihu Lake was through the Wuyi River and Lake Gehu from the water diversion station west of the Zao River.</jats:p>",

We investigate the contingent sourcing strategy for the manufacturer to cope with the disruption. To this end, we first discuss the optimal post-disruption stockpiling decision for customers. In view of expected disruption duration, price rise, and inventory holding cost, three types of stockpiling behavior are analytically provided for the customers: non-stockpiling, gradual stockpiling, and instantaneous stockpiling. Next, a model is formulated to optimize the joint decision of contingent sourcing time and quantity, with the objective of maximizing profit expectation. Finally, by conducting numerical analysis, we generate further insights into the role of relative factors and provide specific managerial suggestions on how to adapt dynamic contingent sourcing strategies to alleviate different disruptions, under different market environments and customer behaviors.</jats:p>",

The effects of initial concentration of Pb2+, contact time, temperature and pH on the adsorption performance of phosphate rock modified soil-bentonite (PSB) were analyzed by Batch tests, and the microstructure and physicochemical properties of the adsorbent were characterized and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that the incorporation of phosphate rock improves the adsorption performance of the mixed material for Pb2+ in an acidic environment, and the maximum adsorption amount of PSB can be 154% greater than that of soil-bentonite (SB). Kinetic analysis showed that intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion both participate in control of the adsorption process, and the Langmuir model fitted the isothermal adsorption data better. The adsorption process of PSB to Pb2+ is an exothermic reaction process, and a low temperature environment is beneficial to the adsorption of Pb2+. Studies on the microscopic mechanism show that PO43− reacts with Pb2+ in solution to form phosphate precipitation, and –OH and PO43− are on the surface or interlayer of the adsorbent participate in the adsorption process of Pb2+.</jats:p>",

The hydrogeochemisty data and formation mechanisms were analyzed to reveal the connection proof. Compared with shallow groundwater, the surface water from the subsidence lake has a higher content of Na+ and HCO3−. For the two types of water samples, Na+ and Mg2+ are two most abundant cations, followed by Ca2+. The contents of anions followed the same order: HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; Cl−. The water samples were controlled by NaHCO3 (99.3%) type. The chemical composition of the two types of water were similar, which are all mainly influenced by silicate minerals weathering and ion-exchange interactions, among which ion-exchange interactions were more intense than in shallow groundwater. The recharging source of the two types of water mainly came from atmospheric precipitation. The two waters in the study area, in general, showed the risk of high salt and low-moderate alkali damage. The outcomes provide a better understanding of the subsidence lake and groundwater and it will help utilization of water resources.</jats:p>",

We found that 0.52 mg/L of BPA could be removed while consuming 5.44 mg/L of dissolved oxygen (DO). Since the oxidation process of NH4+ and BPA both consume the DO in water, the presence of NH4+ can hinder the removal of BPA. The presence of Mn2+ in water had a synergistic effect on BPA removal. The filter film was characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS. Some substances were generated to block the pores of the oxide film, and a small amount of film was found to crack and fall off. The elemental composition of C and O were both increased by about 9.00%, the composition of Mn was decreased from 63.48% to 44.55%, and the reduced manganese substance might affect the activity of the oxide film. The main chemical forms of MeOx were Mn6O12·3H2O, MnFe2O4 and Mn3O4. The decrease in the removal efficiency of BPA was mainly due to the C-containing intermediate [−CH2C − H(OH)]n covering the surface of the oxide film and blocking the pore size of the film.</jats:p>",

In this context, efficient planning and technology changes are necessary to ensure high productivity, competitiveness and harmony with economic, social, and environmental issues. Consequently, this sector needs technical and scientific support. Mathematical optimization models can be useful to build efficient planning tools for the activities involved in the sugarcane supply chain, helping to address these challenges. This paper describes the sugarcane supply chain and presents a literature review of mathematical optimization models that have been proposed to represent its main stages: planting, harvesting, transporting, industrial processing, and marketing. The findings show that several models have been proposed to represent these five stages, however, most of them have not been thoroughly explored from the point of view of strength of the models and solution methods. Moreover, the harvesting stage is the one that has received more attention than the other stages. In the integration of two or more stages, there are many challenges yet to be addressed by mathematical optimization models. This review contributes to a better understanding of the sugar‐energy sector and opens up new perspectives for future investigations.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the green coal supplier evaluation model has its own characteristics. Although many methods have been developed to solve the green supplier evaluation problem, little is known about how to evaluate the green coal supplier in the thermal power supply chain. To overcome this drawback, an evaluation index system for the green coal supplier is established, and new indexes such as price based on calorific value, quality indexes based on the designed coal type, and transportation indexes such as transportation carbon footprint and environment indexes are created according to the characteristic of the thermal power supply chain. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to create the main evaluation indexes, and the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for the evaluation model. Finally, a practical example is applied to show that the model established in this paper outperforms others in evaluation accuracy.</jats:p>",

As the main maize production area in midwestern Jilin Province, frequent drought and a shortage of irrigation water pose substantial threats to the production of maize. We analyzed the balance of water supply and demand in each growth period and the degree of maize yield affected by drought. The results indicate that the FIO-ESM climate model can effectively simulate the changes in temperature and precipitation, and was highly applicable to the study area. From 1980 to 2020, the drought risk indices for the sowing to jointing, jointing to tasseling, tasseling to milk-ripe, and milk-ripe to maturity stages were 0.62, 0.52, 0.48, and 0.60, respectively. In the future, the chances of a RCP8.5 scenario drought risk and an enhanced RCP4.5 scenario have eased. Spatially, the high-risk areas shift in a “west−central−southwest” pattern. Effective precipitation will decrease in the future, while the increasing water requirement of maize increases the dependence on irrigation water. The irrigation requirement index is more than 70% for all periods, particularly in the milk-ripe to maturity stage. The relative meteorological yields were positively correlated with the CWDI of the whole growth period, with the rate of reduction in maize yield and the yield reduction coefficient of variation at a high level of risk between 1980 and 2020. In the future, the negative impact of drought risk on the yield of maize lessened with no obvious trend in production. In particular, the rate of reduction and reduction coefficient of variation for the RCP8.5 scenario were 1.24 and 1.09, respectively.</jats:p>"

Firstly, it constructs the profit function and the financial hedging decision-making model of each member in the decentralized supply chain. Secondly, it introduces the incentive mechanism of exchange rate risk hedging in the centralized supply chain. Thirdly, from the perspective of wholesale price agreements and revenue-sharing contracts, it discusses the impact of financial hedging behavior and bilateral exchange rate risks on the decision-making process of each member through mathematical modeling. Finally, it explores the relationships of decision variables through simulation analysis. The results illustrate that (i) for decentralized and centralized decision-making, the manufacturer’s expected profit and profit variance decrease with the increase of the fluctuations of import and export exchange rates under the hedging strategy for exchange rate risks; (ii) compared with the decentralized supply chain, the manufacturer’s expected profit in the centralized supply chain decreases slightly under the revenue-sharing contract; (iii) in the centralized supply chain, if the manufacturer’s risk hedging ratio is high, its profit variance is smaller than that of the decentralized supply chain and the expected profits of the retailer and the supplier will increase significantly; and (iv) for the members of the transnational supply chain, centralized decision-making is better than decentralized decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose — to investigate the vitamin D supply in children with chronic viral hepatitis B (HBV) depending on the activity of hepatitis and the stage of liver fibrosis. Materials and methods. Fifty children with HBV were examined. All children underwent a comprehensive examination according to the recommendation and elastography of the shear wave of the liver parenchyma to determine the stage of fibrosis. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was determined to verify the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. The peculiarities of vitamin D supply in children with HBV, depending on gender, age, hepatitis activity and stage of liver fibrosis, were evaluated. The study included children who did not receive calcium and vitamin D for 6 months. Results. Children of senior scholl age predomnanted among the surveyed. HBV was more often registered in boys 66.0% (n=33), while in girls — only 34.0% (n=17) (χ2=10.24; p=0.01). Among the examined children significantly more often 66.0% (n=33) we observed HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, 18.0% (n=9) children were diagnosed with HBeAg-positive chronic infection, HBeAg-negative chronic infection were determined in 14.0% (n=7) of children. In the vast majority (70.0%) of patients with HBV, the concentration of vitamin D in the serum was reduced (χ2=16.0; p=0.01). The average concentration of 25(OH)D was 59.85 [13.4–181] nmol/l and was in the zone of insufficiency. The optimal concentration of 25(OH)D was found in 30.0% (n=15) of children, insufficiency in 42.0% (n=21), vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed in 14 children (28.0%). Gender, age and biochemical activity of hepatitis do not affect the level of vitamin D in the examined children with HBV (p&gt;0.05). The analysis of vitamin D supply depending on the stage of fibrosis did not reveal differences in the median concentration of 25(OH)D between groups of children, but in all groups the number of patients with low concentrations of vitamin D prevailed. Conclusions. HBV in children is characterized mainly by a chronic course, with a predominance of the parenteral route of infection. In most patients with HBV, the concentration of 25(OH)D in the serum is reduced. There was no statistically significant difference between the levels of vitamin D in children with HBV depending on gender, age, and biochemical activity of hepatitis. All children with cirrhosis of the liver were deficient in vitamin D. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration. The study protocol was approved by the Local ethics committee of all participating institution. The informed consent of the patient was obtained for conducting the studies. No conflict of interest was declared by the authors. Key words: chronic viral hepatitis B, children, vitamin D, hepatitis activity, stage of fibrosis.</jats:p>",
