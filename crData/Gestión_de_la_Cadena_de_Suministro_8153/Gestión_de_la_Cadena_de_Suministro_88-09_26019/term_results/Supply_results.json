      "abstract": "<jats:p> The serious search for hydrocarbon resources in Africa dates back to the 1950s when the major suppliers were obligated to find other sources because home country reserves were being depleted and the political situation in the Middle East was increasingly unstable. Resultant activity in Africa increased reserves five-fold with Algeria, Nigeria, Libya and Angola accounting for 87% of the total. During this period each country increasingly exercised direct control of its reserves. Africa can be expected to keep its 9% share of world producion which is approximately 5.5mbd, a level that can be maintained with reasonable assurance until the year 2000. About 4mbd of this will be exported, principally to OECD countries. The development of further oil potential will rely heavily on foreign capital and technology. Its availabilty, in turn, will be influenced by oil requirements and oil politics. </jats:p>",

Government interventions have aimed at correcting their most obvious effects, but do not take into account the absence of economies of scale, nor the major role of uncertainty in driving producer decisions in this sector. Over‐production, as well as shortages (of staple foods in many developing countries), have followed. So‐called ‘structural’ policies are not much help, because their cost is too high, being of the same order of magnitude as the value of the commodities they are supposed to regulate. A generalized system of quotas could possibly be considered, although there exist few grounds to fix the target quantity at national level.</jats:p>",

Injektion von 555 kBq <jats:sup>54</jats:sup>Mn über eine Zeitspanne von 16 Tagen ein Futter mit 2,8, 9,1, 25,8 bzw. 59,7 ppm Mn bei Einzelhaltung. Der Verlauf der <jats:sup>54</jats:sup>Mn‐Retention wies darauf hin, daß sich mit steigendem Mn‐Gehalt im Futter der Mn‐Pool im Körper mit kurzer biologischer Halbwertszeit (1,1 bis 1,7 Tage) in etwa verdoppelte und sich mittlere biologische Halbwertszeiten von Körpermangan mit geringerer Turnoverrate stark verkürzten (von 15,8 auf 7,6 Tage). Endkonzentrationen von stabilem Mangan in verschiedenen Organen (Leber, Pankreas, Nieren, Femur) und im Ganzkörper der Hähnchen variierten um einen Faktor von höchstens zwei, vor allem aufgrund einer deutlichen Mn‐Depletion der Gewebe bei der Grundstufe des Mn‐Gehaltes im Futter. Tagesraten der endogenen Exkretion und wahren Retention des Mangans, die für die letzten 8 Tage der Versuchsperiode bestimmt wurden, erhöhten sich in kurvilinearer Beziehung zur Mn‐Konzentration im Futter von etwa 20 auf 80 μg Mn bzw. von 40 auf 125 ug Mn. Eine halbmaximale wahre Mn‐Retention von 69 μg/Tag wurde bei einem Gehalt von etwa 7 ppm Mn im Futter gemessen. Mit steigendem Mn‐Gehalt im Futter sank die Effizienz der wahren Mn‐Retention von etwa 22 auf nahezu 3% und die Nettoretention von etwa 11 auf nahezu 1 % der täglichen Mn‐Aufnahme. Daraus ist zu schließen, daß der Rückgang in der prozentualen wahren Mn‐Retention quantitativ die vorrangige homöostatische Reaktion auf den Anstieg der Mn‐Zufuhr darstellt und auch eine variable endogene Mn‐Ausscheidung erheblich dazu beiträgt, im Körper relativ konstante Mn‐Konzentrationen aufrechtzuerhalten.</jats:p>",

Concomitant with these events was an 137% increase in the relative growth rate of the whole plant and a cessation in nodule growth. Although the concentration of total soluble sugar in nodules was not affected by NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> treatment, the concentration of starch declined to 13% of the control level after 2 days exposure to NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>. In contrast to the effects of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>, nodules in which nitrogenase activity was partially inhibited by a 30 min exposure to 100% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, showed a 52% increase over control in the starch pool over a 72 h period.</jats:p><jats:p>The results were compared with recent studies of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> inhibition of nitrogenase activity in legumes, and in contrast to these studies it was concluded that the inhibitory effects of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> could be accounted for by alterations in photosynthate partitioning to nodules. A hypothesis is proposed which attempts to account for the recent observation (J. K. Vessey, K. B. Walsh, and D. B. Layzell 1988. Physiol. Plant. 73: 113–121) that nitrogenase activity in phloem‐limited and nitrate‐inhibited nodules is limited by O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> diffusion. This hypothesis separates the concepts of photosynthate partitioning and phloem supply from that of carbohydrate deprivation and related effects on the size of the carbohydrate pools in nodules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>D-glucose transport across the intestinal brush-border membrane involves two transport systems designated here as systems 1 and 2. Kinetic properties for both D-glucose and methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside transport were measured at 35 degrees C by using brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from either control, fasted (48 hr), or semistarved (10 days) animals. The results show the following: (i) The sugar influx rate by simple diffusion was identical under either altered condition. (ii) Semistarvation stimulated D-glucose uptake by system 2 (both its Vmax and Km increased), whereas system 1 was untouched. (iii) Fasting increased the capacity of system 1 without affecting either Km of system 1 or Vmax and Km of system 2. The effect of fasting on Vmax of system 1 cannot be attributed to indirect effects from changes in ionic permeability because the kinetic difference between control and fasted animals persisted when the membrane potential was short-circuited with equilibrated K+ and valinomycin. This work provides further evidence for the existence of two distinct sodium-activated D-glucose transport systems in the intestinal brush-border membrane, which adapt independently to either semistarvation or fasting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. The effect of harvesting date of perennial ryegrass (<jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic>) on the nutritive value of the resultant silage and the effect of substitution of late-cut silage with barley was examined in growing cattle. The diets comprised early-cut (H) and late-cut (L) silage offered alone or with 280 (LCI) or 560 (LC2) g rolled barley/kg total dry matter (DM) substituted for late-cut silage.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Both silages were prepared with the addition of formic acid (850 g/l; 2.4 litres/t fresh weight) to a partially wilted crop, and were judged to be well fermented (pH 3.9, 3.8) with lactic acid contents of 108 and 73 g/kg DM, total nitrogen contents of 24.6 and 18.4 g/kg DM and ammonia-N contents of 121 and 124 g/kg total N (values for early- and late-cut silages respectively).</jats:p><jats:p>3. Two experiments were conducted to measure duodenal non-NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N (NAN) supply in relation to N intake on the four diets (feeding level 18 g DM/kg live weight (LW)) and to examine the partition of the metabolizable energy (ME) supply from the four diets using open-circuit indirect calorimetry (three feeding levels, 14, 17 and 20 g DM/kg LW). The experiments were undertaken with eight and nine Friesian male castrates respectively with a mean starting weight of 300 kg and age 12 months. The animals used in Expt 1 had been previously fitted with cannulas into the dorsal rumen and the proximal duodenum.</jats:p><jats:p>4. NAN supply was significantly higher on diet H than all other diets which were similar irrespective of the level of barley inclusion. Mean ME contents (MJ/kg DM) of the two silages differed markedly (H 11.9, L 9.7) and barley addition (LCI and LC2) restored values to 10.7 and 11.1 MJ/kg DM respectively. Estimated NAN absorption in relation to energy supply was significantly higher for diet H (1.47 g/MJ ME) than for all other diets (mean 1.25 g/MJ ME).</jats:p><jats:p>5. Partition of ME supply using conventional linear analysis indicated dietary differences with respect to estimated ME for maintenance (L &gt; H, LCI and LC2) and efficiency of utilization of ME supplied above maintenance (L &gt; H, LCI and LC2), but difficulties in biological interpretation of these findings led to the use of exponential curve analysis. This provided an improved description of the findings, and whilst dietary differences were apparent, none were statistically significant. It was concluded that a single exponential equation could be used satisfactorily to describe all values.</jats:p><jats:p>6. The consequence of these findings in relation to the carcass retentions of energy. fat and protein reported by Thomas <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (1988) is discussed and possible reasons for the discrepancies in energy retention measured by comparative slaughter balance and open-circuit indirect calorimetry are considered.</jats:p>",
