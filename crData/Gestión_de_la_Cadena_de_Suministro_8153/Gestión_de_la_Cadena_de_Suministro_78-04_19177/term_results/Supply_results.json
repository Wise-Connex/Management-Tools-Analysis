Whilst supply from this source is a function of the demand for higher education places, their supply, and the internal efficiency and flexibility of higher education institutions, comparatively little is known of the relative importance of these determinants, what in turn determines them, and how they interreact. Any generalized answers to these questions will be strongly mitigated by institutional, demographic and socio‐economic variations over time and between countries. This paper analyzes the influence of immediate financial variables, as important elements in the price of higher education, as they applied in the era of Commonwealth Scholarship Schemes in Australia.</jats:p>",
