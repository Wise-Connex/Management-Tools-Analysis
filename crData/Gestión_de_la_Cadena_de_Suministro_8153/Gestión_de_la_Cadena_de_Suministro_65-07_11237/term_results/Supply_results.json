      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Chicago Department of Water and Sewers has been requested to develop recommendations for desirable quality criteria goals for various parameters for Lake Michigan water received at its intakes. This article describes Lake Michigan water as an excellent source of water supply that is easily treated in conventional rapid sand treatment plants to produce a superior quality water for domestic and industrial use. It is only during periods when industrial and sewage pollution of the water is present that it becomes difficult to produce the customary high quality water. Furthermore, increased nutrients in the water definitely help bring about biologic degradation of the lake. The article discusses recommendations by the department for achieving the maximum goals in various parameters of quality. The parameter threshold odor number has been omitted because of differences in the effectiveness of treatment. It is therefore suggested that natural algae odors be omitted from these parameters and that a maximum goal of a threshold odor number of 6 be set for the intake water for odors produced by industrial waste pollution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A completely self-contained AFC circuit for klystron power supplies used with reflection cavity type EPR spectrometers is described. No internal modifications to the klystron power supply are required and the entire AFC circuit is enclosed in a single unit containing an oscillator, ac preamplifier, phase detector, and feedback elements. The circuit has an open loop gain versus frequency characteristic which makes it particularly advantageous for use with klystron power supplies which generate 60 cps or other low frequency noise and which may, in addition, have a considerable amount of drift.</jats:p>",
