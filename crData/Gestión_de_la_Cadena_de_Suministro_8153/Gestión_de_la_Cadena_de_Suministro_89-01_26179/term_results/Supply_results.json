The power supply has a capacitor charging capability of 10 kJ/s at 25 kV. By using parallel MOSFETS operating at up to 80 kHz and controlling the duty cycle of the series resonance inverter, 0.1% regulation was achieved. The high voltage transformer is a modular pancake design which has a self-resonance of 750 kHz and a turn ratio of 1:125 resulting in good coupling. Uses are in pulsed power and lasers where high repetition rate capacitor charging with high accuracy is required.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because much of South Australia's electricity is gas-  generated the future supply of gas from the Cooper Basin is the central issue in the state's energy planning. Available proven reserves of gas are only sufficient to meet the state's demand until the early 1990s.The TARDIS computer program has therefore been written to enable production scheduling of proved and probable gas reserves and, by using historically derived discovery- rate algorithms, to calculate the exploration-  drilling effort necessary to meet future gas supply requirements.The mandatory requirement was that the program should complete a simulation within several minutes. This necessitated the decomposition of complex engineering procedures to a simple level without unacceptable loss of accuracy.TARDIS simulates a network of discovered and undiscovered fields which may be allocated to four zones. The fields supply a defined gas market via a processing plant. Appraisal drilling in zones one and three converts estimates of possible gas- in- place into the proved and probable category after allowance for risk. Exploration drilling in zones two and four predicts the discovery of additional reserves using an algorithm, calibrated by historical data, based on the observation that field size decreases as cumulative drilling effort increases.Fields are scheduled in development priority and sufficient fields are brought on line to satisfy a defined gas market. The required number of on- line fields is determined by the cumulative field deliverability and the peak day gas demand. As each field comes on line development wells are drilled until the field is fully developed.A processing plant is simulated to produce sales gas which is within the required specification for chemical composition. The quantity of each of the ancillary gaseous and liquid products is also computed.Data entry and graphical display of results is processed with a spreadsheet and the program runs on a personal computer.TARDIS enables an assessment of whether the current and forecast drilling effort is likely to discover sufficient reserves to satisfy the market. It has proved an invaluable tool in investigating future gas- supply options for South Australia.</jats:p>"

Incorporation of the MOSFET permits flexible control of flash duty cycle and frequency by applying one signal to the transistor’s gate. The circuit’s versatility is demonstrated using an 8.3-W xenon flashlamp as an excitation source for a photodiode array based HPLC fluorescence detector.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A decision to introduce natural gas supply to a small market requires a thorough examination of the economic and technical factors that a gas distributor will encounter in such a project. This paper identifies the important factors to be considered in the feasibility stage and in the construction and implementation phases of the project. The experience of the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria supplying natural gas to the city of Warrnambool is described through all these stages.A feasibility study for natural gas to a small market requires the preparation of a reliable forecast of end- user demand and an assessment of demand/price elasticities for major market sectors, such as household uses and large industrial uses. Where gas is to be supplied from new gas fields any assessment of proven gas reserves must be made. The assessed level of reserves can be measured against forecast demand to identify an expected project life over which the producer and distributor will need to earn a fair return.A producer and a distributor have a common interest in the level of recoverable reserves, the price between producer and distributor, the market demand and the price payable by end- users. A price agreed between a producer and a distributor will be at a level where both parties are satisfied with the expected returns. A higher price would increase returns to the producer, but would deter the distributor from the project.Natural gas supply to Warrnambool involved the planning and construction of a pipeline and an up­grading and expansion of the local reticulation system. In addition, conversion of nearly 13 000 household appliances was undertaken. This work was successfully completed at a cost of about $10 million. The planning and design of these facilities is a balance between short-  term cost minimisation, and cost levels that will achieve long- term economies of scale.To achieve a fast development of the end- use consumption, a strong marketing effort was undertaken to ensure connection of large- use industrial customers was achieved without delay. This quick development of load was essential to provide good cash inflows to the distributor and the producer at an early stage of project development.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to determine if the major supply of switchgrass herbage could be delayed by use of partial spring defoliation and still maintain adequate herbage quality. Switchgrass plots were fertilized with 0 or 120 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and defoliated at six time‐intensity combinations. Yield and quality of initial spring and 6‐wk regrowth were measured. Initial 1984 spring defoliation treatments were 1 June at 15 cm; a multiple defoliation at 15, 20, and 25 cm over 1‐wk intervals beginning on 1 June; 15 June at 6 or 20 cm; and 29 June at 6 or 20 cm. All 1985 treatments were 9 d earlier. Fertilization with N increased 6‐wk regrowth dry matter (DM) yields by 79 to 92% for 1 June treatments and by only 38 to 54% for 29 June treatments. Close defoliation on 29 June produced the greatest total seasonal DM yield of 10.5 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and IVDDM yield of 5.79 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, but only 30% of this was harvested in midsummer after 6 wk of regrowth. Total season DM yield and IVDDM yield were about 20 to 35% less for both 1 June treatments when compared with close defoliation on 29 June, but the 6‐wk regrowth yield accounted for about 75 to 85% of total season DM and IVDDM yields. Little or no difference in leaf or stem IVDDM of the 6‐wk regrowth was observed among defoliation treatments, so partial spring defoliation can delay the major supply of switchgrass herbage with no serious reduction in herbage quality. We conclude that a short period of moderate defoliation of switchgrass in early to mid‐June could benefit grazing programs by providing (i) some very high‐quality switchgrass herbage during early to mid‐June; (ii) a brief rest and regrowth period for the cool‐season pasture; and (iii) relatively high summer yields of quality switchgrass when it is most needed.</jats:p>",

Comments by several writers have raised the possibility of conflicts betweens the tax principles of the two schools. In particular, both Brunner (1982) and Reynolds (1982) criticized supply-siders for emphasizing tax cuts to increase public revenues and ignoring the importance of placing limits on governmental growth. In addition, McKenzie's description of “constitutional economics” as an intellectual movement that “promises far more radical reforms of government than those ever attempted by Keynesian and supply-side economics” (1984, p. 1) indicates that “constitutional” and supply-side economics are different. Yet, his discussion of the Laffer curve and supply-side tax cuts from a constitutional economist's perspective leaves the distinct impression that the two schools are in agreement on tax policy positions.</jats:p>"

They can be used by analysts for plausible inferences about unknown coefficients when incomplete data or only partial information are available.

For both consumables, there was a concomitant increase in nitrogen content. There were no associated changes in strength or microstructure, but there was generally a progressive decrease in crack tip opening displacement (CTOD), measured at - 10°C, and in Charpy toughness.

This research has broad policy implications since many government tax and transfer programs alter the wage rates that workers receive, or alter their perception of the value of the wages received. Comparable worth programs are explicitly intended to alter the wage rates of working women. Accepted theories in labor economics of how the female labor supply is affected by the wage offers that women receive are surveyed in this paper, and the implications concerning expected effects of comparable worth wage adjustments on female labor supply are summarized. Then available empirical evidence bearing on the theory of female labor supply is examined, and the stated implications for comparable worth programs are qualified.</jats:p>",

We evaluated the possible effects of this therapy on the thyroid of the fetus by investigating 62 women with a mean duration of amenorrhea of 20 weeks who solicited controlled abortion. Nineteen of them douched daily with PVP-I for 7 consecutive days before abortion (treated group). The other 43 women were not treated (control group). In both groups the iodine content was determined in the fetal thyroid and in amniotic fluid and maternal urine at the time of abortion. In addition, in the treated group the concentrations of iodine were also determined in amniotic fluid and urine before therapy and in urine after 4 days of therapy. There were no differences in the concentrations of iodine in urine and amniotic fluid in the control group and in the treated group before therapy. In the treated group urinary iodine increased from 6.1 ± (SEM) 0.8 µg/dl before therapy to 91 ± 20 µg/dl after 4 days and to 153 ± 60 µg/dl after 7 days of therapy (p &lt; 0.001). In parallel, iodine in amniotic fluid increased from 1.2 ± 0.2 µg/dl before therapy to 3.7 ± 1.3 µg/dl after 7 days (p &lt; 0.05). In both groups the iodine content of the fetal thyroid increased with gestational age. However, it increased more rapidly in the treated group (from 1 to 7.7 µg) than in the control group (from 1 to 2.5 µg), p &lt; 0.05. In conclusion, routine vaginal douching with PVP-I during early pregnancy induces maternal iodine overload and markedly increases the iodine content not only of the amniotic fluid but also of the fetal thyroid, as soon as the trapping mechanism of iodide by the thyroid has started to develop. In view of the well-documented hypersensitivity of the fetal and neonatal thyroid to the blocking effect of excess iodide, the vaginal application of PVP-I is not recommended during pregnancy.</jats:p>"

A method of analysis is developed to distinguish between the impact on transpiration of ground cover (which varied threefold between spacings) and of root:shoot ratio, which was substantially greater in the wider row spacings. When the soil was wet, both T and the canopy conductance, gc, were approximately proportional to the fraction (f) of incident radiation intercepted by foliage. But when the soil water content decreased below a threshold value, T/f and gc/f decreased because of an increase in stomatal resistance. Stomatal closure in response to soil water stress occurred sooner in the denser stands, partly because of more rapid depletion of soil water. A second contributory factor was that the sparser stands (which had a relatively large root:shoot ratio) had a greater capacity to keep stomata open as the soil water deficit increased.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this article is to search for lessons or warnings for Canada (and, ultimately, elsewhere) in the manner in which Israel has chosen to accommodate its huge supply of physicians. Under extremely conservative assumptions about immigration, and assuming rates of domestic training of physicians at levels somewhat lower than at present, Canada's physician supply will continue to grow at rates in excess of general population growth for at least the next 45 years. In this article we describe the Israeli health care system from a perspective of identifying the consequences of accommodating a physician supply about 50 percent higher than that in Canada. A number of key “accommodation attributes” (low physician incomes, restricted access to hospitals for general practitioners, intramedical-professional conflicts over income and authority, a flourishing black market) are argued to be more than simply products of a unique cultural and political system, but also symptoms of a system vastly oversupplied with physicians. Early signs in Canada of similar “products” of a growing physician supply are noted. While a two-country comparison makes drawing lessons somewhat speculative, the coincidence of events suggests that these trends in Canada warrant, if not immediate action, at least careful monitoring. </jats:p>",

Soil properties related to availability and plant properties reflecting nutrient acquisition were determined. Their interactions in the rhizosphere and their importance for nutrient supply of plants were studied by a combination of measurements and calculations using a simulation model.</jats:p><jats:p>Phosphorus and potassium uptake by roots decreased P and K concentration at the root surface and caused characteristic depletion profiles in the adjacent soil. The shape of the profiles depended on the effective diffusion coefficient, the concentration of the nutrient in soil, morphological properties of the roots and on influx into roots. The degree of depletion at the root surface indicated the proportion of the nutrient potentially available in the soil. The shape of the depletion profiles reflected the amount of the nutrient taken up by a root section. The parameters found to describe nutrient acquisition are (i) influx per unit root length, (ii) root length per unit shoot weight (root/shoot ratio), and (iii) the period of time a root section absorbs nutrients. Plant species differed considerably in these properties.</jats:p><jats:p>In order to integrate the processes involved and to evaluate the importance of individual factors, the Claassen‐Barber model was used. Depletion profiles and nutrient uptake calculated with this model were in good agreement with measured values in a number of cases. However, at low P supply, plants absorbed substantially more P than the model predicted. This indicates that influx in this case is supported by mechanisms not properly taken into account yet.</jats:p><jats:p>Influx per unit root length depends on morphological properties of and nutrient mobilization by roots. Root hairs increase root surface area per unit root length. In addition, because of their small diameter and geometric arrangement in soil, root hairs are specially apt to gain from diffusion when concentration gradients are small. This applies even more to VA‐mycorrhizae. Their hyphae are longer and thinner than root hairs and can thus deplete larger volumes of soil per unit root length.</jats:p><jats:p>Root‐induced changes of soil pH increased the size of P depletion profiles, indicating that roots can mobilize soil P by this mechanism. Both acid and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities were found to be markedly increased at the soil‐root interface suggesting that soil organic P may contribute to the P supply of plants.</jats:p>",

Increases in solution calcium concentration from 2 to 12 8M generally increased rates of absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, manganese and zinc, and rates of transport of magnesium and iron to plant tops. These increases in nutrient absorption and transport rates were associated with the alleviation of severe calcium deficiency. Further increases in solution calcium concentration from 12 to 2500 8M generally had no effect on potassium absorption rate, but increased absorption rates of nitrogen (by 20-130%), and phosphorus (by 90-500%), and decreased those of manganese and zinc; it also decreased rates of transport of iron and magnesium to plant tops. With guar, rates of phosphorus absorption at &lt;2500 8M calcium were too low to maintain adequate concentrations of phosphorus in tops for maximum growth. With the remaining legumes, rates of zinc absorption at 12 8M calcium were high enough for plants to accumulate excessive concentrations of zinc (347-479 mg kg-1) in their tops. These results are discussed in relation to the adaptation of tropical food legumes to soils with low concentrations of calcium in the soil solution and the response of legumes to calcium or lime applications. </jats:p>"

The rates of water withdrawal, N mass flow and N diffusion were determined as a function of soil depth and time.</jats:p><jats:p>The contribution to the N supply to roots by mass flow was 15–33% and mainly confined to the topsoil layer. The N supply by diffusion plays with 67–85% the dominant role, particularly in deeper rootzone layers. During periods of high N uptake, the N inflow (per unit root length and time) ranges between 0.26–2.07 μmol/(m · d) at various rootzone layers for cereal, and between 3.80–8.98 μmol/(m · d) for sugar beet, respectively. As a consequence of the high proportion of diffusion supply, at harvest the whole rootzone was largely depleted of nitrate. Thus, nitrate leaching losses during winter were small, the average nitrate concentration of the yearly groundwater recharge being only 7.9 mg N/l.</jats:p><jats:p>Additionally, some results on supply of K, Ca, Mg and Cl for spring wheat and sugar beet are given. Diffusion supply prevails for K, and in the case of sugar beet for Mg and Cl also. Mass flow of Ca exceeded uptake considerably.</jats:p>",

The pinchoff voltage and cutoff frequency of the JFET were 1.2 V and 900 MHz, respectively. The transimpedance in operation was 965 ft, which was almost the same as the feedback resistance.

Plants were grown either without NO3- or with up to 7.5 mM NO3- and at 10, 15, and 20�C to assess the effects of mineral nitrogen and of temperature on plant growth, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction).The strains TA 101 and SU 391 were slow to nodulate 'Fiord' faba bean (up to 50 days from sowing) but were rapid (20 days) on pea. TA 101 nodulated the pea cultivar 'A 102' significantly better than it did 'Early Dun', and was generally more effective in supplying N to its host than was SU 391 in the absence of NO3-.Nodule development in 'Fiord' inoculated with SU391 was slightly stimulated in the presence of 2.5 mM NO3-, which compensated for the poor early seedling growth which occurred when plants were grown without mineral nitrogen. Both 5.0 and 7.5 mM NO3- delayed nodulation, decreased nodule number and decreased nodule activity of 'Fiord'. NO3- also had a strongly depressive effect on nodulation and nodule activity of pea but strongly promoted plant growth.Seedling growth and nodulation were poorer at 10�C than at either 15 or 20�C in both faba bean and pea. Nodulation of 'Fiord' was markedly reduced by the low temperature, and it appears likely to be slow in the field when the soil temperature is low (10�C) as may occur after late sowing. The known yield advantage of early planting of this cultivar may in part be due to better nodulation under warm (15�C) soil conditions. It is concluded that strains TA 101 and SU 391 are not very effective on 'Fiord' faba bean, although poor seedling growth due to poor nodulation with these inoculants may be compensated for by soil mineral nitrogen. Concentrations of soil NO3- equivalent to 2.5 to 5.0 mM, however, may depress the capacity of both faba bean and pea to fix nitrogen in the field.</jats:p>"

Fine-root elongation and nitrogen uptake in Pinus preceded that in Betula. Seasonal variations in unit leaf rate and relative growth rate correlated with the prevailing temperature conditions. Pinus did not differ in phenology of growth with changes in nutrient supply while the growth and duration of foliage for Betula increased with increasing nutrient supply.

Regular measurements were made of these cations in the leaves, stems, inflorescence, seed and litter of established plants during the wet and dry seasons of 1978-79.Phosphorus supply did not affect K, decreased Ca, increased Mg, and in some fractions increased Na concentration. It decreased the ratio of Ca to P. Applied P had no effect on the changes in cation concentration through time. With increasing plant age, K decreased in leaves of all species, Ca decreased in Seca and Schofield (but remained constant in CPI 34904), Mg was relatively steady in all species, and Na decreased in Seca and CP134904 but not Schofield. A comparison of cation concentrations in intact leaves and leaf litter suggests there was remobilization of K, and to a lesser degree, Na and Mg, but not Ca from old leaves prior to senescence.Potassium and Ca in leaf and green stem were generally considered adequate for cattle requirements throughout the year. However, Mg and Na often fell below the level required for cattle growth. The wide Ca/P ratio combined with low P concentration in all species suggests that cattle grazing these pastures would respond to P supplementation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seven rates of copper were applied to the soil prior to the sowing of strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferumL. cv. Palestine) on an alkaline peat deficient in copper. Symptoms of copper deficiency were evident only on the untreated plots where the clover did not set seed nor persist into the second year.Over five years� production, 1.0 kg Cu/ha continued to provide adequate copper, with regular dressings of superphosphate, for maximum dry matter production and seed yield. It was found that seed yield was more sensitive than vegetative dry matter yield to sub-optimal copper supply. At the lowest rate of applied copper (0.125 kg/ha), the vegetative yield ranged from 53% to 80% of the maximum harvest yield, whereas the seed yield ranged from 15% to 50% of maximum yield.For tissue sampled in the spring, the proposed critical range for copper concentration in the youngest open leaf (YOL) for vegetative dry matter production is 3-35 mg Cu/kg whereas that for seed production is 4.5-5.5 mg Cu/kg. At other times of the year the critical concentrations were higher. It was not clear if this was due to environmental conditions or changing internal requirements for copper.The critical copper concentration range in whole top (WT) tissue of 3.0-4.0 mg/kg for vegetative dry matter production could be applied to all samplings. For seed yield the critical range for copper concentration in WT was 4.0-5.0 mg/kg for the spring harvests. The critical copper concentration in seed for seed production was 5.0-6.0 mg/kg. In the pasture situation a critical concentration of 5.0-6.0 mg Cu/kg in the WT should be adopted when the animal requirement is considered.</jats:p>"

Trikkala) were grown on three copper-deficient soil types at seven rates of copper, applied at sowing, to determine their vegetative and seed yield response to copper fertilizer.On two soil types, symptoms of copper deficiency were apparent where no copper was supplied. On the third, symptoms appeared only in one season, after the site was waterlogged. On the three soil types, the symptoms disappeared when 0.125 kg Cu/ha was applied at sowing. although at this rate vegetative and seed yields were reduced by as much as 44% and 59% respectively.The proposed critical concentration range in youngest open leaf tissue for both diagnosing maximum vegetative dry matter and predicting maximum seed yield is 3.0-4.5 mg Cu/kg for Woogenellup and Nungarin subterranean clover. Trikkala subterranean clover had higher critical concentration ranges for diagnosing maximum vegetative dry matter (4.0-6.0 mg Culkg) and predicting maximum seed yield (4.5-7.0 mg Cu/kg). It was not clear whether this difference was due to a higher internal requirement for copper of Trikkala or overlying environmental conditions affecting the external copper supply at the time of sampling.For whole top tissue (WT), there was no difference in the critical concentration range between the three cultivars for diagnosing maximum vegetative yield (3.0-4.0 mg Cu/kg). However, the critical concentration in WT for predicting maximum seed yield was higher for Trikkala (5.0-6.0 mg Cu/kg) than Woogenellup and Nungarin (3.5-4.5 mg Cu/kg). In the pasture situation, a critical concentration of 5.0-6.0 mg Cu/kg in the WT should be adopted when animal requirement is considered.Seed copper concentration for predicting maximum seed or vegetative yield was not a reliable indicator of copper status of subterranean clover.</jats:p>"
