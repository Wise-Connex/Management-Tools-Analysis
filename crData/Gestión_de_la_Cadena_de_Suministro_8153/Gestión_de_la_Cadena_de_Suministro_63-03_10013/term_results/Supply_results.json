The North Jersey District Water Supply Commission's Wanaque Reservoir received overflow water from Cupsaw Lake. The ice on the lake was acting as a natural barrier to the flow of oil toward the spillway. The article discusses preventive measures to keep the oil from flowing over the spillway. A second oil contamination incident at the lake was mitigated by prevailing winds and a low reservoir level. A second discussion by Lewis W. Klockner Jr. of an ice‐clogged reservoir intake on the Delaware River in Trenton, New Jersey, during the winter of 1961‐62, was solved by a helicopter hovering over the intake on the upstream side.</jats:p>",
