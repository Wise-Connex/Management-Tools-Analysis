Beginning with a brief historical review, the paper gives a general overview of the different types of dental personnel including the dentist, dental hygienist, dental assistant, and laboratory technician. The discussion of these categories of providers includes consideration of manpower planning as it has evolved over the past two decades, National manpower legislation is mentioned first as a reaction to the projected dentist shortage and then in response to the issues of geographic maldistribution and the effects of specialization. The second section of the paper discusses the dynamics of the dental care market. The distribution of the supply of services is identified and related to patterns of utilization and productivity. These factors are considered to be part of the set of dynamic relationships that help explain the current manpower problems of geographic and specialty maldistribution. A concluding section superficially discusses policy implications regarding the potential for increasing supply by: (1) increasing the number of dentists, (2) increasing the numbers and functions of auxiliaries, (3) increasing practice efficiency through group practice, and (4) reducing the restrictions that result from current state dental practice acts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To clarify the problems of altitude tolerance in birds, we studied the combined effect of hypocapnia and hypoxia on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ducks. CBF was measured by the xenon clearance method. Normocapnic hypoxia causes CBF to increase when the arterial O2 tension (PaO2) falls below 60--70 mmHg. Hypocapnic hypoxia significantly shifts the blood flow curve so that blood flow does not increase until a lower PaO2 (50--60 mmHg) is reached. This gives the appearance that hypocapnia suppresses the hypoxia-induced increase in CBF. However, due to the Bohr effect, the hypocapnic blood contains significantly more O2 than does the normocapnic blood at the same PaO2. Therefore, when CBF is expressed as a function of O2 content, rather than PO2, CBF in the hypocapnic group does not differ significantly from the CBF in the normocapnic group. We interpret this to mean that because of the significantly greater oxygen content of the hypocapnic blood at a given PaO2, the degree of hypoxia experienced by these brains is not as severe as that experienced by the normocapnic brains. </jats:p>",

A comparison of intakes with those recommended in Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare, 1976) and the USA (National Research Council, 1974) or by WHO (1973) indicated that for folic acid average values were particulary low, and only for vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> were the recommendations significantly exceeded.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Contributions from alcoholic drinks and confectionery were also calculated and found, on average, to be significant for Cu, vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> and folic acid.</jats:p><jats:p>5.
