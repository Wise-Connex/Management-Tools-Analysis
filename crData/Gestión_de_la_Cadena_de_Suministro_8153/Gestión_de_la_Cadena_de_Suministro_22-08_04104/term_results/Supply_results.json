      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter demystifies digitalisation and illustrates the benefits it can bring to supply chains. It gives insights into the focus and outcomes of digitalisation and how digital failure might be avoided. As supply chains have become more complex, increased risk has been created, along with a constant pressure to monitor every aspect of the extended supply chain ecosystem. Digitalisation plays a key role in addressing visibility and transparency issues across the supply chain, and helps to improve collaboration between supply chain partners to create more effective supply chains. While digital transformation is a strategic imperative for many organisations, improving connectivity and increasing access to, and distribution of, critical data, many organisations fail to re-engineer their business processes and dedicate insufficient resources to deploy such technology effectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Globalisation has undoubtedly revolutionised the way modern society functions by connecting different people, economies, cultures and technology. This integration depends on the adequate movement of goods by increasingly more complex and longer global supply chains (SCs). The structure of the distribution chain and the individual activities that jointly facilitate the transportation of commodities such as fresh fruit have not been well defined, making it difficult and ambiguous to determine greenhouse gas emissions. Mapping the various distribution scenarios of fruit and stating the emission-generating activities not only enable the analysis and management of these activities but also provide a basis for calculating emissions.Objectives: The key objective is to describe all the physical emission-generating distribution activities that take place during the international export of fresh fruit from South Africa. These activities were used to create distribution chain diagrams that define the structure of fresh fruit distribution.Method: To identify activities, a literature review, direct observation of distribution activities at logistical facilities and unstructured interviews with operational managers at these facilities were performed. Scenario planning was used to combine generic activities into realistic distribution chain diagrams. The activities and diagrams were validated by semistructured interviews with four industry experts.Results: Following the identification of emission-generating activities, five generic distribution chain diagrams were created that should represent all possible distribution scenarios for fresh fruit.Conclusion: The generic distribution scenarios not only capture the various methods by which fresh fruit is exported from South Africa but also form the basis of seven important emission-related managerial practices.</jats:p>"

The pandemic affected international travel, global logistics, supplier production and stockpiles at the supply end, which resulted in shortages at retailers and increased prices for basic food items.Objectives: The purpose of this article was to provide insights into and a synthesis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food retail supply chain models in South Africa.Method: A general review of both academic and grey literature (including commentaries) was studied to draw insights into the issues of food retail supply chain. This was combined with an examination of websites and annual reports of the major food retailers in South Africa to find their responses to the pandemic related to their supply chains.Results: It was found that the investment in supply chains and local supply development and the technology by the large food retailers in the country have paid off in the ways that they have been able to respond to and contain the shocks of the pandemic and point to the local versus the international when thinking about new supply chain models for the post-COVID-19 world.Conclusion: The insights drawn from this article may be useful in building more resilient food retail supply chains in the South African context. This article charts a way for more focused analyses using empirical data to thresh out more nuanced insights that will benefit the food retail supply chain and create a more resilient food system in South Africa.</jats:p>"

Vaccines are biological products, and many supply chain factors could influence product integrity and efficacy. This study focuses on aiding the logistics industry in understanding the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain around its handling, storage, and transportation requirements.Objectives: The study had five objectives. Firstly, to understand the functionality and components of a vaccine supply chain and, secondly to identify the stakeholders involved and their roles. Thirdly, the researchers wanted to comprehend and clarify the cold chain protocols for each category of the COVID-19 vaccines procured and the appropriate international best practices. The last two objectives were to identify the skill and training requirements of stakeholders on all levels, and using these inputs in creating an educational toolkit, aimed at operationally involved supply chain stakeholders.Method: The researchers made use of both primary and secondary data, focusing mostly on collecting data through a literature review, stakeholder analysis, and interview process.Results: The study outcome was a COVID-19 vaccine educational toolkit with four tools addressing the research objectives: (1) An identification of all vaccine supply chain stakeholders, (2) vaccine categorisation according to type and equipment required, (3) handling, storage, and delivery protocols, and (4) vaccine supply chain skill and training requirements.Conclusion: These tools can be used as a basis when educating and/or training COVID-19 vaccine supply chain employees on different levels and stages.</jats:p>"

The program developed multi-stakeholder partnership governance within a supply chain management (SCM) framework for organic rhizome agroindustry. Stakeholders involved in partnerships are grouped into 3 according to the components in SCM, namely 1) downstream SC who provide input needs for organic rhizome cultivation (producers of compost, cocopit and other planting media), 2) internal SC who carry out the cultivation process starting from the Organic Rhizome Learning Center (until the age of 4 months) and households rhizome cultivation, and 3) upstream SC, namely households (post-harvest and processing). The evaluation results show that of the seven aspects of SSCM, only the logistics aspect is optimized and the transportation is sustainable, while the other 6 aspects are already running. The use of organic waste available for seedling and planting media meets the aspect of a sustainable source of raw materials, is able to reduce the risk of concentration in nature so as to reduce risks to occupational health and safety. Development of research and learning centers in each target village as a means of sharing in sustainable competency development. On the other hand, with tiered partnerships involving customers, suppliers, communities and community groups with government and university facilitation, the model built has a positive impact on local communities.

A generalized structure for swarm intelligence implementation in supply chain management is suggested, which is advantageous to industry practitioners. Different deterministic methods practically fail due to the intrinsic computational complexity of the problem of higher dimensions.</p>",

The war in Ukraine is impacting global supply chains already constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ukraine is responsible for about 70% of the world's neon and Russia controls 44% of the world's supply of palladium, both of which are essential inputs in semiconductor production. Semiconductors are themselves essential to the manufacture of cars, smartphones or even medical equipment. With Taiwan producing nearly two-thirds of the world's semiconductors, China's move to reunify with the island of Taiwan raises significant concerns. In this complex geopolitical context, some companies are considering reshoring or nearshoring, i.e. the repatriation of specific activities within national ou regional borders. Is this the right solution or not?  In this short text, Thierry Warin, Fellow CIRANO and responsible of the CIRANO Pole on Data Science for Trade and Intermodal Transportationfor argues that the solutions to recent complex supply problems must themselves be complex. We need to use the tools we have access to today: massive data, computing power and new methods of analysis. The global trade system must adapt to a new technological paradigm, that of artificial intelligence and data science. The alternative of using the same mental patterns as in the past and proposing binary solutions is no longer acceptable today. There is no more time to lose.</jats:p>"

When there is no integration and synchronized process of the supply chain, the relationship between the company and the supplier is poor, the distribution becomes unequal and the customer is not satisfied, which will lead to failure of business.

In addition, National Ports Authority (NPA) charges are 69% and cargo dues 166% above the global benchmark mean. The NPA uses a rate of return (RR) model to calculate tariff increases that are contested by port stakeholders.Objectives: The study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 trade disruptions and examine the associated higher liner freight rates, tariff applications for higher NPA tariffs and reduced investment in port infrastructure. It showed that adjusting the RR model variables can result in reduced tariffs and large cost savings for port users.Method: This study analysed the impact of the pandemic on South Africa’s cargo volumes and freight rates. It critiqued the regulatory asset base, the asset beta, and the tax rate to be applied and calculated the adjustments to these RR model variables using five scenarios for FY2022/2023.Results: The results show a sharp decrease in cargo volumes during COVID-19 lockdowns, and a parallel increase in freight rates. The five-scenario results show how the NPA tariffs could be much lower, calculating a tariff decrease of 5.7% in scenario 4 and a 20% decrease in scenario 5.Conclusion: Amid the global rise of shipping rates and the economic impact of the pandemic on South Africa’s trade, the results show that there is a potential to enhance South Africa’s trade competitiveness through a decrease in NPA-weighted average tariff by 20%.</jats:p>"

But today, the impact of price instabilities rooted in supply chain bottlenecks is broader and more persistent in nature. With this changing price instability structure, analyzing the interdependence in production among the countries and exploring their effect on countries' inflation levels has become crucial. With this motivation, the chapter examines these relations by the BVAR model. The interdependence of countries' own purchasing managers' index, representing the supply chain disruptions, and their impulse on the producer price index, representing the inflation, are captured by the BVARs. The chapter focuses on the cases of a group of specific economies and chooses three countries: Germany, the United States, and Turkey. The findings remark that these countries' inflation levels are associated with their major trading partners' supply chain disruptions. </jats:p>",

The South African online retail environment also encountered different opportunities and last-mile logistics challenges. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online consumer behaviour has received limited attention. Furthermore, limited studies exist which have measured the online buying behaviour of young people, an important online market segment.Objectives: The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the online shopping behaviour of young people and to provide online retailers and consumer behaviour theorists with a better appreciation of young consumers’ online purchasing needs, which will assist them in developing and effecting appropriate last-mile logistics strategies.Methods: A quantitative research design was used, and empirical data were collected from two non-probability sampling surveys conducted in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) of 461 young people in the Johannesburg area. A self-administered online questionnaire was used to collect the research data.Results: The results indicate that online shopping behaviour either did not change or increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic for most respondents. Young online consumers consider order fulfilment aspects to be more important than the tangible considerations of online retailers.Conclusion: This research study provides a distinct perspective of young people’s perceptions of online shopping and makes a meaningful contribution by identifying the important fulfilment-related service quality expectations of young online customers in South Africa.</jats:p>"

It is concluded that global supply, production, and value chains, although being economically efficient, are no longer any more secure under national protectionist policies, and therefore, the relocation of production processes is mainly due to the increase in the level of income and wages of the developing countries that are the destination, and which reduce the advantages to relocate. </jats:p>",

This conceptual paper discusses localization, agility, and digitalization factors that make the supply chain more resilient. From a theoretical perspective, this research intends to investigate how these characteristics interact to assist the supply chain in becoming resilient by using digitalization, localization, and agility as enablers through conceptual models.The methodology used in this study is an exploratory conceptual investigation to cover the theoretical gaps. A critical evaluation of the literature was conducted to develop a conceptual model to ascertain the current state of knowledge regarding the relationship between supply chain resilience, localization, agility, and digitization in management practice. The study's primary data are the responses to questionnaires issued to respondents, analyzed, and hypotheses were formed and tested using the structural equation modeling technique. The result indicates that agility, localization, and digitalization positively impact supply chain resilience. Additionally, the industry's size and type positively impact the supply chain resilience as a control variable.As a result of the research, a new understanding of supply chain resilience emerges that can assist firms to gain new possibilities to develop new ways to do business under stress.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among the heterotrophic bacteria in drinking water provided by a Bulgarian drinking water supply system (DWSS). Culture-dependent methods and conventional PCR assays were used to study drinking water sampled from six locations on its way from the water source to the consumers' taps. The populations of bacteria resistant to nine antibiotics (ABs) from different classes were quantified and the occurrence of seven antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) was determined. The species composition of the bacterial community and the AMR phenotype of isolated bacteria were determined. The AMR level underwent changes within the DWSS network and the population's proportion of bacteria resistant towards the tested ABs differed depending on the sampling site. The increased level of resistance towards some ABs in drinking water emphasize the role of DWSS as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs that could pose a potential human health risk. Being focused on a Bulgarian DWSS, our study will contribute to establishing health hazards associated with ARB and ARGs in drinking water.</jats:p>",

In this talk, I will discuss our research on the inclusion on labor in supply chains both in optimization and game theory frameworks to elucidate the impacts of disruptions of labor in terms of availability as well as productivity on product flows, prices, and the objective functions of organizations, both profit and nonprofit ones. I will also highlight what can be done to ameliorate negative impacts and will discuss the power of setting appropriate wages on supply chain links from production and transportation to storage and the ultimate distribution to points of demand. The use of international migrants to alleviate shortages will be discussed and the impacts of the war on Ukraine on global supply chains. The inclusion of labor in blood service supply chains in healthcare and in humanitarian organization models for disaster preparedness and response will also be highlighted. I will conclude with some of our experiences in influencing policy in the pandemic.</jats:p>"

Companies from various industries responded to the urgent need for these potentially life‐saving products by adopting ad hoc supply chains in an exceptionally short time: They found new suppliers, developed the products, ramped‐up production, and distributed to new customers within weeks or even days. We define these supply chains as ad hoc supply chains that are built for a specific need, an immediate need, and a time‐limited need. By leveraging a unique sampling, we examined how companies realize supply chain agility when building ad hoc supply chains. We develop an emergent theoretical model that proposes dynamic capabilities to enable companies building ad hoc supply chains in response to a specific need, moderated by an entrepreneurial orientation allowing firms to leverage dynamic capabilities at short notice and a temporary orientation that increases a company's focus on exploiting the short‐term opportunity of ad hoc supply chains.</jats:p>",

Comparison of these maps reveals that the added sediment loads from bank erosion have greatly declined through time. During the Pre-cutoff period (1765–1931), the cumulative sediment supply from bank caving between Cairo, IL, and Baton Rouge, LA, ranged from about 395 million cubic yards/year (MCY/yr) to 535 MCY/yr with a median value of approximately 470 MCY/yr. The 1880-1931 period had the highest rate of sediment supply from bank caving with a median value of approximately 610 MCY/yr. By the 1990s, the sediment supply from bank erosion was essentially eliminated as a result of the revetment program, with significant erosion being observed at only a few locations, totaling approximately 17 MCY/yr. This equates to approximately a 96% reduction in the amount of total sediment being supplied to the channel system from bank erosion.</jats:p>"

Standard data-driven models cannot be effectively used due to a lack of quality data for ungauged basins. VENSIM was used for the system dynamic simulation to assess water availability for the sustainable management of water resources. Inflow into the four tanks, net losses in each tank, and crop water requirement were given as inputs into VENSIM. Along with different models, an extensive field survey was carried out to quantify each input component. Based on system dynamics simulation, only 28% of the total available water is used for irrigation and the rest is wasted due to evaporation, transition loss, and spill from the tanks. It was found that there was approximately 5.46 MCM of surface water available in the watershed, and it will be able to supply the domestic demand of the watershed of 0.672 MCM in addition to the irrigation requirement.</jats:p>",

Cervantes et al highlight the political context that favors nutrition outcomes, nutrition advocacy in the public agenda, and multisectoral mechanisms which can keep the nutrition objective moving forward in the food supply sector. However, a wider view on governance and institutional capacity is needed, recognizing government action by multiple sectors, with diverse sets of actors. The expanded understanding of nutrition, which includes considering nutrition as an emerging facet of food systems, by policy actors is needed. Enhancing discourse involving nutrition and food supply actors is important in order to appeal to the wider public and opinion leaders across the political spectrum.

Further, recognizing that supply chain theories must contain the previously identified characteristics, we offer Factor Market Rivalry (FMR) as a theory of SCM. FMR refers to intense battles for resource positions that are needed to manufacture, provide, or deliver firm products or services. We argue that FMR only occurs within supply chain phenomena.

To cope with the consequences of the crisis, three policies have been adopted to quantitatively and qualitatively adjust human resources to the needs of companies: temporary reduction in the workforce, Tele-working and dismissal.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>The study then shed light on the situation of the supply chain of companies. Four behavior patterns were detected. Maintaining a fluid and regular relationship with suppliers and customers has pushed companies to implement technological solutions to manage flows and maintain the relationship.\nHowever, the results of our research remain limited due to the low response rate from companies. The theoretical framework is not sufficiently referenced due to the novelty of the subject. Finally, we lack the necessary perspective on the consequences of the strategies adopted by companies. All of these limitations offer new avenues for future research.\nCOVID-19 is an exceptional event that has had a major impact on supply chains globally. The pandemic has highlighted the weight of the supply chain in the regular functioning of the global economy. It also highlighted the importance of taking into account new risks as well as the necessary mobilization of more technologically advanced tools to prepare for them.\nThe complexity of supply chains makes the development of commercial transactions fragile. This context offers, on another level, a multitude of opportunities for new structures and new business models.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CLINICALTRIAL</title>\n                        <p>Post-COVID-19 is a major challenge for the national economic fabric.

During this period, workers were suspended, retrenched, and short-pay which tells on their personal, family, and household wellbeing. Therefore, this study qualitatively examined the impact of COVID-19 on Supply Chain workers' well-being in Nigeria. The study was carried out in Agbara Industrial Estate in Ogun State, Nigeria. The study adopted a phenomenological research methodology to explore and provide an in-depth description of participants’ well-being experiences during COVID 19 pandemic. In total, 150 participants were selected randomly from the study area. Both Atlas.ti 7.0 and In Vivo software were used to transcript the interview while analysis was done qualitatively. The findings of the study revealed that most respondents consented that they went through difficulties in feeding themselves and their families during the pandemic due to their job loss and short payment. The study concluded that the supply chain workers were retrenched/short-pays during the period of COVID 19 and they were not adequately catered for their well-being in terms of food and health care. The study recommends that the supply chain companies can support an inclusive COVID-19 recovery for workers.</jats:p>"

In developed countries, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has attracted attention from both academia and industry. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap about supply chain social sustainability in developing countries. Hence, the main purpose of this study is to present the link between social sustainability and economic performance with the mediating role of operational performance in sustainable supply chain management.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach: The PLS-SEM model is applied to identify factors affecting social sustainability and the relationship between social sustainability, operational performance, and economic performance in Vietnam.\r\nFindings: The study broadens the concept and emphasizes the importance of sustainable development in the context of Vietnam and provides recommendations for managers on strategic planning and developing business towards sustainability. This study also encourages managers to enrich employees’ welfare and working conditions and con- tribute to the local community.\r\nResearch limitations/implications: The social indicators in developing countries are distinct from those in developed countries. Hence, this study may only apply in the context of developing countries. There are three main pillars of sustainable development, including economic (profit), environment (planet), and society (people). In this research, the author only examines the social and economic aspects.\r\nOriginality/value: The outcomes of this study demonstrate a clear link between the social and economic elements of sustainability. While demonstrating how fully implemented Social sustainability improves economic performance, this study stimulates academic research about the interrelationship of sustainability elements in supply chains.</jats:p>",

Bu durum stok yönetiminin çok önemli olduğunu gösterir, zira ihtiyaç durumunda stokta istenen kan ürün veya ürünleri yoksa hasta kaybedilebilir. Öte yandan kan toplamak sürekli bir çaba gerektiren bir eylemdir; bağışın gönüllü olduğu ülkelerde konfor, riskler, kolaylık ve erişilebilirlik gibi birçok faktör bağış kararını etkileyebilir. Ancak son yıllarda pandemi süreci nedeni ile dünyada olduğu gibi Türkiye’de de kan bağışları azalmıştır. Buna dış ülkelerden göçlerde eklenince kanı tedarik etmek, kanı ürünlerine ayrıştırmak, depolamak ve hastalara zamanında ulaştırmak adına kan tedarik zinciri ve stok yönetimi her zamankinden daha da önemli hale gelmiştir. Kan tedarik zinciri, kan ve kan ürünlerinin donörden yani kan bağışında bulunan kişiden alıcıya yani kan ihtiyacı olan kişiye verilmesi, kan ürününü hastaya verilmeden önce özellikle bulaşıcı hastalıklar yönünden test edilmesi, ürünlerine ayrıştırmak için işlenmesi ve nihayetinde de ilgili hastane, sağlık merkezi, yoğun bakım üniteleri ve servislere dağıtılması süreçlerini içerir. Ancak koşullar ne olursa olsun kan talebini karşılamak için yeterli miktarda kan toplanması gerekir.  Tedarik zinciri terminolojisinde arz ile talebin eşleştirilmesi, kan ve ürünlerinin toplanması, işlenmesi ve dağıtılması için iyi bir altyapıya ihtiyaç vardır. Kan tedarik zincirinin farklı konfigürasyonları, dünyanın farklı ülkelerindeki hastanelerde uygulanmakla birlikte amaç aynıdır yani kan ürünleri talebini minimum maliyet ve minimum israfla karşılamaktır.  Bilim insanları farklı bakış açılarıyla konuyu ele almış bağış aşamasından hastaya nakil aşamasına kadar geçen süredeki her bir süreci iyileştirme adına değişik çalışmalar yürütmüşlerdir. Bu çalışmalardan en önemlileri sürecin simüle edilmesi ve tedarik zincirine yönelik yapılan araştırmalardır.</jats:p>"

In this process, coal, and nuclear options, as well as renewable energy, may play a prominent role on the supply side. In this context, the necessity of a well-functioning legal system, an independent decision-making authority, and a well-developed accountability institution to make the necessary investments remains important. In integrated cooperation with artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and machine learning technologies, it is possible to store, process, and manage data, which creates energy supply security, with less time and cost.

The study found that the ESG performance of enterprises helps to improve their green supply chain management level; government subsidies play a negative moderating role in the improvement of enterprise green supply chain management by ESG performance. According to the results, enterprises should integrate the ESG system into the green supply chain management process to balance the economic, environmental and social benefits of the enterprise.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological advancements in the past few decades have played a critical role in enhancing supply chain management from varied dimensions. While advancements in information technology have significantly improved various facets of the supply chain, supply chain visibility still lags in tracking and tracing capabilities. The disruptive and emergent blockchain technology (BCT) presents enormous potential to address issues of supply chain sustainability. This paper seeks to evaluate the proximity of BCT to resolve provenance issues throughout the supply chain. The research considers the immaturity of BCT alongside limited success stories in supply chain management. It uses a content analysis methodology to examine recent literature about using BCT in supply chain sustainability and provenance. A conceptual model for using BCT to create an enabled, visible, and sustainable supply chain is provided to frame the investigation. Findings reveal that the benefits of BCT have mostly been conceptually demonstrated in the sustainable supply chain literature, but with few practical applications. Moreover, technically driven challenges including scalability and control are still prevalent. It reaffirms the fact that participants within a blockchain enabled supply chain network must be at the same level of knowledge regarding the technology and its functionality. The study also indicates evidence of a growing research interest in the niche, which will eventually bring about solutions to address ongoing challenges faced by BCT in its integration into supply chain management. These findings contribute to the literature about improving the security and utility of supply chain sustainability and provenance by using BCT.</jats:p>"

The only possibilities for women to benefit from good quality jobs are when they have managerial status and when they work in large companies. Inequalities in access to better quality jobs against them are more related to differences in unobservable characteristics than to differences in individual characteristics.JEL Rating: J16, J23, C25, C35</jats:p>"

Coupled with the impact of economic globalization, more and more foreign brands have also been favored by consumers, which has undoubtedly intensified the competition in the domestic apparel industry, and now the competition between enterprises has gradually transformed into the competition between the supply chain and the supply chain where the enterprise is located. In recent years, driven by the wave of \"Industry 4.0\" and \"Made in China 2025\", intelligent manufacturing has become a breakthrough in manufacturing innovation and upgrading. In a smart environment, creating a smart and efficient supply chain is the key for manufacturing companies to gain an advantage in the competition, and the same is true for the apparel industry.

But the clampdown of Russia’s natural gas supplies shifted the market’s dynamics, and the repercussions are being experienced around the world.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Europe is one of the hardest hit by this disruption in natural gas supplies. In a commentary posted on 18 July, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, called for coordinated actions across Europe to prepare for the coming winter months and for worst-case scenarios of a complete shutoff of Russian gas and limited availability from other sources.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although Russia resumed a reduced flow of gas to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline on 21 July, there is no certainty about the fluctuations or duration of the flow. Birol wrote, “Europe is now forced to operate in a constant state of uncertainty over Russian gas supplies, and we can’t rule out a complete cutoff.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The start of Europe’s winter heating season is 1 October. Birol called for action to fill European gas storage to adequate levels by reducing current gas consumption and to put that conserved gas into storage. High natural gas prices have led to gas conservation to some extent, but more efforts are required.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>He wrote that the gas required to be saved over the next 3 months “is in the order of 12 billion cubic metres—enough to fill about 130 LNG tankers,” equivalent to 424 Bcf.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To lend some perspective to this, consider that US LNG exports averaged 10.1 Bcf/D in June. This reflects a 1.5 Bcf/D decrease from May because of a fire on 8 June that shut down Freeport LNG in Texas, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The agency expects US LNG exports to remain below average at 10.5 Bcf/D in the second half of this year.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Freeport LNG shutdown, and the resulting lower demand for LNG export gas, decreased the US benchmark Henry Hub natural gas spot price. It fell by $1.27/MMBtu to $8.16/MMBtu on 9 June and averaged $7.70/MMBtu in June. EIA expects the spot price to continue to decline to an average of $5.97/MMBtu in the second half of this year.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>European imports of LNG rose by more than 50% in the first 5 months of 2022 compared with the period a year earlier, according to Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm. Although a wide range of shippers have sent fuel to Europe, the major increases in its LNG imports have come from gas produced from US shale.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The increased European demand also increased the price of its imported LNG to nearly nine times what it was about 2 years ago, and those higher prices enticed LNG shippers away from Asia. European futures prices have been around $40/MMBtu. The Wall Street Journal compared that to more than $200/bbl for oil, about twice the price for Brent crude, the international benchmark, as of 22 July.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In most years, China, Japan, and South Korea have been the major markets for LNG. During the first 5 months of 2022, Asian imports fell by 8%—in part because of slowing demand from China caused by COVID-19 lockdowns.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Birol’s commentary began with this sentence: “The world is experiencing the first truly global energy crisis in history.” For Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine also sparked a cost-of-living crisis when oil and gas prices soared.

Due to these sustainability issues, consumers, governments, and non-governmental organizations are pressuring food companies to rethink their current business concepts of food production. Food companies rely on supply chain governance and its mechanisms to implement sustainability standards across all tiers of their supply chains. This study examines the sustainability governance at all stages of a cocoa supply chain, from the raw material production to the retailer, by using a qualitative case study approach. The results show a differentiation of the sustainability governance according to the different supply chain stages. At the raw material production stage, sustainability is mainly improved using contracts, extensive and frequent knowledge sharing, and audits. After the raw material production stage, environmental and social sustainability is almost exclusively coordinated by certificates, while other governance mechanisms are used to foster long-term economic business relationships. This study gives detailed insights into the application intentions and the functioning of sustainability governance mechanisms and provides propositions on how to efficiently improve sustainability in food supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain design with financial criteria. A necessity?\nSupply chain management involves strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. Strategic decisions involve a more-than-one-year planning horizon and consider the facility selection, types of products to be manufactured, and outsourcing of operations. Tactical decisions, with a 6 to 12 months horizon, involve decisions such as demand forecasting and inventory management. Operational decisions include a one-week time horizon, at the longest, and regard, among others, resource planning, picking, packing, and route planning. Strategic and tactical network design decisions are generally challenging to reverse and involve significant time and money investment. Due to a country’s macroeconomic effect and market shocks, these decisions increase in complexity in high-uncertainty environments. Thus, what may be an “optimal” network design today could be a “bad decision” in the future due to drastic changes in network parameters. Traditionally, approaches to network design have focused on cost minimization, neglecting the financial side of the problem. The general idea of considering the network design issue as an investment decision leads to the notion that companies should obtain a return on or profit from the money involved in such a “project.” Notably, higher returns should be demanded the riskier the investment; that is, the expected return of any investment is proportionally tied to its financial risk. Thus, it is necessary to consider that any decision related to distribution network design must be evaluated under financial profitability or risk criteria. This situation does not happen practically as many companies worldwide fail to consider the financial risk and variability of critical network parameters in optimizing distribution networks. It is necessary to emphasize that decisions such as the location of a new plant or warehouse or the relocation or shutting down of an existing facility can overwhelm a company’s finances if the necessary knowledge of the variables involved in the process is unavailable.In Colombia, supply network design decisions must consider organizations’ long-term stable growth and economic value generation. In changing environments and economic recessions such as today’s, the network design issue becomes more critical considering the effects of the various free trade agreements, the opening-up of markets, and access to diversified products and references. Our country needs to drift away from subjectively solving companies’ logistic problems based on the experience of the people in charge of the decision-making process to methodologies that allow companies to grow stably. \nEditorial Note\nThe 73rd issue of Cuadernos de Administración corresponds to the May-August 2022 period. The ten published papers come from the journal’s new strategy of keeping a permanent call for papers meeting the highest scientific and language standards. In this issue, authors from several countries and regions of Colombia submitted their manuscripts to our editorial process. The ten papers in this issue prove the high quality in several aspects of management, marketing, finance, logistics, education, circular economy, human talent management, and regional development. The first article, “Analysis of advertising jingles from the ‘80s and ‘90s through affective computing,” posits a novel tool called ANEJIP (Analyzer of Emotions in Advertising Jingles), which makes it possible to break down audio into fragments and then extracts its acoustic properties of arousal and valence, which in turn allow determining the emotion associated with each fragment within the circumflex model or Russell’s model. The proposed methodology aims to serve as a reference for designing and evaluating musical content in advertising jingles in order to elicit specific emotions in potential customers. “Taxonomy of Material handling equipment selection methods at distribution centers” outlines a material-handling equipment taxonomy based on a systematic literature review of previous work on both material-handling equipment in real-world picking-intensive logistics contexts and decision support systems (DSS). The paper “Value co-creation and its impact on organizational performance: the case of the amateur football clubs of Antioquia football league of Colombia” analyzes the impact of value co-creation on organizational performance in amateur soccer clubs. A structured questionnaire was conducted on a 345-people sample, including managers, chairmen, and executives of amateur soccer clubs of the Antioquia Soccer League of Colombia. Data were analyzed using partial least squares modeling with SmartPLS software. “Working conditions and burnout in personnel of a Mexican government agency “ addresses the problem of proper working conditions to prevent mental health risks, such as organizational burnout, understood as a combination of exhaustion, depersonalization, and dissatisfaction with achievement. It aims to analyze the relationship between different working conditions dimensions and the occupational burnout dimensions in order to identify potential risks and stressors that could lead to occupational burnout. The paper “Learning about the circular economy in rural communities of Cauca” deals with circular economy learning based on two research experiences in rural communities in Cajibío and Popayán, Department of Cauca. The study results are conducive to circular economy learning derived from community practices using rural households’ waste to valorize benefits.“Tax incentives and financial performance: empirical evidence of Ecuadorian companies” analyzes the impact of tax benefits on the financial performance of companies in Ecuador’s manufacturing and trade sectors between 2015 and 2018. The impact of this strategy on company profitability is studied through a comparative analysis using financial indicators and a multiple regression model. The study showed that companies applying tax incentives are in a better financial position and that the smaller the firm’s size, the higher the rate of profitability concerning business investment.The paper “Wage Discrimination by Gender of South American Immigrants in the US Labour Market” analyzes wage discrimination of South American immigrants and uses the native population classified as non-Hispanic whites and African Americans by gender as a reference group in the U.S. context. The results show wage disparity towards the female population of all population groups compared to their male counterparts, which is not consistent with their average higher educational background, which could be explained by unequal treatment in the labor market, among other things. “Identifying the small rural family business based on the categorization of family farming” proposes a categorization of family farming to identify its profile and assess the development potential and limitations of small family businesses in the rural community of San Antonio Portezuelo, State of Puebla, Mexico. The article “Assessment of Technical Efficiency in Higher Education in Ecuador” assesses relative efficiency under a data envelopment analysis perspective in Ecuadorian universities. The methodology set forth therein considers a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using a non-parametric technique that permits units’ relative measurement. The constraint was configured according to the oriented output DEA-BCC model with scale performance and helped measure performance. Nevertheless, its global scope may distort technical efficiency reality, depending on the resources of the universities.Finally, the last literature review paper, “State of the art on organizational longevity: a systematic literature review,” considers relevant education and organizational longevity topics.

One of the reasons for the company's success is the work of supply chain management within PT HM Sampoerna. The goals of this study are to see what factors influence supply chain management techniques in the cigarette sector in Indonesia, with a focus on PT HM Sampoerna Indonesia, to create supply chain management practices in PT HM Sampoerna, to evaluate the efficacy of PT HM Sampoerna's supply chain management, and to identify factors impacting supply chain management in PT HM Sampoerna. This research employs case study research, direct interviews with corporate employees, and secondary approaches such as industry and company websites. The management of the supply chain is generally highly successful. Because they only employ one distributor, PT HM Sampoerna's supply chain management is distinctive. PT Sampoerna gained various benefits that influence the performance of the organization after unifying its supply chain management.</jats:p>"

We first exploit the geographic and temporal variation in the disease spread to estimate the effect of local exposure to the virus on credit. Our estimates indicate that neither local exposure to the virus, nor the sector-specific mobility restrictions had an impact on credit. We then assess the role of bank supply shocks. We create a measure of bank exposure, reflecting the geographic heterogeneity in pandemic vulnerability and deposits, and estimate its effect on credit. Results indicate that bank-supply shocks account for a credit contraction of approximately 5.2%. To further disentangle the role of bank supply shock, we control for the interaction between firm and time fixed-effects and restrict the sample to municipalities that were relatively spared from the pandemic, finding similar results. Most of the bank supply effects are driven by firms that are small, young, and have relatively low liquidity.</jats:p>",

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the current geopolitical and economic threats (meaning the Russia-Ukraine war), the analysis of the issue of food supply to the population of Georgia is quite actual. The most important thing is to fully utilize the production potential of the existing agri-food products, use them efficiently and calculate the country's supply channels correctly. It is noteworthy that the diversification of pre-existing import and export markets is necessary and feasible, and also, anti-crisis management issues are definitely applicable when addressing the country's food supply issues.\n\nDefined and known to our country by the Statistics Service of Georgia, the main food products of strategic importance, which are necessary for the human body, are: wheat, corn, potatoes, vegetables, meat, milk and dairy products, eggs. Analysis of data on these high nutritional value products reveals that the state has a lot to do to meet the needs of the population in the face of existing challenges.\n\n           According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food security can be measured by self-supply index, which can measure the extent to which a country can meet its local requirements for a given product.       \n\n        The share of food in the consumer basket of Georgia is the highest 30.23%, that is why it is interesting how much the country can provide the population with food products with basic nutritional value. \n\n       According to the data of 2020-2021, for example, the wheat self-supply ratio of our country did not exceed 15%. Russia is the main importer of wheat in Georgia.\n\n       Negative impacts as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, the created deficit, the sanctions imposed on Russia can create problems for the cargo imported from Russia,  taking into account all mentioned facts, the need to find new trading partners is on the agenda, from which the possible shortfall will be filled.\n\n       According to 2021 data, 94% of wheat and 79% of corn were imported from Russia. The same is true for vegetables, whose self-supply rate is 63%. It seems that we can meet the needs of the country with vegetables, but we have to fill 1/3 with imported products.\n\nGeorgia mainly imports dairy products (milk powder), according to 2021 data, 37% of the total products were imported from Ukraine and Belarus. Ukraine is the third largest importer of eggs and poultry and the second largest importer of meat.\n\nWhen a country is at war, it is natural that the supply chain of products will not be reliable, it is also possible that prices will increase, that is why we need to look for alternative ways of supplying products and alternative suppliers.\n\nThe impact of hostilities will also be visible on the export of products from our country. Grape products, including wine, have a high rate of local exports. About 60% of these products are exported to Russia, up to 10% to Ukraine and up to 8% to China, while vegetables are also exported to Russia (64%).\n\n           When such a level of crisis is created in the country, it is necessary for the government to intervene, develop anti-crisis measures and solve the problems in a timely manner.\n\n             The state should act in 3 main directions: 1. To promote the development of small and medium-sized businesses, to improve the environment, to promote their cooperation, etc., all of which are necessary to reduce the negative consequences of the crisis; 2. Attracting investment to the country, which softens the background of the crisis and allows the country to breathe; 3. Maximum export promotion, the government should be the link between the business and the outside world, which should create all the conditions for the growth of exports.\n\n           Business has no less role in crisis situations, its main obligation is to bring the country out of crisis. The main tasks of the business are: 1. To become more efficient, to refine the business strategy, the management system and to bring it in line with the decisions. The most important thing for a business is the proper work of each of its links and the perception of what benefits it creates for the society. 2. Improving the quality of the produced product and service, taking into account the needs of the priority customer. In times of crisis, all companies must take care to improve quality, otherwise businesses will not be able to increase exports. 3. To expand foreign contacts, there should be used both private and public opportunities.       \n\n            Taking into consideration all mentioned above, we can conclude that: 1. First of all, it is necessary to use the resources available in the country to improve the country's food supply ratio. 2. Prioritize projects to improve the country's food supply ratio when implementing state business support programs. 3. Search and timely detection of ways to diversify both import and export markets. 4. In the process of managing the state and companies, take into account the issues of anti-crisis management and risk management when making decisions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>This paper discusses the influence and relevance of cutting-edge technologies in the development of a knowledge-based supply chain to enhance food security. The application of technologies is based on the background that food supply chains require real-time monitoring and effective information flow from farm to farm with regards to food availability, preservation of quality, health, safety, and accessibility of food from production to the final user. The study used a quantitative approach and drew a sample of 65 employees and suppliers from three food manufacturing organizations (Probrands, Delta Beverages, and National Foods) that are currently using various cutting-edge technologies in Zimbabwe. Further, 80 downstream consumers were drawn from the commonly known food insecure remote areas in Zimbabwe to provide a fair review of the effectiveness of the current food supply chain system (using modern technology). Results show that a number of technologies can be effectively employed when developing a knowledge-based food supply chain. These include artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the internet of things, machine-learning, robotics, additive manufacturing, or virtual reality, among others. These technologies were found to be effective in resolving supply chain management challenges. As a result of reducing supply chain management challenges, food security was found to be improved and customer satisfaction enhanced. However, in the absence of such technologies, it was found that it is difficult to develop effective and sustainable knowledge-based food supply chains in Zimbabwe. It is recommended that all food producers, intermediaries, suppliers, consumers, and other stakeholders make use of knowledge-based food supply chains that are enhanced by different technologies to ensure food security and customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

Motivated by weak labor force participation during the pandemic, we reexamine the question by introducing labor force entry and exit in an otherwise canonical model with sticky prices and wages. The entry decision generates an employment channel of monetary policy, by which a decline in employment raises wage growth. Consequently, a labor supply shock to the value of nonparticipation in the labor market induces a policy trade-off between stabilization of the employment gap and wage growth. For an adverse labor supply shock, optimal policy dampens the decline in employment to rein in wage growth, which entails a period of higher inflation and a positive output gap. A welfare analysis of policy rules shows that monetary policy should not lean against the employment gap.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, procurement has been defined as an integrated strategic business activity that aims to create high added value based on the focus company’s relationship in the supply chain with its suppliers. The selection of suppliers in the supply chain is a complex task that should be performed in a cost-effective manner, taking into account the numerous requirements of business practice. The optimal supplier choice affects not only the product quality but also the formation of its price. The right choice of suppliers leads to timely, continuous and quality production. The decision on the choice of a supplier is a multi-criteria problem. A large number of models and techniques are used to make such a decision. The paper develops a framework to support decision-making and criteria-based prioritization of suppliers. The aim of this paper is to present the elements and specifics of the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process as one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques and SpiceLogic Ration Will software package as well as their relevance for supplier selection. In addition, based on the analyzed literature, the paper indicates the criteria used when choosing a supplier. The obtained results show that supplier 1 is the most important among the analyzed suppliers. The application of the SpiceLogic software package is justified, as the proposed package provides a platform for manufacturers to better understand the capabilities that sustainable suppliers must have in order to continue working with them and successfully manage the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Participation decisions do not generate asymmetry but contribute to the fluctuations in search frictions by changing the size and composition of the pool of job seekers, which in turn affects the tightness ratio and thereby slack in the labor market.

The European Commission’s strategy for Smart, Green and Integrated Transport and Logistics identified the need for a common communication and navigation platform for pan-European logistics. In parallel a central goal of the Commission was to boost competitiveness in the European Transport and Logistics sector and develop a resource-efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system. Central to the EC’s strategic vision was the development of architectures and open systems for information sharing and valorisation to connect key stakeholders on the basis of trusted business agreements. The evolving landscape set the scene for creating innovative collaboration-driven Supply Chain optimisation, and underpinned the innovation imperatives for the Shared European Logistics Intelligent Information Space (SELIS) project, which sought to address these issues and which is discussed in this chapter.</jats:p>"

This is due to the various physical and informational activities that accompany inventory management, primarily the holding and transportation of inventory. Companies are looking to streamline these activities and minimize the associated costs. One of the most coveted models for jointly solving these two problems is the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), which will be the focus of this study. This paper deals with the case of a deterministic replenishment demand in a distribution network consisting of a supplier and a number of customers to be served by a single vehicle over a finite planning horizon. We study the impact of increasing supplier delivery times on the network costs. A mathematical model is developed and solved by an exact method.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although low-income parents’ dependence on low-fee private schools has been actively documented in the past decade, existing research and policy discussions have failed to recognise their heavy reliance on low-fee tuition providers in order to ensure that their children complete the primary cycle. By mapping a vibrant supply of low-fee tuition providers in two neighbourhoods in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad in Pakistan, this paper argues for understanding the supply-side dynamics of this segment of the education market with the aim of designing better-informed policies, making better use of public spending on supporting private-sector players to reach the poor. Contrary to what is assumed in studies of the private tuition market, the low-fee tuition providers offering services in the Pakistani urban neighbourhoods are not teachers in government schools trying to make extra money by offering afternoon tutorial to children from their schools. Working from their homes, the tutors featured in this paper are mostly women who often have no formal teacher training but are imaginative in their use of a diverse set of teaching techniques to ensure that children from low-income households who cannot get support for education at home cope with their daily homework assignments and pass the annual exams to transition to the next grade. These tutors were motivated to offer tuition by a combination of factors ranging from the need to earn a living, a desire to stay productively engaged, and for some a commitment to help poor children. Arguing that parents expect them to take full responsibility for their children’s educational attainment, these providers view the poor quality of education in schools, the weak maternal involvement in children’s education, and changing cultural norms, whereby children no longer respect authority, as being key to explaining the prevailing low educational levels. The paper presents evidence that the private tuition providers, who may be viewed as education entrepreneurs, have the potential to be used by the state and development agencies to provide better quality education to children from low-income families.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of pulse power technology, higher technical requirements have been put forward for the pulse power supply system. How to improve the precision of power supply is the hotspot of current research. In this paper, a 20 kJ high-precision pulse power supply is established for study, consisting of a high energy storage pulse power capacitor (6420 μF/2.5 kV), a pulse forming inductor (2.73 μH/0.945 mΩ), a 4 in. thyristor, and 2 4 in. diodes. Three characteristic parameters (current peak Imax, rise time Tr, and pulse width Tw) are proposed to define the precision of the pulse power supply: Imax = 54 kA, Tr = 205 µs, and Tw = 1470 µs. According to the electrical parameters, the numerical expressions of the power supply precision are theoretically solved. This can guide the device screening and active temperature control scheme. Then, the active temperature control experiment of the high-precision pulse power supply was carried out. The results show that ΔImax is less than 1.2‰, ΔTr is less than 1.8‰, and ΔTw is less than 2.1‰, within the ambient temperature of 10–30 °C. The rated Īmax is different under different ambient temperatures. The extreme difference is 0.7 kA, and the error is 6.5‰. In addition, the life test of a high-precision pulsed power supply is carried out, which shows that the capacitance and inductance will decrease with the increase of rated discharge times. The change of capacitance is 1.19‰, and the change of inductance is 3.73‰. Finally, this high-precision pulse power supply has proved that the precision can reach a thousandth under the condition of active temperature control, and it is proposed that the precision of the power supply can be maintained by controlling parameters such as device temperature and discharge voltage.</jats:p>",

We used humic acid as a modifier. Saline soil adsorption and leaching tests were carried out in the laboratory and the field to study the effect of humic acid on water, salt, and wheat yield in coastal clay saline soil. Compared to the CK (non-humic acid treatment), the laboratory tests show that soil water content, salt adsorption, salt leaching, and salt removal efficiency, all showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, with the increase of humic acid, and increased by 0.1–1%, 0.5–4%, 3–11%, and 1–8% under T1-T8 (humic acid treatments), respectively. Field tests show that in all humic acid treatments soil salinity in 0–20 cm and 0–60 cm was reduced, and the water content and wheat yield was increased, compared to CK. When the humic acid content was 0.149 g/kg (T2 treatment), the soil salt removal effect and wheat yield were optimized. Overall, humic acid can effectively reduce the salinity in clay saline soil, improve its ability to hold water, and inhibit salt accumulation and soil salinization. This research contributes to the improvement of saline-alkali soil in the Yellow River Delta.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability as a business phenomenon has occupied the attention of academicians, practitioners, and consumers for more than three decades. While some firms emphasize on their own internal sustainability initiatives, there is a growing trend to implement sustainability across the supply chain. This increasing interest makes implementation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices very important for focal firm’s sustainability; however, the ability to create innovative products, processes, and ways of operating is crucial if an organization is to be sustainable. Although there have been studies that investigate innovation in the context of sustainability, their scopes are limited to a single perspective which often obscures the big picture of innovation, its creation, and its effects on firm performance. In this study, we will adopt a multi-level innovation perspective to explore the symbiotic relationships between innovation creation and the development of SSCM practices, and resulting sustainability performance. This research will contribute to supply chain management and innovation literature and practice by identifying the different innovation types that emerge when SSCM practices are being implemented and explaining the effects innovation patterns and SSCM practices have on sustainability performance.</jats:p>"

Parameters reported on labels of 74 (BW) brands were used as datasets. According to the Maghreb, EEC and WHO legislations and using PCA, HCA, KMC and ANOVA analysis in conjunction with analytical and empirical approaches, the study discussed the water quality and classification. The results showed that (BW) constituents comply with natural mineral (MW), spring (SW) and table waters (TW) standards for human consumption. It appears that Ca-HCO3 is the dominant facies in Algerian and Tunisian MW but in Morocco, they are Ca-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 facies. All Algerian and majority of Moroccan and Tunisian SW are Ca-HCO3 type, while both Tunisian and Moroccan TW are mainly Na-Cl type. Some of Maghreb BW are sulfated, chlorinated, bicarbonated, containing calcium, sodium and fluoride and adapted to a low sodium diet. Classification showed that BW could be categorized into four different groups. The first includes five brands of MW, rich in salts with Na + K-Cl facies. Meanwhile, two facies mark the waters of the second (Ca + Mg-SO4 and Ca + Mg-Cl), whereas the waters of the third and fourth are essentially low in salts and marked by Ca + Mg-HCO3 facies.</jats:p>",

The results show that the hot areas of domestic labor supply research include demographic dividend, labor force, severe labor shortage, aging, unemployed people, demand, medical insurance, and so on. The latest research frontier in the field of labor supply in China is related to delayed retirement, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, aging, and intermediary effect. All the research is closely related to the national policy orientation. In the future, it is suggested to strengthen communication and cooperation between scholars and research institutions from a multidisciplinary perspective, enhance research and collaboration in the field of labor supply, reinforce the construction of facilities in labor supply, build a labor supply service system and constantly innovate the development model to promote the development of social integration.</jats:p>"

Analysis of the performance of the agriculture sector in the last few months reveals that agriculture and allied sectors can give new momentum to the Indian economy. A food crisis is not possible in India. We produce 70 million tonnes of food grain, more than the total national requirement. In the coming Kharif season, the input costs are expected to be higher than usual, but the government of India’s response to mitigate high input costs is encouraging. The major problem is in the food supply chain, which needed serious intervention from stakeholders and state and central government support. Disturbances and disruption in food supply chains have created high transaction costs. The spread of COVID-19 may create irregularity in food supply throughout India as 92% of produce is purchased and consumed. Using trade statistics and survey data gathered through online questionnaires and phone interviews with small-holder farmers, agro-industrial companies, agricultural workers, traders, importers, and consumers. Our findings show significant differences in how COVID-19 and containment measures disrupt supply chains between the modern export-oriented supply chain, which is centered on a few large vertically integrated agro-industrial companies, and the more traditional domestic-oriented supply chain, which includes a large number of small-holder farmers and informal traders — with the former being more resilient to the COVID-19.</jats:p>",

Therefore, every organization must be more vigilant before introducing something that could have social consequences. This study aims to investigate all of the necessary components for proposing and establishing a community sustainability ecosystem model that supports local business sustainability with participation by highlighting essential variables that foster sustainable business prospects. The researcher distributed a questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale to 1,000 community water users in Thailand and received 627 valid responses. Using a simple random sampling technique with a sampling ratio of 14 villages, data was obtained. Subsequently, descriptive statistics are used to characterize the data (frequency distributions, percentages, averages, medians, and standard deviations). Furthermore, PLS-SEM was used to examine the relationships between factors and to launch the conceptual model using PLS path modeling. This study aimed to enhance the original Commitment-Trust theory relying on sustainability by examining the relationships between accepted variables pertaining to change agents, stakeholders, transparency, social networking, and good governance in order to provide new knowledge to the sustainability community and local sustainability businesses. In addition, this conceptual model can be applied to new business cases in which businesses need a framework that can be followed rapidly and reduces the danger of making mistakes on their own. In light of these considerations, this article proposes a novel community sustainability ecosystem model that may be adopted by the majority of businesses as a framework for managing the entire firm. Not only does it aid local businesses, but it can also adapt to any business change in order to become more profitable and sustainable.</jats:p>"

Specifically, it is a solution of acetic acid produced by a two stage fermentation process. The first is an alcoholic fermentation, where the sugars are converted in ethanol and lower metabolites by the yeast action, generally Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was performed through a technique that is expanding more and more, the so-called “pied de cuve”. The second step is an acetic fermentation where acetic acid bacteria (AAB) action causes the conversion of ethanol into acetic acid. Overall, the aim of this research is to follow wine vinegar production step by step through the volatiloma analysis by metal oxide semiconductor MOX sensors developed by Nano Sensor Systems S.r.l. This work is based on wine vinegar monitored from the grape must to the formed vinegar. The monitoring lasted 4 months and the analyses were carried out with a new generation of Electronic Nose (EN) engineered by Nano Sensor Systems S.r.l., called Small Sensor Systems Plus (S3+), equipped with an array of six gas MOX sensors with different sensing layers each. In particular, real-time monitoring made it possible to follow and to differentiate each step of the vinegar production. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was the statistical multivariate analysis utilized to process the dataset obtained from the sensors. A closer look to PCA graphs affirms how the sensors were able to cluster the production steps in a chronologically correct manner.</jats:p>"

Using the Delphi method, environmental, social and economic indicators were identified (namely environmental performance indicators to evaluate soil, water, air, energy and environmental practices; social performance indicators related to human capital and social interaction; and economic performance indicators that address labor remuneration and return on investment). Subsequently, the proposed sustainability assessment model was applied for validation purposes in three different companies belonging to the swine supply chain in the southern region of Brazil. This study differs from previous ones by focusing on the sustainability assessment of the upstream and downstream of the supply chain, which are responsible for significant impacts. The performance of the studied companies from the three triple bottom-line (TBL) dimensions is significantly different. Both negative and positive impacts were found to be related to most of the specific metrics. The economic dimension presented a better performance than the environmental and social ones. Furthermore, there was a predominance of negative impacts in the environmental dimension, in relation to the soil, water, air, and energy indicators. Thus, specific actions, strategies, and policies must be designed for the different companies towards an effective and comprehensive sustainability throughout the swine supply chain. The proposed model can be extended to other companies in the same supply chain, replicated in other livestock and agribusiness industries and supply chains (such as cattle and poultry), and it can be used in different locations and including additional indicators and metrics.</jats:p>"

A supply network is called fragile if aggregate output is very sensitive to small aggregate shocks. We show that supply networks of intermediate productivity are fragile in equilibrium, even though this is always inefficient.

The model is an attempt to redraw the existing ‘contract logistics model’, and implement flexible, fast and agile supply chains which can free up manufacturers and retailers to meet the short lead times that consumers demand. In doing so, the model is designed to re-engineer the supply chain, rather than the current contract logistics approach which generally, in simple terms, is not adaptable. Thus, in order to meet consumer demand supply chains have not completely changed, but rather more inventory has been added in more warehouses, resulting in an ‘explosion of inventory across supply chains’ with products sitting in warehouses, costing money and losing value.</jats:p>"

One of the aims is educating people about importance of water treatment in today’s world.  &#x0D;\nMethodology: Bellow article briefly discuss some history of drinking water supply and municipal wastewater sanitation, i.e., construction of historical water engineering system like water wells, first flush toilets, indoor plumbing and simple pressurized showers, sewage farms and irrigation, in China, ancient Greece, Roman Empire, Asia minor, India, by Mayans in America and in Australia.&#x0D;\nMain Findings: By the 1840s the luxury of indoor plumbing, which mixes human waste with water and flushes it away, eliminated the need for cesspools. As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the consequences of major urbanization and outbreaks of diseases like typhoid and cholera from contaminated water and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system. Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for sewage treatment in the early 20th century, after scientists at the University of Manchester Ardern and Lockett discovered the sewage treatment process of activated sludge in 1912.&#x0D;\nImplications of the study: More than 100 years have been passed since the activated sludge process was explored, since the time when the mankind started to realize how important is the water sanitation in diseases prevention. However, the water treatment technology is permanently improving and enriched with new innovative solutions, the basic principle from the year 1912 i.e., activated sludge process remains as the main process of all conventional wastewater treatment plants.</jats:p>"

This pattern is caused by the response of household mortgage debt. Furthermore, we find evidence that positive credit supply shocks are the driving force behind boom-bust cycles.

The results showed that the demand side of drinking water has more influence on access to improved drinking water source, compared to the supply side. This is indicated by the level of education that has a significant influence on access to improved drinking water source, followed by the price of water. The low level of education results in a lack of awareness of the improved use of drinking water source. This result indicates the need for policies from local governments to conduct socialization and education in campaigns for the use of improved drinking water source, especially in areas with low levels of education. In addition, local governments need to set special drinking water rates for the poor people.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction industry is undoubtedly one of the most significant global sectors that contributes to sustainable development across physical, social, environmental and economic objectives. Globally the value of the construction industry is USD 10 trillion annually. The robustness of the sector is in serious question with a crisis in mental health. The rebuilding of economies is often led by significant capital works programs and therefore in response to the global pandemic, it is anticipated that this problem will only be exacerbated. The construction sector has a unique project-based structure of numerous intersecting subsectors, which influence the behaviours and culminate in highly demanding work environments on a project-by-project basis. We propose that to institute transformational change to the mental health problem, we need to challenge current problematisations towards presenting a new conceptual framework. The aim of this paper is to analyse the industrial organisation and the structural and behavioural context of the industry and propose a new approach to understanding interactions at multiple levels in relation to root causes of the mental health problem. Aligned to the UN SDG that we are to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, this paper responds to high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide in the construction industry. There is a need to generate new knowledge about the interactions between multi project supply chain, construction project supply chain environment and construction supply chain performance in relation to mental health outcomes. Literature indicates that there is a wealth of research on stressors, coping and interventions at an individual level, however very little from an ‘insider’ construction management perspective which contextualise mental health outcomes with the environmental stressors. Coupled with this, past research designs predominantly utilised quantitative approaches reliant on questionnaires. We critique past problematisations of the mental health problem and show how it has been represented to enable the development of a reframed conceptualisation. There is a need to identify contextual evidence-based stressors throughout the construction project supply chain. We present a transformational change model integrating construction industry specific context knowledge with psychosocial expertise to improve workers’ mental health. Future research could lead to outcomes including recommendations and guidelines to engage management actors who can influence positive change through preventative strategies leading to effective and measurable mental health and project performance improvements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As global climate change continues, policymakers at various levels of government have taken up the great challenge of decarbonisation and adopted tools to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental policy, including climate policy, is explicitly aimed at promoting environmental protection and conservation, but it also carries economic and social effects. Academic interest in sustainable supply chains has grown significantly in recent years. Social aspects, as well as the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability, are still rare. The purpose of this study is: (1) to review the most recent literature on greenhouse gas emissions policies, particularly pollution taxes and pollution rights trading schemes; (2) to investigate the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) with a focus on market and price development; (3) to identify possible effects of this system on supply-chain sustainability; (4) to offer inspiration for further research into the links between the EU ETS and sustainable development of the supply chain. The article concentrates on the impact of the cap-and-trade scheme on the three pillars of sustainable development: the environmental, economic and social dimensions. The findings of this study prove that this scheme has significantly affected not only upstream regulated sectors, but also downstream companies in the supply chain as well as households. In addition, our investigation suggests the presence of trade-offs between the environmental (climate) and socio-economic goals of sustainable development as a result of applying the EU ETS.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Philippine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has been in existence since 1976, providing Filipino children access to safe and effective vaccines to protect them from diseases like measles, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough.   EPI is one of the major programs of the Department of Health and has achieved many milestones. Mortality and morbidity due to vaccine-preventable diseases have declined precipitously over the years, saving the lives of many Filipino children. Moreover, polio and maternal and neonatal tetanus were eliminated in 2000 and 2017, respectively.   Despite this progress, basic vaccine coverage hovered at only 70–80 percent in the last 30 years, and EPI has never achieved its target to fully immunize at least 95 percent of children. Hence, this study assesses the performance of EPI in the Philippines. Central to this assessment is the policy question: Why has the country struggled to maintain immunization coverage and repeatedly failed to achieve its national immunization target?  While demand factors like vaccine confidence have contributed to the weak performance of the program, the sharp decline in immunization coverage in recent years is caused mainly by deep-seated supply-side system issues. In particular, leadership, planning, and supply chain problems led to recurring vaccine stockouts in the past decade.</jats:p>",

Water use patterns were affected, shifting peak demand and changing volumes, though changes varied from place to place. This study analyses the effects of the safe-distancing measures on water use patterns in different countries and cities with the aim of drawing general conclusions on causes and impacts of changes in water use patterns, as well as providing some insights on the impacts on finances of utilities and potential long-term implications. The analysis is based on information collected by the members of the IWA Specialist Group on Statistics and Economics for Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, the Netherlands and Singapore. Temporal, spatial/sectoral and volume changes can be distinguished. The main temporal change in domestic water use was a delay in the morning peak, while commercial water use patterns changed significantly. In general, the volume of domestic water use increased between about 3% and 8%, while non-domestic water use decreased between about 2% and 11% over 2020. Indirect evidence suggests shifts have taken place between sectors and spatially. The impact on finances of utilities has likely been only short-term.</jats:p>",

After exploring the infeasibility of wholesale price contract and wholesale price + cost-sharing contract, a wholesale price + cost sharing + revenue sharing hybrid contract is designed to optimize the coordination of the supply chain and finally examined and verified through arithmetic analysis. It is found that it is difficult to judge the overall utility of consumers under centralized decision-making, and the decisions made under decentralized decision-making are not optimal. Under the decentralized decision-making model, the wholesale price contract, and the wholesale price + cost-sharing contract can achieve supply chain coordination, but the contract will not be accepted because the former hurts the members' interests, and the latter reduces the overall profit. Therefore, a hybrid \"wholesale price + cost sharing + revenue sharing\" contract is designed to introduce profit redistribution and is shown to achieve perfect supply chain coordination.</jats:p>"

These models cannot adequately deal with dynamic characteristics of supply chain system affected by lead time, demand fluctuation, sale prediction and so forth. Static models in particular cannot describe, analyze and provide solutions for a key issue in supply chains called bullwhip effect. The bullwhip effect is information deviation from one end of the supply chain to the other which intensifies fluctuation and change in demand from downstream to upstream. This issue leads to major deficiencies. One of the approaches used to cope with dynamic issues is control systems approach. In present study, a predicting model controller was developed to minimize the bullwhip effect in supply chain. In addition, a prediction methodology is integrated into predicting model control framework to predict uncertainty in distorting demand behavior. Integration of a prediction methodology in predicting model control framework improved the controlling system's performance. The main feature of demand signal used in model design is its fluctuation and distortion. One of the main factors behind bullwhip effect is demand signals processing and in fact, the predicting model used.</jats:p>"

This study examined the temporal and spatial characteristics of meteorological droughts in the Mae Klong River Basin, Thailand, during 1971–2015. The rainfall anomaly index (RAI) was calculated for 3, 6, and 12 months using monthly observed rainfall data from eight stations. The RAI results showed the presence of multiple drought events ranging from moderate to severe conditions over the study period. Trend analysis was carried out for the drought duration, magnitude, and intensity using the Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope method. Increasing trends were found for drought intensity for both the 6- and 12-month time scales. The performance of RAI was assessed by comparison with the standardized precipitation index (SPI). In general, a high correlation (Pearson's coefficient r&amp;gt;0.93) was found between RAI and SPI. Cohen's Kappa test indicated fair agreement between the results of the two drought indices. The findings of this study are expected to help decision-makers better manage the basin's water resources.</jats:p>",

To this purpose, the data from a period of five years and over 36,000 observations was evaluated in this article. The cluster analysis approach was also used to categorize monitoring stations into three groups. What's more, three latent factors that predominantly influence the river water quality were assessed using factor analysis: anthropogenic pollution, seawater intrusion and geological processes, and the nitrification process. A spatial pattern using the three latent factor scores was plotted and six redundant monitoring stations were identified by this pattern. Finally, discriminant analysis was used to extract seven significant parameters. The results showed that the surface water-monitoring program of the watercourses in the Northwestern New Territories (Hong Kong) could be adjusted by reducing the monitoring stations to 18 and the measured chemical parameters to seven to ensure the detection of water quality and reduce the cost.</jats:p>",

We assessed how farm size affects intermediaries and job creation, income generation and the number of wealth beneficiaries. We surveyed 16 commercial farms from 0.1 to 220 ha and their supply chains. To compare wealth creation and the number of beneficiaries we established a baseline annual production of 550 t. Labor hours per tonne tended to rise in medium and extra-large farms. There were two main types of fish downstream supply chains: small farms selling their fish directly to consumers and large farms relying on intermediary trading, where gross revenue was spread among the different parts of the supply chain. Large supply chain stakeholders enhanced net income, typically through supermarket sales. However, the few farms and intermediaries involved resulted in low, poorly distributed, wealth creation. Intermediary trading through markets resulted in high global wealth creation but incomes below the minimum salary of most market sellers. Market sellers shipping from the wholesale market showed improved income. Fish trading undertaken by small farms produced the best gross revenue per traded fish, providing considerable wealth creation, especially in the case of selling at consumers’ homes and markets. This supply chain also permitted good wealth distribution. Net incomes of self-employed farmers exceeded the regional minimum salary by a factor of 3 to 5. Direct selling was thus more appropriate for lifting people out of poverty.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Distributed Control System (DCS) is regarded as the “brain” of nuclear power plant due to its function required in guarding nuclear safety. Power supply system is vital to supply electric power for DCS to maintain normal operation. Distribution design requirements of DCS power supply system are discussed firstly on analyzing the requirements of IEEE, IEC, etc. Combining with the comparative analysis of power supply schemes of DCS system in typical nuclear power plants based on CPR1000, AP1000 and EPR, key factors restricting the reliability of DCS power supply system are analyzed based on relevant design rules and standards in this paper. The method of improving the reliability of DCS power supply system is explored by analyzing the type of power supply, system design, equipment selection and design of electrical raceway. Thus a new high reliability power supply scheme for DCS system is presented based on mature equipment manufacturing technology. The scheme enhances the reliability, stability and flexibility of the distribution system by reducing the converting process on distribution path, increasing the design of cross-tie between divisions, and making full use of the advantages of DC distribution system. Through system operation analysis, equipment analysis and fault response analysis, this paper discussed the high reliability and feasibility of the new scheme, providing a new research direction for the design of DC system in nuclear power plant.</jats:p>",

This revolution helps in the making of more informed business decisions as well as the automation and/or improvement of business processes tasks. The successful integration of IoT into business operations is required to realize these benefits. Supporting the modelling of IoT-enhanced business proccesess is the first step toward this goal. Despite the fact that numerous papers studied this topic, it is unclear what the current state of the art is in terms of modelling solutions and gaps. We conduct a systematic literature review in this work to determine how current solutions model IoT into business operations, and whether the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has emerged as the de facto standard for business process modelling [20, 26]). The Object Management Group (OMG) developed BPMN, which is now an ISO standard BPMN is already enough for a full modelling of IoT integration, or the extensions are needed. We found and analysed the several existing alternative solutions after reviewing all the literature on this issue. Furthermore, we discuss some key aspects of the planned additions that should be addressed in the near future, such as the absence of standardization.</jats:p>"

There is a problem where the change in decentralization policy to centralization in financial governance has an impact on the sustainability of pesantren education. From the results of the data analysis it can be concluded that in the financial management of Pondok Pesantren Nurul Jadid, financial governance is carried out through the process of financial planning, implementation, reporting, evaluation, and financial supervision. In this case, Islamic boarding schools need to issue a more decentralized financial policy direction in which regions and educational institutions can optimize their resources and be creative in managing their resources.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to map ES supply-demand bundles to comprehensively analyze the ES tradeoffs in the Yangtze River Delta by using cluster analysis, correlation analysis, hotspots analysis, and principal component analysis. We found that: (1) Both the supply and demand of ES are unevenly distributed with highly spatial autocorrelation. (2) Significant tradeoffs and synergies between ES in terms of supply-supply, demand-demand, and supply-demand. (3) Four ES supply-demand bundle types were identified with distinct ES supply and demand relationships. (4) Land use types, urban intensity, and climatic factors are the main social-ecological factors that distinguish the four identified clusters. The identified ES supply-demand clusters can support the main functional zoning of the Yangtze River Delta. Our results also suggest that “land sharing” is a more appropriate approach for the sustainable development of the Yangtze River Delta considering the balance of multiple ES supply and ES demand.</jats:p>"

Such active droplet systems are driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium and turn over chemically, which corresponds to a simple metabolism. Two scenarios of nonequilibrium driving are considered. First, droplets are driven via the system boundaries by external reservoirs that supply nutrient and remove waste (boundary‐driven). Second, droplets are driven by a chemical energy provided by a fuel in the bulk (bulk‐driven). For both scenarios, the conservation of energy and matter as well as the balance of entropy are discussed. Conserved and nonconserved fields are used to analyse the nonequilibrium steady states of active droplets. Using an effective droplet model, droplet stability and instabilities leading to droplet division are explored. This work reveals that droplet division occurs quite generally in active droplet systems. The results suggest that life‐like processes such as metabolism and division can emerge in simple nonequilibrium systems that combine the physics of phase separation and chemical reactions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study develops and tests a novel product quality framework for food supply chains (FSCs) that addresses sustainability. Issues including climate change, population growth, and the resources required by industrialized agriculture, as well as changing consumer preferences contribute to concerns about the social, ecological, and economic sustainability of FSCs. FSCs, therefore, need to be adapted to address changing supply and demand characteristics. We integrate the natural resource-based view (NRBV) with convention theory (CT) to develop a new set of quality dimensions. Placing social and ecological considerations within the domain of quality management advances theory in two ways. First, while social and ecological considerations are typically peripheral to business models, this framework allows social responsibility and the natural environment to occupy a central place within FSC operations. Second, the framework reflects the fundamentally socially embedded nature of FSCs, including the geographic, historical, and cultural associations of food quality. We then construct a typology of quality conventions and FSCs. We empirically test the typology using a case study methodology with cases from the United States of America (USA). The analysis explores how firms bundle quality conventions across FSCs for competitive advantage. We also find a set of paths through which FSCs transition via exploitation, exploration and organizational ambidexterity to generate competitive advantage, highlighting tradeoffs that may arise as FSCs evolve. These tradeoffs, which relate to maintaining or adapting quality conventions, are practically important because, if not managed appropriately, may result in lower performance and less sustainable FSCs.</jats:p>"

It is suggested that with regard to low total power loss and high minimum film thickness, for a lighter loaded bearing, the axial groove should be located in the angular range of 100–140 deg to the load line with a groove length ratio Lg/L over 0.6 or the angular range of 300–350 deg with an Lg/L over 0.75. For a heavier loaded bearing, it is suggested that the groove be placed at the angular range of 80–115 deg with an Lg/L over 0.6.</jats:p>",

It is challenging for entrepreneurs to predict the future, and the tested routines, proven habits, or the developed patterns of action no longer function properly, e.g., the logistic strategy of JIT does not fit the new rules of the business game and begins to be treated as a relic. From a business perspective, this new reality is profoundly changing how enterprises and supply chains operate, as well as how we approach supply chain resilience. As a result, we observe a picture of a highly volatile and unpredictable business environment in which vulnerable supply chains operate. The following research questions were asked in the paper: (1) What are the barriers to realizing the concept of Supply Chain Resilience in the reality of VUCA?; and (2) What can be the lead time for the Supply Chain Resilience in reality VUCA? The article presents the results of an expert study using the Delphi method. High-class experts from the scientific community were selected for the research. The results of the research allowed us to answer the research questions posed. Internal barriers to realizing a resilient supply chain in reality VUCA are listed. Based on the indications of experts, three scenarios have also been developed that relate to the speed of the expected lead time of a resilient supply chain, in fact, VUCA. Further research directions on the resilience of supply chains have also been marked out.</jats:p>"

In this paper, with the increase of DC power sources such as photovoltaic power generation and fuel cells, it is difficult for batteries to fully improve energy utilization efficiency and solve the problem of large-scale consumption of clean energy power. An adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) device is established, and RMES model considering integrated demand response (IDR) is considered. As the most potential energy storage device at present, A-CAES device can better promote the absorption of new energy such as wind energy and photovoltaic, effectively utilize traditional energy and reduce the environmental pollution caused by RMES. Improve the ”multi-energy complementary” energy supply mode adopted by RMES through A-CAES. IDR is adopted to improve the economy and flexibility of integrated energy system.

The objective of this study is to explore the blockchain (BC) platform and its inputs as technological solutions. In addition, the application of blockchain technology in managing supply chain (SC) business processes like shipment tracking, authenticity, and identification is also a focus of research. This research was carried out in three ways to explore the issue. Expert interviews were used to develop a research framework for the comparative analysis of BC platforms to find out the benefits and the barriers of blockchain adoption. In association with the diffusion of the technology, a qualitative comparative analysis was applied to benchmark blockchain platform providers. We analysed the blockchain-supply chain market by component, provider, type, and the conditions of usage. As part of this research, the Forbes TOP 50 companies were analysed by business area, country of origin, application area, and benefits in order to see in which area they applied blockchain technology and what improvements they have achieved. The results revealed that blockchain use in supply chains of selected industries has outstanding benefits of transparency, trustworthiness, traceability, and cost efficiencies which give businesses an advantage in terms of implementation costs, technology needs, human resources, legal environments, volatile costs, and security. In the supply chain, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum are the most widely used blockchain platforms.

To investigate the impact of carbon emissions right pledge financing on supply chains, this study constructed a two-echelon low-carbon supply chain, which consisted of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer invested in carbon reduction technologies using carbon emissions right pledge financing. On this basis, we analyzed the carbon emissions reduction levels and profits of the supply chain in three different power structures. The results showed that the manufacturer pledged the most carbon emissions rights to finance emissions reduction in the Nash model and, in this case, the carbon emissions reduction levels and profits of the supply chain were always the highest. In the manufacturer-led Stackelberg model, the overall economic and environmental benefits of the supply chain were the lowest. In addition, we analyzed the sensitivity of the important parameters of the model and revealed some management implications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid economic growth and increasingly fierce market competition, the traditional manufacturing advantages have become a thing of the past. There are problems such as inaccurate procurement plans, large quantities of inventory sold out, chaotic procurement processes, and unclear inventory policies. Optimizing the procurement of basic raw materials will help reduce raw material costs. This paper analyzes some raw material supply chain processes through the Delphi method, Plato principle, and trend-adjusted exponential smoothing method and finds that the important factors for improving raw material supply include economic and technological environment, the realization of purchasing department functions, price stability, technical level, system management awareness, product qualification rate, quality inspection and testing, and problem handling timeliness. Financial situation, procurement efficiency, and cooperation compatibility are important factors for improving the supply of raw materials. By using key indicators to select strategic suppliers and computational intelligence to obtain the forecast value of raw material supply, the forecast error rate is within 9%, indicating that the forecast data are reliable and can be used as an auxiliary tool for raw material supply, thereby reducing risks. Under the corresponding conditions, the waste of raw materials can be reduced and the raw materials can be stored more reasonably. Using the Delphi method, Plato principle, and trend adjustment exponential smoothing method to analyze part of the raw material supply chain process brings benefits to the enterprise and finally achieves the standardization of the procurement process, the optimization of supplier groups, the sharing of procurement information, the supervision of procurement process, the reduction of purchasing costs, improvement of procurement intelligence, division of labor and performance assessment, and achievement of a win-win situation with suppliers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Neuronal densities vary enormously across sites within a brain. Does the density of the capillary bed vary accompanying the presumably larger energy requirement of sites with more neurons, or with larger neurons, or is energy supply constrained by a mostly homogeneous capillary bed? Here we find evidence for the latter, with a capillary bed that represents typically between 0.7 and 1.5% of the volume of the parenchyma across various sites in the mouse brain, whereas neuronal densities vary by at least 100-fold. As a result, the ratio of capillary cells per neuron decreases uniformly with increasing neuronal density and therefore with smaller average neuronal size across sites. Thus, given the relatively constant capillary density compared to neuronal density in the brain, blood and energy availability per neuron is presumably dependent on how many neurons compete for the limited supply provided by a mostly homogeneous capillary bed. Additionally, we find that local capillary density is not correlated with local synapse densities, although there is a small but significant correlation between lower neuronal density (and therefore larger neuronal size) and more synapses per neuron within the restricted range of 6,500–9,500 across cortical sites. Further, local variations in the glial/neuron ratio are not correlated with local variations in the number of synapses per neuron or local synaptic densities. These findings suggest that it is not that larger neurons, neurons with more synapses, or even sites with more synapses <jats:italic>demand</jats:italic> more energy, but simply that larger neurons (in low density sites) have more energy available per cell and for the totality of its synapses than smaller neurons (in high density sites) due to competition for limited resources supplied by a capillary bed of fairly homogeneous density throughout the brain.</jats:p>"

When conveying the steam medium of high temperature and high pressure, it impacts the valve disc and pipe wall, resulting in flow-induced vibration and noise of the pipe, resulting in excessive pipeline vibration, which is not conducive to the normal operation of the heat supply network and stable steam supply. In this paper, by using large eddy simulation turbulence theory to study bleed valve disc under different rotation angle operating characteristics, pipe flow field regularity of distribution, and the pressure pulsation of measuring points, the Q criterion is applied to analyze the locomotion mechanism of vortex structure in the downstream flow field of the valve disc, the use of common noise prediction method to calculate the noise of the heat supply network structure features, analysis of the inherent law of flow-induced vibration. It is found that with the increase of the rotation angle of the valve disc, there is an obvious negative pressure center area at the back of the valve disc, and the vortex is formed under the action of the adverse pressure gradient. The decrease in vortex size makes the flow efficiency at the back of the valve increase significantly. Large eddy simulation results show that the fluid generates a double vortex structure similar to the dean vortex behind the valve, and is eventually broken and separated due to the dissipation of viscous turbulent kinetic energy. The smaller the rotation angle is, the more seriously the dissipation vortex blocks the flow area near the pipe wall. The noise characteristics of the flow field in the heat supply network present a dipole state and the overall broadband characteristics. The energy of the flow field is concentrated in the low and middle frequency, and there is a peak of noise SPL. Simulation results showed that when the valve disc rotation angle is less than 30°, the vortex structure will seriously block the pipeline flow area, accounting for more than 90%, and the pipeline flow efficiency will decrease significantly with strong pulsation and noise. The fundamental frequency of the noise in the heat supply network shows a frequency doubling relationship with the natural frequency of the structure, and the rotation angle of the valve disc is negative correlation significantly with the magnitude and position of the fundamental frequency of the noise. Both of them can induce the flow-induced vibration and noise of the heat supply network, which complies with the field measurement data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Healthcare organisations are constantly facing sophisticated cyberattacks due to the sensitivity and criticality of patient health care information and wide connectivity of medical devices. Such attacks can pose potential disruptions to critical services delivery. There are number of existing works that focus on using Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting vulnerability and exploitation but most of these works focused on parameterized values to predict severity and exploitability. This paper proposes a novel method that uses ontology axioms to define essential concepts related to the overall healthcare ecosystem and to ensure semantic consistency checking among such concepts. The application of ontology enables the formal specification and description of healthcare ecosystem and the key elements used in vulnerability assessment as a set of concepts. Such specification also strengthens the relationships that exist between healthcare-based and vulnerability assessment concepts, in addition to semantic definition and reasoning of the concepts. Our work also makes use of Machine Learning techniques to predict possible security vulnerabilities in health care supply chain services. The paper demonstrates the applicability of our work by using vulnerability datasets to predict the exploitation. The results show that the conceptualization of healthcare sector cybersecurity using an ontological approach provides mechanisms to better understand the correlation between the healthcare sector and the security domain, while the ML algorithms increase the accuracy of the vulnerability exploitability prediction. Our result shows that using Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest provided a reasonable result for predicting vulnerability exploitability.</jats:p>",

In this study, to find the optimum operation for a reservoir with the purpose of satisfying water demands while meeting the water quantity and quality criteria, a generic reservoir and river basin simulation model (MODSIM) is coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm leading to construct the PSO–MODSIM model. With the decision variables of the reservoir's monthly releases, the objective function is to maximize the supply for downstream demands while keeping the electrical conductivity (EC) in the river flow lower than a predefined level at the downstream checkpoint, which is a function of the EC in the agricultural return flows. Moreover, a safe flow rate is defined in which the streamflow should not exceed at the checkpoint resulting in mitigation of the submerging lands damage. Results obtained by the PSO–MODSIM model indicate the ability of the proposed simulation–optimization approach for solving the problem of optimal quantity–quality-based water allocation in a reservoir–river system. For instance, the EC at the checkpoint is decreased by 61% in the optimum reservoir operation state comparing the present situation, whereas the municipal and environmental demands are fully met and the agricultural demands are supplied with a desirable reliability satisfaction level.</jats:p>",

After exhaustion of the possibilities for the implementation of technical measures to reduce energy costs by changing in volumetric planning solutions and insulating building envelopes further decreasing heat consumption level should be associated with the use of the secondary and renewable resources potential. The paper presents the results of assessing the technical and economic feasibility of using the exhaust air thermal potential for heating the supply air in the forced supply-and-exhaust ventilation system of a building taking as a low-capacity unit as an example. For a counterflow air-to-air recuperative type heat utilizer finned with ribbed heat pipes in the form of a plurality of continuous sheets, the influence of changes in the physical properties of the exhaust air during the phase transition of the water vapor contained in it into a liquid state on the heat exchanger-utilizer performance and characteristics of its efficiency has been established. The conditions of heat exchange are determined (without condensate, with condensate in the part of the heat exchanger-utilizer, with condensate in the entire heat exchanger-utilizer and with the risk of icing) in the supply air temperature range from (–26) to (+8) °C for three variants of its operation with a balance of the nominal amount of exhaust and supply air and with two variants of imbalance. Variants with imbalances have been investigated in order to find possible combinations of supply and exhaust air temperatures, at which there would be no phase transition of water vapor in the exhaust air flow to the liquid state in the entire volume of the heat utilizer, which would eliminate the need for measures to collect and remove condensate and preventing it from freezing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PT. Mitratani Dua Tujuh merupakan perusahaan agroindustri yang bergerak pada bidang produksi sayuran beku khususnya edamame. Secara garis besar terdapat 4 proses utama pada rantai pasok PT. Mitratani Dua Tujuh yaitu budidaya, pengadaan bahan penunjang, pengolahan, serta pengiriman. Dalam pelaksanaannya, PT. Mitratani Dua Tujuh juga mengalami berbagai masalah dalam rantai pasoknya. Tantangan terbesar yang dialami PT. Mitratani Dua Tujuh yaitu ketidakpastian cuaca dan order. Ketidakpastian cuaca seperti tingkat kelembaban yang tinggi dapat memengaruhi hasil panen karena menyebabkan munculnya dark spot pada edamame yang dapat menurunkan kualitas. Sedangkan ketidakpastian order memiliki dampak yang besar bagi rantai pasok PT. Mitratani Dua Tujuh hingga ke hulu. Permasalahan-permasalahan pada agroindustri tersebut seringkali tidak dapat diprediksi secara tepat oleh perusahaan karena sifatnya yang tidak pasti. Untuk mengurangi berbagai kerugian yang muncul pada jaringan rantai pasok agroindustri diperlukan sebuah manajemen risiko. Terdapat beberapa tahap dalam manajemen risiko antara lain, identifikasi risiko, penilaian risiko, mitigasi risiko, dan evaluasi risiko. Identifikasi risiko dilakukan untuk mengetahui kejadian yang dapat menyebabkan kerugian dan juga agen atau penyebab terjadinya risiko. Penilaian risiko dilakukan untuk mendeskripsikan dan mengkuantifikasi risiko. Mitigasi risiko merupakan proses merespon risiko yang telah dinilai sedangkan evaluasi risiko dilakukan untuk menilai efektivitas mitigasi risiko yang telah diterapkan. Pujawan dan Geraldin telah mengembangkan model khusus untuk pengelolaan risiko rantai pasok yang disebut House Of Risk (HOR). Model House of Risk berfokus pada pencegahan dengan mengurangi kemungkinan terjadinya agen risiko, dengan mengurangi agen risiko maka dapat mencegah terjadinya suatu risiko. Pada House of Risk fase 1 ditemukan sebanyak 32 kejadian risiko dan 38 agen risiko. Sedangkan pada HOR fase 2 ditemukan sebanyak 16 agen risiko yang menjadi prioritas mitigasi kemudian dilanjutkan dengan mengidentifikasi strategi mitigasi yang dapat diterapkan. Pada penilaian House of Risk fase 2 menghasilkan 8 strategi prioritas mitigasi yaitu komunikasi intens, menentukan batas minimum stok aman bahan penunjang, memberikan margin of error terhadap setiap perencanaan produksi, menyediakan sistem informasi yang terkoordinasi dan tersinkronisasi , memberi batas waktu maksimal perubahan order kepada customer, diperlukan maintenance dan penggantian spare part secara berkala, menyediakan spare part cadangan untuk spare part tertentu yang sering rusak, dan menyediakan spare time untuk menyelesaikan tanggungan produksi yang terbengkalai saat mesin rusak atau saat listrik padam.</jats:p>"

The result of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model revealed that electricity supply has a negative and insignificant relationship with the manufacturing sector output. Conversely, technology has a positive and significant relationship with manufacturing sector output in the short run. Thus, it was recommended that an adequate and stable supply of electricity and deploying modern technology should be on the front burner of the country's development policy.

The NB solution, however, is derived based on the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), an unrealistic assumption in many contexts. Indeed, our analysis suggests that the NB solution can lead to unreasonable negotiation outcomes in supply chains with horizontal competition. As an alternative, the Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) solution has been applied in many fields but has not been introduced to the supply chain contexts. The KS solution is derived under the axiom of individual monotonicity in replacement of the IIA axiom. We perform a comprehensive comparison of contract negotiations under the KS and NB solutions in horizontally competing supply chains. Although the KS solution does not possess the flexibility of explicitly specifying the relative bargaining power as the NB solution does, the KS solution can appropriately capture the negotiation power shift induced by the decision ownership, the negotiation sequence, the vertical relationship, the competition intensity, the trade contingency, and the contract type. Our study sheds lights on the appropriate selection of solution concepts in studying negotiations in competing supply chains.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the complexity involved in the dynamics of effects between organizations’ SC risks and RCs to overcome disruptive events. Past researchers investigated how to improve the performance of construction projects, regardless of the complexities and interdependencies associated with the risks across the entire SC. However, the system dynamics (SD) approach to describe the diversity of construction SCs under risks has received limited attention indicating a research gap pursued by this study. This work aimed to analyze and establish interconnectivity and functionality amongst the construction SC risks and RCs using systems thinking (ST) and SD modeling approach. The SD technique is used to assess the complexity and integrated effect of SC risks on construction projects to enhance their resilience. The risks and RCs were identified by critically scrutinizing the literature and were then ranked through content analysis. Questionnaire surveys and expert opinions (involving 10 experts) helped develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and SD models with simulations to assess complexity qualitatively and quantitatively within the system. Research reveals that construction organizations are more vulnerable to health pandemics, budget overruns, poor information coordination, insufficient management oversight, and error visibility to stakeholders. Further, the most effective RCs include assets visibility, collaborative information exchange, business intelligence gatherings, alternative suppliers, and inventory management systems. This research helps industry practitioners identify and plan for various risks and RCs within their organizations and SCs. Furthermore, it helps understand trade-offs between suitable RCs to abate essential risks and develop preparedness against disruptions to improve organizational policymaking, project efficiency, and performance.</jats:p>"

The research was descriptive research with a qualitative approach. This research used in-depth interviews with particular informants with purposive sampling and participative observation methods in certain activities. Data that had been obtained was analysed and qualitatively described. This research found that the collectors still overpowered the supply-chain process of natural rubber in the Batanghari Regency – trader, both at the village, sub-regency, and Regency levels. Other institutions, such as the auction market and crumb rubber factory, were located only in particular locations, so they were not accessible to the whole farmers in the Regency. As a result, several channels of marketing systems made different prices from what the farmers got. Institutional marketing indeed could be implemented. It has been proven by institutions such as auctions, joint venture groups, and other groups. Besides, some non–economic aspects can affect the way price parameter changes in the supply chain process, and they are; institution characteristics, marketing channel, and patronage relationship between farmers and traders. Batanghari Regency government should re-examine their plantation regulation about the marketing mechanism until the lowest level, villages. The government should have encouraged a mutual understanding among farmers so that similar efforts could occur elsewhere.</jats:p>"

Identifying which supplier has the greater possibility of interruptions is pivotal for managing the occurrence of these risks, which have a significant impact on the supply chain. Identifying and predicting how these risks propagate and understanding how these risks dynamically diffuse if control strategies are installed can help to better manage supply chain risks. Drawing on the complex systems and epidemiological literature, we research the impact of the global supply network structure on risk propagation and supply network health. The SIR model is used to dynamically identify and predict the risk status of the supply chain risk at different times. The results show that there is a significant relationship between network structure and risk propagation and supply network health. We demonstrate the importance of supply network visibility and of the extraction of the information of node firms. We build up an R package for geometric graphs and epidemics. This paper applies the R package to model the supply chain risk for an automotive manufacturing company. The R package provides a firm to construct the complicated interactions among suppliers and display how these interactions impact on risks. Theoretically, our study adapts a computational approach to contribute to the understanding of risk management and supply networks. Managerially, our study demonstrates how the supply chain network analysis approach can benefit the managers by developing a more holistic framework of system-wide risk propagation. This provides guidance for network governance policies, which will lead to healthier supply chains.</jats:p>"

First, the spatial-temporal characteristics of economic data of the IST Supply Chain are analyzed based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Second, the annual Online Public Attention (OPA) data to IST in domestic cities and regions are collected. The quarterly concentration index and Gini coefficient are used to analyze their spatial and temporal characteristics. Then, the weighted fusion algorithm used for the Supply Chain scenario modeling is improved to solve data redundancy and improve information accuracy. Finally, the framework of the IST-oriented Supply Chain scenario ontology model is proposed. The experimental results show that Internet users give much attention to IST from 2011 to 2021. OPA to IST increased first and decreased and peaked in 2016. The final fusion value of the proposed data fusion algorithm is 20.0221, and that of the adaptive Weighted Average Method (WAM) is 20.0724. Thus, the proposed algorithm outperforms the adaptive WAM. The traditional scenario-based ontology model takes people as the center. In contrast, the Supply Chain scenario-based ontology model centers around product state and scenario. Therefore, the proposed Supply Chain scenario-based ontology model is entirely new. The proposed scenariobased ontology model using polymorphic IoT lays the foundation for developing an intelligent and automatic SCM. It has great practical significance in realizing efficient tourism industry management and SCM.</jats:p>",

It has been proven that in order to reduce the negative impact on the environment, the contribution of each logistics company to the formation of ecological ecosystems must be systemic, and in order to ensure sustainable development, logistics companies must implement investment and innovative projects in various directions that help reduce the negative impact on the environment. This determines the main directions for the introduction of innovative technologies that can be implemented in the process of shipping in order to green the activities of a logistics company. Potential projects for the modernization of vehicles through their \"greening\" were studied to minimize the negative impact on the environment and maintain the competitive position of logistics companies. Detailed development and justification of the feasibility of implementing projects for a logistics company that supports the concept of sustainable development and implements the Green Business strategy has been carried out. The projects for the modernization of the transport infrastructure of a logistics company are analyzed, and the advantages, disadvantages, and potential for their development are identified, which involves the introduction of various \"environmental\" technologies, such as, firstly, the use of alternative fuel, namely liquefied natural gas, and secondly, the use of technology, which is based on wind energy, which gives a clear reduction in fuel costs and offers a more innovative solution; thirdly, the use of technology based on solar panels, innovative materials in the construction of ships. It is substantiated that each project has different entry barriers for implementation and initial investment, which determines the degree of risk and the possibility of implementing projects at different periods of the life cycle of a logistics company on the path to implementing the Green Business strategy. Using the methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of investment projects, the expediency of implementing each investment project is substantiated and a comparative description of the corresponding calculations is carried out. It is noted that \"green\" logistics has great potential for both a separate logistics company and the entire logistics ecosystem.</jats:p>"

According to two requirements, a unipolar high voltage pulsed power supply with power factor correction (PFC) is proposed in this paper. The power supply consists of a unipolar pulse high voltage generating unit, a PFC unit, and a driving circuit. By introducing a feedback clamping diode and a reverse current blocking diode in a flyback converter, repetitive nanosecond pulses are generated in the unipolar pulse high voltage generating unit. Because a discontinuous current mode strategy is adopted in the PFC unit and the driving signal is shared by the two units, a compact structure of the power supply is achieved, and a high PF is obtained. To validate the proposed pulsed power supply, an experimental setup is built for a DBD excimer lamp. The results show that the proposed power supply has the capability of not only providing a unipolar nanosecond pulse high voltage for the DBD excimer lamp but also achieving PF close to 1 and total harmonic distortion of less than 24%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The automotive sector is one of the important sectors in both the developed world and the developing countries. For developing countries, this industry is a course of income coming from export models. For the developed nations, the automotive sector can create quality jobs and offer after-sales and service job opportunities as well. The automotive industry was challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic as shortages for some parts halted production in different parts of the world. Also, sales of automobiles increased in some parts due to commuters avoiding mass transit in fear of the pandemic. Tax collection is also another issue associated with this industry. In some countries, heavy taxes are levied on the vehicles with some possible drawbacks. This chapter will talk about the causes and remedies for the disruptions in the supply chain. The issue of taxation will also be discussed offering some possible solutions. Green energy and public transportation will be offered as remedies to the problems of the industry and the more general problem of global warming. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As agriculture and industry exploit more than 90% of the global freshwater resources, water overuse and degradation have emerged as critical socio-environmental challenges for both nations and corporations. In this context, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to quantify the freshwater consumption and pollution of a territory or across a product’s life cycle. As research on water management in supply chains is growing, this work aims to integrate the perspective of freshwater resources into supply network configuration. Focusing on the agrifood sector, we have developed a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be used to minimize the operational costs under a water footprint cap in a wine supply chain network by selecting the optimal suppliers (vine growers), manufacturing sites (winemakers), and transportation modes (fuel-powered trucks). The optimization outcomes unveil that the wine network’s configurations (structure and fuel type) vary significantly depending on the values of the water footprint cap so as to balance the trade-off between economic and water-related environmental efficiency. Beyond the viticulture sector, the proposed model is anticipated to act as a paradigm for setting joint sustainable targets or caps to limit water use across supply chains.</jats:p>"

I hypothesize democratic regimes afford labor the opportunity to increase its share of national income. While previous empirical work finds cross-sectional evidence for the hypothesis, this paper employs a time-series cross-sectional analysis using data for 119 countries between 1950 and 2017, indicating the labor share of income is higher in democratic countries. The estimates are robust to different specifications of the statistical model. This paper also examines a potential causal mechanism that links democracy to a higher labor share through the supply of labor (the average number of hours worked in the economy). The relationship between democracy and the supply of labor lends additional evidence to my hypothesis. In a world characterized by diverging democracy, the results imply the path countries choose between democracy and dictatorship matters. </jats:p>",

We determined the ruminal supply of microbial nitrogen (RSMN), ERSMN, and the urea-N by measuring N and purine derivatives in urine. Subsequently, we predicted the duodenal RSMN, the rumen nitrogen balance (RNB), and the urea cost with the Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS v. 1.0.33) model.\nResults: The inclusion of Leucaena improved (P≤0.05) the RSMN. The ERSMN estimated by purine derivatives had a quadratic response (P≤0.05) at the inclusion level of Leucaena in the diet. The RNB, the cost of urea, and the urea-N increased (P≤0.05) with a higher inclusion percentage of Leucaena. The maximum ERSMN and N balance were obtained with 20% Leucaena in the ration.\nStudy Limitations/Implications: The expression of the nitrogen utilization potential of Leucaena for microbial protein synthesis in this study was likely restricted by the limited availability of non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC). Further studies must be conducted to determine the most affordable source of NFC to match Leucaena nitrogen utilization in the rumen.\nFindings/Conclusions: Leucaena could be used as an efficient protein source for heifers at a 20% inclusion in their diet.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A key element for reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort on high-speed rail is controlling air-conditioning temperature. Accurate prediction of air supply temperature is aimed at improving control effects. Existing studies of supply air temperature prediction models are interdisciplinary, involving heat transfer science and computer science, where the problem is defined as time-series prediction. However, the model is widely accepted as a complex model that is nonlinear and dynamic. That makes it difficult for existing statistical and deep learning methods, e.g., autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory network (LSTM), to fully capture the interaction between these variables and provide accurate prediction results. Recent studies have shown the potential of the Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. This paper offers an improved temporal fusion transformers (TFT) prediction model for supply air temperature in high-speed train carriages to tackle these challenges, with two improvements: (i) Double-convolutional residual encoder structure based on dilated causal convolution; (ii) Spatio-temporal double-gated structure based on Gated Linear Units. Moreover, this study designs a loss function suitable for general long sequence time-series forecast tasks for temperature forecasting. Empirical simulations using a high-speed rail air-conditioning operation dataset at a specific location in China show that the temperature prediction of the two units using the improved TFT model improves the MAPE by 21.70% and 11.73%, respectively the original model. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the model effectively outperforms seven popular methods on time series computing tasks, and the attention of the prediction problem in the time dimension is analyzed.</jats:p>"

Neither the resilience of these networks is known, nor do we have ways to systematically monitor their ongoing change. Systemic risk contributions of individual companies were hitherto not quantifiable since data on supply networks on the firm-level do not exist with the exception of a very few countries. Here we use telecommunication meta data to reconstruct nationwide firm-level supply networks in almost real-time. We find the probability of observing a supply-link, given the existence of a strong communication-link between two companies, to be about 90%. The so reconstructed supply networks allow us to reliably quantify the systemic risk of individual companies and thus obtain an estimate for a country’s economic resilience. We identify about 65 companies, from a broad range of company sizes and from 22 different industry sectors, that could potentially cause massive damages. The method can be used for objectively monitoring change in production processes which might become essential during the green transition.</jats:p>"

There have been many episodes where governments of some countries financially supported such an attack on a public company or institution. The cyber-attacks problem is not new, and the economic damage it can do is truly impactful. I’ve undergone an analysis of relevant literature in order to identify the key factors and the limitations that supply chains are facing when it comes to computer products. Following ample research, I’ve formulated the research questions which I believe to be essential in providing answers that can bring contributions to the field: “What are the main challenges that computer products supply chains are facing?”, and “In what way can we limit these attacks?”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results of the analysis classify the challenges in three key dimensions: hijacking updates, undermining code signing, and destroying the free access code.

According to BPS data in 2014 there were 4.104 heads of cattle and in 2016 decreased with a total of slaughtering as many as 3,461 heads of cattle. From this data it can be seen that the number of cattle slaughtering in Sumbawa Regency can be said to be quite low for the needs of beef in Sumbawa Regency. In Sumbawa especially, the problem of beef lies in relatively expensive price. This study aims to determine the supply chain of beef from slaughterhouse to end consumers by using data collection methods, and determining respondents (snowball sampling technique and purposive sampling technique). The result of this study is the marketing efficiency of beef shows that the efficiency of marketing of 0 (zero) level of beef seller-consumer is 0% smaller compared to the level marketing efficiency of level 1 (one) of meat retailers-consumers of 0.87 %. Value added at the level of beef seller (butcher) shows that the conversion factor value is 1.30 where the conversion factor is obtained by dividing the output value with the input value for every 1 medium-sized cattle.</jats:p>"

Feeder links are the key component of distribution networks. They are of great significance to the TSC of the distribution network. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the influence rules of feeder links on TSC and then apply the rules in distribution network planning. First, the indices describing the position, scale, and efficiency of feeder links are defined. Second, the influence rules of feeder links on TSC are revealed. 1) When the feeder geometrical distribution is more balanced, the TSC is higher. 2) When the feeder link scale is larger, the TSC is higher. While for both (1) and (2), the TSC will remain unchanged after reaching a certain value. 3) There always exists an optimal construction order of feeder links, which can ensure the TSC is as high as possible in each planning stage. Third, based on the rules, a model and an algorithm of the feeder link planning are proposed. The method can find an optimal construction order of feeder links, which can ensure that the value of TSC is as high as possible in each feeder link planning stage. Finally, the proposed method is verified on an 8-substation-transformer case grid, which has shown that the proposed method has advantages in feeder link efficiency and feeder-distribution balancing, and especially the TSC can be improved in each planning stage than the traditional methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The implementation of measures to limit electricity consumption in many provinces of China has caused coal prices to rise irrationally, further aggravating the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises in the supply chain. Small and medium-sized enterprises lacking funds cannot effectively participate in the green transformation and development of the coal industry, which slows down the sustainable development process of the coal industry. Under the current background of low-carbon advocacy, blockchain technology can reasonably allocate resources and efficiently process information, thereby providing a solution for this financing problem. This paper first proposes a coal accounts receivable financing model based on blockchain technology, then builds a coal accounts receivable financing system dominated by ports through blockchain technology. Finally, the Stackelberg yield–benefit model is used to analyze the income function of each participant in the process of accounts receivable financing. The results show that the use of blockchain technology can reduce the financing condition of financial institutions and improve the maximum income of cooperative enterprises in the chain while solving the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises in the coal supply chain. This study provides practical significance and theoretical value for promoting the transformation and upgrading of coal enterprises and accelerating the opening of the sustainable development model of the coal industry.</jats:p>"

Pengembangan usaha jagung, khususnya petani jagung terkendala dalam masa tanam yang sifat tanamnya musiman, dalam jaminan kesinambungan kualitas produk, ketepatan waktu pengiriman produk yang menjadi kendala pada proses distribusi jagung kepada konsumen. Penanggulangan masalah ketersediaan jagung untuk bahan baku pakan ternak memerlukan kajian terhadap dinamika komoditas jagung, dapat dilihat melalui suatu rantai kegiatan. Jagung pada umumnya dikonsumsi dalam bentuk pipilan, akan tetapi ini diperuntukkan untuk konsumsi peternakan ayam petelur. Petani sebagai pelaku utama dalam hal ini umumnya tidak mendapat keuntungan yang optimal, karena semakin panjang sebuah rantai pasok maka akan memperlemah posisi tawar petani. Tujuan penelitian ini yaitu menggambarkan ranyai pasok jagung untuk pakan ternak di Kabupaten Pasaman Barat. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah metode survey dengan analisis data kuantitatif dengan menggunakan analisis profil rantai pasok menggunakan kerangka Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN). Sampel yang diambil yaitu petani sebanyak 75 orang, pedagang pengumpul 12 orang dan pedagang besar 1 orang. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terdapat 3 pola saluran rantai pasok, yaitu pola saluran 1 terdiri dari petani – pedagang pengumpul 1– pedagang besar – konsumen, saluran 2 terdiri dari petani – pedagang pengumpul 2– konsumen dan saluran 3 terdiri dari petani – pedagang besar – konsumen. Aliran produk pada proses bisnis rantai pasok jagung mulai dari petani, pedagang pengumpul 1 dan 2 serta pedagang besar disini belum terlaksana dengan baik, karena tidak adanya siklus yang pasti untuk waktu pengiriman maupun kuota yang akan dikirim nantinya kepada konsumen akhir karena tidak dapat diprediksi jumlah yang akan dikirim.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this article studies the current internal control technology of vegetable greenhouses, and improves the sensor application in vegetable greenhouses, in a targeted manner by combining with the improved neural network algorithm. The model has more accurate prediction accuracy than traditional BP. By using the Android client and ZigBee artificial intelligence control technology it creates the most suitable living conditions for the vegetables, fruits, and other crops in the vegetable greenhouse by controlling the various valves, sun visors, and light supplementary switches inside the vegetable greenhouse. The simulation results show that the model proposed in this article has higher convergence accuracy. In addition, this article applies the improved neural network to the management of the agricultural product supply chain, starting from the agricultural product supply chain and agricultural product supply chain management. Based on this, the analytic hierarchy process is used to explore the influencing factors of agricultural product supply chain management, and the analysis shows that consumers are targeting different consumer demand raised by the agricultural product supply chain. The improved neural network provides new ideas for the research of sensor vegetable greenhouses and agricultural product supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Facing environmental protection constraints, research on China’s coal security should analyze both supply and demand security. In this study, 19 criteria were selected for four subsystems (coal supply chain, coal market, economy and demographics, and social ecology) to construct an evaluation system for China‘s coal supply and demand security. Entropy and TOPSIS methods were used to evaluate coal security for 2002–2019. The obstacle factors affecting coal security for each subsystem were determined, and the grey model was used to predict the security and obstacle degree for each subsystem for 2020 and 2021. The results indicate that (1) China’s coal supply and use safety level in the period 2002–2019 was below a relatively safe level, i.e., at a safe early warning level during the period 2010–2014 and at a general safety level in the remaining years. (2) The basic coal reserves, the reserve-production ratio of the basic reserves, the balance of social coal stocks at the beginning and the end of the year, and the proportion of coal imports to consumption, urbanization rate, carbon dioxide emissions, and coal consumption in thermal power generation are the main obstacle factors that affect the safety of coal supply and use in China. (3) The obstacle degree of the coal production and supply evaluation subsystem is higher than that of the other three sub-systems, and the overall change trend during the study period showed a downward trend at first, followed by an upward trend.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>All over the world, the concept of Supply Chain Finance has emerged through the globalization of trade. The common sense within a supply chain is that suppliers are trying to receive their payments as early as possible while buyers are increasing their payment terms. SCF attempts to cope with this problem and creates opportunities for all parties creating a ‘win–win’ situation for both buyer and supplier by giving the buyer the opportunity to extend payment terms and pay the supplier in advance. This process allows all parties to free up operating working capital and provide financing in favor of the supplier. With the development of Supply Chain Management, two approaches gained the most recognition; Working Capital Management and Supply Chain Finance. Both are considered drivers for a financially stable supply chain. A Supply Chain. This thesis aims to provide a single definition by reviewing the theory of Supply Chain Finance and provide the reader with an implementation checklist and its benefits of it. The theory will then be backed up by expert interviews.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Heat supply, which is one of the most important areas of housing and communal services in our country, is in critical condition, as evidenced by the increase in the number of accidents on heating networks and an increase in heat loss over the past 25 years. The current situation necessitates the modernization of the sphere under consideration, which should be associated with the introduction of modern technologies and innovations in the activities of heat supply. In addition, a number of researchers note that currently there is a change in the energy system based on the partial replacement of existing energy sources towards energy-efficient devices, which, on the one hand, allow meeting growing energy needs, and, on the other hand, reduce the negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it is proposed to consider the modernization and innovative development of heat supply, including in the context of compliance with environmental safety properties. It is determined that the subject of heat supply, which should take responsibility for the implementation of the vector of its innovative development in a certain territory, should be unified heat supply organizations, fixed by legislation as a single center of responsibility, modernization and technological development of heat supply. In this regard, the purpose of the study is to consider the theoretical aspects of the innovative development of unified heat supply organizations in the conditions of transition to a new energy system.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study was the works of Russian and foreign authors on the issues of innovative development of economic systems, as well as the work of researchers proving the relationship of cyclical economic growth with innovative development. The study used methods of analysis and synthesis, as well as the method of comparative estimates.&#x0D;\nResults. The study of approaches to the innovative development of economic systems allowed us to conclude that, despite the crisis phenomena that are natural in their cyclicity, the decline in the development of these systems is overcome with greater speed in cases of innovation in the system, which, according to the author, should be reflected in practice in the mo­dernization of heat supply, in particular, through the innovative development of unified heat supply organizations.&#x0D;\nConclusions. In the conditions of changing energy structure, the innovative development of unified heat supply organizations should be considered not only from the standpoint of increasing the efficiency of heat supply in Russia, but also from the standpoint of increasing its energy efficiency and minimizing the negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>",

Many studies in determining groundwater recharge areas with a combination of Geographic Information System and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis have been carried out. The development of studies over the last ten years is reviewed in this paper using the PRISMA systematic review method to find out the study's progress. A total of 31 studies were found in the previous ten years based on the review results. Information about the country of origin of the study, dominant geology, climatic conditions, criteria used, decision-making and weighting methods, and the validation process for each study were extracted. The results show 12 countries researching this topic, with five dominant geological classes and nine classes of climatic conditions, and 33 criteria are used in the 2011–2021 range with eight dominant criteria used. Four decision rules and the weighted method are used, and a validation process is commonly used with well data. From systematic review and meta-analysis, we conclude: India has become the country that has most researched this topic. Hard-rock-class geology is dominant and arid and semi-arid climate conditions have become the main focus of studies. The variability of criteria is up to 33 with 18 criteria still used only once in each study, and eight dominant criteria have been used. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multiple Influence Factor (MIF) have become the most-used methods for assigned weight, and Frequency Ratio (FR) is the newest method for assigned weight. Lithology has the highest weight compared with the other seven dominant criteria, and well data has become the most common data for verification of groundwater recharge.</jats:p>",

While most of the published work about ferrate investigated the treatment performance by ferrate alone, new applications of ferrate expand to the synergistic application of ferrate with other techniques such as membrane separation, sulphur-based chemical use, UV radiation, ozonation, acidification, and other chemical additives. This paper aims to review and explore the treatment performance and reaction mechanisms associated with synergistic applications of ferrate. The main objective of this study is to conduct case studies on the synergistic application of ferrate with other water processes. It was found that the efficiency of water treatment increased significantly by the synergistic application of ferrate, and this is attributed to the alleviation of membrane fouling, the activating the formation of more radical oxidative species, enhanced coagulation, and the potential improvement of micropollutants’ biodegradability. Therefore, the stated ferrate technology holds high potential for improving the efficiency of water treatment and other environmental remediation processes. Further studies are required to explore a more feasible combination of ferrate with other techniques and expand the understanding of the working mechanisms of the known synergistic applications of ferrate.</jats:p>"

The respondents were garments-manufacturing industry workers working in three hot spots known as towns of Savar and Ashulia (Dhaka District) and Gazipur Sadar (Gazipur District). The survey was conducted between November and December, 2019. This research study finds that seven factors significantly influence work-satisfaction of garment workers in Bangladesh. Among these, four are related to the non-pecuniary factors: supervisory treatment of the workers, working environment, hygienic canteen facility, and medical facility. The three other factors, namely, the amount of salary, timely payment of salary and increment policy for the workers, play a significant part in workers’ satisfaction. This study helps in assessing the opinions of the workers about their work-satisfaction as well as policy planning for the development of the garments-manufacturing industry. Also, this study will add value to the setting of South Asian developing countries and industries because of the similar socio-economic environment to Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

The random activity of the sun is taken into account in the production of water due to the desalination of salt water. A balance equation is derived regarding the cases of company losses when the region's needs for drinking water are not met and regarding the total cost of the system, with the help of which the necessary dependence on the level of probability is subsequently obtained. To which the dichotomy method is then applied to calculate the probability measure. To make sure that the solution is unique, the function is examined for monotonicity with respect to the probability level. Further, to estimate the confidence probability, the problem is solved for average values, where the system cost is estimated and the probability of fulfilling the constraints is calculated. To solve the problem, a confidence method is used, with the help of which the original stochastic poblem is reduced to a linear programming problem. The resulting solution is improved by varying the radius of the confidence ball. One of the possible ways to choose the level of confidence based on the economic balance between the cost of the operation of the water supply system as a whole and the emergency delivery of fresh water is proposed. The choice of the confidence level is made using the initial approximation, which is obtained by solving the problem for average values. An assessment of the reliability of the system used was obtained and a program was implemented to solve this problem.</jats:p>",

Monoterpenes accumulation inducing by nutrient status under rhizobacteria and organic manure supply in Cymbopogon nardus. Biodiversitas 23: 4055-4063. The quality type of Cymbopogon nardus in Indonesia is called as Java Citronella Oil. One of the oil components determining the quality of C. nardus is citronellal content as well-known monoterpenes. The citronellal component in C. nardus is obtained through the redistillation process in leaves. This study aims to obtain citronellal content, organic matter, and carbon which are affected by dosage of fertilizer on C. nardus. In the overall, the citronellal component of plants without PGPR (P0) treatment at all levels of organic manure supply is 10% higher than those treated rhizobacteria (P20). The final content of carbon and organic matter in respectively (2,25%) and (3,08%) leaves of plant (P0) at K10, K20, K25, K30 is 20% higher than those treated with P20. This might be caused by the carbon that is distributed to the vegetative part during the fast-growth phase, by contrast, the component of citronellal was reduced. The growth rate of C. nardus depends on the accumulation of dry weight at 5 and 6 MAP, which increases significantly with organic manure treatment of K30 and supply of rhizobacteria (P20), which had nutrient status 1,362% nitrogen, 0,194% phosphorus, 0,882 % potassium in leaf following by citronellal and citronellol.</jats:p>"

These traditional design principles are being challenged as supply chains around the globe struggle to bounce back from an array of recent disruptions. This brings up the longstanding battle between profit driven efficiency goals and redundancy efforts that support demand in times of need. Supply chain design guidelines that address resilience thus require a balanced approach between efficiency and redundancy, one that presents flexibility in a way that acknowledges profit requirements. Ecologists have used Ecological Network Analysis to reveal a unique balance of pathway efficiency and redundancy characteristic of biological ecosystems. This balance results in efficient steady-state operations and survival despite unexpected disruptions. Supply chain networks are here evaluated using the same ecological analysis, providing quantitative design guidelines for achieving an ecologically similar system-level resilience. This study builds on past bio-inspired supply chain work to simulate profit-based supply chain performance during disruptions from an ecological perspective. Significant insights include that the validity of ecologically inspired supply chain design is contingent on the supply chain’s properties and that under the right conditions, the ecological balance of efficiency and redundancy can vastly improve the performance of supply chains during disruptions.</jats:p>",

Companies, with regard to their size and industry, are not fully digitalized and this is because their focus usually lays on their main activity line and less on the rest of the processes involving supply chain management. Digitalization is adopted differently and most companies face different problems in adopting and implementing new technology. Based on a semi-structured interview with in-depth questions, this paper investigates the digitalization status of selected firms’ supply chain management systems. Results aim to understand the future trends in the supply chain in Romania and identify some best practices with practical relevance for managers. The interviewed managers managed to bring up the digitalization state of their companies supply chain practices, what are the main barriers they need to overcome to remain competitive and also how they manage change within the employees ranks. The study identified within different industries that supply chain practices are partially digitalized and require constant development and improvement. Based on the discussions revealed by our study, professionals and academics can further explore what the implementation of cutting edge or disruptive technology involves for supply chain management in the broad context of digital transformation.</jats:p>",

In response to the crisis, clinicians, policy makers and people who use drugs have been seeking ways to prevent the worst harms of unregulated opioid use. One prominent idea is safe supply. One form of safe supply enlists clinicians to prescribe opioids so that people have access to drugs of known composition and strength. In this paper, we assess the ethical case for clinicians providing this service. As we describe, there is much that is unknown about safe supply. However, given the seriousness of the overdose death epidemic and the current limited evidence for safe supply’s efficacy, we argue that it is ethically permissible for clinicians to begin prescribing opioids for some select patients.</jats:p>",

Food supply chains have shown considerable resilience in the face of such stress. Monitoring of the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that the effects of COVID-19 on food supply, demand and access are interlinked processes and have a complex impact on food systems. In addition, high-value food supply chains in developed countries are even more complex, so countries need to respond quickly to restore them and also develop mechanisms that balance business and public interests and protect farmers and food business workers during future potential pandemic crises. The research aims to identify the main demand and supply side factors that affect the resilience of local and global food supply chains during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as assess the resilience of the supply chain for arable crops during the COVID-19 crisis in Latvia, identifying the main risk factors. The research found that arable crop farmers were relatively less affected by the COVID-19 crisis than other agricultural employees. The impact of the crisis was larger on the crop processing industry than on the other industries, and the main risk factors related to changes in demand and the industry’s dependence on imported raw materials and the successful operation of export markets. Based on an in-depth risk analysis, the research developed recommendations for policy makers and actors in the agri-food chain that would improve the resilience of local (domestic) participants of the arable crop food supply chain in Latvia.</jats:p>",

The advantages of the SCSA (such as its convenient operation, heuristic searching, etc.) make it easy to find an optimal solution and maintain a wide searching range. However, the SCSA also has some drawbacks, such as long searching time, and the ease of falling on a local optimum. In order to solve the problems existing with SCSA, in this paper, an improved standard cuckoo search algorithm (ISCSA) was studied, which includes chaotic initialization and a Gaussian disturbance algorithm. As a case study, taking economic, social and ecological benefits as the objective function, multi-objective water resources optimal allocation models were constructed in Xianxiang Region, China. The ISCSA was applied to solve the water allocation models and a multi-objective optimal water supply scheme for Xinxiang region was obtained. Water resources optimal allocation schemes for the planning level year (2025) for 12 water supply sub-regions were predicted. A desirable eco-environment and other benefits were achieved using the studied methods. The results show that the ISCSA has obvious advantages in the solution of water resources optimal allocation and planning.</jats:p>",

Current trends of «fast track surgery» give rise to development of new safe techniques of the thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the purpose of which is to minimize the level of postoperative complications, such as vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism, bleeding. In this regard, it is important for the endocrine surgeon to save «dry operating field», which contributes to the clear visualization of such «thin» structures as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid glands. Therefore, the key issue of this surgery is to understand the anatomical and topographic features of the blood supply to the internal neck organs (a complex of neck organs consisting of the thyroid and parathyroid glands, larynx, trachea, esophagus).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>AIM</jats:bold>. To determine the main sources of arterial blood supply of the internal neck organs and their anatomical, topographic features.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>MATERIALS AND METHODS</jats:bold>. The computed tomography protocols of cervical branches of brachiocephalic arteries were analysed in the study. The thickness of the reconstructed sections in the axial, frontal and sagittal planes was 0.35±0.05 mm. The fact of blood supply was confirmed by the anatomical close of the arterial structure to the internal organ and the presence of intramural arterial branches.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>. The course of all cervical branches of the subclavian and common carotid artery was traced among 42 patients. It is noted, that only the inferior, superior thyroid arteries and thyroid ima artery supply internal neck organs with the blood. At the same time, the superior thyroid artery was visualized in all angiograms. However, the inferior thyroid artery was absent in 2.4% of cases. The thyroid ima artery was rarely detected (in 4.8% of patients). In 73.2% of cases, the inferior thyroid artery was detected high at the upper third level of the thyroid lobe and then had a descending course. In 23.2% of cases, the artery was formed at the middle third level of the thyroid lobe and was directed horizontally to the gland. Only in 3.6% of cases, the ascending course was determined in the vessel. The inferior thyroid artery was located on the posterior surface of the thyroid lobe, where it formed glandular branches. On the contrary, the branches of the superior thyroid artery were located mainly along the anterolateral surface of the thyroid gland. The average thickness of the inferior thyroid artery was 2.1±0.5 mm, and the superior thyroid artery was 1.6± 0.7 mm.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>. According to the study, arterial blood supply to the internal neck organs is provided mainly by the inferior and superior thyroid arteries. At the same time, the trunk of the inferior thyroid artery is larger than the superior thyroid artery (p=0.032). The inferior thyroid artery forms branches along the posterior surface of the thyroid lobe and from a topographic point of view it is the main source of blood supply to the parathyroid glands. In most cases, the inferior thyroid artery has a descending course, is directed along the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and forms an X-shaped intersection with the recurrent laryngeal nerve.</jats:p>"

Yet, there remains a dearth of knowledge on the abundance and location of parking infrastructure. The extent and location of parking supply, including on-street and off-street spaces, are estimated for the nine-county Bay Area by creating a federated database that joins land use, transportation, parcel, building, and parking code layers to estimate the number and characteristics of parking spaces at the census block scale. This bottom-up parking space inventory results in an estimated 15 million parking spaces in the region: 8.6 million on-street and 6.4 million off-street. Residential parking dominates the share of supply at 70%, followed by commercial at 9.4%. Space density is greatest in downtown San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose—largely attributed to high-rise structures. On-street parking is dominant in the North Bay, commanding 78% of total parking in Napa, 75% in Solano, 68% in Sonoma, and 67% in Marin County. Parking area constitutes 7.9% of the total incorporated area. Notably, when compared to other southwest cities (Phoenix Metropolitan Area and Los Angeles County), the Bay Area parking supply appears better utilized considering spaces per person, per car, and per job. The density and quantity of parking spaces in the Bay Area are critical insights toward developing targeted policies that encourage active mobility and support affordable housing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this research, a hybrid integrated topology that would work very well for applications involving distribution generation has been suggested. The Photovoltaic and Fuel Cell source are used to power the hybrid integrated topology's power supply. Photovoltaic source is utilized as the main power and runs very near to its Maximum Power Point, while the fuel cell section serves merely as a DC supply and feeds just the power that is needed to make up the difference. The integrated approach improves the overall power level that is supplied because of the presence of the fuel cell in parallel with the photovoltaic source. This may be achieved by smoothing out the voltage stress that are brought by the photovoltaic system's output. Another important characteristic is that the load may be fuelled by photovoltaic energy in any quantity, even if that quantity is relatively low. This is a feasible regardless of the size of the photovoltaic system. In addition, excess power may be sent to the electrolysis load, which results in the source of energy being used in the most effective manner possible. When converting voltages, a Hybrid Cascaded Multilevel Inverter (HCMI) topology is preferred over a conventional three phase inverter because it has the advantages of a gradual decrease in switching losses, a low total harmonic distortion, and a minimum power loss. This in comparison to the conventional three phase inverter, has none of these advantages. In addition to that, the voltages might be converted in a more effective way using this design. The suggested system has a number of desirable qualities, and the most notable are its low operational costs, its user-friendly layout, and its high level of durability.</jats:p>"

Through the systematic review of the relevant literature, three dimensions of trust, i.e., the trustor–trustee perspective, forms of trust, and time orientation, are investigated. Our findings show that, first, there are three pairs of trustors and trustees involved in blockchain implementation: (a) the user and the blockchain, (b) two supply chain partners, and (c) the consumer/public and a supply chain unit. Second, the two forms of trust, namely cognition-based and institution-based trust, are likely to be enhanced by blockchain execution, while affect-based trust may not be directly impacted by the technology. Third, the presence of blockchain technology would facilitate swift trust-building between unknown supply chain partners under specific circumstances. Moreover, we also find contradicting assertions among scholars on the implications of blockchain for trust in supply chains. While some studies pointed out that blockchain will enable a trustless trusted scheme, others expected the reinforcement of interorganizational trust. To test these assertions, we develop the blockchain-entrusted supply chain models to present the three-step process of how trust is developed through the blockchain and diffused to supply chain partners and external stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Via the application of the Ghoshian Supply-Driven Model, this study presents the first highly disaggregated input (supply) multiplier estimates for the Maltese economy based on the 2010 and 2015 Symmetric Input-Output Tables. This study also includes a comparative analysis between the years 2010 and 2015 to assess changes in the input (supply) multipliers ranking across economic sectors. Based on the 2015 Symmetric Input-Output Table, potential output is mostly increased following the additional allocation of primary inputs to the Manufacturing of other non-metallic mineral products sector following the highest input (supply) multiplier estimate, keeping all else constant. Furthermore, based on the 2010 Symmetric Input-Output Table, the Advertising and market research sector registered the highest input (supply) multiplier. The input (supply) multipliers are subject to the traditional input-output framework and the supply-side modelling assumptions. However, they do provide estimates on the potential change in economy-wide output following exogenous primary input shocks in every sector. In other words, the input (supply) multipliers provide policy makers a guide in which economic sector it is most beneficial to allocate primary inputs, such as labour supply, with the aim of supporting economic growth. The derived input (supply) multipliers may be utilised to aid in the formation of industry specific labour market policies with the aim of supporting overall economic expansion.</jats:p>"

A multi-case study approach is employed based on seven apparel manufactures in Sri Lanka. Cross-case analysis highlights the water, energy, earth conservative practices followed by apparel companies. A key factor identified that has not been highlighted in the literature is green management orientation initiatives in the supply chain which intensifies the development of environmental sustainability. There is a knowledge gap in the existing supply chain literature, especially on sustainable practices followed by manufacturing industries. This study adds to the literature on green supply chain management by identifying the effects of Green Management Orientation (GMO) practices. The concept of green initiatives for apparel manufacturers is discussed. The factors that contribute to green sustainability development are zero land filling, rain water harvesting, sludge drying, reduce CO2 omission and make polyester yarn from recycling pet bottles. Further, three main themes are developed on what are factors affect to the green management orientation involvement in the supply chain. This paper responds recent calls for greater scrutiny of why and how firms decouple with green practices and supports the development of the literature specially on environment sustainability.

Therefore, indicators for sustainability development in pharmaceutical industries therefore must cover all three dimensions of sustainability. The traditional supply chain was more about reducing costs and maximizing revenue and profit. Now the corporate goal is also about considering the environmental and social impact of their products and services journey through the entire value chain — from plan to source, to make, to deliver, to the service domain. Sustainability as part of corporate responsibilities is now mandatory to be mentioned as part of the broader commitment to safeguarding the planet. This multiple qualitative case study aimed to investigate the role of sustainability in the efficient pharmaceutical supply chain. Sustainability is also the key driver for the long-term growth of a pharmaceutical company. The study involved interviewing various pharmaceutical managers with proven strategies for implementing sustainability-related strategies. The theory of constraint was used as the conceptual framework for this qualitative multiple case study. Data from interviews and supporting documents were analyzed using data triangulation to discover themes. Three main themes emerged from data analysis: (a) known or unknown constraints, (b) business operational model change, and (c) training and building sustainability capability. Seven key strategies were developed pertain to these three themes. These themes were identified based on interview data inputs and documentation provided by participants. Identified themes and strategies are summarized in the system model. Researchers and industry leaders can utilize themes and strategies to identify constraints, risks, and issues in the current system and work towards a sustainable supply chain integrated ecosystem.</jats:p>"

Successful crop production implies an adequate supply of high-quality irrigation water, among other factors. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the suitability of spring-fed streamwater for irrigation use and evaluate hydrogeochemical processes that regulate streamwater chemistry at the Manthong village in Kanglung, Bhutan. The water samples were analyzed for temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, total dissolved solute (TDS) and major ions. Piper and Durov diagrams indicated that most samples are of the intermediate type and simple dissolution or linear mixing is the primary hydrochemical process regulating streamwater chemistry. All the measured physicochemical parameters were within the acceptable thresholds of the FAO guidelines recommended for agricultural use. Analytical results of the streamwater water quality indices, including EC, %Na, residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), Kelley's ratio (KR) and permeability index (PI), revealed its suitability for irrigation use except for magnesium hazard (MH). The Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) results confirmed that the WS-1 has no restriction as irrigation water; however, WS-2 falls under the high-restriction category. The findings of this study will serve as the baseline data and guide irrigation water management and sustainable irrigation development in the region.</jats:p>",

It is experimentally established that the bound water in the deposit significantly exceeds the mineral component (chemical iron) for any waters with the different levels of iron oxidation. The deposit dehydration takes place at its boundary with the liquid phase. As a result, ferrous iron is gradually oxidized and ferric iron transforms from hydroxide forms to oxide forms, which leads to a decrease in the deposit volume and a increase in its density and strength. Further, the coefficient of the deposit hydrodynamic stability is proposed to use to take into account changes in the properties of the deposit that accumulates in the granular medium. It is experimentally determined that the iron amount remaining in the medium after backwashing increases simultaneously with the deposit's age. It will lead to a gradual reduction of the operational dirt capacity of the granular medium and a need to have measures of the filtration properties restoration or to replace the filter medium entirely.</jats:p>",

After that, the authors designed the flow chart of crude oil standard curve, extracted organic phase, determined the residual oil composition in the culture medium, and calculated the degradation rate of mixed bacteria to crude oil. By studying the degradation mechanism of aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi, the degradation products were confirmed and the treatment of oil pollution on the water surface was carried out.

At present, the power supply in the production preparation area of most nuclear plants is mostly purchased electricity. There is a big difference between the price of electricity purchased from external power grid and the cost of power generation from nuclear plant. Therefore, if the production preparation area of the nuclear power plant power consumption is changed to power supply by itself (Auxiliary power), it will make a great contribution to energy saving and power saving, cost reduction and efficiency promotion. There is no study on the efficiency promotion of nuclear power generating units at home. This study mainly focuses on the project of power supply migration in production preparation area of nuclear power plant. This study is carried out from four aspects: transformer capacity, bus voltage drop of 6.6kV, capacitive current, and economy.

This competition based on e-commerce technology has changed the traditional supply chain model and improved the operation efficiency of the supply chain. However, with the use of e-commerce technology, the supply and demand relationship between e-commerce enterprises has become extremely complicated. The original risk management system in the past has long been unable to adapt to the development needs of e-commerce enterprises in the new era. In view of this, it has far-reaching practical significance to actively carry out research on supply chain risk management for e-commerce enterprises, especially for B2C enterprises. In this research, on the premise of some previous theoretical and practical results, a B2C enterprise supply chain risk identification model is established by means of the research on SCOR, namely, the supply chain operation mode, combined with the characteristics of the B2C enterprise supply chain. The comprehensive evaluation method is used to evaluate the supply chain risk. Finally, an empirical study is carried out with J Company, which represents the B2C enterprise, as an example, which proves the applicability and reliability of this model. The results of this study have a certain reference value for the identification and control of B2C enterprise supply chain risks and also an inspiration for future research.</jats:p>",

The first objective function is related to profit maximization, the second objective function is to minimize delivery time, and the third objective function is to reduce lost business days. Moreover, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) have been applied to optimize the proposed model. The research results show that the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm can provide a complete set of Pareto solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

Robust Pareto optimal solutions are obtained using a lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff optimization approach of the bi-objective model.

This study analyses a unique dataset of factory audits matched with a survey of worker turnover rates from 622 factories in 28 countries supplying a large global apparel retailer. The results show that violations of the retailer's codes of conduct for suppliers are generally related to turnover, but that workers ‘vote with their feet’ primarily for violations of wages and benefits, relative to violations of other code provisions such as environment protection and safety standards. This ‘means‐ends’ decoupling between factory practices and worker preferences implies that global firms need to incorporate the livelihood logic that underlies workers' turnover decisions while implementing their private regulation programmes.</jats:p>",

One of the most problematic areas is the technology for choosing energy-efficient power supply schemes for railway traction networks in real time. The methods of forming and transforming graphs of complex schemes of traction and external power supply systems and building expert control systems for the implementation of energy-saving technologies of electrified railways were further developed in the work.\nIn the course of the study, to increase the efficiency of simulation modeling of electric traction networks, the statistical characteristics of the loads of feeders that supply the final boundary sections, stations, depot access tracks, railway junctions and idle voltages on the traction substation tires were obtained. Methods of calculation and modeling of traction power supply have been developed, which take into account the inseparable relationship with power systems and allow choosing rational modes with minimal power flows and energy losses. Proposed methods of managing the modes of operation of the traction power supply system based on a vague description of their states and an expert system that allow solving new problems. Including, the choice of energy-saving power supply schemes in the case of power flows, economic modes of network operation in case of intensification of the transportation process. Thanks to this, ways of reducing power consumption and minimizing energy losses of traction power supply systems are proposed, which allow minimizing power flows and power losses by adjusting load flow parameters and voltage levels of traction substations. And also to increase the energy efficiency of electrified railway lines.\nThe technique of technical and economic feasibility of power supply schemes of traction networks and evaluation of the possibility of switching to cantilever or loop power supply schemes with parallel connection points has been developed. The implemented recommendations save about 25 thousand kWh per 1 km of two-track section.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s business environment, data analytics capability has gained popularity among organizations as a source of competitive advantage. Furthermore, due to the current business outsourcing, supply chain management is known to be an extremely challenging task. Most previous studies focused on the relationship between data analytics capability and competitive advantage regardless of the role of organizational characteristics, particularly supply chain resilience. This paper aimed to assess the impact of data analytics capability on competitive advantage in the textile industry concerning the mediating role of supply chain resilience and organizational flexibility. To this end, a new conceptual model was developed to investigate the relationships and partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied for analysis. The population of this study comprised 450 qualified persons and four well-known brands of sleep products. In addition, a pilot survey was conducted with 30 respondents before the questionnaire was used for the final survey. Based on the results, data analytics capability positively affected competitive advantage, supply chain resilience, and organizational flexibility. Additionally, supply chain resilience and organizational flexibility played mediating roles in the relationship between data analytics capability and competitive advantage. Finally, some management insights are presented that are of interest to top managers. However, the results of this study were limited to the area of the textile industry (sleeping goods manufacturers) in Iran in order to maintain the uniformity of the research constructs.</jats:p>"

It is noted that in 1914 traditional method of price regulation through the issuance of rates was used to resolve it. Starting from 1915, food committees and commissions began to be created in the structure of the local self-government institutions to prevent shortage of goods and speculative trade. They were entrusted with the organisation of the purchase of food and its distribution, the maintenance of food warehouses and the development of rates. To provide financial support for their activities, there were used funds from local budgets and credits received from banks under the guarantees of the treasury or from government institutions. However, local authorities could not solve the problem of food supply for the civilian population effectively due to the lack of a unified concept of food policy at the state level and the lack of coordination between the actions of central departments. To the greatest extent, it manifested itself in the organisation of food supplies from the central regions of the Russian Empire to the front-line provinces. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Empire, when determining the supply areas, did not coordinate the transportation plan with the War Ministry of the Russian Empire, which controlled the railways. The department also faced opposition from the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire. It contributed food shortages, speculation and rising prices. As a result in late 1916 – early 1917 in the Belarusian provinces, not occupied by German troops, the food crisis worsened and turned into one of the main factors of destabilisation of the internal situation, which led to the February Revolution and a change in the state system.</jats:p>"

Through research on these papers, we found that the current evaluation method for the water supply system seismic resilience is divided into two aspects: on the one hand, it’s based on the seismic performance of water supply system, where the system itself evaluates the resilience absorbs the earthquake resistance level. On the other hand, the assessment is based on the post-earthquake recovery ability of the water supply system, namely the recovery time, recovery degree, recovery path and the resilience level of resources input. Based on past seismic safety of the water supply system and research on post-earthquake recovery ability, the meaning of water supply system in seismic resilience should include two aspects of seismic safety and post-earthquake recovery ability. From using the seismic safety evaluation method also and post-earthquake recovery ability in two angles, this paper gives a comprehensive multiple evaluation index framework of the evaluation model and points out that water system earthquake state resilience evaluative criteria and the requirements of the current seismic code should match.</jats:p>",

This study calculated the supply of ecosystem services (ESS) in Jiangsu Province, China, in 2000, 2010, and 2020, and quantitatively evaluated the ecosystem service demand (ESD) in those years by considering land development intensity, population density, and economic conditions. The ‘coupling coordination degree and relative development degree’ (CDRD) model is introduced to explore the degree of coordination and change in the relationship of supply versus demand of ecosystem services, and then to reveal the impact of various factors on the spatial differentiation characteristics of the SDES. The results show that: 1) the ESS is high in the Taihu Lake Plain, the southwest of Huaihai area and the eastern coastal zone of Jiangsu Province, yet low in the northwest and middle of Huaihai area, and along the Yangtze River Plain. The overall distribution pattern of ESD and the coordinating degree of the SDES is high in the south and north of Jiangsu Province but low in the province’s middle. 2) The degree of coordination for the SDES increased from 0.371 to 0.415, and the relationship between supply and demand changed from one of moderate imbalance to one of basic coordination. The imbalance of supply and demand is mainly concentrated in the Lixiahe area, coastal plain area, and middle of the Huaihe River Basin, for which the predominant type is a moderate imbalance–demand lag. Meanwhile, the analysis of influencing factors shows that there is an obvious synergistic effect between different factors. The results of this research could contribute to sustainable ecosystem management and decision-making for the construction of ecological civilization in Jiangsu Province.</jats:p>"

In this regard, search for solutions which would provide energy saving with an increase of energy, commercial and ecological efficiency of modern heat supply systems is becoming vitally important today. One of them is the development and use of special types of energy including renewable energy sources, wind energy in particular. Accordingly, the paper presents one of the possible solutions to the heat supply problem which are directed at meeting the whole region’s heat demand through the joint use of wind power plants with a boiler room operating on fuel oil. The study assessed the efficiency of constructing of wind power plants with a total capacity of 1.7 MW for the heat supply needs of a settlement, which is located on the Barents Sea coast in Russia. The selected area is characterized by an average annual wind speed of 7.0 m/s and a long heating period (9–10 months a year). The assessment showed that the wind power plant construction is financially reasonable, as additional profit can be generated by the end of the wind power plants scheduled service life that make up the half of primary investments. The results obtained in the paper are expected to make up for the lack of information on the feasibility of wind power plants construction for the heat supply needs, which is very useful for other countries that have similar areas experiencing various heat supply difficulties.</jats:p>"

In order to coordinate the profits of channel members, a two-step pricing decision model is established. This research shows that using a two-step pricing decision model can make the retailer’s optimal promotion fees and the manufacturer’s optimal sales compensation fees the same as the centralized decision-making’s optimal values; however, the results are not good, because after the coordination, the retailer’s profits increase and the manufacturer’s profits decrease, and, as a consequence, the retailer needs to pay a fixed fee to the manufacturer within the validity of the contract, which is signed by both sides, to achieve a win–win situation for the channel members.</jats:p>"

This study aims to present a comparative analysis of three widely used ensemble techniques (averaging, bagging, and boosting) in groundwater spring potential mapping. Firstly, 12 spring-related factors and a total of 79 groundwater spring locations were collected and used as the dataset. Secondly, three typical ensemble models were adopted to predict groundwater spring potential, namely, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), random forest (RF), and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and four statistical indexes (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the root mean square error (RMSE)) were used to estimate the model's accuracy. The results indicate that the three models had a good predictive performance and that the AUC values of the GBDT, RF, and BMA were 0.88, 0.84, and 0.78, respectively. Furthermore, the GBDT had the best performance (accuracy = 0.89, sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.87, and RMSE = 0.33) in terms of the four indexes, followed by RF (accuracy = 0.87, sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.83, and RMSE = 0.36) and BMA (accuracy = 0.76, sensitivity = 0.87, specificity = 0.65, and RMSE = 0.49).

The conventional wisdom is that downward-sloping tax profiles avoid green paradox outcomes by reducing present extraction. This paper shows that accounting for subsidized reserves development can induce green paradox outcomes for downward-sloping income tax profiles. A theoretical model linking reserves development and extraction with climate change damages is developed to explore conditions for the weak and strong green paradox outcomes of higher present extraction and cumulative damages. We find that the weak green paradox arises under higher and flatter income tax profiles. The strong green paradox is an ambiguous outcome without subsidized reserves development. Quantitative examples demonstrate the effect of downward-sloping tax profiles on crude oil extraction and how the strong green paradox arises when delayed emissions are less relevant for damages.</jats:p>",

The river was treated using composite artificial floating island and improved biological contact oxidation processes as the core, supplemented by source control, substrate purification, and water ecosystem construction. The transparency, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) of the water body met the China Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard (GB3838-2002) V. The oxidation–reduction potential was remarkably improved and the black odor phenomenon was eliminated. The composite artificial floating island had the highest TP removal rate of 38.30%, while the improved biological contact oxidation process had the highest NH3-N removal rate of 43.08%. The process is effective in improving the quality of black odorous rivers and has high applicability; thus, the process provides a reference for the treatment of other black odorous water bodies.</jats:p>",

This strategic path and strategic decisions gained an environmental dimension under the name of green supply chain management and green supplier selection, and attracted great attention in both academic and corporate life. New strategies such as green principles and related environmental performance are imperative and very important for companies, with increasing awareness of environmental issues and increasing concerns for future generations and our world. In order to address the growing environmental concerns of various stakeholders, companies have focused on external partners in the supply chain. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of green supply chain practices on firm performance. To this end, a survey was conducted with the managers of 120 large-scale firms operating in Turkey in order to measure this effect. Explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlation analysis and multiple regression estimators were used in the empirical analysis. Since all items of the Green Supply Chain Applications Scale and Firm Performance Scale had factor loads (&gt;60), all items remained in the analysis. In DFA, item factor weight values with 3 sub-dimensions are in the range (0.73; 0.90). According to these results, the internal and external supply chain practices have a positive and significant effect on all the indicators of firm performance that are reduction of pollutants, reduction of green costs and firm competitiveness. Similarly, reduction of pollutants and reduction of green costs, two indicators of green performance, positively affect firm competitiveness.</jats:p>"

Public housing can be broadly divided into public rental housing and public sale housing. Public rental housing is divided into eight types: permanent rental housing, national rental housing, happy housing, and etc.. In addition, so-called public-private self-owned housing was introduced in 2021.\r\nKorea's public rental housing system has changed according to the policy regimes of governments on public rental housing, and with these changes, new types of public rental housing have been introduced and the supply of certain types of public rental housing has increased or decreased. And there were also changes in the name and legal basis of public rental housing.\r\nThe integrated public rental housing type was introduced in 2020 to unify the various types of public rental housing and simplify the occupancy qualifications. Follow-up measures are needed for the establishment of the integrated public rental housing type. Meanwhile, there are doubts about the effectiveness of so-called public-private self-owned housing, such as accumulated equity housing unit for sale and profit-sharing housing unit for sale, introduced in 2021. And until now, public housing was supplied by the State and LH Corporation, but now there is an opinion that the social housing supplied by local governments and social economy entities should be revitalized. However, due to the nature of social housing, social economy entities will experience financial difficulties just like LH Corporation, and these difficulties will eventually be resolved only with the support of the State or local governments. However, such support for social economic entities would be a burden to the State or local governments, and therefore, social consensus on such support should be preceded. In addition, social conflicts are occurring due to the supply of public housing, and social mix policies are being attempted to solve this problem, but another type of social conflict is occurring as a result. Ultimately, social conflicts caused by public housing can only be resolved when there is a social consensus on the overall public housing policy.</jats:p>",

Contamination of the aquatic ecosystem and unhygienic handling practices along the fish supply chain can lead to a contaminated fish. Consumption of raw or under cooked fish and fish products is a major source of fishborne infections in humans. Despite reports of fish contamination with foodborne pathogens in Ethiopia, information regarding the hygienic status of fish handling practices is limited. We assessed fish hygienic handling practices at production sites and along the fish supply chain in three towns in east Shewa zone of Oromia. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire interviews and personal observations. The study consisted of purposively selected respondents comprising of 50 fishermen, 10 retailers, 20 food establishments serving fish, and 120 consumers. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used to present the proportion of various actors along the fish production and supply chain and to compare the proportions of observations among the different categories respectively. We observed that the lakes were accessible to animals and exposed to chemical and microbial contaminations through rainwater run-off. Fish were processed under unhygienic practices like washing of filleted fish with lake water, indiscriminate processing at unhygienic landing sites, use of a single knife for processing all fish with infrequent washing and with no disinfection in between. Majority (70%; n = 10) of the retailers and all the food establishments transported fish in vehicles with no cold chain facilities. Good hygienic practices we observed were the use of refrigerators for storage in all retailers and 70% (n = 20) of the food establishments; 30% of retailers used vehicles with a cold chain facility for the transportation of fish. Over three-fourths (77%; n = 120) of the consumers preferred consuming raw fish; 80% of them lacked the knowledge of fishborne diseases. The study revealed a wide range of unhygienic handling practices along fish production and supply chain; lack of infrastructure for post-harvest fish handling and processing, lack of appropriate transportation facilities and presence of knowledge gaps regarding fish borne diseases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management decision-making study mainly based on the expected utility theory and most of the studies are obtaining the average values in the statistical sense. For Supply Chain (SC) decision-making individuals the statistical-based optimal profitability brings decision conflicts in the particular market within a specific period. Moreover, the small and medium outsourcing participants face unexpected outcomes which are the main cause of SCs disruption. This study proposes a contractual coordination model that maximizes the probability of a pre-determined Profit Target (PT). The purpose of this paper is to reduce the influence of demand uncertainty with the high risk of unexpected outcomes. We constructed the Revenue Sharing (RS) and buyback contract models within the SC participants’ PT conditions and then discussed the SC overall performance. We simulated and analyzed the coordination conditions and the decision-making preferences of SC participants under the two contracts. From the comparison, under the PT strategy, the retailer is more willing to adopt the RS contract rather than the buyback contract. But the SC upstream supplier's contract selection decision depends on the specific contract parameters. Finally, numerical results indicated the contract selection decisions with the given PT of both SC participants.</jats:p>",

The research methodology combines a case study design with a structured questionnaire-based survey involving the participating firms: suppliers\n of EXPO 2020. Based on the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, the case study design develops strategies to be implemented in the development, planning, sourcing, making, delivering, and return stages of EXPO operations and assesses the sustainability aspect of the event's supply\n chains. The survey results are obtained by applying the partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS SEM) and the analysis is performed using the SMARTPLS model to test for the quality criteria, bootstrapping, and consistency of the sustainability development model. The sustainability\n development model developed in this study may influence the supply chains supporting this mega-event to enhance the participating suppliers' sustainability performance. The study findings have implications for organizations that strive for excellence through innovation, by understanding the\n relationship between the SCOR model chapters and their environmental impacts as an outcome moderated by digitization of the processes. This study is the first to use the SMARTPLS model to stimulate the relationship between sustainability factors and environmental outcomes, mediated by sustainability.\n While EXPO 2020/21 developments are ongoing at the time of this writing, this study's findings could benefits stakeholders of the supply chain in the ecosystem of UAE and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.</jats:p>",

To mitigate this burden of freshwater demand and build a sustainable water management system, harvesting rainwater during the rainfall season is a viable option. Runoff estimation studies in the past are time-intensive as parameter estimation for an area is complex by the conventional method. In this study, the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad campus was selected as a pilot project to assess a methodology that uses Google Earth images for obtaining the runoff coefficients. This method is easy and consumes less time in runoff estimation. This was compared with the conventional method. Using the conventional method (Arc-GIS), the equivalent runoff coefficients for these catchments were found to be 0.2780, 0.3553, and 0.4111, respectively. The range of error (compared to the traditional method) in runoff obtained from the proposed method with a default k value (0.8) was found to be 8.16–13.55%, with an average value of 9.91%. However, with a slightly modified value of k (0.9), the errors were significantly reduced to 1.94–3.32%, with an average of 2.15%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an improvement plan for the cost management system of a military executive agency in the supply field. The military introduced an executive agency system to improve the efficiency of defense operations. As of 2022, 18 units, including the land, sea, and air general supply depots, are being operated as military executive agencies. The first step in improving management efficiency is establishing a cost management system. It is necessary to eliminate inefficient processes, redundant or unnecessary work, and cost information is an approach to improve work efficiency. Currently, military executive agencies manage costs based on arbitrary standards set by the cost manager of each institution instead of systematic standards. Consequently, cost management is superficial and has not led to cost reduction. Furthermore, because the cost management standards are inconsistent, it is impossible to use them for comparing and analyzing the cost information of each institution. In particular, it is recommended that cost information be synthesized and utilized without data omission by establishing a common standard according to the guidelines for calculating corporate logistics costs announced by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport and using the national defense-integrated financial information system. Finally, the application of data-based analytical procedures can improve the efficiency of military operating agencies by identifying abnormal areas and eliminating inefficient processes.</jats:p>"

But is this right? We start our answer by reviewing studies that look at risks to and from GSCs and at how GSCs have recovered from past shocks. We then look at whether GSCs are too risky, starting with business research on how firms approach the cost-resilience trade-off. We propose the risk-versus-reward framework from portfolio theory as a good way to evaluate whether anti-risk policy is justified. We then discuss how exposures to foreign shocks are measured and argue that exposure is higher than direct indicators imply. Finally, we consider the future of GSCs in light of current policy proposals and advancing technology before pointing to the rich menu of topics for future research on the risk-GSC nexus.</jats:p>",

The gridded dataset of daily rainfall for 120 years from 1901 to 2020 was obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and analysed using statistical results of mean rainfall, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, maximum seasonal rainfall, percent deviation of rainfall, number of rainy days, rainfall intensity, rainfall categorization, trend detection, and cross-correlation coefficients. The period was divided into three quad-decadal times (QDT) of 40 years each (i.e., 1901–1940: QDT1, 1941–1980: QDT2, and 1981–2020: QDT3). A general decrease in the number of rainfall events was observed in all the seasons except for a few MSDs of northwest India showing a rise throughout the pre-monsoon season in recent times (QDT3). Significant trends were detected using the ITA method in seasonal rainfall in nearly all the MSDs of India. Our findings are highlighting the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of seasonal rainfall dynamics at the MSDs level which will be useful for comprehending the rainfall dynamics as impacted by climate change and climate variability in India, and may further lead the policymakers and stakeholders for making the best use of available water resources.</jats:p>",

Water samples analyzed met the WHO drinking water quality standard except for turbidity and thermotolerant coliform in some samples. The Water Quality Index (WQI) values of the spring water ranged from 5.75 to 41.64, majority falling under excellent class demonstrating potability of springs tapped.

The scatter diagrams and molar ratios of major ions indicated silicate and carbonate weathering controlling the spring water chemistry. The piper diagram indicated that springs are predominantly Ca-Mg-Cl and Na-Cl types. Gibbs diagrams inferred that spring/stream chemistry is mainly controlled by rainwater followed by water-rock interaction. Statistical analyses indicated different sources of dissolved ions including carbonate and silicate weathering, atmospheric precipitation, dissolution of sulphate minerals, and oxidation of sulphides.</jats:p>",

For the long-term evaluation of this creative sector, numerous intricate sustainability components, such as environmental, social, and financial, are necessary. The study focuses on longterm sustainability considerations in the supply chain in the construction sector. This work aims to address this information and examine sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research in the construction sector in this manner. More than 95 publications were studied from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021 using both in-depth content analysis and bibliometric methodologies. Several issues of SSCM in construction have been found including environmental, economic and social patterns which are most commonly known as the triple bottom line, typically enhanced by artificial intelligence. Many challenges were discovered including inefficiencies in the logistics system and a shortage of funding, environmental issues in demolition procedures and difficulties in applying sustainability measures due to high skill, data, and time requirements. The article offers a broad list of potentials for improving the current situation in the construction sector by using various types of supply chains such as increasing investment in energy conservation and emission reduction technologies to drive sustainable development, establishing strong green supply chain relationships, and forming a Covid-19 financial support group for small construction companies among other things. The study’s findings suggested that due to the significance of long-term relationships between construction companies, suppliers and customers, smart technology could make it simpler to reach every supply chain link. After an exhaustive literature review 59 research questions were formulated for the future research. In the future, the importance of these questions could be determined using expert questionnaires and multi-criteria evaluation.</jats:p>",

The main approaches to determining the logistics potential are described, on the basis of which a methodology for assessing its use is proposed. The purpose of the article is to research the components of the potential of logistics infrastructure objects and develop a mathematical model for its assessment. The author's understanding of the logistics potential of the logistics infrastructure is based on an integrated vision of the potential. Such integration has the form of a three-dimensional model with a \"resources-abilities-competencies\" coordinate system. The resource plane of such a model reveals the phenomenon of transformation of opportunities into abilities. In turn, abilities through their disclosure, consolidation and renewal with the help of training are transformed into competences. The proposed mathematical model of assessing the integral potential of the logistics infrastructure of the enterprise is performed taking into account its life cycle. This approach ensures the objectivity of the assessment of the integral potential. This can provide an assessment of the potential in view of three components that provide directions for the formation and use of logistics infrastructure facilities: resourceful (assessment of material or energy intensity), organizational (efficiency of management, coordination, etc.) and functional (functional infrastructure components, blocks, etc.). Each of these components is characterized by a set of parameters, the assessment of which reflects their compliance with a certain stage of the life cycle of the object under study. The correct selection of a group of parameters is important. In particular, such a group of parameters can be: compliance as a complete set of necessary functions, operations, properties, etc.; excellence as a level of innovative development, informatization, digitization, etc.; usefulness as a level of specialization or versatility (capacity); relevance as a level of expediency, need for use, etc.; relevance as the possibility or suitability of being replaced by a similar means or resource. In this way, the integration of the potentials of individual elements of each direction of formation forms the overall potential of the logistics infrastructure object.</jats:p>"

In the United States, the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) database records the occurrence of a drinking water violation regulation in public water systems. A notable shortcoming of SDWIS is the lack of the contaminant concentration level about the allowable maximum contaminant threshold. In this study, we take advantage of both the SDWIS violation database and the contaminants sampling database at the state level to examine the drinking water quality of all kinds of drinking water systems in detail. We obtained sampling data (i.e., the concentration level of contaminants) of public water systems (PWSs) in Tennessee and explored the statistical distribution of contaminant concentration data in relation to the enforceable maximum regulatory contaminant level). We use both SDWIS violation records and actual concentrations of contaminants from the sampling data to study the factors that influence the drinking water quality of PWSs. We find that different types of violations were more frequent in (1) specific geological regions, (2) counties with PWSs that serve a larger population (10,000 to 100,000 people), and (3) places with abundant surface water, such as near a lake or major river. Additionally, the distribution of measured concentrations for many contaminants was not smooth but was punctuated by discontinuities at selected levels, such as at 50% of the maximum contaminant level. Such anomalies in the sampling data do not indicate violations, but more investigation is needed to determine the reasons behind the punctuated changes.</jats:p>"

This is in contrast to the most common responses to disruption emphasized in the extant resilience literature, in which restoration of a supply chain to its pre‐disruption state is typically the focus. Researching plastic responses is important because they differ greatly from restoration. A plastic response is a new way to operate, thus requiring implementation of major changes to the supply chain. Accordingly, a foundational premise is adopted to characterize a plastic response as (1) a significant redesign, (2) due to a pressing need, (3) requiring most or all of the following: acquisition of new skills, investment in new assets and leadership support, (4) a permanent new way to operate. Additionally, eight propositions are offered to serve as bases for further research. These relate to two fundamental issues: when are plastic responses most likely to be exercised and how to enable plastic responses. The propositions were developed through qualitative data analysis and informed by change management theory. The data were collected from in‐depth interviews with global corporations in a variety of industries. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are offered at the end.</jats:p>",

In this context, green supply chain management (GSCM) approaches are expanding globally. Based on institutional and sociotechnical systems theory, the conceptual model of this research highlights a mediation of two GSCM types, namely technological and behavioral practices, as well as the moderation of organizational pressure on institutional performance. The hypotheses were evaluated using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method, obtaining data from 563 Chinese firms. This study's categorization of technological and behavioral GSCM practices and results add to the literature on GSCM. The empirical findings indicate that the technological GSCM practices considerably affect behavioral practices. Moreover, GSCM technological and behavioral practices have a substantial effect on institutional performance. GSCM behavioral practices mediate the link between technological GSCM practices and institutional performance. The outcomes also reveal that organizational pressure moderates the association between GSCM technological GSCM practices and institutional performance. These results show that companies in emerging economies should prioritize the behavioral GSCM practices to successfully apply the technological GSCM practices to achieve compelling financial, social, and environmental performance. </jats:p>",

How suppliers from developing nations may accomplish sustainable development and competitive advantage goals has become a tough issue inside the multinational supply chain, particularly in the agri-food cold chain. Using an integrated theory-based perspective, this paper analyzes how sustainable logistics service providers’ supply chain cooperation (MSCC) might drive the sustainable transformation of suppliers in developing nations. Between 1 June 2020 and 15 January 2021, we gathered feedback from 215 Chinese vendors and analyzed and discussed possible models using structural equation modeling. This study demonstrates that the sustainable practices of logistics service providers are the foundation for influencing the collaboration of suppliers in developing nations with regard to sustainability. In addition, the five-stage transnational supply chain cooperation based on the theory of innovation diffusion is an efficient strategy for ensuring the sustainable development of suppliers in developing nations. This paper examines the theoretical framework at the forefront of multinational supply chain sustainability development. This presents the most recent experience and policy application for suppliers from emerging nations to acquire a competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Although water utilities, following the related legislative framework, monitor drinking water quality through samplings, the likelihood of detecting contaminants in consumers’ taps is low, depending on the scale of the monitoring programme. Additionally, even if the monitoring frequency is high, there is a time delay since sampling and analysis processes take some time. The selection of suitable locations for the installation of online water quality sensors is a hard task for a water utility due to the complexity of the water distribution system, the limitations of certain network junctions which are not easily accessible, and the computational burden involved. This topic has been extensively studied in recent years and sophisticated methods have been developed using optimization techniques. However, small water utilities do not have the means to implement such tools. This paper applies a methodology to identify the suitable junctions for the installation of online water quality sensors based on different objectives and under demand-driven conditions. This paper utilizes the hydraulic simulation model of a standard network to set up the water quality simulation model. A thorough analysis of various contamination scenarios takes place with different injection nodes and at different starting injection times for 24 h. The latter relates to the contaminant’s spread due to varying water demand. After a thorough analysis of 816 scenarios, a prioritized list of the most suitable nodes for the installation of the sensors is available for each optimization objective. Comparing the prioritized list of nodes achieved from each single or multi-objective function, the detection probability is almost the same. The analysis revealed that, due to varying water demand conditions, the ranking of the proposed nodes suitable for the installation of water quality monitoring sensors differs. Thus, varying hourly water demand should be part of analyses seeking to get reliable results.</jats:p>"

The answer lies in two methods by which coronavirus stifled economic activities. First, the spread of the virus encouraged social distancing which led to the shutdown of financial markets, corporate offices, businesses and events. Second, the exponential rate at which the virus was spreading, and the heightened uncertainty about how bad the situation could get, led to flight to safety in consumption and investment among consumers, investors and international trade partners. We focus on the period from the start of 2020 through March when the coronavirus began spreading into other countries and markets. We draw on real-world observations in assessing the restrictive measures, monetary policy measures, fiscal policy measures and the public health measures that were adopted during the period. We empirically examine the impact of social distancing policies on economic activities and stock market indices. We also empirically the effect of COVID infection cases and COVID deaths on macroeconomic performance during the 2020 to 2021 period. The findings reveal that the increasing number of lockdown days, monetary policy decisions and international travel restrictions severely affected the level of economic activities and the closing, opening, lowest and highest stock price of major stock market indices. We also find that the rising number of COVID cases and rising death cases led to a significant increase in global inflation rate, global unemployment rate, and global energy commodity index.</jats:p>",

Humanitarian organizations are always active in helping affected communities through effective humanitarian supply-chain management by providing humanitarian goods and services, which is crucial to aiding vulnerable people after a natural catastrophe. However, some factors cause significant difficulties in achieving feasible humanitarian supply-chain (HSC) management that eventually ends up as a disfunctional and ineffective system to support to the community in need. Therefore, a lack of standard logistics support complicates horizontal cooperation between humanitarian organizations at various stages, along with relief aid. The motive of the paper is to identify and understand the barriers of HSC during the disaster preparedness and immediate response phase, particularly for cyclones in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Through an extensive literature review and consultation with experts from different humanitarian organizations, 10 barriers were identified. To illustrate the structural relationships among the selected barriers, an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach with additional MICMAC (Matriced’ Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á unClassement) analysis is used for data analysis. This aids in evaluating relative dependencies and driving power among the selected barriers. Findings show that a lack of an integrated approach and coordination among government and other humanitarian stakeholders, the inefficacy of multilateral information sharing among them, and a shortage of experienced logisticians are the barriers with the highest driving powers in HSC. The findings of this study will help humanitarian experts, aid agencies who distribute humanitarian aid, and organizations, to set up a good supply chain for helping people in the coastal area of Bangladesh following cyclones.</jats:p>"

Block chain’s advanced features make it capable of providing a basis for complete traceability of drugs, from manufacturer to end consumer, and the ability to identify counterfeit-drug. This paper aims to address the issue of drug safety using Block chain and encrypted QR(quick response) code security. Manufacturer generates an encrypted QR (quick response) code for the details and attaches the transaction to the block chain system. If any participants want details of drugs, then public key must be shared by that participant to the manufacturer. Manufacturer will encrypt the QR code and will send back to the participant.

Following the existing problems detected with the help of a diagnostic, we will propose a new process design by integrating 4.0 technologies to modernize the company. For our case study, we treat the multinational SC of Automotive Wiring Equipment Morocco, where we will focus on the downstream part of the SC composed of the warehouse and the different stages of road and sea transport until the final delivery in Austria. Then, we will consider the opportunities offered by each country in terms of logistics competitiveness. In this research work, we will show how Lean VSM4.0 will contribute to sustainable development by integrating the three pillars economic, environmental, and social. With the Lean VSM 4.0 tool, all logistic processes will be visualized, from which improvements could be obtained, especially the optimization of the lead-time, the cost, the energy consumed, and the follow-up of the products during the whole SC while reducing accidents.</jats:p>"

This study proposes an improved multicycle integration method that can effectively determine the optimal number of suppliers under the premise of considering the risk of supply interruption and transaction costs that may be caused by various uncertain factors. The supply interruption risk is divided into two categories: “common risk event” and “individual risk event.” On the basis of balancing the transaction cost of the company’s choice of suppliers and the financial loss of supply interruption, quantitative analysis methods are used to determine the optimal number of suppliers for the company. The problem is analyzed, the corresponding model is given, and the influence of each parameter on the optimal number of suppliers is analyzed. From the perspective of stochastic uncertainty in both customer demand and supplier supply capacity, this study analyzes the optimization problem of enterprise purchase quantity allocation under the volume discount environment. The relaxation factor is somewhat adaptive because the particle swarm is continuously updated. Aiming at ordering cost, transaction cost, transportation cost, order delay quantity, and product quality, considering random demand constraints, supplier supply capacity constraints, and multisupplier multiproduct situations, we establish supplier selection in an environment of uncertain demand and supply capacity and dynamic relaxation approximation algorithm for order allocation. The research results show that the dynamic relaxation approximation algorithm can not only determine the optimal supplier but also determine the optimal procurement allocation for each supplier.</jats:p>",

It is discussed how to combine the site conditions of the nuclear power plant, the price of raw materials and the main cold-end equipment of the steam turbine, the cost of the main structures of the water supply and drainage system and the related annual operating costs, power generation income and other factors, to seek the optimal solution through economic and technical comparison of multiple schemes.

By comparing the cold end optimization results of the constant speed scheme of 1 machine with 2 pumps, the frequency conversion scheme of 1 machine with 2 pumps and the expansion unit system scheme of 1 machine with 2 pumps, the frequency conversion scheme of 1 machine with 2 pumps is superior in terms of technology and economy and has a great advantage for the northern site.

The main objective of this work is to design, build and evaluate the SMPS using flyback converter topology. In this work, a 555 timer was chosen as the pulse width modulator. The 555 timer was chosen because it is easily available, cheap and has the capability to produce stable pulse width modulation. The complete circuit of the SMPS consist of full bridge rectifier, smoothing capacitor, pulse width modulator, high frequency transformer and flyback converter. The complete SMPS circuit was firstly designed and simulated using Proteus software. After obtaining acceptable results from the simulation process, the hardware part of the project, soon follows. Next, the SMPS circuit was constructed on a breadbroad. Testing and measurements of important parameters such as the input and output voltages and duty cycle were carried out using digital oscilloscope and multi meter. Both simulation and experimental results have shown that the designed circuit can convert single 24 Vrms 50 Hz AC voltage input into a stable single 5±0.15 V DC outputs. This work also has shown that pulsed DC voltage with peak value of 3.8 V and frequency lower than 4 kHz is adequate in controlling the switching frequency of a MOSFET transistor, thus regulating the output voltage within the desired range. Further analysis also shows close correlation between the simulation and experimental results.</jats:p>",

As a key infrastructure of public services, access to clean and safe drinking water is an essential factor for local socio-economic development. Despite various national and international efforts, water supply is often not guaranteed, especially in rural areas of Africa. Although many water resources are theoretically available in these areas, bodies of water are often contaminated with dangerous pathogens and pollutants. As a result, people, often women and children, have to travel long distances to collect water from taps and are exposed to dangers such as physical violence and accidents on their way. In this article, we present a socio-economic case study for rural development. We describe a drinking water treatment plant with an annual capacity of 10,950 m3 on Kibumba Island in Lake Victoria (Tanzania). The plant is operated by a photovoltaic mini-grid system with second-life lithium-ion battery storage. We describe the planning, the installation, and the start of operation of the water treatment system. In addition, we estimate the water prices achievable with the proposed system and compare it to existing sources of drinking water on Kibumba Island. Assuming a useful life of 15 years, the installed drinking water system is cost-neutral for the community at a cost price of 0.70 EUR/m3, 22% less than any other source of clean water on Kibumba Island. Access to safe and clean drinking water is a major step forward for the local population. We investigate the socio-economic added value using social and economic key indicators like health, education, and income. Hence, this approach may serve as a role model for community-owned drinking water systems in sub-Saharan Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to develop a multi-objective second-generation-based socially responsible supply chain (SGB-SRSC) network design model that considers all dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and social. The dynamic nature of the biodiesel supply chain (SC) impairs the SGB-SRSC model decisions; thus, a grey-fuzzy solution approach is developed. Biodiesel is a promising renewable energy resource produced from a variety of easily accessible domestic wastes. For a swift transition towards commercially feasible biodiesel production, integrated optimization of the biodiesel SC system is critical. Using the latest social impact assessment tools, this study provides a decision-support system for developing a biodiesel SC network. A comprehensive computational analysis is performed on a case study to validate the proposed model. The results show that significant investment is required to achieve social well-being goals and secure decisions against uncertainty associated with SGB-SRSC model parameters. Further, it is observed that the expenses of biodiesel production and biodiesel plant installation accounted for a large portion of the overall SC cost. As a result, finding more cost-effective biodiesel production methods is critical to the industry’s economic viability. Regulators and policymakers involved in biodiesel production projects may find the framework useful in obtaining a compromise solution for socio-economic goals based on their preferences.</jats:p>"

The result showed that four-fifths of the total respondents were females (85.54%), two-thirds of the total respondents (68.68%) were less than 50 years and 91.56% of the total respondents had formal education. A total of 21 bird species had their body parts and products on sale in the different markets studied in the study area. Due to the belief and faith of the people, the respondents agreed that there were some bird species that are regarded as being sacred or forbidden and thus, the birds and their bird body parts are used and sold in traditional medicine to treat different ailments and for sacrificial activities of their clients. It was concluded that the existence of bird species cannot be over-emphasized because they are important in believed resources for curing specified types of ailments and sacrificial offerings in traditional medicine. It was recommended that since birds significantly contribute to the natural ecosystem, human health and nutrition, forest and wildlife conservation campaign should be strengthened.</jats:p>"

However, their implementation is more widely adopted and researched from the perspectives of larger retailers in developed economies outside of Africa, limiting the widespread applicability of their findings to stakeholders in developing countries such as South Africa.Aim: The study explored and proposed a decision support framework for the potential coordination of closed-loop supply chain strategies by small, medium and micro enterprise (SMME) fashion retailers in South Africa.Setting: This research study was conducted in South Africa with stakeholders in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Limpopo provinces.Methods: This descriptive, qualitative research approach used purposive sampling, in the form of judgment sampling, to select 14 participants. The interviews were then transcribed and transferred to Nvivo™ software to identify and analyse themes within the data.Results: The findings revealed that while some SMMEs would consider or were already considering adopting closed-loop strategies, various challenges and limitations existed related to the sizes of their businesses, their restricted relationships with supply chain stakeholders and their operation in an African developing country. A decision support framework was established, which considers this context and could aid in the implementation of circular strategies by such retailers.Conclusion: Despite resource limitations, opportunities exist for SMME retailers to adopt closed-loop supply chains and become globally competitive, following international focus on accountability and sustainable consumption. The decision support framework is suitable for such stakeholders to facilitate collaborative efforts towards achieving end-to-end sustainability.</jats:p>"

The Duriangkang reservoir was built from 1992 until 1995 as the first estuary dam in Indonesia and the largest reservoir in Batam city. These two reservoirs are the cascade reservoirs. The dam with an effective storage capacity of 107 million m3 works to fulfill the water needs with a capacity of 2,500 l/s. However, the Muka Kuning reservoir was finished in 1990, but it was newly turned in 1992. At the beginning, the Muka Kuning WTP had a water production capacity of 310 l/s, but the capacity was increased to 600 l/s in 2015 along with the increasing water need in Batam. This research intends to analyze the water balance in the Duriangkang-Muka Kuning cascade reservoirs and to investigate the potency of the Duriangkang reservoir that can support the water availability in the Muka Kuning. The methodology uses water balance simulation in the Duriangkang-Muka Kuning reservoir to analyze the potency of the Duriangkang reservoir that can be used to support the water availability in the Muka Kuning reservoir. The catchment area of the Duriangkang reservoir now consists of residences, society plantations, forestry areas, empty land, and industry, which can decrease the amount of water availability to be stored every year. The results of the water balance analysis indicate that the water availability of the Duriangkang reservoir is in surplus conditions throughout the year in the wet, normal, and dry year conditions. Therefore, the Duriangkang reservoir has the potency to support the water availability in the Muka Kuning reservoir.</jats:p>"

Two decision-making methods, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), were integrated to prioritize different sub-watersheds. The Rarhu watershed has an area of 630 km2 with an elevation ranging from 210 to 824 m. The NASA Digital Elevation Model (NASADEM) was used to extract drainage networks which were verified from Survey of India (SOI) toposheets. To prioritize 21 sub-watersheds using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, 11 morphometric parameters were selected from linear, areal, and relief parameters. The VIKOR method prioritized sub-watersheds using AHP criteria weights, which are classified into four priority levels ranging from very high to low. In addition, performing sensitivity analysis validated the robustness of the decision-making model. As per the analysis, Rarhu watershed was found to have an elongated shape and a highest 6th order stream with a dendritic pattern of streams. It is estimated that watershed degradation is around 36.17% in the study area, with very high priority needs for soil and water conservation measures. Using the results of the study, policymakers, watershed planners, watershed development programme, and soil and water conservation programme projects can identify vulnerable sub-watersheds that require urgent adaptation of soil and water management control measures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Indonesia merupakan negara agraris dimana pertanian memegang peranan penting pada perekonomian nasional. Untuk mengimbangi semakin pesatnya laju pertumbuhan penduduk di Indonesia, maka usaha pertanian yang maju perlu digalakkan kawasan pertanian secara holistic. Dalam upaya membangun pertanian Indonesia agar secara kualitas dan kuantitas produk pertanian dapat ditingkatkan maka perlu peran pemerintah dalam hal kebijakan pertanian guna pencapaian dan pemerataan swasembada pangan nasional. Pembangunan pertanian merupakan sektor yang diutamakan terkait dengan kesejahteraan petani. Hal ini dapat diupayakan dengan dua metode yaitu intensifikasi dan ekstensifikasi. Intensifikasi pertanian yaitu pengolahan lahan pertanian yang ada dengan sebaik-baiknya untuk meningkatkan hasil pertanian dengan menggunakan berbagai prasarana dan sarana produksi yang ada. Ekstensifikasi pertanian adalah usaha meningkatkan hasil pertanian dengan cara memperluas lahan pertanian baru. Ekstensifikasi dapat dilakukan dengan membuka hutan untuk lahan pertanian baru, mengelola semak belukar, tanah sekitar rawa-rawa untuk pertanian dan daerah pertanian lain yang belum dimanfatkan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menentukan rekomendasi strategi pengembangan rantai pasok komoditi padi di daerah penelitian. Pelaksanaan penelitian Rantai Nilai dilakasanakan pada bulan Juli s.d. September 2021 di 7 Daerah Irigasi (D.I) potensial di Kabupaten Jombang dalam lima kecamatan. Dalam upaya mencapai tujuan penelitian, kajian ini menggunakan kombinasi metode penelitian antara kuantitatif dan deskriptif kualitatif. Narasumber adalah petugas dan pihak-pihak yang terkait dengan aktivitas alur kegiatan rantai pasok dan rantai nilai serta penentuan strategi usaha tani. Metode analisis data juga dilakukan dengan menggunakan analisis kualitatif Analisa SWOT dan Fishbon sebagai pengembangannya. Teknik analisa data yang sesuai dengan penelitian di Dinas Pertanian ini adalah dengan Analisa SWOT yaitu metode menganalisa permasalahan dengan pengkajian tentang suatu konsep strategi dengan menentukan faktor kekuatan (Strenght), kelemahan (Weaknesses), peluang (Opportunities) dan ancaman (Threat) sehingga faktor tersebut dapat diidentifikasi berdasarkan strategi internal dan eksternal. Strategi yang perlu dilakukan adalah efisiensi usaha tani dari hulu sampai hilir, perluasan dan penguatan pasar luar daerah, penguatan sarana prasarana pada lembaga petani dan perbaikan kesuburan tanah untuk menjaga kelestarian alam. Selain itu kemitraan dengan palaku usaha pertanian lain untuk bersinergi juga diperlukan ditunjang dengan kemitraan dengan palaku usaha pertanian lain untuk bersinergi, mengembangkan pertanian ramah lingkungan berkelanjutan serta optimalisasi pemanfaatan potensi lokal.</jats:p>"

It is necessary to investigate the effects of environmental factors on river benthic diatoms. In this study, the benthic diatom assemblages, environment factors including physical–chemical factors, and altitude factors were intensively investigated in gradient tributaries of Taizi River, northeast China. The CCA method was used to explore the relationships between benthic diatom assemblages and environmental factors. The results demonstrated that the altitude, distance to river source, water temperature, TN, SS, average water depth, TP, and CODCr were the environmental factors that accounted for significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) portions of the total variance in species composition. These suggest that the diatom assemblage is a good indicator of environmental change, and it is not only sensitive to physical–chemical factors but also significantly sensitive to large-scale factors (e.g., altitude, distance to river source).</jats:p>",

Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide a promising inexpensive tool for reliable crop water consumption estimations compared to conventional field measurements. Having agricultural land fragmentation and mixed cropping systems in the Nile River Delta, traditional methods of estimating are seemingly challenging. The present study aims to improve agricultural water management at the meso scale using RS-based techniques. Four RS-based methods were employed to estimate in mixed cropping farms at the Nile River Delta. The adopted methods include: (i) the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), (ii) the Simplified Surface Energy Balance algorithm (SSEB), (iii) Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFLUX) product, and (iv) the crop coefficient () method. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed a significant difference between the employed RS-based techniques. During the winter season 2018–2019, the estimated varied from 331.33 mm/season to 389.34 mm/season, with an average of 358.76 mm/season. The irrigation efficiency was estimated to be about 55–63%, with an average of 59.55%. The study developed an algorithm to schedule the operation hours of irrigation pumps in the study area based on actual water requirements and pump capacity. The study highlights the relevance of RS methods and the importance of the equitable distribution of water in small farms to enhance water management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, the relationship between all kinds of things is constantly strengthened, and the regional restrictions on things are also constantly weakened, especially in the aspect of trade. In the past, people could only buy some basic goods in a relatively small area if they wanted to buy them in a relatively small area, but now the situation is very different. People’s dependence on traders is gradually decreasing; that is to say, the traditional advantages of traders are gradually losing. Particularly, in today’s fierce competition, survival of the fittest, and limited profits, the entire trade industry is facing a lot of impacts, not to mention the survival of traders relying on this industry. Therefore, traders must think of a new way to adapt to the characteristics of the new era, to continue to make profits and maintain their own survival. In fact, for the whole industry, this is also the most urgent problem to be solved. This study mainly explores the above problems and puts forward some feasible methods to solve the problems, hoping to cause some thinking of the industry personnel, so that they can modify and adjust their working mode. In addition, it should be emphasized that the mode of using Internet of things and machine learning to achieve the purpose of innovation is of great practical significance.</jats:p>",

Electrocoagulation–flotation (ECF) has shown promising performance in minimizing algal cells from water and dissolved AOM. This study aimed to investigate the effect of current density (CD) and pH on alumina (Al)-based ECF for removing MA cell and DBPs precursors from cyanobacteria-laden water. The performance of Al-based ECF was evaluated at various CD and pH conditions within 20 min. In addition, the total halogenated DBPs formation of the treated suspension after ECF was quantified. At pH 8, the ECF process with 5 mA/cm2 exhibits the most significant reductions in MA cell and soluble AOM, accounting for 97 and 56%, respectively. Additionally, the precursors of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloketones (HKs) can be effectively removed with flotation despite their significant release at EC. The tremendous reduction of humic acid-like (HAL) substances in extracellular organic matter (EOM) fraction by ECF leads to the minimized THMs formation potential. In summary, Al-based ECF at pH 8 is effective to remove cyanobacteria and minimize the precursors of regulated THMs along with an insignificant reduction in regulated haloacetic acids (HAAs) precursors.</jats:p>",

The maximum soil diesel content removal for tall fescue was by freshwater (54% (2018); 46% (2019)) and in the grass, the pea was by wastewater (44% (2018); 41% (2019)). A significant difference was observed in the amount of diesel removal by the plants at two levels of contamination, but the type of irrigation water had no significant effect. The plant growth decreased significantly by increased diesel in all treatments except D1.5 for tall fescue (2018) that led to better growth compared to the DC treatment. Diesel concentration had significant effects on plant parameters (dry weight, height, color, time of flowering, and podding), but the type of water had no similar impact.

The problem is represented through a stochastic bilevel program that allows the representation of the hierarchy between the producer (leader) and a wholesaler (follower). The producer decides planning and scheduling of the selective harvest for each homogeneous management zone into the resulting partition, and the wholesaler decides the amount to be acquired to satisfy demand requirements. At each decision level, a stochastic optimization model is proposed for representing the uncertainty in future crop yields, prices, and demands, using a finite set of scenarios. A reformulation of the bilevel model into a mixed‐integer linear program is provided using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions and replacing the nonlinear complementary constraints allowing for the introduction of auxiliary binary variables and a big‐<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>term. This model was applied in a case study for selective harvesting of grapes with data collected from a farm located in the south central zone of Chile. Our research shows valuable results of the proposed methodology from a set of instances representing the behavior of both decision makers under uncertainty.</jats:p>",

The influence of genotype, environment and crop management and the efficient use of resources during the production of raw material, tubers harvested for processing purposes, are delineated. It is shown that climate change affects performance and that consumers looking for quality and new products are hardly interested in the primary processes, nor are breeders and processors showing interest in consumer concerns. Crop performance is dependent on yield and quality (dry matter, sugars, tuber size and desired and undesired constituents). Factory performance relies on recovery, reuse of rejects and avoidance of wastes. Heatmaps drawn of classes of productivity and losses and their attributes reveal where gains are to be made on fields, farms and factories to improve efficiencies, reduce the impact on the environment, and opportunities for decarbonisation.</jats:p>",

A supply-side analysis of P supply chains and associated P emissions can provide insights into underlying economic activities and transitions responsible for human-induced P emissions. Taking the mainland China as the case, this study constructs time-series physical input-output tables to describe P supply chains during 1949–2012. Subsequently, it identifies critical products and influencing factors of P supply chains enabling P emissions to the environment (including air, land, and water) from the supply perspective. The results show that phosphate rock, an important initial supplier of P from natural environment to China’s P supply chain, was responsible for 86% of P emissions in 2012. Moreover, food crops and livestock are important initial suppliers of P from soil to China’s P supply chain, through cultivation and pasturing, respectively. From 1949 to 2012, the change in primary input level was the largest driver of P emission increments, followed by changes in population, emission intensity, and primary input structure. On the contrary, changes in production structure reduced P emissions. These findings could support supply-side policy decisions on P emission control.</jats:p>",

Strengthening the research on drought identification mechanism has an important guiding role in drought disaster prevention and mitigation. The current drought identification is mostly static in the process of drought, and there is a problem that the historical evaluation information and the drought prediction information are not closely combined, with limited application value. Based on the physical cumulative and recessional effects of drought events, this paper further uses the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to divide the whole drought process into four stages: accumulation → outbreak → reaction → restoration. In addition, this study proposes a new dynamic identification mechanism based on drought process, and develops a drought prediction model combining singular spectrum analysis and BP neural network (SSA-BPNN), filling the gap between scientific research and practical application. Using three drought events in the Yulin region of China as examples for simulation studies, the results show that the use of the new mechanism can not only improve the application value of the SSA-BPNN model, but also effectively advance the drought preparation time and resistance level.</jats:p>",

Subsequent research has also shown that the cross-section of stock returns is impacted differently by inflation. This cross-sectional variance across risky and safe stocks makes one of the most puzzling anomalies, risk (beta) anomaly, stronger in inflationary periods. This chapter tests the hypothesis that higher inflation leads to stronger mispricing of risk in stock market due to money illusion effect in Turkey, one of the emerging countries afflicted with perennial high inflation. The results show that although money illusion and mispricing were not visibly present in hyper-inflationary period in 1990s, the anomalous pricing of risky securities was remarkably high in inflationary periods over the last two decades, with a distinct mispricing due to the inflationary pressure that commenced with the COVID-19 pandemic. These varying results across the vastly different inflation regimes can be explained by rational inattention and impact of past experience of inflation on investment behavior. </jats:p>",

A tuned inductor, which was included at the input of the controlled current source (constituting the main part of the power supply) allowed for an improvement in the quality of the compensation process, compared to a device with a fixed inductive filter This resulted in a visible reduction of the nonlinear distortions of the grid current. The improvement was made possible by extending the frequency response of the current source, which allowed to increase the dynamics of the current changes at the input of the power supply. This solution represents a new approach to such power devices.

The statistical population of this research included the organizations and people involved in relief operations performed in three recent disasters: the fire-induced collapse of the Plasco building, Shahran gas explosion, and the flash flood in the Tehran subway. In order to analyze networks, a questionnaire containing network analysis questions was designed. Upon the completion of the questionnaires, the data of each network were entered systematically into a matrix on an excel spreadsheet. Such indexes as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, intersection points, isolation points, and network density were calculated by Ucinet and NetDraw software packages; therefore, the networks were analyzed.\nFINDINGS: Based on the results obtained from the analysis of communication, information exchange, and cooperation networks, the network density was 21%, indicating a low level of organizational relationship. At this level of communication, information exchange and cooperation were obtained at 11.5% and 16.5%, respectively. The analysis of the trust network also illustrated that the density of this network was 26.6%, suggesting that out of 21% of connections, there was about a quarter of possible trust. This is suggestive of low levels of inter-organizational Trust.\nCONCLUSION: Building trust in Iran's humanitarian service supply chain can be very effective in the acceleration of service supply, organization, and success of relief operations</jats:p>",

In this context, tradable credit schemes have received more and more attention in recent years. These cap-and-trade systems have the primary goal of limiting congestion, but they can also incorporate emission reduction goals. In this paper, we present the conceptual extension of a tradable credit scheme from a congestion and emission-oriented to a holistic, full-trip, multi-modal mobility traffic management system. In addition to the demand it also includes the management of the supply side. The integration of all existing modes into one holistic scheme ensures that the overall system goals are reached as all behavioral responses remain within the system boundaries. The system comprises two key innovations. First, a central agency has the possibility to provide full-trip incentives across modes to support the overall system’s goal. Second, users of the system can spend parts of their allocated mobility budget for transport infrastructure upgrades as an addition to paying for mobility or monetizing it on the market. Those innovations are a distinct extension to the idea of tradable credits. Commonly used smartphones would serve as the enabling technology of the proposed system. They offer all technical requirements and almost every citizen has access to one. Smartphones are affordable compared to dedicated traffic management infrastructure and they are flexible to accommodate system changes, e.g., new modes, through software updates. Besides the potential technical implementation, overall design questions, social aspects as well as general implications of the concept are covered.</jats:p>"

In previous studies, the optimal voltage ratio was derived, and a 1.7% points improvement in efficiency was realized for a rated unity power factor load. However, it has not been examined whether the conversion efficiency can be improved, except during the rated operation.

We explore this issue using individual‐level administrative and pension data for Philadelphia city employees, where workers have some choice about whether or not to perform overtime, which is pensionable. We document large variations across workers in the incentives to do overtime provided by pension rules. Although standard regressions show that worker overtime is positively associated with own expected pension compensation, a robust nonparametric approach that exploits the discontinuities in expected wages due to pensions shows that the elasticity of worker labor supply to expected pension compensation is likely zero: Our standard regression results are likely the consequence of the rule by which overtime is allocated in Philadelphia. We estimate that this rule adds 4% to pension costs and raises total compensation costs by around 0.7% of payroll, and examine the implications for pension underfunding.</jats:p>",

This study investigates agricultural supply chain coordination contracts in the presence of output uncertainty. It considers a two-level supply chain comprising a farmer and a retailer, where the farmer faces capital constraints and shows stockout-averse (SA), waste-averse (WA), or stock-out- and waste-averse (SW) preferences. The results show that the retailer order, production input, and supply chain expected utility in the decentralized decision framework are lower than those realized under the centralized decision model; hence, the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. Nevertheless, the designed coordination contract mechanism coordinates the supply chain efficiently and realizes a flexible distribution of benefits between the farmer and the retailer. Furthermore, when the revenue-sharing coefficient meets specific conditions, both the farmer and the retailer achieve a win-win situation. Finally, we verify the coordination contract design using numerical simulations and analyze the effects of SA and WA preferences on decision-making and the supply chain expected utility. This study provides theoretical guidance for the coordination mechanism design of agricultural supply chain with capital constraints and behavioral preferences.</jats:p>",

It further assessed ESI’s resilience capacities (prevention, absorption, adaptation, recovery, and transformation) and ultimately quantified resilience using SDG 7 targets. The study observed that in 2020, the UK had 143 days of lockdowns compared to 74 for Uganda and none for Malawi. The UK’s annual demand fell by 4.8% while Uganda and Malawi’s increased by 0.5% and 2.8%, respectively. During lockdowns, the UK lost 28% of its demand compared to 5.5% for Malawi and 24% for Uganda. It took the UK 8 months to recover its demand, which was correspondingly twice and four times longer than Uganda and Malawi. The degeneration in the level of system operations in the UK did not significantly affect electricity access and reliability contrary to Uganda and Malawi, whose impacts on their development commitments could span for years. This study underscores the necessity of evaluating resilience with respect to local development commitments. Moreover, several measures were proposed to enhance resilience mainly through actions meant to ensure business continuity.</jats:p>"

For the electrode material, a method of plating a platinum group on a metal was used to reduce the cost while maintaining the performance. It was prepared to prevent as much as possible the risk that may occur when operating the hypochlorous acid sterilization water supply device. The sterilization water had an acidity of 8.23pH, and was found to have excellent bacterial sterilization power.

Since the number of tanks in circulation will remain constant, the analysis of LPG availability can be focused on the number of tanks. Continuous simulation method with system dynamics is generally used in system growth analysis. In this paper the method is utilized to model the discrete movement of tanks circulating in the community which in this case is represented in a much smaller system, consisting of filling stations, agents, and stores. The modeling results provide a sufficient picture of how the availability of the tank can be optimized appropriately.</jats:p>"

The world is hungry for energy and climate change calls for lower emissions. The major power energy sector challenges are the increased energy demand due to industrial activity, climate change, demographic pressures, and urbanization trends, including pandemic. The companies need efficient and reliable energy and decarbonization technologies to succeed. Industries and power generation companies had to take on many challenges while running their business operations. However, the process of decarbonization takes time and includes the energy transition away from conventional fuels, from coal to gas and then to hybrid systems with renewables and cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen. The aim of this paper is to set a basis to pinpoint the subject of “Supply chains Decarbonization” within the Power energy sector as one of the tough challenges yet to come. The main objective of this article research is to provide a critical review of the commitments for decarbonization of supply-chains with focus on the power energy sector, based on international business experts and research articles. The methodologies used for this research is based on very recent research papers and studies review of major consulting groups, publishers, and energy sustainability councils. Pros and cons hypotheses are being organized as Highlights/ Lowlights over long or short run, in the conjecture of various consulting experts. The findings reveal that consulting groups express concerns and attention for the risks, some of the risks could be significant, results are less to be noted in the short run, but the results and the achievements are to be considered in the longer period. Google trend shows that the syntagms of “decarbonization” and “energy transition” are well known and searched.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of requirements are imposed on installations associated with regulated DC sources, including low voltage and current ripple in the load, as well as a wide range of output current variation. Such installations are traditionally made on controlled rectifiers or pulse-width converters in which voltage ripples are always present. The paper considers a method for reducing the voltage ripple of powerful rectifiers for powering magnetic systems based on the insertion of a compensating voltage equal in magnitude and opposite in phase to the ripple voltage into the load circuit. The possibility of using ripple compensators connected in parallel and in series with the load, as well as methods of obtaining a compensating voltage is shown. Methods for obtaining compensating voltage are given. In order to exclude the magnetization of the ripple compensator transformer, it is proposed to use several versions of the compensating transformer and the inclusion of ripple compensators. Practical schemes of passive compensators (with a demagnetizing circuit and a bifilar winding) are analyzed. The problem of developing ripple compensators for multiphase rectifiers, as well as ways to solve it, is considered. Practical recommendations for choosing a core material and calculating a transformer are given. On the basis of the presented theoretical and practical considerations for the design of the ripple compensators, simulation models have been developed in the Simulink pack-age of the MATLAB program. A technique for studying ripple compensators using the simulation models of a symmetrical 12-pulse rectifier that has been developed is presented. The results of simulation of passive ripple compensators, performed in two versions, showed their effectiveness, while the scheme was relatively simple and economic costs were relatively low. Also, the time of setting the set current in the system in the presence of a ripple compensator increases by no more than 3 %, and the accuracy and stability of operation do not change.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to assess the agro-input supply sector in Kogi state. A total of 157 input dealers were randomly selected across the twenty-one local government areas in the state. Data were collected using well-structured questionnaire complemented with interview schedule and were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. Findings reveal that agro-chemicals, fertilizer and feed were the major inputs supplied by most of the retailers and wholesalers that hardly engage in activities that create awareness about their products. Input prices were the most important preference and consideration factor in the purchase of agro-input by customers and form the basis for competition. Casual, family and child labors that proved to be cheaper, commonly accessible and do not require signing of formal employment contract with workers dominated both the retail and wholesale sectors. Poor government support, poor business condition in addition to poor capital base, high transportation cost, price fluctuations, adulteration were the identified major constraints affecting the agripreneurs. The study recommends capacity development on new marketing strategies, registration of businesses with relevant agencies, provision of credit and financial services; formation of formidable, strong and mutual-trust co-operative societies for input supply actors so as to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the agricultural inputs supply sector in the state.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this research aims to combine system dynamics modelling with a hotel food supply chain system to solve the unpredictability of supply chain dynamics. In addition, The Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) and Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) are used in this study to model the complexity of the case study supply chain, with an objective model to minimize the instability of inventory turnover and to stabilize the sales movement. This study proposes five policy scenario simulations where standard deviation (SD) and Standard of Error (SE) are used as the decision-making parameters. The simulation result suggests that the fifth scenario provides the highest SD (49.484) and the lowest SE (6.336). Therefore, controlling the customer response time variable to a maximum of 25 minutes and the menu unavailability variable to 15 occurrences per week will result in higher stability of the case study inventory turnover.</jats:p>"

While exerting great benefits (i.e., flood control, hydropower generation, inland river navigation and scenic tourism), the eutrophication of the tributary bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir has become one of the main environmental problems. This paper is to study the causes of water environment evolution in the tributary bay and investigate the driving force of eutrophication succession after the Three Gorges Reservoir enters the regular operation. By considering the Meixi River on the left bank of the mainstream of the Three Gorges Reservoir area (a typical tributary), this paper developed a three-dimensional hydrodynamic, water quality and water eutrophication mathematical model for the Meixi tributary bay, calibrated with measured data about hydrological regime (water level, flow), hydrodynamic factors (velocity) and water quality (water temperature, Chl-a, TP, TN, etc.). The annual variation of Chl-a concentration in the tributary bay was simulated, and the response relationship between the variation of Chl-a concentration and water conditions of the mainstream and tributary bay (e.g., reservoir water level, reservoir bay velocity, exogenous nutrient input, water temperature stratification and other factors) was analyzed. Results show that the water storage operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir contributes to the low flow velocity maintenance (≤0.05 m/s) in the tributary bay, the backward flow of the mainstream and the sufficient nutrients carried by the tributary water; the water temperature stratification is more likely to occur in the slow detention area in the middle-upper part of the bay in spring and summer, which provides a potential driving force for algae blooms. With the continuous decline of pollution load input in the reservoir basin, the algae blooms in tributary bay was the result of the combined action of low water level operation, low flow velocity (≤0.02 m/s), a large number of non-point source loads input with rainfall and runoff (the proportion of wet year is &amp;gt;70%), and obvious water temperature stratification in shallow water area, and the suitable meteorological conditions are the main inducing factors. Therefore, since the ecological regulation cannot be applied to the multitudinous tributary bays, the non-point source pollution control in the tributary bay is the key to controlling factor.</jats:p>",

In order to develop vigorously in the new retail environment, it is urgent for merchants to set up supply chain network reasonably. This paper constructs a supply chain newsvendor model consisting of 1 wholesaler and N retailers. Analyse how channel conversion rate, negotiation ability of supply chain members, number of retailers, and other factors affect the balance among supply chain members when offline demand, online demand, and cross-channel demand exist simultaneously. Combined with the case data of two fast fashion brands, this paper compares and analyses the profit changes of decentralized supply chain and centralized supply chain under the influence of multiple factors. The study shows that there is no absolute optimal supply chain model and the choice of supply chain model will change with the change of influencing factors. However, no matter in which supply chain mode, improving channel conversion rate and controlling the number of retailers are beneficial. In addition, in decentralized supply chain, balance can be achieved among supply chain members so as to achieve Pareto optimality. Wholesalers should take the initiative to promote the transformation of demand among channels, and should not be too strong in member negotiations. This paper analyses the basic characteristics of the supply chain network under the new retail, and establishes the network optimization strategy that is easy to implement, which can help enterprises to carry out the supply network layout more effectively under the smart new retail mode.</jats:p>",

To quantify CAV effects on transportation network, this paper first collects secondary data and adopts simulation parameters and equations from existing literature. The results from transportation analysis are then incorporated into supply chain analysis to evaluate how CAVs would change supply chain performance measured by total travel time, greenhouse gas emissions, and supply chain cost. As the performance of supply chain systems involving perishable or semi-perishable products is highly sensitive to CAV market penetration rate and driverless truck adoption rate mainly because of reduced travel time, this paper uses fresh potato supply chain systems as an illustrative example. The case study results indicate that CAVs can greatly improve supply chain performance directly and indirectly by decreasing total travel time and supply chain costs, whereas emissions are reduced primarily through the adoption of driverless trucks in the supply chain system. The effect of CAVs on supply chain performance becomes even greater when commodities travel longer distances. This study will allow supply chain managers (and grocery delivery companies) to better understand how supply chain design and operation could be transformed and reoptimized in response to the introduction of CAV technologies. The research outcomes would help them better utilize the opportunities and address possible challenges that may arise as a result of CAVs. </jats:p>",

In 2020, the pineapple cultivation area is around 72,656 hectares, which generated agro-waste after harvesting such as leaves, rhizome, and stem. The estimation of waste from leaves is about 37.5 tons per hectare, which results in waste of around 2.7 million tons per year. In addition, most farmers burn agro-waste rather than decompose causing pollution problems. Previous research showed that pineapple leaves can be used as raw materials in other industries such as textiles, paper, packaging, reinforcing materials, etc. Meanwhile, in Thailand, very few producers have the potential to produce pineapple leaf fiber due to high production costs, insufficient production capacity, lack of knowledge and labor, etc. Therefore, this research studied the pineapple leaf fiber supply chain. The objectives were to analyze the present pineapple leaf fiber supply chain of the community enterprise, pinpoint key activities, challenges, and propose guidelines to solve problems. The related stakeholders were interviewed such as farmers, community enterprise, yarn manufacturers, collectors, and government agencies. Next, business processes were identified by applying the Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). These main activities of IDEF0 are plan, source, make, deliver, and return. After the study, the challenges were uncertain demand, lack of break-even point and cost analysis, long production lead time and high production cost. Thus, the community enterprise should focus on finding a sustainable market, calculate the production cost analysis and apply Kaizen and Lean concepts to improve productivity and reduce production costs. Finally, our guidelines for fiber community enterprise can be employed in other community enterprises to enhance supply chain management and lead to sustainability.</jats:p>",

We find four major drivers: ‘customer enforcement’, ‘sustainable business value’, ‘environmental legitimacy’ and ‘competitive pressures’. Customers and competitors were the most influential external stakeholders. Shareholders and top management with intrinsic environmental values, being internal stakeholders, played pivotal roles in a proactive move to carbon neutrality when there was limited regulatory pressure. The early movers believed in the long‐term economic benefits of transitioning to carbon neutrality. We also identify the implications of carbon neutrality initiatives for supply chain management. Based on the research findings, we develop a decision support framework to guide firms in transitioning towards carbon neutrality in a multi‐tier supply chain context.</jats:p>",

This research aimed to indicate and assess the most promising types of measure which are to be applied to achieve the required reduction of CO2 emissions in global shipping as well as developing a potential roadmap leading to their implementation. In the conducted research work, mainly qualitative analyses were applied, i.e., factor analysis (FA), comparative analysis (CA), and a series of consultations with representatives of the maritime industry were carried out, following the procedure typical for the Delphi technique. The main result of the research work is the development of a scenario for potential supply and distribution of fuels to the maritime shipping market by 2050. The basic conclusion is that shortages in manufacturing, commercialization, and supply of low and zero-emission fuels to the shipping market may be the main obstacle hampering the reaching of the targets of shipping industry decarbonization. Such a scenario could significantly slow down the stepping up process of greening the global supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cover crops are supposed to decrease the soil mineral N content (N<jats:sub>min</jats:sub>) during winter and increase the N supply to subsequent main crops due to mineralization of N previously prevented from leaching. However, data on N supply from cover crops grown before sugar beet have rarely been reported for Central European conditions. Therefore, our study aimed to provide information for cover crops differing in frost resistance and biomass quantity applicable for N fertilizer dressing in the subsequent main crop. In 2018/19 and 2019/20, field trials were conducted on two Luvisol sites in Germany typical for sugar beet cultivation, comprising a sequence of autumn sown cover crops grown after field pea followed by unfertilized sugar beet main crops sown in next spring. Apparent net N mineralization and the N effect of cover crops on sugar beet were calculated according to a mass balance approach including N<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> and sugar beet N uptake. Winter rye and oil radish revealed the greatest potential for scavenging nitrate from the soil profile while reductions caused by frost-sensitive saia oat and spring vetch were more variable. The amount of N in the cover crop biomass was negatively correlated with N<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> in autumn and also in spring. Thus, for environmentally effective cover cropping in Central Europe, species with a sufficiently high frost tolerance should be chosen. Despite cover crop N uptake up to 170 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and C:N ratios &amp;lt; 20, a positive N effect on sugar beet was only found between March and July of the beet growing season and was 50 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at maximum, while between August and September, net immobilization was predominant with up to 100 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Differences among crop species were not consistent across the site/years investigated.

The World Health Organization estimates that household air pollution from inefficient stoves causes more premature deaths than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Increasing demand for energy has led to dramatic increases in emissions. The need for reliable electricity and limiting emissions drives research on Resilient Hybrid Energy Systems (RHESs), which provide cleaner energy through combining wind, solar, and biomass energy with traditional fossil energy, increasing production efficiency and reliability and reducing generating costs and emissions. Microgrids have been shown as an efficient means of implementing RHESs, with some focused mainly on reducing the environmental impact of electric power generation. The technical challenges of designing, implementing, and applying microgrids involve conducting a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to evaluate these systems’ environmental and economic performance under diverse operating conditions to evaluate resiliency. A sample RHES was developed and used to demonstrate the implementation in rural applications, where the system can provide reliable electricity for heating, cooling, lighting, and pumping clean water. The model and findings can be utilized by other regions around the globe facing similar challenges.</jats:p>"

We argue that a multi‐theory perspective, dynamic capability at an organizational level and enactment theory at a managerial level allow us to better understand how the sensemaking process within managerial risk perception assists organizational resilience. We draw from in‐depth interviews with 40 managers across the UK's food industry, which has been able to display resilience during the pandemic. In sensing supply chain risks (SCRs), managers within both authority‐based and consensus‐based organizational structures utilize risk‐capture heuristics and enact actions related to effective communications, albeit at different information costs. In seizing, we found that managers adhere to distinct heuristics that are idiosyncratic to their organizational structures. Through limited horizontal communication channels, authority‐based structures adhere to rudimentary how‐to heuristics, whereas consensus‐based structures use obtainable how‐to heuristics. We contribute to the organizational resilience and dynamic capabilities literature by identifying assessment as an additional step prior to transforming, which depicts a retention process to inform future judgements. Our study presents a novel framework of organizational resilience to SCRs during equivocal environments, by providing a nuanced understanding of the construction of dynamic capabilities through sensemaking.</jats:p>",

The catastrophe progression method was used for risk evaluation, and the WEEE risk control model was constructed using system dynamics to analyze the influence of risk control strategies. The results show that adopting risk control strategies positively promotes risk control. Risk mitigation is most pronounced when both the fund subsidy and the green and low-carbon strategies are adopted. When only one approach is implemented, the green and low-carbon strategy has a more considerable effect. When the intensities of the mitigation measures are improved to the same extent, the risk control effect generated by the fund subsidy strategy was found to have a greater impact.

In this environment, the financial investment activities of the public and enterprises have greatly increased and have an important role and impact on the optimal allocation of market funds. Due to the coexistence of risks and interests, the financial investment market will be impacted by high-risk events, which will lead to instability of order and certain economic losses. The operation risk of an enterprise is a huge challenge for its own development. A little carelessness may lead to a sharp decline in the status of the enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen financial investment control and risk prediction, which has important practical significance for the benign development of enterprises, improving market competitiveness, and reducing negative impacts. Therefore, this paper adopts the concept of edge computing, and based on the R&amp;D and operation experience of relevant venture capital systems, develops an intelligent system that can predict various risks in the whole process of financial investment. Firstly, the mobile edge computing framework is introduced, followed by the computing advantages. Then, the system architecture is designed around the edge computing, such as designing specific algorithms, so as to complete the overall design of the intelligent financial investment risk prediction system. Then, the results are systematically analyzed through experiments, which show that the system can well predict the financial investment risk.

Considering the perishable nature of fresh food products and their short life cycle, fresh food companies feel immense pressure to adopt an efficient and proactive risk management system. The risk management aspects within the food supply chains have been addressed in several studies. However, only a few studies focus on the complex interactions between the various types of risks impacting food supply chain functionality and dynamic feedback effects, which can generate a reliable risk management system. This paper strives to contribute to this evident research gap by adopting a system dynamics modelling approach to generate a systemic risk management model. The system dynamics model serves as the basis for the simulation of risk index values and can be explored in future work to further analyse the dynamic risk’s effect on the food supply chain system’s behaviour. According to a literature review of published research from 2017 to 2021, nine different risks across the food supply chain were identified as a subsection of the major risk categories: macro-level and operational risks. Following this stage, two of the risk groups identified first were integrated with a developed system dynamics model to conduct this research and to evaluate the interaction between the risks and the functionality of the three main dairy supply chain processes: production, logistics, and retailing. The key findings drawn from this paper can be beneficial for enhancing managerial discernment regarding the critical role of system dynamics models for analysing various types of risks across the food supply chain process and improving its efficiency.</jats:p>"

For this, samplers were positioned under the spans of a Center Pivot system, being evaluated the effects of the sampling pattern and of the span, in a 3×3 statistical factorial design, with three replications. The results showed that circular and meshed arrangements were statistically equal and had higher values of Christiansen's and Distribution Uniformity Coefficients. The mesh type arrangement represented a more uniform distribution profile of irrigation depths on the surface. For areas of flat or slightly undulating topography and when using pressure regulating valves for the emitters, sampling in a radial pattern is sufficient, but for terrains with irregular topography or when pressure head variations along the lateral line are important for the operation of the emitters, the combination of the radial and circular pattern is interesting. The meshed sampling detects the stoppage effect of the towers and drift, however, in a reduced area.</jats:p>",

Climate change will have a significant impact on the collection and utilization of rainwater and its spatial characteristics. When the Gray-Green infrastructure is designed, if only historical precipitation is adopted to calculate the urban design rainstorm intensity formula (DRIF) and the total annual runoff control rate, it may be difficult to meet the demand of future precipitation changes on the city's ability to accommodate rainfall. Therefore, it is very important to study the impact of climate change on the IDF curve. This study proposes an overall optimization solution framework for historical and future DRIF. The impact of the extreme value on the IDF curve during the historical period is analyzed. The calculation method of the IDF curve in the future period is established. The changes of the rainstorm intensity in the historical and future period (SSP1-2.6,SSP2-4.5,SSP3-7.0,SSP5-8.5) were analyzed for the 15 durations and eight return periods in Beijing, China. The results of this study show that the nondominated sorting and local search (NSLS) has the best accuracy in fitting the statistical samples of precipitation for different durations. The best methods to judge and process the extreme value of the statistical sample are Z-score and average value of series greater than critical value (AVG). Under the four SSP scenarios, the estimated IDF value is larger than the observed value in the historical period. The results of the equivalent return period calculated using the DRIF show that the the four SSP scenarios are smaller than the historical period for the return period greater than five years. Taking 120 min of short-duration precipitation as an example, the 100-year equivalent return periods of the observation under the four SSP scenarios are 35-, 20-, 54-, and 17-years, respectively. The research can provide valuable reference for the design and planning of the drainage facility under climate change.</jats:p>",

We then used game theory to analyze the pricing decisions, traceability levels, anti-pandemic effort levels and subsidy levels of the supply chain under different governmental anti-pandemic or subsidy strategies. Our results showed that in all scenarios, the higher the consumer preference for traceability information, the larger the traceability levels and anti-pandemic effort levels and the more favorable the outcome for all parties; thus, governments should improve consumer awareness of pandemic prevention. For the benefit of all parties, governments should adopt anti-pandemic and subsidy strategies simultaneously, even in the post-pandemic era. Interestingly, for the scenario in which governments could only adopt one strategy, when the cost coefficient of traceability was small, the governmental subsidies would actually lead to lower traceability levels of the 3PL. This study could provide decision-making references for governments during the post-pandemic era and a new possibility for blockchain application.</jats:p>"

The rapid growth of information technologies, such as blockchain technology, has facilitated effective information systems development to support supply chain quality management. However, a significant challenge in developing blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems is how to deal with information asymmetry and the conflicting interests of supply chain partners. Taking a service-dominant view, this research proposes a Blockchain-Oriented Service Modeling (BOSM) approach for blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems. We provide a visual language for modeling the coordination and integration of business processes and domain knowledge at the knowledge level to facilitate the alignment of blockchain technology with supply chain quality management. The proposed approach bridges operational service computing with strategic service management in blockchain-enabled supply chain quality management and facilitates the communication between business people in supply chain management and software professionals in blockchain-based service computing. A case study on a dairy supply chain is presented to show advantages of the modeling framework under the service-dominant view, separating the cause of quality from the carrier of quality in the design of blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems.</jats:p>",

On the service front, 41.3% of the dairy cooperative societies faced animal feed shortages. The average per day milk consumption increased by 42.7 % during lockdown mainly driven by the return of family members from cities to villages. However, the gross income realized through milk sales by the dairy farmers decreased during the lockdown period mainly due to reduced milk prices offered by the co-operatives. The gross income realized through the sale of milk products by the vendors declined by 5.11% due to a fall in demand for various milk products.

Firms need to comprehend the integration of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in their supply chain. The current study intends to analyze the mediation effect of environmental performance (ENP) in the relationship between GSCM practices, institutional pressures (IP), and financial performance (FNP). Therefore, GSCM-IP-ENP-FNP model was developed with the help of an extensive literature review and then proved with the help of data collected from pesticide chemical firms working in Pakistan. Data were collected through a questionnaire from 500 senior-level managers of the pesticide firms of Pakistan. However, 468 responses were retained for analysis keeping in view the limitations of the current study. SPSS version 22 and SmartPLS 3.0 were used for data analysis. Results of the study indicated strong relationships among all variables. It was also concluded that GSCM practices, IP, and ENP have a positive and statistically significant relationship with a firm’s FNP. This study is an important contribution to theory and practice. The study is unique and has significant contributions because it developed and proved the GSCM-IP-ENP-FNP model. The model helped to prove the mediation effect of ENP in the relationship between GSCM practices, IP, and FNP in the pesticide sector of Pakistan, which would be highly beneficial for the managers of pesticide firms as well as for the government to understand the importance of GSCM practices for improving the ENP as well as the FNP of pesticide firms in Pakistan as well as worldwide, especially in developing countries. This study recommends that the management of firms should implement GSCM practices to protect the environment. Government, consumers, and other institutions should exert pressure and the government should provide subsidies, if necessary, to the firms for successful implementation of GSCM practices. Furthermore, it is recommended to conduct further studies in other countries by using the mixed methodology in the pesticide sector as well as in other sectors of the economy to increase the generalizability of the current study.</jats:p>"

However, questions remain regarding how certain features—the evolution of mutators and whether compensatory mutations alleviate costs fully or partially—may influence the evolutionary dynamics of compensation and reversion. In this study, we attempt to explain findings from experimental evolution by utilizing computational and theoretical approaches toward a more refined understanding of how mutation rate and the fitness effects of compensatory mutations influence adaptive dynamics. We find that high mutation rates increase the probability of reversion toward the wild type when compensation is only partial. However, the existence of even a single fully compensatory mutation is associated with a dramatically decreased probability of reversion to the wild type. These findings help to explain specific results from experimental evolution, where compensation was observed in nonmutator strains, but reversion (sometimes with compensation) was observed in mutator strains, indicating that real-world compensatory mutations are often unable to fully alleviate the costs associated with adaptation. Our findings emphasize the potential role of the supply and quality of mutations in crafting the dynamics of adaptation and reversal, with implications for theoretical population genetics and for biomedical contexts like the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</jats:p>",

The set aim is achieved by solving the following problems: choosing a method for calculating various schedules of regulating heat supply from CHPPs; construction of initial, reduced and extended temperature schedules and schedules of delivery water consumption; determination of optimal energy costs and heat-transfer agent costs. The most important of the results achieved is the carried analysis of the energy and economic efficiency indicators changes during the transition from the traditional to lowered and extended schedules of heat-supply system regulation. The total fuel savings at CHPP during the transition from the initial design temperature schedule with a maximum delivery water temperature of 150°C to the most energy efficient schedules reaches about 2%, which should be recognized as very significant. The significance of the obtained results lies in the fact that they allow calculating the energy effect in the form of fuel savings at CHPPs compared to their operation with the design temperature schedule. It is shown that the use of these technologies will increase the efficiency of district heating that will ensure a reliable and high-quality supply of heat energy to consumers and reduce its cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As an emerging industry, e-commerce mainly relies on online platforms to provide products and services for enterprises and consumers, and it has its own risks in the development of supply chain finance. When developing an online business, it can rely on the support of developed logistics and physical stores, which has its special advantages in operating supply chain finance, but at the same time, it also brings special business risks. With the rapid development of economic level in recent years, the application of EC Supply Chain has become more and more extensive. The emergence of EC Supply Chain has injected strong vitality into the financial market, but at the same time, the EC Supply Chain financial business is also facing huge risks. For cross-border import e-commerce companies, the core of the supply chain is the source of goods and logistics. Enterprises have more resources, which means that they have more initiative in the fierce competition, and a stable and perfect supply chain will be the core competitiveness of the cross-border import e-commerce industry. The purpose of this paper is to study how to prevent risks in the EC Supply Chain financial market based on high-performance computing. This paper puts forward the importance of high-performance computing and the significance of EC Supply Chain development and proposes preventive measures against financial market risks in EC Supply Chain. From the data in the experimental part of this paper, it can be known that the development trend of the risk generated by the EC Supply Chain in 2010 accounted for 6.9%. By 2015, the percentage of the development trend of EC Supply Chain risk was 17.9%, an increase of 11%. It can be seen that the development of EC Supply Chain risk is very rapid, so how to prevent the financial market risk of EC Supply Chain is very urgent. From the data, it can be seen that the exogenous risk in the e-commerce supply chain has a score of 7.4–8.4 for market risk, a score of 7.7–9.1 for economic risk, and the highest score for economic risk. Risk is the biggest risk factor. The characteristics of supply chain risk are not only complex, diverse, and uncertain but also transitive and virtual.</jats:p>",

This article focuses on the formation mechanism and factors of the financial core competence of grassroots power supply enterprises and reviews the latest research hotspots and their theoretical significance in academia. By applying the random matrix model to evaluate the core financial capabilities of grassroots power supply enterprises, it proposes a path for cultivating and improving the core financial capabilities of grassroots power supply enterprises. Through a detailed and powerful discussion, it is possible to effectively improve the financial management efficiency of grassroots power supply enterprises and quickly adapt to the needs of market changes, so as to meet the interests of relevant stakeholders of grassroots power supply enterprises as much as possible. Considering the market competition environment, it is found that the positive relationship between corporate responsibility information disclosure and the degree of earnings management is only significant in low-competitive markets, which also shows that with the intensification of market competition, the degree of information asymmetry decreases. The ability of power supply is also increasing, which will weaken the mechanism of grassroots power supply enterprises to conceal earnings management behavior through corporate responsibility information disclosure. The results show that corporate responsibility information may become a tool to cover up the management of grassroots power supply enterprises to manipulate earnings and reduce the quality of earnings reports, and this behavior will be different in grassroots power supply enterprises with different characteristics and external environments. This will help to form an objective understanding of corporate responsibility information disclosure behaviors, identify the motives of grassroots power supply companies’ responsible behaviors for regulators, standardize corporate responsibility disclosure norms, and take differentiated measures for different situations.</jats:p>",

Timber tracking is one example of digital transformation, and can be performed in various locations, from the forest to the mill, or even beyond, to the final timber product. The integration of new technologies in the forestry and timber industries should contribute to enhancing supply chain efficiency and safety. For this purpose, a new timber tracking and processing system was tested by integrating RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology with digital survey tools and intelligent machines, into a smart timber supply chain. A case study on this process was carried out in a mountain forest in Austria. The tags were used to link information to single items (trees and logs) and transfer relevant data (species, diameter, length, volume, defects, density, stiffness, branchiness, etc.), throughout the whole supply chain. The performance of the technology was analyzed by means of process flow, bottleneck, and risk analyses. Fourteen spruce trees went through the supply chain process from the forest stand to the log yard, monitored by the new timber tracking and processing system. The results revealed that the new system is useful for transferring information through the timber supply chain, and the system costs remained at a normal market level. The weakest point in the supply chain was the processing of the trees by the intelligent prototype processor. A high error rate and low durability lead to higher idling time and harvesting cost, but the findings of this study can be used to further improve this system.

Although firms recognize the need to define strategies for success, they often overlook whatever strategies they do develop in their decision‐making process. To address this gap, we argue that the strategy tripod comprising the industry‐based view (IBV), resource‐based view (RBV), and institutional‐based view (INSBV) can influence SC orientation toward sustainability. This paper describes an investigation into this strategy tripod's impact on the cashew industry's SC sustainability orientation. Multiple case studies were conducted by gathering data from various cashew SC stakeholders. A deductive content analysis showed that, despite the existing influences from the three legs of the strategy tripod, emphasis was placed on the firm perspective (i.e., RBV), which affected SC sustainability orientation in that the industry‐ (i.e., IBV) and institutional‐ (i.e., INSBV) level views received less consideration in the creation of SC strategies. This research contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on under‐explored relations between business strategy and SC sustainability. Our results show that firms should move from pressure responsiveness to strategy management to implement sustainability‐oriented initiatives.</jats:p>",

The future water condition will be impossible to manage unless the municipality is able to address the increased demand for water which often leads to illegal water connections. The goal of this study is twofold: first to predict human population growth over a 50-year period and secondly, to formulate a linear programming model to determine the number of additional reservoir tanks which need to be built, in order to satisfy the human water demand for the next half century. This study compares the application of automated time series forecasting models like ARIMA, ETS, and BATS model to predict the growth in human population. The best model to forecast human population growth was then selected using the forecasting assessment criterion of RMSE, MAE, MASE and MAPE. Based on the forecast results obtained in this study, ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift model has shown a better prediction accuracy in terms of the RMSE = 3.725, MAE = 2.265, MASE = 0.211, and MAPE = 0.757, than the ETS(A,Ad,N), and BATS(1, {0,0}, 1,-) model to explain the observed values of a time series. The forecast results derived from ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift model have indicated that the human population growth will triple by 2067, albeit at a higher pace than at any period since 1996. On the basis of human population growth forecasts, it is suggested that 687 additional reservoir tanks with a capacity of 47,500 kilolitres are built within the next 50 years in order to supplement the increased demand for water that comes with an increase in human population. An implication of these findings is the possibility that, should anticipated human population growth materialise, the current reservoir tanks are likely to come under stress due to the increased demand for water.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, this option is associated with environmental and public health risks. Therefore, a microbiological health risk assessment was carried out regarding the application of agricultural reuse of water in the neighborhood of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). This study was carried out in cities in the central region of Brazil, using a semiquantitative methodology. Escherichia coli density in treated wastewater was used as an input, which was obtained from the city wastewater utility. The same exposure scenario was defined for two crops – sugarcane and pasture – at the surroundings of four WWTP under study. As receptors, the following were adopted: farmers; water reuse transport workers; the local community; and sugarcane industry workers. The estimated risks for all groups were considered acceptable. Furthermore, such risks should be reduced to despicable (despicable risk should be understood as low risk) if improvements in the wastewater treatment system and more efficient configurations of barriers are adopted. It can be concluded that risk assessment clarifies the options for system-management, allowing for better informed decision-making and encouraging public confidence in the safe application of water reuse.</jats:p>",

This effect has been suggested to result from stimulation of coupling efficiency of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation by reduced nitrate derivatives. In this paper, we report the acute effects of sodium nitrite on the bioenergetic behaviour of cultured rat (L6) myocytes. At odds with improved efficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, extracellular flux analysis reveals that a ½-hour exposure to NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (0.1–5 μM) does not affect mitochondrial coupling efficiency in static myoblasts or in spontaneously contracting myotubes. Unexpectedly, NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> stimulates the rate of glycolytic ATP production in both myoblasts and myotubes. Increased ATP supply through glycolysis does not emerge at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation, which means that NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> acutely increases the rate of overall myocellular ATP synthesis, significantly so in myoblasts and tending towards significance in contractile myotubes. Notably, NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exposure shifts myocytes to a more glycolytic bioenergetic phenotype. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption does not decrease after NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exposure, and non-mitochondrial respiration tends to drop.

These farmers are unable to allocate adequate resources such as transport vehicles, equipment, and laborers to various activities in the production process. This paper formulated a mixed-integer linear programming model based on a supply chain network design for banana flour production. This model aimed to determine the optimal number of resources for a producer organization to maximize its total profit. The deterministic branch-and-bound technique and metaheuristic binary firefly algorithm were implemented to obtain the model solution. Based on a case study, both approaches consistently showed that to maximize the profit for small-scale banana flour production, they must operate one mill and one truck with a 4,000- kg maximum capacity and hire nine non-regular and 14 regular laborers. The methodology developed in this study can also be applied to other banana producer organizations with a similar supply chain network to explore alternative enterprises and improve profitability.</jats:p>"

COVID-19 has rapidly spread all over the world within a short time period. Due to the coronavirus pandemic transmitting quickly worldwide, the impact on global healthcare systems and healthcare supply chain management has been profound. The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously influenced the routine and daily operations of healthcare facilities and the entire healthcare supply chain management and has brough about a public health crisis. As making sure the availability of healthcare facilities during COVID-19 is crucial, the debate on how to take resilience actions for sustaining healthcare supply chain management has gained new momentum. Apart from the logistics of handling human remains in some countries, supplies within the communities are urgently needed for emergency response. This study focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of the current practices of healthcare supply chain management in Hong Kong and the United States under COVID-19 settings. A wide range of different aspects associated with healthcare supply chain operations are considered, including the best practices for using respirators, transport of life-saving medical supplies, contingency healthcare strategies, blood distribution, and best practices for using disinfectants, as well as human remains handling and logistics. The outcomes of the conducted research identify the existing healthcare supply chain trends in two major Eastern and Western regions of the world, Hong Kong and the United States, and determine the key challenges and propose some strategies that can improve the effectiveness of healthcare supply chain management under COVID-19 settings.

Reshoring and nearshoring strategies are the possible responses of manufacturing companies to disruptions in order to adapt to unforeseen events. The supply chain for the Italian ceramic sector, which is characterized by a high intensity of natural and energy resource consumption and a sourcing system with a high geopolitical risk, is examined in this study. The functional decomposition technique was used to analyze the supply chain; then, three scenarios were developed as potential remedies for the unexpected termination of Ukrainian plastic clay supply. The study also showed that complex issues require multifaceted analysis approaches, which is why a transdisciplinary approach was chosen. In addition, the analysis of the ceramic industry showed that nearshoring and reshoring strategies can reduce supply risk and have a positive impact on the environment. The study also showed how bringing extraction sources closer to factories significantly reduces CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from transportation. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the complexity of supply chains in times of disruption, configuring reshoring and nearshoring options through transdisciplinarity.</jats:p>"

The possibility of using a fuzzy inference system, artificial neural networks, and a genetic algorithm for solving the problem is shown. As a result of the research, neuro-fuzzy models of the elements of the distributed generation plant were obtained, which are an integral part of the digital twin. Based on the simulation results, the following conclusions were drawn: the proposed method for constructing an optimized fuzzy model gives acceptable results when compared with experimental data and shows practical applicability in constructing a digital twin. In the future, in order to simplify the model, it is necessary to solve the problem of optimizing the number of rules in the fuzzy inference system.

The use of steam generated from waste treatment plants as a source of energy in industries is a promising energy recovery method. In recent years, the feasibility and economic potential of conversion of waste into energy have been evaluated; however, economic efficiency is not always achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to classify steam supply targets based on profitability. Herein, we selected appropriate industries from different types and scales of industries for steam supply based on analyses carried out in Aichi Prefecture. Therefore, industries were classified based on their production shipment value. We also calculated the maximum profit potential from steam supply from waste treatment plants and the steam demand potential of each mesh. We applied data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate energy efficiency and regression analysis to evaluate the potential effects on growth. The appropriate industry was estimated through decision tree analysis based on DEA scores for the mixed industries cluster. We extracted four appropriate industries: pulp, textiles, ceramics, and steel. For each industry, we calculated the number of firms required in the mesh for economic benefit. We also selected industries that could be used to explore the potential of adopting the developed methodology for other regions and industries and for identification of waste treatment plants that could participate in steam supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application of naturally-derived biomolecules in everyday products, replacing conventional synthetic manufacturing, is an ever-increasing market. An example of this is the compatible solute ectoine, which is contained in a plethora of treatment formulations for medicinal products and cosmetics. As of today, ectoine is produced in a scale of tons each year by the natural producer <jats:italic>Halomonas elongata</jats:italic>. In this work, we explore two complementary approaches to obtain genetically improved producer strains for ectoine production. We explore the effect of increased precursor supply (oxaloacetate) on ectoine production, as well as an implementation of increased ectoine demand through the overexpression of a transporter. Both approaches were implemented on an already genetically modified ectoine-excreting strain <jats:italic>H. elongata</jats:italic> KB2.13 (Δ<jats:italic>teaABC</jats:italic> Δ<jats:italic>doeA</jats:italic>) and both led to new strains with higher ectoine excretion. The supply driven approach led to a 45% increase in ectoine titers in two different strains. This increase was attributed to the removal of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which allowed the conversion of 17.9% of the glucose substrate to ectoine. For the demand driven approach, we investigated the potential of the TeaBC transmembrane proteins from the ectoine-specific Tripartite ATP-Independent Periplasmic (TRAP) transporter as export channels to improve ectoine excretion. In the absence of the substrate-binding protein TeaA, an overexpression of both subunits TeaBC facilitated a three-fold increased excretion rate of ectoine. Individually, the large subunit TeaC showed an approximately five times higher extracellular ectoine concentration per dry weight compared to TeaBC shortly after its expression was induced. However, the detrimental effect on growth and ectoine titer at the end of the process hints toward a negative impact of TeaC overexpression on membrane integrity and possibly leads to cell lysis. By using either strategy, the ectoine synthesis and excretion in <jats:italic>H. elongata</jats:italic> could be boosted drastically. The inherent complementary nature of these approaches point at a coordinated implementation of both as a promising strategy for future projects in Metabolic Engineering. Moreover, a wide variation of intracelllular ectoine levels was observed between the strains, which points at a major disruption of mechanisms responsible for ectoine regulation in strain KB2.13.</jats:p>"

Operating experience attests to the fact that during islanded operations, GREPs are shut down by process protections or protective relays in the event of severe disturbances. This leads to complete load shedding, which is accompanied by losses and damage to industrial facilities. Severe disturbances include the following ones: large load surges on GREPs due to one of them being switched off, the group starting of electric motors, and load shedding (more than 50%) during short circuits or disconnection of process lines. Energy storage systems (ESS) have the ability to compensate for instantaneous power imbalances to prevent GREPs from switching off. The authors of this study have developed methods for intelligent control of the ESS that allow one to solve two problems: prevention of GREPs shutdowns under short-term frequency and voltage deviations as well as preservation of the calendar and cycling lifetime of battery storage (BS) of the GREP. The first method does not require performing the calculation of adjustments of control actions for active and reactive power on the ESS online but rather determines them by the value of frequency deviations and the voltage sag configuration, which greatly simplifies the system of automatic control of the ESS. The second method, which consists in dividing the steady-state power/frequency characteristic into sections with different droops that are chosen depending on the current load of the ESS and the battery state of charge, and offsetting it according to a specified pattern, allows for preventing the premature loss of power capacity of the ESS BS.</jats:p>"

However, most of these studies consider the pattern demands of the retailers as deterministic, which is very unlikely in practice where variability is significant. Thus, VMI systems based on deterministic demand patterns can lead to inefficient results, compromising the benefits of this system. Particularly within the pharmaceutical industry, an efficient supply chain through VMI is vital. The present work contributes within this context by proposing a multi-retailer VMI model to maximize the profits of a two-echelon supply chain in the presence of non-deterministic or uncertain demand. Due to the complexity of the model, a micro-genetic algorithm is developed to determine the lot size strategy to address the variable pattern of the non-deterministic demand within the profit function and reduce the stockout risk. The proposed model was validated through computer simulation, which is important to dynamically evaluate the performance of the model’s parameters. The dynamic evaluation showed that the proposed model is more efficient to reduce stockout events than models with consider deterministic demand patterns.  </jats:p>"

Cloud data provides a lot of data support for people's life and work, but because of its large number, multifarious types and huge value, there are some problems such as private data leakage and abuse of sensitive information. Stocking of biomedical material at one place only, can cause delay in sending important lifesaving material to needy patients. On the one hand, it is an important content of engineering scheduling theory and method; On the other hand, in medical field, a lot of materials are usually consumed to protect the life of patients. Biomedical informatics and computer vision techniques have been combined in a variety of inter‐multidisciplinary disciplines during the past few decades. We are all aware that inadequate or insufficient cloud access management and controls can expose a corporation to a range of issues. The work that follows offers intelligent supply chain, an upgraded service management control telephone network architecture. If we can acquire according to the patient demands and retain the ideal inventory such that the patient requirement and interest can be safe, the overall cost will be lowered greatly. The experimental results show that R1 orders 31 times, and the total cost is 1,259,520 CNY. R2 ordered 24 times, with a total cost of 982,034 CNY; R3 orders 22 times, and the total cost is 990,146 CNY.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper considers the operation of an LED lighting system with a parallel power supply from photovoltaic modules and a power grid. Such systems are supposed to be widely applicable in premises with limited natural lighting, particularly agrosystems where artificial light of a certain spectrum is specifically required to ensure efficient plant growth. The paper presents the scheme of the developed LED lighting system, as well as an assembled prototype containing a single 36-watt lamp. The data of the experimental study are provided on the developed LED lighting system using the developed monitoring system. The experimental study demonstrates an efficient power take-off and the reliability of the proposed scheme to competently select the characteristics and circuit solutions for the converter of voltage from the PV module. The proposed LED system allows simplification of the PV system by eliminating circuits with an inverter and storage devices, hence significantly reducing the cost of the photovoltaic systems. Likewise, such a simplicity has a positive effect on PV system reliability, which benefits the cost as well.</jats:p>"

Despite being pervasive in coastal Ghana, LULCC has not been investigated to understand its effects on the potential for coastal landscapes to supply ecosystem services (ES). In this study, the impacts of LULCC on the potential supply of ES by coastal landscapes in Southwestern Ghana was assessed for the years 2008 and 2018 by using remote sensing and benefit transfer approaches. Based on available data, relevant provisioning and regulating ES were selected for the assessment while indicators to aid the quantification of the ES were obtained from literature. Supervised classification methods and maximum likelihood algorithms were used to prepare land use/land cover (LULC) maps and the derived LULC categories were assigned according to the descriptions of the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). Potential supply of provisioning (food, fuelwood) and regulating (carbon storage) services was quantified and the spatial and temporal distributions of these ES illustrated using maps. The results show variations in food and fuelwood supply and carbon storage potentials over the study period and across different locations on the landscape. Potentials for fuelwood supply and carbon storage in mangrove forests indicated declining trends between 2008 and 2018. On the other hand, food-crop supply and carbon storage potential in rubber plantations depicted increasing patterns over the same period. Population, slope and elevation exhibited strong effects on LULC conversions to food crop and rubber plantations whereas these factors were less important determinants of mangrove forest conversions. The findings of the study have implications for identifying and addressing tradeoffs between land uses for agriculture, industrial development and conservation of critical coastal ES within the context of rapid land system transformations in the study region.</jats:p>"

Under these circumstances, the resilience evaluation of the agricultural supply chain based on green transformation became an important subject. Based on this topic with outstanding problems, this paper evaluates the resilience level of the agricultural supply chain in northeast China with the goal of achieving the “double carbon” objective. By focusing on its resilience, we selected Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces as research subjects and collected the agricultural supply chain-related data from 2010 to 2019. Based on the relationship between supply chain nodes and the operation system, an evaluation model containing three levels was established. The entropy weight method and TOWA operator were used to carry out secondary weighting on the evaluation system and time levels containing 12 indicators, following the evaluation of the resilience level of the agricultural supply chain in three static and dynamic dimensions using the grey correlation method. The results show that the importance of the evaluation level of “internode resilience level” has always been a priority during the decade. Therefore, it is pointed out that the resilience construction and green transformation of the agricultural supply chain should be strengthened and implemented from the following three aspects: strengthening agricultural modernization, optimizing supply chain operation, and the implementation and promotion of effective policies.</jats:p>",

It is believed that establishing distribution centers (DCs) for centralized collection and unified distribution is one effective way to address this problem. This paper proposes a unified framework simultaneously considering the location-inventory-routing problem (LIRP) in auto parts supply logistics. Integrating the idea of sustainable development, a multi-objective MIP model is developed to determine the location and inventory capacity of DCs and routing decisions to minimize the total system cost and carbon emissions while concerning multi-period production demand. In addition, a robust optimization model is developed further in the context of uncertain demand. Numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed deterministic and robust models. The results show that synergistically optimizing the location and capacity of DCs and routing decisions are beneficial in reducing total system cost and carbon emissions. The analysis can provide guidelines to decision-makers for the effective management of auto parts supply logistics.</jats:p>"

A hydroponics experiment was\nconducted herein to test the influence of different N and K conditions\non the root morphology and physiology of apple M9T337 rootstocks. The\nresults showed that high nitrate-N conditions caused the dysregulation\nof N/K balance, hormone content, and antioxidant metabolism, resulting\nin damage to the root cortex structure. High nitrate conditions caused\nstomatal closure and reduced mesophyll conductance ( <jats:italic>g</jats:italic>) and the maximum carboxylation efficiency ( <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>), thus increasing photosynthetic limitations, and\nalso reduced the expression of sugar transporter proteins (\n<jats:italic>MdSOT1</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>MdSOT2</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>MdSUT1</jats:italic>), leading to a lower\nsoluble sugar content in the root system, which was detrimental to root\ngrowth. Further analysis found that appropriately increasing the K\nsupply (10 mM) enhanced the superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and\nascorbate peroxidase activities, reduced the malondialdehyde and H\nO  contents, and protected the root\nstructure. It also optimized the net photosynthetic rate ( <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>), increased sugar transporter protein expression and\nsugar-metabolizing enzyme activity in the roots, promoted the transport\nof photosynthetic products such as sorbitol and sucrose from the leaves\nto the roots, and increased the soluble sugar content in the roots. In\nsummary, our data show that an appropriate increase in the K supply (10\nmM) alleviated the root inhibition of high N through regulating\nphysiological metabolic activities such as the antioxidant system and\ncarbon metabolism.

The sector remains the last major transport mode without vehicle emission standards, so the intensive CAEP work over the past years was an important opportunity for ICAO to deliver on its stated climate goals.  The development of an aeroplane CO2 Standard was one recommended element within the ICAO Programme of Action on International Aviation and Climate Change, which was subsequently endorsed by the ICAO High-level Meeting of Member States. Following the agreement of a draft Annex 16 Volume III certification requirement1 at CAEP/9, the CAEP/10 work programme for WG3 included work items E.05 on an aeroplane CO2 emissions Standard and E.06 on interdependencies (Appendix A). These items were allocated to the CO2Task Group (CO2TG). The 36-State ICAO Council has adopted a new aircraft CO2 emissions standard which will reduce the impact of aviation greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate. Contained in a new Volume III to Annex 16 of the Chicago Convention (Environmental Protection), the aircraft CO2 emissions measure represents the world’s first global design certification standard governing CO2 emissions for any industry sector. The Standard will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in-production as of 2023. Those in-production aircraft which by 2028 do not meet the standard will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are sufficiently modified.</jats:p>"

Aim: This study aims to observe residual chlorine distribution patterns and investigate the effect of distribution distance, pH, and temperature on residual chlorine concentration in the water distribution network. Methodology and Results: Analytical survey method with a cross-sectional approach was used in this study. The field survey results and the water analysis were inputted into the ArcGIS 10.6 software to generate an Isoconcentration map. Correlation and regression analysis were conducted using SPSS 16.0. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The results showed that 65% of the residual chlorine concentration in the drinking water distribution network Istana Dieng residence did not meet the quality standard (&lt;0.2 mg/l). Twenty-six sample points showed a value of 0.1 mg/l, which was caused by the pipe's physical condition and the use of wells connected to the PDAM network. There was a significant correlation between distance and residual chlorine concentration. The significant correlation between pH and residual chlorine concentration showed a value of -0.690. The correlation between temperature and residual chlorine concentration was -0.633. It was proven that the lower the residual chlorine concentration, the higher the pH and temperature values in the distribution network.</jats:p>"

Throughout the 2010s, these demographic transformations took place against a backdrop of increasing migration flows and stocks. This IMR Research Note aims to enrich the discussion of the aforementioned issues and to provide methodological and empirical evidence on the role of migration stocks in shaping changes over time in two main aspects of the European labor supply: the size of the labor force and aggregate labor force participation rates from 2006 to 2018. Based on annual LFS data, we use a mixed standardization and decomposition method to determine to what extent trends in the European labor supply are driven over time by changes in population or in labor force participation rates within specific groups selected on the basis of age, gender, birth country (native- versus foreign-born), and origin country (European Union versus non-European Union). Our Research Note points out that, despite the upward trend in the labor force participation rates of native-born women and of native-born persons aged 55 years and over, the increase in labor supply in the European Union and in the 10 European countries under study in this article between 2006 and 2018 was driven by foreign-born persons. These developments suggest that, in a context of political desire for less migration, international migration has become a structural feature of European labor markets. </jats:p>",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a paradigm change involving the agri-food sector, the economic sector, and local public policies, in the direction of a diffused ecological transition. In this scenario, the Circular Economy, supported by the adoption of a Systemic Approach, represents a useful operational tool to respond to complex transversal challenges, to reduce and enhance waste, minimize the use of new raw materials, and strengthen the territorial identity and relations among local stakeholders. This article describes a research project conducted for the Piedmont Region (Italy), through which it was possible to apply these innovative tools and approaches to five typical local agri-food chains (wine, dairy and cheese, rice, water, and bovine beef). Currently, at the Piedmontese level, concrete proposals for public policies capable of supporting the ecological transition of the local agri-food chains have not yet been developed, especially in terms of cyclicality of outputs and territorial co-evolution. For this reason, through the use of a multi-stakeholder approach, participatory mechanisms of local actors, and the analysis of several national and international case studies, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the possible enhancement of food waste and by-products, finally developing specific proposals for good practices and public policies capable of contributing to the achievement of the Piedmontese Regional Strategy for Sustainable Development.</jats:p>"

The study was guided by Open systems theory as postulated by Katz and Khan (1966). The target populations were 395,003. Both probability and non-probability sampling techniques were used while questionnaire, observation, Document schedule were used to gather quantitative information from pupils, teachers, Ward Education Officer, school Committee Members and interviews were used to collect Qualitative data from District Education Officer, District planning officer and District Executive Director. Quantitative Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and qualitative by coding and creating themes and final data was merged to ensure comparison of the findings. The reliability of the instruments was tested by using the Cronbach Alpha; while conformability of qualitative data was ensured by adherence to data collection procedures and ethics. The study found shortage of teachers supply and undeveloped teachers in primary schools. From that school mapping and micro-planning were not active to ensure the supply of teachers and professional development to meet the demand in public primary schools in Arusha region. The study recommended that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) Collaborate with the President Office Regional Administrative and Local government (PO-RALG) through Departments of planning should maintain school mapping and micro-planning through training and implement at district level for teachers supply and professional development to meet the demand in public primary schools. Local government and education stakeholders should mobilize and allocate reallocation funds for teachers’ recruitment at their locality and support teachers professional development in primary schools.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of low-carbon transformation, many small and medium-sized suppliers face financial difficulties. How to encourage and motivate capital-constrained suppliers to implement low-carbon strategies has become an important problem. There is a lack of quantitative research on green financing problems in the supply chain, especially considering the bank’s green credit financing (GCF) with discounted interest rates related to a low-carbon level. This paper formulates a Stackelberg game model to analyze the green financing and emission reduction decisions of a retailer-dominated supply chain consisting of one capital-constrained supplier and one capital-sufficient retailer. The retailer’s environmental purchasing requirement is considered. The result shows that the retailer’s procurement requirement cannot always motivate the capital-constrained supplier to improve their emission reduction rate. The mixed credit mode, which includes the bank’s GCF and the retailer’s partial prepayment, can help relieve the financing pressure of the capital-constrained supplier. It is found that the GCF at a discounted interest rate can effectively improve the supplier’s emission reduction enthusiasm. This paper tries to provide some meaningful insights for the government and supply chain members when making sustainable strategies.</jats:p>"

Engle Granger cointegration analysis is considered to examine the relationship between these factors. The findings demonstrate that there is a long-term relationship between the variables. In other words, it is understood that renewable energy usage affects inflation for Turkey in the long term. Therefore, it would be appropriate for countries to prioritize renewable energy investments. In this way, countries will be able to produce their own energy, and their dependence on foreign energy will decrease. Thus, they will not be affected much by the increases in energy prices. In this context, investments should be made primarily in renewable energy technologies. </jats:p>",

The air speed in the air vent will decrease with an increase in the area, but the quantity of air supplied will increase. When the area of air vents is equal to the tunnel residual, the air supply capacity of the air vent reaches the maximum. A relationship between the quantity of air supplied and the area of the air vent is put forward, and the error with the prototype observation result is about 10%. The distribution of negative pressure in the tunnel may be improved by arranging the air vent in a proper position; the quantity of air supplied also decreases as the distance between the air vent and the pressurized conduit increases. In general, it is more advantageous to position the air vent upstream. These results provide a reference for the air ventilation design in hydraulic engineering.</jats:p>",

The characteristics of agricultural water usage and Usage Rate compared to the Permission amount (URP) threshold curve of the Seom River basin, which is defined as the thresholds of the maximum usage rate of agricultural water in each hydrological condition, were derived and analyzed using the historical record of runoff and agricultural water usage. The agricultural water supply of the Hoengseong Dam was simulated from 2006 to 2021 according to the URP threshold curve. As a result, it was found that the agricultural water usage rate of the Seom River Basin can be up to 106.5% even with the average hydrological condition compared to normal years.

The work is in two stages. In the first stage, the authors examined the document flow between the parties in customs clearance processes through three different digitalization scenarios using blockchain technology. They have come to the conclusion that rapid adaptation to innovations based on blockchain technology in the field of document management in international trade customs clearance processes is advantageous. In the second stage, they analyzed the priorities of the rational decision-making process with the NAHP method. The main challenges facing the transition to new technology are the need to train staff for new systems, the need to develop and improve new internal processes, the time spent reaching agreements with trading partners in the transition period, and the alignment of technological developments with legislation. </jats:p>",

The FMECA is a systemic process that identifies potentials failure modes within a system and was chosen for its causes and effect approach to assessing risks. The objective of the study was to assess drinking‐water supply systems and identify water supply systems' risks from source to point‐of‐use. Three major water supply sources were selected for assessment: hand‐dug wells, boreholes and public water supply sources. The sources were assessed by identifying the potential failure modes that exist within the water supply sources and the consequence of the identified risks on relevant stakeholders. The sources were divided into modules. The risk in each module was determined by multiplying failure rate (likelihood) and consequences of failure of the module. Risk reduction options include repair and maintenance measures, information dissemination on the procedures to reduce the identified risks and preventive and regulatory approaches. The resulting risks were characterized using FMECA risk matrix of each water source and classified into high, medium and low risks. Well cover and lining were the most risk‐prone modules for hand‐dug wells (high and medium risks). Broken well cover and lining serve as pathways to contaminants into the well. Casing and screen modules posed the highest risk for boreholes, recording high to medium risk. Cracked casing and broken screen provide access for contamination into boreholes. The module with the greatest risk for public water supply source was the point‐of‐abstraction/use module. Unsanitary containers and poor storage conditions is believed to be responsible for recontamination of the treated water Climate variability, environmental and anthropogenic influences were observed to be responsible for most of the identified risks. The study highlights that consumer participation is vital in ensuring the availability of safe drinking‐water, stressing consumer education as the most important channel. The study recommends the use of FMECA to ensure implementing preventive and regulatory measures by water monitoring agencies and for water resources planning and policy making.</jats:p>",

To determine the effects of Myco-Root biofertilizer and chitosan nanoparticles (Cs-NPs) on the physiological and biochemical properties of balangu (Lallemantia iberica (M.Bieb.) Fisch. &amp; C.A.Mey.) under different irrigation levels, an experiment was laid out as a factorial based on completely randomized design (CRD) with twelve treatments and three replications. The first factor was represented by different irrigation regimes, including no water deficit (90% FC), mild water deficit (60% FC) and severe water deficit (30% FC); the second factor included control (no Myco-Root and Cs-NPs), inoculation with Myco-Root biofertilizer, foliar application of chitosan nanoparticles (Cs-NPs) and co-application of Cs-NPs along with Myco-Root. The results showed that the highest fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll and carotenoid content, chlorophyll index (SPAD) and fluorescence indices were obtained in 90% FC treated with Cs-NPs+ Myco-Root. In addition, the maximum activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and peroxidase (POX) was achieved in 60% FC with application of Cs-NPs+ Myco-Root. Moreover, the maximum essential oil content (1.43%) and yield (0.25 g pot−1) were recorded in 60% FC following the application of Cs-NPs+ Myco-Root. Chemical analysis of essential oil showed that germacrene D (31.22–39.77%), (E)-caryophyllene (16.28–19.82%), bicyclogermacrene (7.1–9.22%) and caryophyllene oxide (3.85–6.96%) were the major volatile constituents of balangu. Interestingly, the maximum contents of germacrene D and (E)-caryophyllene were recorded in 60% FC after the application of Cs-NPs+ Myco-Root. Overall, it can be concluded that co-application of Cs-NPs+ Myco-Root could be a sustainable and eco-friendly strategy for improving the essential oil quantity and quality, as well as physiological characteristics, of balangu under water deficit conditions.</jats:p>"

The risk was classified into three main groups to deepen the research process: management system risks, environment risks, and process risks. This allowed for the formulation of some original conclusions. The results showed that companies implementing standardized management systems take the issue of risk analysis and management more seriously than organizations that do not implement such systems. The research also highlighted the differences in the perception of risk caused by implementing various management systems. The study also found that the industry and business profile specificity also affect the risk assessment in cooperation with suppliers.</jats:p>"

Using crop production and employment data from California counties, we estimate panel regressions linking farm employment to crop production outcomes. Because we exploit variation in equilibrium employment, as opposed to exogenous variation in the labor supply curve, we use an equilibrium displacement model to identify the most likely sources of estimation bias and conclude that our regression estimates should be interpreted as upper bounds for the effect of interest. Our results indicate that a 10% decrease in the farm labor supply (in terms of the number of workers) causes at most a 4.2% reduction in production in the top 10 fruit and vegetable producing counties. Production effects are channeled primarily through a reduction in harvested acreage, although we also uncover some effects on yield.</jats:p>",

In summary, the implementation of the PDCA cycle supervision method in the supervision of the sterile supply center in conjunction with the nursing logo is conducive to improving the quality of supervision and sterilization of all work aspects of the sterile supply center, reducing the occurrence of adverse nursing events and promoting the job satisfaction of nurses. In addition, it is conducive to standardizing the operational processes of staff, improving self-learning awareness enhancement, and improving work quality and efficiency.</jats:p>",

It is applied to optimize the discrete curtailment of solar feed-in in an electrical distribution network and guarantees network stability under fluctuating feed-in. This is modeled by a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem proposed by Aigner et al. (Eur J Oper Res (2022) <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"doi\" xlink:href=\"10.1016/j.ejor.2021.10.051\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.10.051</jats:ext-link>). The solution approach is based on the approximation of chance constraints via robust constraints using suitable uncertainty sets. The resulting robust optimization problem has a known equivalent tractable reformulation. To compute uncertainty sets that lead to an inner approximation of the stochastic problem, an R-vine copula model is fitted to the distribution of the multi-dimensional power forecast error, i.e., the difference between the forecasted solar power and the measured feed-in at several network nodes. The uncertainty sets are determined by encompassing a sufficient number of samples drawn from the R-vine copula model. Furthermore, an enhanced algorithm is proposed to fit R-vine copulas which can be used to draw conditional samples for given solar radiation forecasts. The experimental results obtained for real-world weather and network data demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of stochastic programming and model-based prediction of uncertainty via copulas. We improve the outcomes of previous work by showing that the resulting uncertainty sets are much smaller and lead to less conservative solutions while maintaining the same probabilistic guarantees.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the karst habitats with nitrate-abundant and ammonium-rare soil, the bicarbonate supply plays a crucial role in both inorganic carbon and nitrogen assimilation in various plant species. Consequently, two carbon sources, carbon dioxide (CO2) and bicarbonate (HCO3−), and two nitrogen sources, namely nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+) are available for plants. However, variations in the absorption and utilization of nitrate, ammonium, and inorganic carbon during bicarbonate supply in different plants are not well-depicted. In this study, we evaluated the nitrate/ammonium use efficiency and their contributions to the total nitrogen assimilation/utilization capacity at different bicarbonate levels using a bidirectional stable nitrogen isotope tracer approach. The inorganic carbon assimilation, such as the photosynthesis, carbon/nitrogen enzymatic activities, carbon/nitrogen content, nitrogen assimilation/utilization capacity, and nitrate/ammonium contributions to plant growth, were also evaluated to decipher the responses of both carbon and nitrogen metabolism to bicarbonate supply in karst habitats. With the increasing bicarbonate level, Orychophragmus violaceus (Ov) was found to be more available for nitrate to total nitrogen assimilation and utilization than Bn (Brassica napus). Further, it enhanced the contributions of nitrate and nitrogen accumulation/utilization capacity and inorganic carbon assimilation, increasing photosynthesis, carbon/nitrogen enzymatic activities, and carbon accumulation, and promoted the growth in Ov. Though the highest bicarbonate level was conducive to ammonium utilization and water use efficiency in both Ov and Bn, it inhibited total inorganic carbon and nitrogen assimilation, leading to growth suppression in Bn compared to Ov. Moreover, considering the optimistic responses of both carbon and nitrogen assimilation to the high bicarbonate supply in nitrate-abundant, as well as ammonium-rare, environments, we conclude that Ov was more adaptable to the karst habitats. This study provides a novel approach to elucidate the responses of nitrate/ammonium utilization and inorganic carbon assimilation to bicarbonate. Furthermore, the current study reveals the complex interactions among different carbon–nitrogen metabolism pathways in various plants and their adaptations to karst habitats.</jats:p>"

With precision farming, significant savings can be achieved by the site-specific application of fertilizers. In contrast to currently available single sensors and camera-based systems, arrays or line sensors provide a suitable spatial resolution without requiring complex signal processing and promise significant potential regarding price and precision. Such systems comprise a cost-effective and compact unit that can be extended to any working width by cascading into arrays. In this study, experiments were performed to evaluate the applicability of a TrueColor sensor array in monitoring the nitrogen supply of winter barley during its growth. This sensor is based on recording the reflectance values in various channels of the CIELab color space: luminosity, green–red, and blue–yellow. The unique selling point of this sensor is the detection of luminosity because only the CIELab color space provides this opportunity. Strong correlations were found between the different reflection channels and the nitrogen level (R² = 0.959), plant coverage (R² = 0.907), and fresh mass yield (R² = 0.866). The fast signal processing allows this sensor to meet stringent demands for the operating speed, spatial resolution, and price structure.</jats:p>"

Recently, with the Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis and the period of containment, many companies are suffering from a lack of liquidity due to the closure of certain companies.  While considering this health crisis, we will design two mathematical models: one before containment and the second after containment.

The quantitative characteristics of the operation of gas supply systems based on underground tanks when using gas with a high butane content are determined  using the main provisions of the thermodynamic equilibrium of the vapor and liquid phases in the reservoir, the conditions for ensuring the minimum overpressure of the vapor phase for natural regasification of the product, the conditions for supplying the required amount of gas to the consumer for all domestic needs during the cold season. In result, the amount of accumulated moisture in the gas storage mode and the operation of tanks is determined. The minimum level of filling the tanks with the liquid phase and the number of gas refills per year are substantiated, while providing various utility needs depending on the climatic zone of operation and the characteristics of the gas supplied facilities. It is proven, when using liquefied hydrocarbon gases with a high butane content, taking into account the accumulation of moisture in the annual cycle of operation, it is recommended to use tanks with a volume of 5.0 m3 or more when using gas for all household needs, tanks with a volume of 1.0 m3 or more when using gas only for the purpose of food preparation.</jats:p>",

Salinization usually occurs during summer dry periods as a result of long droughts and excessive pumping for water supply. The Boljkovac water supply pumping station has slightly increased parameters that indicate the possibility of salinization during the dry summer periods, but the main salinization occurs post heavy rains which appear after long dry periods in the fall, winter, and spring. Due to the occasional occurrence of salinization, continuous monitoring of the aquifer by depth was set up at the piezometric well drilled near the water supply pumping station. The results of the monitoring were analyzed in relation to external factors that can negatively affect the disruption of the labile dynamic balance of salt and fresh water. The analyzed external factors are the pumping rate for the water supply, the amount of precipitation, surface flow and the interaction of surface water and groundwater, as well as the sea level changes. In Croatia, and the wider Mediterranean area, there are a large number of springs and water wells that have the same or similar problems, so the results of this analysis can be used in designing monitoring and setting up management systems for these coastal aquifers.</jats:p>"

In this study, we selected Lake Yanlong, a representative artificial water supply lake in Yancheng City, as our experimental lake to explore how the community composition of fishes changed among different habitat types and assess potential consequences for effective water treatment. From October 2015 to October 2020, we conducted quarterly surveys of fish communities and environmental factors in the Mangshe River (MR; water for lake) compared to four different water treatment zones of Lake Yanlong (PZ, the pretreatment zone with inlet from the MR; EZ, the emergent macrophyte zone; SZ, the submerged macrophyte zone; DZ, the deep purification zone with outlet to urban waterworks). A total of 16,339 individual fish belonging to 11 families and 49 species were collected. Six of the eight dominant species observed across zones were small-bodied fishes. Despite reduced fish species richness, the relative abundance and biomass of fishes tended to be higher in Lake Yanlong relative to the MR. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou evenness index, Simpson’s diversity index all decreased from the MR to the DZ in the following sequence: MR &amp;lt; PZ &amp;lt; EZ &amp;lt; SZ &amp;lt; DZ. Analysis of similarities and similarity percentage analysis confirmed that fish communities differed significantly among zones and <jats:italic>Coilia ectenes</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Carassius auratus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Pseudobrama simony</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Hemiculter leucisculus</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Hemiculter bleekeri</jats:italic> were the major differentiating species. Mantel’s test and redundancy analysis revealed that water depth, aquatic vegetation coverage, and phytoplankton concentrations were the major factors determining the spatial distribution of fishes when moving from the MR to the DZ of Lake Yanlong. Stocking piscivorous fish can be used as an effective measure to control the abundance of prolific small-bodied fishes in Lake Yanlong. The details backing these findings are important for understanding how the community composition of fishes among habitat types in Lake Yanlong influence water quality, and to develop suitable biomanipulation strategies for the management of fish resources and maintaining proper function of these artificial water supply lakes.</jats:p>"

The relevance of research is that the comprehensive substantiation of issues aimed at ensuring the effective functioning of the electrical complex with the presence of an electric motor load in conditions of low-quality supply voltage. The aim of the work is to study the effect of the asymmetry of the supply voltage on the service life of an asynchronous motor with a short-circuited rotor. The main attention is paid to the dynamics of changes in the service life of low-voltage asynchronous electric motors of various series, depending on the level of voltage asymmetry. Asynchronous electric motors of the classic series (4A, AI) and the upgraded (5A, AI’) are identified as the object of research. As is known, the efficient and reliable operation of electric motors is characterized by the service life of the insulation of the windings. A qualitative assessment of the operational reliability of AM is determined by the accuracy of forecasting the real life of their service. That is why, it becomes obvious, the task of an adequate assessment of the operational reliability of low-voltage asynchronous electric motors operating under conditions of low-quality supply voltage directly depends on the complex of studies of such an external influencing factor as the asymmetry of the supply voltage. METHODS. The realization of the research objectives was carried out using the software package \"SimPowerSystems\" of the interactive programming environment Matlab/Simulink. RESULTS. The research was carried out on asynchronous motors with a short-circuited rotor: classic series (4A132S4, AIR160S8), upgraded series (5A132M6, AIR132S4) with P<jats:sub>H</jats:sub> = 7,5 kW, rated speed n = 1500 rpm. Modeling of the physical processes of the studied electric motors was carried out by changing the voltage asymmetry coefficient in the reverse sequence (K<jats:sub>2U</jats:sub>) from 0 to 5% in increments of 1%. Based on the obtained simulation results, diagrams of the change in the service life of AM from the magnitude of the influencing factor are constructed. The studies performed using computer modeling based on the \"SimPowerSystems\" software package of the Matlab/Simulink system made it possible to predict changes in the service life of AM, estimate the limits of permissible values of the voltage asymmetry coefficient in the reverse sequence, compare the studied electric motors by the level of resistance to an external influencing factor. CONCLUSION. A comprehensive solution to issues related to improving the operational reliability of low-voltage asynchronous electric motors is one of the priority areas, mainly aimed at ensuring the effective functioning of the electrical complex with an electric motor load. In the course of the study, a detailed assessment and analysis of the degree of influence of the asymmetry of the supply voltage on the operational reliability of low-voltage asynchronous electric motors was carried out. The results of the study were discussed, recommendations for the use of asynchronous electric motors in the presence of asymmetry of the supply voltage were formulated.</jats:p>"

According to scholars, these activities are not a pure system of Zakat provision and unable to alleviate poverty. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, this practice shifted heavily to buying food items for the poor due to the financial hurdles they confronted during the pandemic.

This study focuses on sustainable business models (SBMs) by adopting a supply chain perspective to identify the value of sustainability practices along the supply chain for different SBMs. In particular, the research investigates four small and medium‐sized enterprises (SME) case studies that have been able to implement new SBMs wisely integrating the concept of sustainability with their supply chain partners. First, the results confirm that SBMs need to be supported by strong alignment with sustainability practices within the entire supply chain to be successfully implemented. Secondly, the application of the proper practices of selection, monitoring, collaboration, and integration among supply chain partners within various SBMs is the key to achieving sustainability objectives. The paper, therefore, contributes to the debate by bringing new evidence to the SBMs topic, investigating how the success of these models is possible only through a precise definition of the relationships to be established in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Honeybees weigh the cost of flight against the benefit of nectar and pollen, which are nutritionally distinct resources that serve different purposes: bees collect nectar continuously to build large honey stores for overwintering, but they collect pollen intermittently to build modest stores for brood production periods. Therefore, nectar foraging can be considered a supply-driven process, whereas pollen foraging is demand-driven. Here we compared the foraging distances, communicated by waggle dances and serving as a proxy for cost, for nectar and pollen in three ecologically distinct landscapes in Virginia. We found that honeybees foraged for nectar at distances 14% further than for pollen across all three sites (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 6224 dances,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt; 0.001). Specific temporal dynamics reveal that monthly nectar foraging occurs at greater distances compared with pollen foraging 85% of the time.

Despite the prevalence of such incidents, we know surprisingly little about their supply chain impacts, especially in modern produce markets where contracts may impede the diffusion of price impacts through the supply chain. The November 2018 <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> incident for romaine lettuce in Central California roiled North American produce markets throughout the fall of 2018 and well into 2019. Our study of the economic impacts of this incident benefited from access to disaggregate information on prices and sales for romaine and substitute leafy greens at all stages of the supply chain, enabling us to overcome data limitations that have impeded prior studies. We decompose impacts from the incident into price and quantity components. Romaine growers were largely protected from damage due to fixed‐price provisions in grower‐processor contracts. Economic losses were incurred mostly by romaine shippers and processors, and grocery retailers who pulled saleable product from the supply chain and lost sales during and well after the incident due to reduced consumer demand. We estimate that the total societal loss from the incident was in the range of $276–$343 million. Widespread and long‐lasting impacts from a food‐safety incident demonstrate the economic benefit of industries adopting mandatory food‐safety standards and improved traceability to minimize the occurrence and impacts of such incidents.</jats:p>",

However, the complex wiring of monitoring sensors makes assembly and maintenance more difficult. This work reports a hybridized triboelectric‐electromagnetic nanogenerator (HNG) as a power supply of a self‐powered wireless monitoring system for ventilation systems. The HNG integrates an air inlet cover, a stator with coils and interdigitated copper electrodes, a rotor with magnets, fluorinated ethylene propylene films, and optimized built‐in wind blades. The HNG scavenges wind energy from a ventilation system and serves as a power supply for electric applications. Under the wind speed of 6.5 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the ventilation system, the maximum stabilized voltage and maximum instantaneous current of the HNG are 177.5 V and 0.049 A, which can charge smartphones and light up a bulb. Furthermore, the HNG realizes the self‐powered wireless transmission of temperature and humidity sensing nodes. This work demonstrates an effective wind energy harvester, providing an innovative strategy for monitoring the condition of the ventilation system and broadening the thoughts of prospective energy harvesting.</jats:p>",

We estimated the district-level dietary mineral supply of staple cereals, combining district-level cereal production and crop mineral composition data, assuming cereal consumption of 300 g capita−1 day−1 proportional to district-level production quantity of each cereal. We considered Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), maize (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), teff (Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) consumption representing 93.5% of the total cereal production in the three major agrarian regions. On average, grain cereals can supply 146, 23, and 7.1 mg capita−1 day−1 of Ca, Fe, and Zn, respectively. In addition, the Se supply was 25 µg capita−1 day−1. Even at district-level, cereals differ by their mineral composition, causing a wide range of variation in their contribution to the daily dietary requirements, i.e., for an adult woman: 1–48% of Ca, 34–724% of Fe, 17–191% of Se, and 48–95% of Zn. There was considerable variability in the dietary supply of Ca, Fe, Se, and Zn from staple cereals between districts in Ethiopia.</jats:p>"

The robust newsvendor model is designed to solve the problem. Our results show that implementing an advance selling strategy is always beneficial from the demand uncertainty perspective to the seller. However, sellers should choose advance selling carefully from the standpoint of supply uncertainty: sellers will non‐advance selling under certain conditions. This condition is contingent on the market, capacity level, selling price, supply–demand correlation, consumer characteristics, and seller's pricing power. Interestingly, pricing power is the key driver to stimulate advance selling under supply uncertainty. In addition, the impact of supply and demand uncertainty and supply–demand correlation on these strategies are related to price discounts.</jats:p>",

This study uses an environmental extended multi-regional input–output (EEMRIO) model to analyze the impact of embodied emissions on the indirect CO2 emission intensity of coal production between China’s coal mining sector and 141 countries/regions. It is found that the CO2 emission intensity of China’s coal production was 34.14 gCO2/MJ in 2014, while the direct and indirect emission intensities were 16.22 gCO2/MJ and 17.92 gCO2/MJ, respectively. From 2007 to 2014, the direct emission intensity of China’s coal production increased by 23%, while the indirect emission intensity decreased by 30%. The key material and service inputs affecting indirect carbon emissions of coal production in China are electricity service, metal manufacturing, chemical products, coal mining, and transport, which accounted for 85.5% of the total indirect emission intensity of coal production in 2014. Globally, a large portion of CO2 from Chinese coal production is emitted to meet foreign direct and indirect demands for material and service inputs.

As only 14% of German households are supplied with renewable energy, a shift is necessary. This shift should be realized with the lowest possible environmental impact. This paper assesses the environmental impacts of changes in energy generation and distribution, by integrating the life cycle assessment (LCA) method into energy system models (ESM). (2) The integrated LCA is applied to a case study of the German neighborhood of Herne, (i) to optimize the energy supply, considering different technologies, and (ii) to determine the environmental impacts of the base case (status quo), a cost-optimized scenario, and a CO2-optimized scenario. (3) The use of gas boilers in the base case is substituted with CHPs, surface water heat pumps and PV-systems in the CO2-optimized scenario, and five ground-coupled heat pumps and PV-systems for the cost-optimized scenario. This technology shift led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of almost 40% in the cost-optimized, and more than 50% in the CO2-optimized, scenario. However, technology shifts, e.g., due to oversized battery storage, risk higher impacts in other categories, such as terrestrial eco toxicity, by around 22%. Thus, it can be recommended to use smaller battery storage systems. (4) By combining ESM and LCA, additional environmental impacts beyond GHG emissions can be quantified, and therefore trade-offs between environmental impacts can be identified. Furthermore, only applying ESM leads to an underestimation of greenhouse gas emissions of around 10%. However, combining ESM and LCA required significant effort and is not yet possible using an integrated software.</jats:p>"

The concept of \"green\" technologies has been clarified as technologies that use environmentally safe production processes and supply chains in comparison with the production methods traditionally used at enterprises. The role and opportunities of Ukrainian environmental logistics in the European Green Deal have been studied. It has been established that the European Green Deal is a program of the European Union aimed at protecting the climate and the environment. This program is aimed at making the economies of the European Union countries more resource-efficient, canceling greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and separating economic growth from the use of natural resources. Currently, Ukraine is only planning to join the European Green Deal, declaring in the National Economic Strategy the intention to achieve climate neutrality by 2060. The state and general trends of the development of strategic logistics infrastructure projects of Ukraine in the context of the implementation of the Green Deal and Digital Europe programs are analyzed. The Europian Green Deal is a dynamic instrument that is at the stage of formation. The purpose of the article is the development of theoretical and methodological foundations, applied recommendations regarding the prospects of \"green\" technologies in the logistics activities of Ukrainian enterprises: their concepts and features of implementation within the framework of the European Green Deal and Digital Europe programs, \"European Union for the Environment\" (EU4Environment), development of sustainable logistics in Ukraine, features of application in specific logistics processes, problems and prospects, logistics strategy of Ukrainian enterprises. The process of applying \"green\" technologies in supply chain management is analyzed. In the logistics chain, processes related to supply, production, warehousing, transportation and distribution are involved, therefore, logistics activities are focused not only on the internal business processes of the enterprise, but also have a significant impact on the environment and contribute to the emergence of negative environmental consequences. In connection with the above, the concept of \"green\" (sustainable) supply chains, which provides for a minimal harmful impact on the environment during the implementation of logistics business processes, has recently become widespread.</jats:p>"

In UFAD systems, an underfloor plenum delivers conditioned air to the air supply diffusers. The distribution of internal air velocity and static pressure in plenums determines the uniformity of the airflow to the occupied zones. As a result, the plenum has a detrimental effect on the characteristics of the supply air and, thus, the resulting indoor air quality and thermal comfort. Nevertheless, most existing studies on underfloor plenums focused on small-scale plenums with a single internal air duct. Large plenums and multiple air ducts in UFAD equipped in large premises are underexplored. In this study, a circular underfloor plenum with a large scale (radius of 15 m, height difference of 0.9−2.9 m) and 503 under-seat diffusers in a conference room was studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation (ANSYS Fluent (16.0)). The distributions of airflow velocity and static pressure inside the plenum were analyzed and compared to one concentrated air supply mode and three uniform air supply modes. Based on the air velocity at the center of under-seat diffusers, the outgoing airflow uniformity from the diffusers under four cases was evaluated by the index of air velocity uniformity. The results showed that the multiple supply ducts with bottom air outlets yielded the best uniformity of supply air. The findings of this paper are expected to provide a technical basis for realizing the optimal design of the UFAD system in terms of uniformity of supply air.</jats:p>"

This work tries to examine the domestic water coping strategies in the community in terms of water access, sources, practices, barriers, cultural influences, and other environmental issues. These factors were investigated through qualitative research methods. Major water sources in the community include surface sources, rainwater harvesting, and sachet water, while the main water coping practices are water storage, water sharing, and buying water from vendors.

The experimental design was a randomized block design, with four replicates. The sulfur doses applied at topdressing fertilization were 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha-1 of S, in addition to the control treatment (dose zero). Regarding the treatments with organic compost, the dose of 70 t ha-1 of compost (wet basis) was supplied at planting. The following characteristics were evaluated: seed production (mass and number of seeds per plant), seed quality (mass of one thousand seeds, first count of the standard germination test, germination percentage, and germination speed index) and content of macronutrients and mineral accumulation. The organic compost supply at planting increased seed production by 43% compared to the treatment without the application of organic compost, while the doses of sulfur did not affect the production of lettuce seeds. The supply of organic compost increased the accumulation of a great part of the macronutrients, except for the accumulation of calcium. The lettuce seeds quality was not affected by both the main treatments, the sulfur doses at topdressing and the organic compost supply at planting.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim: to assess the state of pharmaceutical provision of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease in Ukraine in accordance with international recommendations.\r\nMaterials and methods. In our studies, we used data from international guidelines, clinical protocols that regulate the organization of medical and pharmaceutical care for these patients in the USA, Australia, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Finland, India, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The actual state of pharmaceutical provision of these patients in Ukraine was studied using a depersonalized database of medical prescriptions, which operates based on a number of specialized healthcare institutions. In addition, data from the Morion information search system were used. We used general theoretical (historical, formal, graphic, hypothetical-deductive, etc.) and applied (clinical-economic, organizational-economic, mathematical-statistical, etc.) research methods.\r\nResults. It has been established that a consolidated opinion has been formed in the world scientific community regarding the possibility of effective use in the pathogenetic treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease of drugs from the groups N06DA Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N06DX-Other drugs for use in case of dementia. Thus, the pharmaceutical component of international recommendations, clinical protocols for the treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease contains four drugs used in pathogenetic therapy. These are N06DA02 Donepezil, N06DA03 Rivastigmine, N06DA04 Galantamine and N06DX01 Memantine. It has been reported that all the above drugs are included in the domestic clinical protocol for the treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the State Drug Formulary (with the exception of N06DA03 Rivastigmine), and the State Drug Registry. At the same time, all of them were absent from the National List of Essential Drugs, which has an important socio-economic and medical-pharmaceutical significance in the health care system. It was found that patients (200 people) received 2487 prescriptions (100.0 %), among which 9.41 % (234 prescriptions) were drugs used in pathogenetic treatment. There is a highly disproportionate nature of the distribution of prescriptions and consumption by international generic names of drugs. Thus, drugs N06DX01 Memantine accounted for 80.41 % (188 prescriptions) of all prescriptions in the group N06D Drugs for use in dementia, and the consumption rate was UAH 84420.20, which accounted for 91.48 % of the amount of expenses directed to patients with carrying out pathogenetic treatment. Significant dominance of drugs N06DX01 Memantine in the structure of prescriptions and consumption indicates the presence of severe, advanced forms of dementia in patients. This fact once again emphasizes the need for early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, primarily for the rational use of limited health care resources. We have found that there are no prescriptions for N06D A04 Galantamine preparations, which are recommended by the relevant international recommendations in different countries of the world, as well as by the domestic clinical protocol for the pathogenetic treatment of mild and moderate forms of Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, N06DA05 Ipidacrine preparations were used in the treatment of domestic patients, which are not presented in the pharmaceutical component of international recommendations and protocols governing the pathogenetic treatment of the above-mentioned groups of neuropsychiatric patients.\r\nConclusions. The peculiarities of the formation of the pharmaceutical component in the organization of the treatment process of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease in Ukraine, established by us, allow further research on the development of rational ways of resource provision of neuropsychiatric patients</jats:p>"

The recently built upstream Xiluodu, Wudongde, Xiangjiaba and Beihtan dams have altered the ecohydrology of mainstream and tributaries, so nutrients regime during pre and post dam stages are comparatively investigated here. Although total phosphorus (TP) increased at the lower reach, eutrophication remained TP limited with few exceptions. Maximum supply from main stream, potential of water exchange on surface corresponding to increased overflow intrusion facilitated increased average total nitrogen (TN) at euphotic zone in XXB by 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/L respectively since 2014. Eutrophication and algal growth in XXB remained TP limited with few exceptions at the upper reach. Average TN increased by 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches respectively in Late March since 2014 compared to those in early years. It increased by 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches in Early April since 2014. It increased by 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches in mid April since 2014. It increased slightly at the upper reach, 0.6 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.9 mg/L at the lower reach during late April. It increased slightly at the upper reach and by 0.3 mg/L at the middle reach and by 0.5 mg/L at the lower reaches corresponding to either of the patterns. During mid May, it remained the same at the upper reach, decreased by 0.2 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.5 mg/L at the lower reach. During late May, it remained the same at the upper reach, decreased by 0.4 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.6 mg/L at the lower reaches. These statistics indicate average an increase in TN in spring except in late May .TN concentration was beyond danger limit sustaining and prolonging eutrophication status in spring. As overflow, interflow and upper interflow patterns are prevalent in random order so nutrients could not be predicted theoretically, however nutrients management from non-point sources and the main supplier Three Gorges Reservoir is advisable.</jats:p>",

Therefore, we have modeled a platform supply chain using game theory, in which the manufacturer conducts green research and development (R&amp;D) activities, the third-party platform conducts data-driven marketing (DDM) activities to promote green products, and all consumers have green preferences. The numerical example and empirical analysis methods are used to mine management insights. The government subsidizes the manufacturer’s green R&amp;D, the third-party platform’s DDM, and the consumers’ green consumption. The third-party platform provides an agency selling or reselling strategy to sell products. Our results show that: (1) the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to green R&amp;D and DDM activities has positive impacts on all members’ profits and on the green R&amp;D level of products in the platform supply chain, with three kinds of government subsidy policies. (2) The levels of the three kinds of government subsidies mainly have an impact on all members’ profits and on the green R&amp;D level of products in the platform supply chain with an agency selling or reselling strategy; government subsidies to the manufacturer are more conducive to improving the green R&amp;D level of products. (3) The levels of the three government subsidies and the unit service commissioning fee for selling products are the main factors affecting the preferred selling strategy of each member and the equilibrium of the selling strategy.</jats:p>"

Rational N application is one of the key ways to improve a crop’s high and stable yield and economic and environmental benefits. The N nutrition level of potato regulates the gene expression of enzymes related to the N metabolism pathway, which shows the change of the activity of key enzymes in N metabolism, and finally realizes the regulation of N absorption and utilization. In this study, the key enzyme genes and enzyme activity of different genotypes of potato under different N supply treatments were identified, which laid a foundation for further exploration of the functions of each gene in the potato N metabolism pathway and provided theoretical basis for rational N application. The results showed that the relative expression levels of StNRT1.5, StNR, StNiR in leaves, StNRT2.5, StNRT2.4, StGS1-2 in roots and StNRT2.7, StGS1-3, StGS2, StGS1-4, StFd-GOGAT in leaves and roots showed that the levels of N-inefficient potato Atlantic (A) were higher than the N-efficient potato Yanshu 4 (Y), while the relative expression levels of StNRT2.5, StGS1-2 in leaves, StNRT1.5StNR, StNiR in roots and StGDH, StNADH-GOGAT in leaves and roots showed that levels in Yanshu 4 (Y) were higher than in Atlantic (A). At the same time, we especially found that the GDH activity in the leaves of the two genotypes of potato were higher at low N levels. Additionally, the activity of NR and NiR, and the activity of GS and GOGAT were correlated. In addition, the changes of key enzymes in different N metabolism showed a certain continuity with the advancement of growth and development, and some gene expression rules and enzyme activity changes also showed a certain consistency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The flexible nature of on-demand ride services provided by transportation network companies (TNC) has resulted in unique supply-side challenges as the industry deals with the COVID-19 pandemic. Early during the pandemic, there was a 70% decrease in the number of drivers accepting trips on TNC platforms, as individual drivers chose to reduce their risk of viral infection and abide by social distancing recommendations. Given the two-sided market nature of TNCs, the decrease was also the effect of reduced rider demand creating a less desirable driver experience. This paper characterizes and quantifies this change in supply as it relates to driver residency, tenure, attrition, and the number of trips provided. The distribution of drivers accepting trips shifted slightly toward the lower income and higher minority areas of Chicago. Using survival analysis methods, we find that retention among drivers who started in the early months of the pandemic was significantly lower than in reference years, after six months of driving. The results of the negative binomial regression show that drivers on a single TNC platform provided 20% less trips than drivers on multiple platforms. This difference increases to 30% during the pandemic. Additionally, new drivers joined multiple apps during COVID-19, likely to serve more trips and secure higher income. The results of this paper can be used to understand and target driver retention to accelerate the recovery of the TNC industry. </jats:p>",

Compared with traditional OCAJBs, under high gas supply pressure, supersonic phenomena occur near the gas film inlet in both the MGOAJB and the OCAJB. The Mach number, maximum pressure, temperature and Reynolds number of the OCAJB are higher than those of the MGOAJB, but the MGOAJB has a more stable gas film pressure due to pressure equalization. As the gas film thickness of the MGOAJB increases, the Mach number, Reynolds number and temperature near the gas film inlet increase, but the pressure decreases, the recovery of the pressure and temperature becomes more obvious when the gas velocity drops to a subsonic speed. With increases in the MGOAJB orifice diameter, the pressure, temperature and Reynolds number increase, the Mach number decreases, and the recovery of the pressure and gas temperature becomes more obvious. </jats:p>",

Trihalomethanes (THMs) are the most common DBPs found in swimming pool water. Developing a predictive THM model is an efficient and promising way to optimize the chlorine dosage and guarantee water safety. Because the main components of swimmer inputs and their respective quantities have been formalized and determined through body fluid analogs (BFA), the model development can rely on the chlorination of BFA components and mixtures. In this study, a well-established second-order reaction chlorine decay model with a variable reaction rate coefficient was expanded to describe the chlorine consumption in swimming pool water. The THM model with a variable formation coefficient was first developed based on the identical assumption of the chlorine model, that is, the reactivity of the reactants decreases as the reaction progresses. The results showed that uric acid exhibited the fastest initial rate coefficient for chlorine decay. Although citric acid showed a considerably high specific THM formation potential (μmol-THM, species/mg productive chlorine consumption), urea and humic acid (HA) were attributed to the fast-reacting THM formation precursors. The rate coefficients of urea and HA were higher than that of citric acid. For the mixture, the (overall) reaction rate coefficients were formulated as a function of the rate coefficient of the individual substance and the concentration of the substance remaining in the water. This concept was tested using BFA and BFA with HA. The model accurately described the chlorine consumption and THM concentrations (R2 &amp;gt; 0.96).</jats:p>",

Specifically, in this paper, the indexes at various levels are selected through literature mining and text analysis, and the mutual influence degrees among index are determined with the help of DEMATEL, so that the causality diagram can be drawn. On this basis, we obtain the global weight and the mixed weight of each index by using the ANP method and SD (Super Decisions) software, thus determining the relative importance of each index. The study finds that with regard to the SSC collaborative governance capability of WDPs, the highest requirement is made on Information Collaboration Capability (ICC) which also provides the foundational guarantee. The proportion carried by Subject Participation and Collaboration Capability (SPCC) is the lowest, however, its mixed weight is 1.9077, second only to ICC. Both Water Quantity Collaboration Capability (WQCC) and Water Quality Assurance Coordination Capacity (WQACC) account for a high percentage, which is consistent with the actual situation. The study provides a capability evaluation index system for the SSC collaborative governance of WDPs, enriches the theory of SSC collaborative governance of WDPs, and provides decision-making support for the operation and management of WDPs.</jats:p>",

In this context, research has been carried out using both the AHP and the DEMATEL methods. A comprehensive literature review was carried out, and four different criteria were determined. In order to determine which of these criteria is more important, an analysis was carried out using these two different methods. According to the results obtained, it has been determined that the use of renewable energy is the most important factor in eliminating the inflation caused by energy prices in the health sector. Because the best criterion is the same for both the results of AHP and DEMATEL, this situation gives information about the coherency and reliability of the study. Hence, appropriate strategies can be provided based on these results to minimize the inflation problem in the healthcare industry. The findings indicate that it would be appropriate for hospitals to give importance to the use of renewable energy. In this way, hospitals will be able to produce the energy they need themselves. </jats:p>",

Then, modeling the relationship between inventory cost savings and supply chain success factors is a route for stating such a determination. This is particularly important in pharmacies and food nutrition services (FNS), where the advances made on this topic are still scarce. In this article, we propose and formulate a robust compromise (RoCo) multi-criteria model based on non-linear programming and time-dependent demand. The novelty of our proposal is in defining a score that allows us to measure the mentioned success factors in a simple way, in meeting together all three elements (RoCo multi-criteria, non-linear programming, and time-dependent demand) to state a new model, and in applying it to pharmacies and FNS. This model relates inventory cost savings for pharmacy/FNS and success factors across their supply chains. Savings of inventory costs are predicted by lot sizes to be purchased and computed by comparing optimal and true inventory costs. We utilize a system that records the movements and costs of products to collect the data. Factors, such as purchasing organization, economies of scale, and synchronized supply, are assumed using the purchase system, with these factors ranked on a Likert scale. We consider multilevel relationships between savings obtained for 79 pharmacy/FNS products, and success factor scores according to these products. To deal with the endogeneity bias of the relationships proposed, internal instrumental variables are employed by utilizing generalized statistical moments. Among our main conclusions, we state that the greatest cost savings obtained from inventory models are directly associated with low-success supply chain factors. In this association, the success factors operate as endogenous variables, with respect to inventory cost savings, given the simultaneity of their relationship with cost savings when inventory decision-making.</jats:p>"

The results show that the DCC of WEFE in the Yangtze River Delta shows obvious spatial-temporal characteristics.

The endowment in the Lithium Triangle is significant, and the expectations for the global supply are high in terms of resources and sustainability. In this paper, we investigate the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges to the future of sustainable lithium extraction. We undertook a qualitative analysis to prioritise the risks associated with these challenges and discussed their interlinkages. We argue that a sustainable perspective for lithium extraction in the region requires continuous and informed dialogue among government, industry and community stakeholders and participatory processes that reduce the asymmetries of power and knowledge. We provide a list of urgent mitigation actions that could assist the move towards sustainability. These include the following. First is expanding our understandings of the water cycle of lithium brines in this region. This should be underpinned by baseline data and ongoing monitoring at the watershed scale, capacity building to strengthen institutions, improved regulations and data infrastructures to promote data transparency and accessibility. Second is integrating biodiversity impacts within existing mining practices and procedures (e.g. Environmental Impact Assessments — EIA). We propose the strategic implementation of the mitigation hierarchy and IFC’s Performance Standards to avoid, reduce and offset the risks of lithium extraction on ecosystem services and critically important biodiversity impacts. Third is strengthening social participatory processes that enable the local communities to become actors in decision-making and the ongoing management and monitoring of lithium projects. Fourth is establishing a framework to support a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) process specific to lithium with a regional approach in the Lithium Triangle.</jats:p>",

Twelve experts participated in the expert-based assessment by filling individual matrices for the potential of the NH to provide ES. We analysed the results i.e. individual scores by comparing them, and calculating the minimum, the maximum and the range scores between them. We calculated the mean individual experts’ scores by ecosystem types and subtypes for nine prioritized ecosystem services for recreation – 2 provisioning, 2 regulating and 5 cultural. The results show that individual experts have different perceptions for some ecosystems and their services due to their different scientific expertise. This follows from the quite high ranges i.e., 4 or 5 units between maximum and minimum score per spatial unit. There are: (i) significant variations in scoring of Grasslands, Wetlands, Croplands, Rivers and lakes, and Urban ecosystems; and (ii) considerable similarities about Woodland and forest, Sparsely vegetated lands and Marine ecosystems. To compare the spatial discrepancies between the experts’ scores, we map them individually. A final integrated map represents the potential of the NH in Bulgaria to provide ecosystem services for recreation with an average score above 3.00.

Unlike most previous studies, the results of this study found that the level of work stress of employees is quite high (4.03 points) and is positively affected by the transactional leadership style, while that of transformational leadership style will reduce stress levels. The study also found that, although the level of work stress was high, the intention to quit was quite low; the older the workers, the lower the intention to quit; and women have a higher intention to quit than men. However, this study has many limitations when it does not consider factors affecting work stress and intention to leave other jobs such as job satisfaction, working environment, etc. Research results provide a theoretical and practical basis for leaders at supply enterprises in adjusting human resource management policies to reduce stress for employees and enhance long-term commitment. with the company.</jats:p>",

In order to reduce the harm of carbon dioxide to the global ecological environment, the use of natural gas instead of coal is a realistic choice for China to achieve the “dual carbon” goal. Opportunities also bring new challenges, and the price of natural gas is an important method of promoting the upstream and downstream industrial chains of natural gas, so it is of great practical significance to study the price of natural gas. This paper builds a three-level supply chain model consisting of suppliers in the natural gas market, city gas companies and consumers in the market and uses the Stackelberg game to study the decision-making models of different subjects under their own dominance and centralized decision-making; it also considers the pricing mechanism and profit situation of stakeholders in the natural gas market under the low-carbon preference of consumers and the level of corporate carbon emission reduction. The research results show that when considering consumers’ low-carbon preferences, the sales prices of various stakeholders in the market have increased, which is beneficial for all entities in the natural gas industry chain. At the same time, with the low-carbon transformation of energy companies, the production method drives the price of raw materials to rise in the process of low-carbon innovation, which, in turn, makes the price of various stakeholders in the natural gas market and the level of carbon emission reduction per unit show a positive relationship; in order to maximize the overall profit of the supply chain, the natural gas market should adopt a centralized decision-making method to further promote the reform of China’s natural gas marketization.</jats:p>"

In this study, nine strains of brackish diatoms isolated from water and sediment samples from several evaporation ponds in California and Arizona were examined for their ability to assimilate silica and remove other constituents from RO concentrate. In addition to two previously reported strains, namely Gedaniella flavovirens PEWL001 and Nitzschia communis PEWL002, several new isolates including Halamphora sydowii PEWL004, Nitzschia sp. PEWL008, and Halamphora sp. PEWL011 were found to remove more than 95% of silica, 95% of ammonia and orthophosphate, and more than 50% of calcium and carbonate within 6 days. Two additional G. flavovirens strains (Psetr3 and Psetr7) collected from a brackish lake in Aomori, Japan, also showed rapid dissolved silica uptake (32 mg L−1 day−1) comparable to the one isolated from an agricultural drainage water evaporation pond in the Central Valley, California. This study demonstrated that the brackish diatoms isolated from the evaporation ponds could be useful for the treatment of RO concentrate, which would possibly enable more sustainable desalination processes.</jats:p>",

Such a structure causes biodeterioration, i.e. biological degradation of technical materials. The issue is of high importance in the case of distribution of treated water to end-point consumers. An important factor determining the formation of biofilm is the type and character of the surface which can stimulate or inhibit its growth. The article presents innovative results of research involving measurement of growth of biofilm on technical materials used for the construction of water supply networks by means of an impedance sensor. The research was conducted at a laboratory scale continuously for 6 months, reflecting actual conditions occurring in water distribution systems. After half a year culture of environmental microorganisms in the bioreactor, an almost 100% increase in the value of relative impedance was recorded by means of a sensor placed inside the bioreactor. A comparison of the surface coverage of technical materials and the sensor with bacteria (fluorescence in situ hybridization) showed that the sensor could be used for technical materials made of polybutylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. Observations (scanning electron microscopy) of the surface of the plastics used to build the water supply network pipes (new materials, with biofilm present, and after detaching the biofilm) showed significant changes in the structures of the materials due to biofilm formation. The largest changes in the structure were observed on the polyethylene and polypropylene surfaces. The proposed sensor could be applied in the measurements of biofilm adhesion to selected technical materials.</jats:p>",

Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain’s transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item’s authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m2 cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system. By 2050, the world’s population will need a 70% increase in food production. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model.

Thus, despite the lack of definition of the regulations on these contracts by the Superintendence of Private Insurance (Susep), this article’s contribution lies in evaluating UL - a typically American product - in Brazil, using an entirely actuarial methodology, for policyholders and insurers, according to local parameters. The relevance of the article lies in strengthening the support for individuals, companies, and authorities to evaluate the product and discuss its implementation, even identifying the most favorable profiles and scenarios for its development. Although the UL is an individual modality that is widespread in several countries and its design exploits well-defined attractions, the product has not been explored in the national literature. The methodology adoted in this study used fully actuarial modeling, the internal rate of return (IRR), and profit testing. The study reveals that the Brazilian market for UL is viable, especially due to the higher interest rates compared to countries where the product is already widespread. From a demand perspective, the results indicate that the policyholder would be in a more advantageous position acquiring UL than buying life insurance in the private market and investing the surplus in financial assets, due to the hybrid characteristic of the contract, which enables the use of financial returns as discount factors in the insurance portion and operational charges, reducing the opportunity costs linked to the product. With regard to companies, the profit testing results suggest there are stimuli for the supply of UL, provided the operation has a long-term bias. Altering the mortality pattern, policy type, and the company’s investment profile, all the results point in a similar direction.</jats:p>"

They also play a key role during the water filling and drainage stages in pipeline systems. However, systematic guidelines for the selection of air valve parameters are lacking. In practical engineering applications, the selection is mainly based on personal experience. If the selected parameters are not appropriate, negative pressures can occur in a pipeline due to insufficient air inflow or destructive water hammer pressures with column separation and rejoinder, which are caused by rapid air discharge. Given the subjectivity of the selection of air valve parameters in engineering applications, this paper introduces the structure and working principle of two different types of air valves. Combined with engineering examples, the one-dimensional transient flow elastic model and the characteristic method are used to conduct numerical simulations in MATLAB to investigate the influences of the air valve type, the inlet and outlet orifice diameters, and the inflow and outflow discharge coefficients on protection against water hammer with column separation and rejoinder. The inflow and outflow coefficients of the anti-slam air valve have a slight influence on preventing water hammers with column separation and rejoinder. The research results provide a theoretical basis for the rational selection of air valves in practical engineering applications.</jats:p>",

Unlike other models in the literature, the location of the NG and LNG facilities and routing of vehicles of different modes are optimized by considering the minimization of costs by using the 𝜺 – Constraint method, and different transportation modes, like sea, road, and pipeline, are used together for better effectiveness and cost reduction.

Hence, this paper develops a volume of fluid (VOF) model to study pressure surges in a two shafts and one tunnel system. Research works under different initial air-pocket parameters are carried out, while the VOF model is verified by the empty tunnel water filling experiment in the same system. The results show that the maximum pressure increases with an initial length/diameter ratio decrease or air volume fraction increase. Also, the extreme pressure with entrapped air-pocket at a certain scale can reach 1.6 times the static pressure (30 m). With the increase of initial air volume fraction, the frequency of pressure surges slows down, while the maximum pressure gradually increases and approaches a specific value within a fixed air volume fraction range (0.2–5.0%). The maximum pressure of air-pocket at different initial positions shows a downward trend from the middle of the tunnel to two sides, while the pressure of the air-pocket near a higher shaft will be slightly higher. The proposed model can be extended to systems with multiple shafts or air-pockets, and the conclusions have reference significance for structure design and water filling control in the DSST.</jats:p>",

Spatial heterogeneity of ES supply–demand, ES tradeoffs, and the socioecological environment calls for zoning management, while few studies have combined the above three aspects in dividing management zones and proposed strategies. Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia in northwestern China as a case study, this study quantified the supply and demand for five key ESs (crop production, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and recreational opportunity), analyzed ES tradeoffs/synergies and bundles through correlation analysis and the self-organizing map (SOM) method, and investigated their socioecological driving mechanisms through a random forest model and the SOM method. Management zones were proposed and differentiated suggestions were provided through overlaying ES bundles and driver clusters. The results suggested that crop production, carbon sequestration, and nutrient retention mostly correlated to the same intrinsic ecological process, resulting in consistent synergies among these three ESs at both supply and demand sides. On the contrary, the variance in interactions between the two ESs of sand fixation and recreational opportunity and the other three ESs is due to the low similarity of their intrinsic ecological processes and external driving mechanisms. Fourteen socioecological factors could effectively explain the spatial heterogeneity of ES supply, demand, and match degree. Fourteen management zones with similar ecological problems and socioecological environments were delineated, and differentiated suggestions were provided for each zone. Adopting both ES characteristics and the socioecological environment into zoning management could effectively detect ecological problems and help to promote management suggestions in different socioecological contexts. This framework could offer new insights for integrating ESs into actual decision-making and ecosystem management.</jats:p>"

The degradation kinetics of OFL under different ClO2 concentrations, pH and pipe materials, and formation of intermediates, as well as the toxicity of water in water supply systems were first studied. The results showed that the degradation of OFL in PE pipe and deionized water increased with the increase of ClO2 concentration, and the reaction of OFL followed the second-order kinetic model. The removal rate of OFL in deionized water was faster than that in PE pipe. The degradation rate of OFL in PE tube and deionized water were positively correlated with pH. In addition, degradation efficiency of OFL in different pipes followed: cast iron pipe &amp;gt; stainless steel pipe &amp;gt; PE pipe. The detection of OFL intermediates showed that the cleavage of piperazine groups were the main and initial products in the degradation process of OFL. In addition, the decarboxylation intermediates of quinolone groups were also detected. The aquatic toxicity test showed that the degradation of OFL by ClO2 would increase the toxicity of water, therefore, the decrease of OFL may not mean the decrease of water toxicity.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers develop a community of interest by forming long-term strategic partnerships with suppliers and vendors throughout the supply chain. This paper defines supply chain management by reviewing the existing literature and discusses the current state of supply chain management research, as well as prospective research directions. Specifically, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the influential studies of SCM in terms of various aspects, such as research areas, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors and corresponding authors, most cited publications, and author keywords, based on the 8998 reviews and articles collected from the SCI and SSCI database of the Web of Science (WoS) between 2010 and 2020. The results show that the major research areas were Management (3071, 34.13%), Operations Research &amp; Management Science (2680, 29.78%), and Engineering, Industrial (1854, 20.60%) with TP and TPR%. The most productive journal and institution were J. Clean Prod and Hong Kong Polytech Univ with a TP of 554 and 238, respectively. China, USA, and UK were the top three contributing countries. Furthermore, “sustainability”, “green supply chain (management)”, and “sustainable supply chain (management)” were the most popular author keywords in recent three years and since 2010, apart from the author keywords of SCM. When combined with the most cited articles in recent years, the application of block chain and Industry 4.0 in supply chain management increased rapidly and generated great attention.</jats:p>"

Sustainable supply chain management should pursue economic, environmental, and social activities simultaneously, and decision making such as coordination and resource allocation among these activities is inevitably important. Therefore, this study examines the role of dynamic and ambivalence capacities of adjustment and resource allocation among various factors affecting sustainable supply chain management, and conducts an empirical analysis focusing on the process of performance creation between purchasers and customers. Accordingly, a survey was conducted on those in charge of managing supply chain management in a company, and 296 valid questionnaires were analyzed to verify the research hypothesis. The analysis revealed that both dynamic and ambivalent competences have a positive effect on the economic, environmental, and social activities of sustainable supply chain management. Conversely, economic and social activities have a positive effect on both supplier and purchasing company performance, whereas environmental activities do not have any effect. Furthermore, the result of suppliers through sustainable supply chain activity was confirmed to have a positive effect on the performance of the purchaser. The findings are meaningful in that they present theoretical grounds for the importance of coordination and resource allocation among the three main aspects that constitute sustainable supply chain activities and empirically suggest that dynamic and ambivalent capabilities can serve as a significant preceding factor in creating results.</jats:p>",

Suppliers are likely to put more limited capacity into completing orders, thus ignoring the quality of products. This will easily lead to the occurrence of product quality events, and then affect the goodwill of enterprise products. The innovations of this paper are as follows: first, based on the above facts, a negative and dynamic correlation between the delivery level and the quality level is established, which has been involved in previous studies. Second, the joint decision model of timely delivery, product quality, and marketing is constructed. Thirdly, centralized decision-making is the best way of supply chain cooperation, and cost sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain. This paper provides guidance for enterprise managers when making decisions on quality, marketing and delivery. It also provides the basis for enterprise managers to formulate effective cooperation models. We can draw some research implications: when consumers are less sensitive to timely delivery, enterprises should give some coupons and small gifts to consumers in exchange for the extension of delivery time and put their limited capacity into improving the product quality. When consumers are highly sensitive to timely delivery, they can outsource some orders to cost-effective and professional third-party enterprises, which not only improves the delivery rate but also improves the product quality.</jats:p>"

There are three key findings: (1) the main variation value of indicators has evolved from the quantity of housing supply to the quality of population growth, improving the quality of population growth has been the key factor to break the insufficient balance of indicators; (2) the coupling degree is high but the coordination degree is obviously low, the aggregation level of coupling coordination degree is generally middle, and there is obviously spatial polarization—improving the degree of coordination is the key point to break the inadequate balance of cities; (3) the coupling coordination degree is irregularly distributed in 11 urban agglomerations, the spatial correlation of coupling coordination degree is generally weak, improving the spatial coordination degree of urban agglomeration will contribute to improving the balanced sufficiency level, and the spatial coupling coordination degree is also expected to increase. This study presents a new perspective for exploring spatial coordination between population growth, land use and housing supply, which proposes a new approach to investigate quantitative interaction and spatial correlation of urban agglomeration in China.</jats:p>"

A few major clades of the <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic> complex belonging to lineage 2, responsible for high prevalence of MDR-TB in Eurasia, show outstanding transnational distributions. Here, we determined factors underlying the emergence and epidemic spread of the W148 clade by genome sequencing and Bayesian demogenetic analyses of 720 isolates from 23 countries. We dated a common ancestor around 1963 and identified two successive epidemic expansions in the late 1980s and late 1990s, coinciding with major socio-economic changes in the post-Soviet Era. These population expansions favored accumulation of resistance mutations to up to 11 anti-TB drugs, with MDR evolving toward additional resistances to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs within 20 years on average. Timescaled haplotypic density analysis revealed that widespread acquisition of compensatory mutations was associated with transmission success of XDR strains. Virtually all W148 strains harbored a hypervirulence-associated <jats:italic>ppe38</jats:italic> gene locus, and incipient recurrent emergence of <jats:italic>prpR</jats:italic> mutation-mediated drug tolerance was detected. The outstanding genetic arsenal of this geographically widespread M/XDR strain clade represents a “perfect storm” that jeopardizes the successful introduction of new anti-M/XDR-TB antibiotic regimens.</jats:p>"

Currently, only very basic organic seed market data are being reported at the country level. Those available from each member state are seldom comparable over time between countries and sometimes even within one country. This study provides the first overall statistics on European organic seed supply and demand. Estimates of the organic seed demand and supply of twelve important crops in EU organic agriculture are provided by developing and testing innovative approaches to improve data collection and analysis, such as multiple imputation (MI) techniques to estimate missing values. The estimates are based on data extracted from official EU datasets from 2014 to 2018 and collected by an online survey of 756 farmers, as well as various expert assessments across the EU. The results were provided by four EU geographical regions, with a specific focus on wheat, lucerne, carrot, and apple. Although strong sector and regional differences currently characterise the organic seed market, organic seed demand considerably exceeds supply for most crops. Generally, farms in the central and northern regions revealed a higher organic seed supply than those in the southern and eastern regions, and organic seed supply is higher for wheat than other crops. A significant output of this study is the development of recommendations to improve methodologies to increase the transparency and availability of organic seed market data.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to develop a strategic formulation framework incorporating the 3DCE concept in product functionality, concurrent process design, and appropriate supply chain solutions. The framework has been developed and implemented in food and beverage SME. Strategy development follows the traditional approach, including environmental analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy mapping. However, the result of environmental analysis extracted in the form of SWOT and Grand Strategy matrices are specifically piled into concurrent strategic theme covering the concurrent product, process, and supply chain aspects. Predominantly, product features covering the product innovation and functionality and process features covering segmentation-based and cross-functional process designs were tailored with innovative supply chain solutions based on the segmented model.

However, lack of efficient genome editing tools greatly hinders the AP-3 overproduction in <jats:italic>A. pretiosum</jats:italic>. To solve this problem, a tailor-made pCRISPR–Cas9apre system was developed from pCRISPR–Cas9 for increasing the accessibility of <jats:italic>A. pretiosum</jats:italic> to genetic engineering, by optimizing <jats:italic>cas9</jats:italic> for the host codon preference and replacing pSG5 with pIJ101 replicon. Using pCRISPR–Cas9apre, five large-size gene clusters for putative competition pathway were individually deleted with homology-directed repair (HDR) and their effects on AP-3 yield were investigated. Especially, inactivation of T1PKS-15 increased AP-3 production by 27%, which was most likely due to the improved intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) pool for essential precursor supply of AP-3 biosynthesis. To enhance a “glycolate” extender unit, two combined bidirectional promoters (BDPs) <jats:italic>ermEp-kasOp</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>j23119p-kasOp</jats:italic> were knocked into <jats:italic>asm12-asm13</jats:italic> spacer in the center region of gene cluster, respectively, by pCRISPR–Cas9apre.

The AP-3 yields of BDP-ek and BDP-jk were finally increased by 30% and 50% compared to the parent strain L40. Both CRISPR–Cas9-mediated engineering strategies employed in this study contributed to the availability of AP-3 PKS extender units and paved the way for further metabolic engineering of ansamitocin overproduction.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous studies on horizontal outsourcing between competing duopolists emphasize cost factors, such as economies of scale and/or variable cost advantages in Cournot markets, as potential explanations. Our paper studies horizontal outsourcing when two competing firms engage in Bertrand competition, and highlights the important role of sole sourcing commitment. We adopt the framework of a multistage duopoly game that comprises of an incumbent and an entrant. The incumbent has the capability to make a key component in‐house, and the entrant, who is a rival of the incumbent in the downstream market, can source the component from either the incumbent or a supplier not participating in the end‐product market. We find that if the entrant commits to sole sourcing, horizontal outsourcing can occur when the incumbent has a component cost advantage or even a small cost disadvantage over the alternative supplier. Specifically, if the component cost gap is small, horizontal outsourcing may soften downstream market competition and benefit both firms at the expense of inducing higher prices for the consumers. If the incumbent has a significant cost advantage, horizontal outsourcing may lead to an increased downstream price war by expanding the total supply of end products. Without sole sourcing commitment, horizontal outsourcing occurs only when the incumbent has a cost advantage, and it always strengthens downstream price competition. By contrast, if the firms engage in downstream Cournot competition, sole sourcing commitment has no impact on the adoption of horizontal outsourcing, and the entrant sources from her rival only when the incumbent enjoys a significant cost advantage. Finally, we also study various extensions to check and confirm the robustness of our main results to key model assumptions. </jats:p>",

There is a fixed resonant frequency in the traction network. When the harmonic current frequency produced by the locomotive matches the resonant frequency of the traction network, it will cause high-frequency resonant overvoltage. The propagation path of the high-order harmonics of the traction load is analyzed based on a V/v wiring traction transformer. The propagation characteristics of high-order harmonics on self-used equipment at 380 V low-voltage side and 27.5 kV high-voltage side are expounded. A simulation model for the low-voltage self-consumption power system is established and the singular value decomposition algorithm is proposed to identify the harmonic impedance. The simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the error to within 0.1%. Under realistic conditions, the overvoltage caused by high-order harmonics is difficult to identify. To solve this problem, an overvoltage identification algorithm for Electric Multiple Units based on a convolutional neural network is proposed. The ShuffleNet neural network model is then used to identify high-order harmonics overvoltage and other types of overvoltage. The overall accuracy of the proposed classification model can be improved from 97.12% to 98.44%. Better recognition and classification performances can also be achieved.</jats:p>"

Previous studies have recognized the important impact of land use/land cover (LULC) planning on carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystem services (ESs). However, exploring trends in carbon sequestration under sustainable development scenarios that combine economic and ecological development, particularly the mechanisms that balance the supply and demand of carbon sequestration, still requires in-depth exploration in different geographical contexts. In this study, we present the LULC simulation framework from 2000 to 2030 for four different development scenarios in the Xinjiang region, located in an important Belt and Road region, including business as usual (BAU), rapid economic development (RED), ecological land protection (ELP), and sustainable development with both economic and ecological development (SD). Our results suggest that both the supply and demand of carbon stock in Xinjiang will increase in 2025 and 2030, with the demand exceeding the supply. However, our scenario planning mitigates the supply and demand deficit situation for carbon sequestration in the context of future cropland expansion in different scenarios. In summary, our study’s findings will enrich the study of carbon sequestration under future scenarios in the Belt and Road region. Xinjiang should pay more attention to the dynamic changes in landscape type structure and its carbon storage supply and demand caused by cultivated land expansion. Among the four scenarios, the spatial difference between carbon storage supply and demand based on the SD scenario is the smallest, which is more in line with the high-quality development of regional ecological security in Xinjiang.</jats:p>"

Through model solving and further numerical simulations, the results showed that the increase in carbon emission reduction investment cost has a significant negative impact on power price and the total expected income of the supply chain. However, a reasonable level of government carbon emission reduction subsidy can effectively alleviate the increase in power price and improve the total expected income of supply chain.

Bonny Water Distribution Plant BWDP has a total capacity of 7.012 Million Litres per Day (MLD) for a population of about 175000 people. In this case study, data was collected for six months in all pumping stations. The result shows that BWDP has an average Availability of 88.84%, Quality of 85.58%, Performance of 83.45% and 61.27% OEE as compared to 90% Availability, 95% Quality, 99% Performance and 85% OEE of Seiichi Nakajima world class OEE system. To minimize these losses and to achieve world class  OEE system, it was recommended that there should be reduction in events which are discussed in six big losses  section, which include; fault in current, trips, pipeline leakages, water shortages in sump well and others</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Open innovation (OI) is the actual framework for doing innovation. Business incubators are OI places because beyond the office space and other services, they ensure networking and facilitate OI collaborations both inside the incubator among entrepreneurs and outside with external stakeholders. Thus, instead of playing a mere passive role, incubators now facilitate OI for their inhabitants by providing relevant services. The “Business Incubation and Open Innovation ABC” as the guidelines for business incubators are one of intellectual results in the project “Open Innovation, No1.1.1.2/VIAA/3/19/426” funded by Postdoctoral Research Support Aid programme of Latvia. This article identifies the structure of national business incubation (BI) guidelines focusing on BI process through OI approach, namely partners, competences, strategies (inside-out and outside-in), sustainability. The article reveals the incubation and OI trends based on: 1) the literature review and 2) empirical qualitative research. The empirical qualitative research comprised: 1) national business incubation service analyses from OI perspective, 2) the international practice analysis of incubation programmes at Aalto University, Finland, and TalTech in Estonia, based on eight expert interviews, and 3) national business incubation expert and management (23) focus group discussion results. The pandemic facilitated the online co-creation, co-petition, and collaboration in business incubation. Although business incubators reorganized their cycle and services, incubator operators, managers and tenants still lack the overall recognition of OI approach in BI, even though, OI activities are practiced. This article provides national BI guideline’s structure as a novelty for business incubation practitioners, academia, entrepreneurship support policy makers and tenants explaining business incubation role, OI practices and strategies applied to business incubation and incubators as OI partners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Mexico, sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is one of the most notable agrifood crops, due to the economic importance it represents, sucrose and ethanol are systematically produced from it. However, a modernization scheme is currently required through productive diversification, valorizing and taking advantage of the generated co-products. In this scheme, the production of lactic acid is proposed, which generates added value and has potential demand in different industries such as food and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate factors that determine potential supply of lactic acid, if it were produced using bagasse and molasses generated in 18 sugar mills located in four sugarcane regions in Veracruz, Mexico. Statistical methods of panel data analysis were applied by estimating five econometric models, using the factors that can determine such supply. Analysis results indicated that the four sugarcane regions have lactic acid production potential, highlighting the Papaloapan-Gulf (2.6 million t) and Cordoba-Gulf (1.6 million t) regions. Factors that influenced or determined supply were: harvest duration, lactic acid import price, the number of co-products and by-products, the harvested area and the average of schooling level. In conclusion, the sugar agroindustry in Veracruz has the potential to diversify its production through the co-production of lactic acid in the context of a deficit trade balance.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study is to develop a multicriteria tool to help select the solution alternative for UWC cases. The tool (called UWC-MCDA) is based on obtaining consensus on various multicriteria methods for selecting alternatives to solve UWC cases. The proposed methodology consists of the following steps: (1) defining the criteria, (2) defining weights, (3) defining the alternative, (4) defining multicriterial decision support methods, (5) coding the UWC solution alternative selection model, (6) evaluation of the model coding, (7) application of the model coding, and (8) sensitivity analysis. The methods PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, and Consensus ranking are used. The case study considered was the Administrative Region of Brasilia, in the Federal District of Brazil. A multicriteria tool to help select the solution alternative for UWC cases was developed in an easy-to-use environment (Visual Basic for Applications, MS Excel). The UWC-MCDA is able to identify and prioritize, among a set of possible alternatives, the most appropriate solution for the case in question. For the case study, the UWC-MCDA indicated the best alternatives for regulating water consumption, strengthening sanitation service operators and good water conservation practices.

This study aimed to develop an algorithm for predicting the consequences of accidents in real time to perform a dynamic risk assessment and, using this algorithm, formulate a ship accident–response procedure that can be used in fire accidents during LNG bunkering. The risk of fire was estimated by predicting the hole size due to changes in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport conditions and the consequence based on the fire accidents scenario in LNG-fueled ships. The prediction model was trained with the hole prediction data using Ansys CFX and with the consequence data using DNV Phast, and the consequences of fire were compared and evaluated by applying the trained results. A method for estimating the size of the fire based on the predicted consequence is proposed, which supports fast decision making in fire accidents during LNG bunkering by identifying the potential size of the fire at the beginning of an accident.</jats:p>"

In total 11 pond water samples and 21 river water samples were collected around the typical to be exploited metal mine in southern Anhui Province, China. The optical properties of DOM in surface water were studied using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed the intrinsic relationship among UV-Vis spectral parameters, fluorescent components, and heavy metals. The results showed that the DOM in the river had higher content, but its molecular weight was smaller than in the pond. EEM coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) revealed humic-like components (C1 and C2) and protein-like components (C3), and the average content of each fluorescent component in the river was higher than that in the pond. However, except for As, the average content of other heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn) in ponds was more significant than in rivers. The co-occurrence network analysis result revealed that there might be different relationships between heavy metals and the DOM due to the various land use.</jats:p>",

Differential game models between the manufacturer and the retailers were constructed. Using the continuous dynamic programming theory, the manufacturer’s quality level strategy, retailer’s service level strategy and supply chain system performance under the modes of no cost sharing decision, cost sharing decision and centralized decision were analyzed and compared. Main findings: The optimal strategy of product quality under centralized decision is greater than the corresponding value under cost sharing contract decision. Compared with decentralized decision making of no cost sharing, cost sharing contract cannot promote the manufacturer to improve product quality. Different from previous studies, the service quality under centralized decision making is not higher than other decisions. When the horizontal reference effect of service quality meets a certain condition, the supply chain profit under centralized decision making is lower than the corresponding value under decentralized decision making.</jats:p>"

These are critical to prevent supply disruption and continuously improve existing medicines and vaccines. Due to the complexity of current PAC systems across markets, a change can take 3 to 5 years to approval globally (Hoath et al in BioProcess Int, 2016) thus hindering innovation and increasing the risk of shortages. The key messages are as follows: 1. Industry believes that global regulatory convergence of post-approval changes to Marketing Authorisations (MAs) using science- and risk-based approaches will enable a more efficient management of quality and supply improvements and will facilitate patients’ access to innovative medicines and vaccines of the highest quality. 2. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) should establish national or regional guidelines in line with international standards (regarding a risk-based classification of changes and standardisation of requirements) (Guidelines on procedures and data requirements for changes to approved biotherapeutic products, in WHO Technical Report Series, 2018, Guidelines on procedures and data requirements for changes to approved vaccines, in WHO Technical Report Series, 2015), have clear procedural guidance including timelines and implement reliance pathways to accelerate the approval of changes. This paper briefly outlines the challenges for PACs and provides solutions for a more flexible and aligned global system.</jats:p>",

Mobility restriction and overall demand decline lead to systematically cascading disruptions that are more severe and longer lasting than those caused by natural disasters and political conflicts. In the present study, the authors find that large companies and manufacturers with traditional advantages suffer greater losses than small ones, which is conceptualized as the “<jats:italic>Hub Paradox</jats:italic>” by empirically investigating one Warp Knitting Industrial Zone of China. An underload cascading failure model is employed to simulate supply chain viability under disruptions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the load decreases beyond a threshold, the viability will drop down critically. Besides, supply chain viability depends on two aspects: the adaptive capability of the manufacturers themselves and the adaptive capability of the connections of the supply network. The comparison study demonstrates that enhancing cooperative relations between hub and non-hub manufacturers will facilitate the entire supply network viability. The present study sheds light on viable supply chain management. Compared with conventionally linear or resilient supply chains, intertwined supply networks can leverage viability with higher adaptation of redistributing production capacities among manufacturers to re-establish overall scale advantages. Finally, the present study also suggests solving the “<jats:italic>Hub Paradox</jats:italic>” from the perspective of complex adaptive system.</jats:p>",

The ongoing climate and environmental breakdown, the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian war in Ukraine in early 2022 are creating a convergence of crises with grave concerns about its future unfolding and impacts on vulnerable groups. Inability to afford environmentally friendly actions might leave certain groups of society in a vicious circle. Based on quantitative social survey data from 2020 and 2021 within the Latvian Council of Science funded project ‘Ready for change? Sustainable management of common natural resources’, this paper demonstrates correlations between the financial security of people and environmental behaviour in Latvia. Financial security is measured by status of debt obligations and the length of time people can provide for themselves in case of the loss of their current income sources. We conclude that the overall financial security has significantly reduced from 2020 to 2021, while at the same time environmentally oriented behaviours have remained stagnant or less widespread. As a result of cluster analysis, three groups of financial security are distinguished and further analysis demonstrates that high income alone is an insufficient motivator for diverse environmental behaviour. Affluent people tend to do the simplest steps more often, like trying to sort their waste for recycling, while many with lower incomes and in rural areas are capable of more actions, with the overall lower consumption levels. Only thinking and acting beyond the ‘business-as-usual’ narrative can enable transformative actions to change the structural processes that keep causing the side-effects of our development.</jats:p>",

The study is based on quantitative analysis of data from a nationwide representative survey of 1015 residents of Latvia conducted in November 2021. The results suggest that Latvians perceive economic development and environmental protection mostly as mutually dependent goals, and even those believing that the concern for the environment has gone too far at the expense of economic development still report practicing certain pro-environmental actions on a regular basis. Specifically, buying locally sourced and seasonal foods whenever possible, sorting different kinds of waste for recycling, and trying to reduce the consumption of disposable items like plastic bags are reported most often by the respondents.

However, most studies to date just focused on water supply services, and ignore water demand services and their supply–demand coupling mechanisms. Ecosystem service flow could be used to evaluate the imbalance between water supply and demand. Therefore, this study takes the Yellow River Basin as the research object to quantify the supply, demand, and spatial flow of water provision services. The results showed that land use and land cover (LULC) played a critical role in the spatial distributions of water supply and demand in the Yellow River Basin. The total water supply was 3.03 × 1011 m3, with a range of 3.29 × 108 m3 to 7.35 × 1010 m3 for different sub-watersheds. The spatial patterns of water supply were strongly different from those in water demand, resulting in obvious spatial mismatches. There was a higher water demand for constructional areas and agricultural lands, which had relatively lower water supply. Most water areas and natural lands provide much more water supply than demand. We used a water flow process to assess the water provision service between water supply side and demand side. The water flow process suggested that the Yellow River Basin had an obvious imbalance between water supply and demand depending on land use and populations, which would help policy makers to manage water resources through optimizing land management in different cities and finally achieving a balance between water supply side and demand site.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a novel self-adaptation and sorting selection-based differential evolutionary (SA-SSDE) algorithm that can solve large-scale WDS optimization problems more efficiently while having the greater ability to explore global optimal solutions. The following two unique features enable the better performance of the proposed SA-SSDE algorithm: (1) the DE/current-to-pbest/n mutation and sorting selection operators are used to speed up the convergence and thus improve the optimization efficiency; (2) the parameter adaptation strategy in JADE (an adaptive differential evolution algorithm proposed by Zhang &amp; Sanderson 2009) is introduced and modified to cater for WDS optimization, and it is capable of dynamically adapting the control parameters (i.e., F and CR values) to the fitness landscapes characteristic of larger-scale WDS optimization problems, allowing for greater exploratory ability. The proposed SA-SSDE algorithm found new best solutions of $7.068 million, €1.9205 million, and $30.852 million for three well-known large networks (ZJ164, Balerma454, and Rural476), having the convergence speed of 1.02, 1.92, and 5.99 times faster than the classic DE, respectively. Investigations into the searching behavior and the control parameter evolution during optimization are carried out, resulting in a better understanding of why the proposed SA-SSDE algorithm outperforms the classic DE, as well as the guidance for developing more advanced EAs.</jats:p>",

Evaluating water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) is crucial for regional sustainable development. To date, limited attention has been paid to WRCC in areas of predominantly sandy land, with the impact of vegetation restoration in ecologically degraded areas on WRCC remaining unclear. In this study, using a comprehensive evaluation index and a system dynamics model, we evaluated the WRCC of the Mu Us Sandy Land, Inner Mongolia, China, from 2000 to 2019 then projected to 2030. Our results show WRCC has decreased since 2000, reaching a general state by 2019. In a future scenario where historical development remains unabated, WRCC will continue to decline to a poor carrying state by 2030. The comprehensive scheme based on industrial restructuring and water conservation performed the best in terms of WRCC, continuously increasing and returning to a general carrying state by 2030. Our findings highlight the WRCC of the Mu Us Sandy Land is not optimistic and subsequent ecological restoration should proceed with caution. A comprehensive scheme is an optimal development strategy for the future.</jats:p>",

Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for lettuce growth and development and significantly impacts its metabolites. Biomarkers that are indicative of variations in the K status of lettuce before the occurrence of biophysical changes (e.g., leaf or canopy morphological, textural and color features), can be adopted to determine the early K status of lettuce. To understand the effect of low K on diverse metabolites, we examined the metabolic response of lettuce in a closed cultivation room under controlled conditions. The evaluation was based on large-scale untargeted metabolomics assay of the K group using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed with a fold-change (FC) analysis, t-test, and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis. Fifty-two metabolites were classified into two groups by the FC, p, and the variable importance in projection (VIP). Low K led to an increment in 40 metabolites (FC &gt; 2, p &lt; 0.05, VIP &gt; 1) and a decrease in 12 metabolites (FC &lt; 0.5, p &lt; 0.05, VIP &gt; 1). Ten pathways were significantly enriched with metabolic biomarkers. In light of the complex interactive relationships among N, P, and K, the top five biomarkers were screened further by VIP &gt; 4.00. Adenosine, FA 18:1+3O, uridine, cis-aconitate, and D(-)-gulono-gamma-lactone showed an increase in low-K stress samples, and may be considered potential metabolic biomarkers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine how different strategies can be used to protect global manufacturers from the prevalent issue of supplier copycatting in emerging markets. In particular, using a game‐theoretical model, we consider a manufacturer that sells a product to an emerging market, which requires the completion of multiple tasks. The manufacturer can perform any of these tasks in‐house or outsource any of them to an emerging market supplier. The former approach carries a higher cost, while the latter puts the manufacturer's intellectual property (IP) at risk of supplier copycatting. Either the manufacturer or the emerging market government can exert enforcement effort to protect the IP rights within the supply chain. Our results show that, surprisingly, there are cases where the manufacturer should outsource fewer tasks when in‐house production is more costly. Further, even though the supplier is the target of the enforcement, we show that the manufacturer's enforcement effort can help the supplier but hurt customers and the emerging market. Concerning whether the government or the manufacturer should take responsibility for IP protection, we recommend that the government enforce IP protection when the manufacturer has a weak brand quality and that the manufacturer enforce IP protection when it has a strong brand. This managerial insight provides a theoretical framework for the recent practitioners’ debate about who should be responsible for protecting IP rights within the supply chain. </jats:p>",

From a historical point of view, the Green Revolution, together with biofortification and sustainable intensification, was established as a possible solution to counter hunger and malnutrition during the second half of the 20th century. As a solution, to overcome the limitations attributed to the Green Revolution, food supply chains were developed. The current food system, based on the long food supply chain (LFSC), is characterized by globalization, promoting several advantages for both producers and consumers. However, LFSC has been demonstrated to be unable to feed the global population and, furthermore, it generates negative ecological, environmental, logistical, and nutritional pressures. Thus, novel efficient food systems are required to respond to current environmental and consumers’ demands, as is the case of short food supply chain (SFSC). As a recently emerging food system, the evaluation of SFSC sustainability in terms of environmental, economic, and social assessment is yet to be determined. This review is focused on the evolution of food supply systems, starting from the Green Revolution to food supply chains, providing a significant perspective on sustainability.</jats:p>",

Then, the boundary of the control region is initially defined based on the selected reference intersection, through a combination of the improved Newman algorithm. Subsequently, a spectral clustering algorithm is used to obtain the boundaries of the optimal active control subregions. Finally, a city road network is used as the study object for analysis and verification under the premise of implementing active traffic control. The results show that compared with the intersection clustering algorithm method and the boundary control subdivision method, the control effect indicators, such as the average delay and the average number of stops, have a great optimization improvement. Thus, the proposed method of regional borders combines the actual traffic flow characteristics efficiently to make a more accurate real-time dynamic division of the road network sub-areas.</jats:p>"

Recognition of different aspects of the relationship between agriculture and the pandemic is a significant issue because it influences food security. The analysis considered three important pandemics from the past: Black Death, Spanish flu and AIDS. The literature review on the economic consequences of these pandemics was the research method in the study. From the analysed three pandemics, the most extensive and most positive results for the economy in the short and long run took place after Black Death, which was the deadliest. The economic consequences of the other two pandemics were the relatively short term and rather adverse. The reduction of human capital was a negative effect of these pandemics on an economy of a long-term nature. The response of agriculture to the pandemics depended on the size of the labour shortages and the role of agriculture in the economy. The reaction differed between countries. Aggregate agricultural production did not decline in absolute or per capita terms in many countries. However, in Africa, pandemics led to famine and malnutrition. The drop in the population increased the labour/capital and labour/land ratios. The labour shortages triggered adjustment processes in the form of wage increases and encouraged the introduction of innovations. During the pandemic, rural areas depopulated, and it took quite a long time to recover to the level before the pandemic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid development of information and communications technologies has changed the lives of both - society as a whole and individuals in it. The world is becoming a huge system for gathering, storing, and sharing information. Large amounts of data are collected, stored, analysed, and used for commercial purposes. Prominent American sociologist Shoshana Zuboff calls this process \"surveillance capitalism.\" This paper aims to analyse the tools of surveillance capitalism and the influence of surveillance capitalism on public choices and behaviour. It is based on empirical information collected using several research methods - a survey (n = 204), semi-structured interviews (n = 5), and qualitative content analysis. The paper analyses three popular surveillance capitalists' online tools - Google search, Facebook, and Twitter and gives insights into society's preferences and behaviour patterns concerning ways of obtaining information and attitudes towards privacy and self-censorship. The research concludes that the tools created by surveillance capitalists have become an integral part of social life, and they dominate the process of interaction. They make life easier but their uncritical acceptance can be dangerous. Since surveillance capitalism has taken the stage, society members often uncritically, even ignorantly, treat current reality in which the everydayness data about user's life are the free raw material for surveillance capitalists, thus contributing to surveillance capitalism and its threats to defined privacy principles and democracy.</jats:p>",

They aim at ensuring an access to financial services in poorly urbanised areas which are endangered with financial exclusion. The main aim of the present study is to identify these advantages and various aspects of activities conducted by cooperative banks that place them in a role of local initiators of economic development in Poland. The study includes a review of the literature on the subject, an analysis and synthesis of issues discussed, as well as an analysis of data from the reports of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (UKNF) and the National Association of Cooperative Banks (KZBS). The analysis of financial data covered the years 2016-2021 and was carried out with the use of structure and dynamics indicators. Cooperative banks stimulate local economic development through cooperation with local governments, offering preferential loans for farmers and family businesses. They also provide consulting services to various groups of clients. An important element of their activities resulting from their mission are pro-social activities which aim at educating and supporting local sport and cultural initiatives.</jats:p>",

The kinetic model of S2− removal was developed, and the inflow ratio of the PEPEC was analyzed according to the results of the kinetic models. The results showed that the S2− removal ratio could reach 97.5% ± 0.5%, when the inflow ratio was controlled at 2% for the PEPEC operation. Meanwhile, the removal efficiency and operation performance were assessed for both the simulating ex-situ and in-situ bench-scale tests. Compared with the in-situ processes, the PEPEC showed a stable operation performance during 120 h of bio-treatment, and the concentrations of S2−, COD, NH3-N and TP in the effluent reached approximately 0.5, 20, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The time consumption (8 h for one batch) and consortium dosage (3 g for the whole operation) in the PEPEC were significantly less than those in the in-situ processes. The PEPEC presented some potential advantages for the bio-treatment of a heavily polluted river.</jats:p>",

The article highlights the role of social advertising by drawing attention to social challenges that require actions in order to address specific problems. In short, social advertising is used as a means for introducing an important problem to the society. The problem-solving process by using social advertising campaigns is effective when a campaign includes specific memorable characteristics; therefore, the main social advertising features are a topical subject. The authors of the article aim to investigate social advertising features in Lithuania and observe the main social marketing campaign elements that evoke strong feelings and encourage representatives of various audience groups to change behavioural pattern. The paper relies on scientific literature overview, statistical data analysis, and a case study. A case study as a research method is selected in order to investigate social advertising campaigns that were launched in Lithuania during the last decade (before and after the pandemic) as well as to perform a comparative analysis of the main elements and models used. As a result of the article, four main goals for social marketing advertising for Lithuanian market are distinguished: (1) to encourage changes in behaviour, (2) to spread information, (3) to form a public need, (4) to develop and support the promoted idea. Moreover, the performed analysis reveals the importance of publicity and strong emotional response evoked by shocking images as the main elements of Lithuanian social marketing campaigns launched during the last decade.</jats:p>",

Such results indicate on high degree of commitment to the development of circular economy, as well as collaborative consumption helping to drive the sharing economy, which is an important step towards hindering wastage of both food and other resources thereby promoting their optimal use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent years have seen a growing global demand for influencer marketing services despite those having both advantages and disadvantages. Specifically, through influencer marketing campaigns brands operating under fierce competition aim to instil in consumers a more positive attitude towards their product, promote buying decisions, and implement a dialogue approach in marketing communication and feedback generation so as to establish a much closer link with their consumers. However, there are also major disadvantages about influencer marketing, such as the yield of influencer marketing campaigns and the lack of regulatory framework in respect of liability for unfair commercial practice and breach of confidentiality. \nThe goal of the study is to develop recommendations for avoiding liability for unfair commercial practice in Latvia based on the theoretical aspects and the use of influencer marketing services in marketing campaigns in EU. The methods of research used are monographic, secondary data analysis, comparison, grouping, graphic, descriptive, as well as qualitative data analysis, case study, the analytical, inductive and deductive method. The results of the study show that, while the global demand for influencer marketing activities has been rapidly growing over the recent years, it also becomes increasingly important for businesses building long-term partnerships with influencers to thoroughly consider the influencers’ values, beliefs, life style and conduct on social media as well as to seek to include in the contract a confidentiality clause prohibiting disclosure of information on the marketing strategy, customer behavior etc. when providing services to other partners and avoiding conflicts of interest in providing services to competing businesses.</jats:p>",

The main factors of competitiveness in beekeeping are formed at the regional level, but they are realized on a supra-regional basis, which is why a marketing strategy is needed to develop the potential and competitiveness of beekeeping in the Rousse district, the starting point of which is the economic and geographical characteristic of the area. There is a discrepancy between the natural zoning of the Danube plain and the administrative and territorial structure of the Ruse region. The aim of the study is the interdependence between the triad \"natural conditions - natural resources - economy\". One of the specific tasks is related to the analysis of beekeeping by administrative-territorial units in Ruse district, and the second is focused on the economic and market characteristics of regional beekeeping. The hilly nature of the relief, the relatively low altitude and the great biodiversity are the factors determining the variety of beekeeping grazing in the region of Ruse in terms of quantity and quality. The analysis revealed that it is more professionally oriented and managed by the national, with more efficient territorial organization and development, and with a higher relative share of organic beekeeping. These advantages determine its higher competitiveness. Now the district of Ruse forms more than 10% of the national production of honey (over 1000 tons per year), respectively and in proportion to the economic effect of pollination - over BGN 100 million / year. The district offers very good opportunities and optimal conditions for the development of api-tourism, which will diversify the beekeeping farms and provide them with more stable and higher incomes. It has significant production, educational and innovative potential, a solid base for the formation of a regional beekeeping cluster.</jats:p>",

The result shows that there are regional differences in the development of supply and demand coupling coordination of elderly care service resources. The degree of supply and demand coupling coordination of elderly care service resources in the western and northern regions is lower than that in the eastern and southern regions. Although the level in most areas of supply and demand coupling coordination of elderly care service resources will improve in the future, there is still a gap from good coordination. In order to strengthen the supply of elderly care service resources, and promote the upgrade of the supply and demand of elderly care service resources, the government should start from the demand of the elderly to increase investment in infrastructure construction, investment in elderly care services resources, talent training and other aspects.</jats:p>"

At the moment, both in the scientific literature and practical application, digital transformation is understood not only as the use of digital technologies, but also as a change in the understanding of the role of technology in the development of processes, forms and approaches at the level of both: an individual and society. Digital transformation is also an integral part of policy planning documents, which is vividly confirmed by the Digital Transformation Guidelines for 2021-2027 of Latvia. The vision defined in the document emphasizes the importance of technology for the development of society and the competitiveness of the business and for the development of creativity. It describes the relatively low level of digital transformation in small and medium-sized enterprises in Latvia, which is very typical as well for creative industries. Digital transformation of the creative industries has been little studied so far. The aim of the article is to assess the importance of digital transformation in regional creative industries. To achieve this goal, the literature and documents on the digital transformation were analysed, especially about the creative industries. To assess the potential of digital transformation in creative industries, interviews with experts on digital transformation, creative industries and regional development were carried out. The study showed that the importance and application of digital transformation in the creative industries have grown in recent years, partly due to the situation of the Covid-19. On the other hand, its role in the performance of companies is still relatively small and underestimated.</jats:p>",

The research aim is to perform a comparative analysis of self-employment trends in Latvia and other EU Member States. The analysed period (2011-2019) allows observing various changes in the trends of self-employment such as changes in the age groups and sectors with the increasing number of self-employed persons as well as changes in reasons indicating willingness of individuals to become self-employed. An examination of the statistical portrait of a self-employed person reveals identical characteristics among the EU Member States: it is a male with a secondary education, aged 25-49, having chosen self-employment by his own choice and hiring no other employees. The only difference of statistical portrait lies in the employment status: a manager in Latvia and a professional in the EU. In recent years, the number of self-employed persons aged 50-64, having chosen self-employment due to their personal reasons, hiring no other employees, having acquired an in-depth and comprehensive knowledge and wanting to apply the acquired knowledge in the future tends to increase. Therefore, further research on this group of self-employed persons is recommended to identify the causal relationships and benefits for their engagement in this type of employment.</jats:p>",

In forest headwater streams, metabolic processes are\npredominately heterotrophic and depend on both the availability of carbon\n(C) and nitrogen (N) and a favourable C:N stoichiometry. In this context, hydrological conditions and the presence of riparian forests adjacent to streams can play an important, yet understudied role in determining dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and DOC:NO3- molar ratios. Here, we aimed to investigate how the interplay between hydrological conditions and riparian forest coverage drives DOC and NO3- supply and DOC:NO3- stoichiometry in\nan oligotrophic headwater Mediterranean stream. We analysed DOC and\nNO3- concentrations and DOC:NO3- molar ratios during\nboth base flow and storm flow conditions at three stream locations along a\nlongitudinal gradient of increased riparian forest coverage. Further, we\nperformed an event analysis to examine the hydroclimatic conditions that\nfavour the transfer of DOC and NO3- from riparian soils to the\nstream during storms. Stream DOC and NO3- concentrations were\ngenerally low (overall averages ± SD were\n1.0±0.6 mg C L−1 and 0.20±0.09 mg N L−1), although significantly higher\nduring storm flow compared to base flow conditions in all three stream\nsites. Optimal DOC:NO3- stoichiometry for stream heterotrophic\nmicroorganisms (corresponding to DOC:NO3- molar ratios between 4.8\nand 11.7) was prevalent at the midstream and downstream sites under both\nflow conditions, whereas C-limited conditions were prevalent at the upstream\nsite, which had no surrounding riparian forest. The hydroclimatic analysis\nof storms suggested that large and medium storm events display a distinct\nmechanism of DOC and NO3- mobilization. In comparison to large\nstorms, medium storm events showed limited hydrological responses that led\nto significantly lower increases in stream DOC and NO3-\nconcentrations. During large storm events, different patterns of DOC and\nNO3- mobilization arise, depending on antecedent soil moisture conditions: drier antecedent conditions promoted rapid elevations of the riparian groundwater table, hydrologically activating a wider and shallower soil layer, and leading to relatively higher increases in stream DOC and\nNO3- concentrations compared to large storm events preceded by wet\nconditions. Our results suggest that (i) increased supply of limited\nresources during storms can potentially sustain in-stream heterotrophic\nactivity during high flows, especially during large storm events preceded by dry conditions, and (ii) C-limited conditions upstream were overcome\ndownstream, likely due to higher C inputs from riparian forests present at\nlower elevations. The contrasting spatiotemporal patterns in DOC and\nNO3- availability and DOC:NO3- stoichiometry observed at the studied stream suggest that groundwater inputs from riparian forests\nare essential for maintaining in-stream heterotrophic activity in\noligotrophic, forest headwater catchments.\n                    </jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to examine the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic on agriculture, agri-food system and rural areas in developed countries as identified in the literature. The impact of the pandemic is divided into economic and social effects. A literature review was used to identify the current state of knowledge on the topic. The study found that the consequences of the pandemic occurred in every element of the food chain. The onset of the pandemic was characterised by shortages of many agri-food products, especially for certain groups of people who were unable to use the new sales channels. Production in the agricultural sector proved to be fairly resilient to the impact of the pandemic. However, the income insecurity of farms has increased significantly, especially for farms that offer seasonal products, rely on migrant labour and sell to the HoReCa sector. Food consumer behaviour has changed, which may have long-term consequences for the food economy. The social impact of the pandemic relates primarily to the increased digital exclusion of rural areas and the social exclusion of the elderly. The uncertainty of farmers' income and the deepening of social exclusion seem to be the most severe consequences of the pandemic in agriculture, agri-food sector and in rural areas.</jats:p>",

One of the measures to mitigate the risks from the weather in agriculture is to insure crops. In the Estonian insurance market, crop insurance is available to farmers. Government-based crop insurance subsidies apply to crop insurance premium, but so far, there is little demand for it among farmers. The aim of the paper is to identify the terms of crop insurance that play a role in deciding in favour of crop insurance. A survey examines the factors related to the insurance decisions of agricultural producers about their preferences regarding the terms of crop insurance. The data, collected from Estonian agricultural companies through an online questionnaire, is used to show farmers’ preferences with regards to crop insurance. The results show that interest to using crop insurance was relatively low among farmers despite the agricultural insurance premium subsidies provided by the Agricultural Registers and Information Board in Estonia. Regarding crop insurance, it would be rather used by farmers who consider insurable production risks and insurance premium subsidies more important. Of the terms, insurance indemnity, covered risks, and insurance premium were considered the most important in making a decision in favour of using crop insurance. Interest in crop insurance products would increase if specific insurance conditions were understandable and acceptable to producers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Social entrepreneurship is one of the fastest growing areas of entrepreneurship. Since the beginning of 21st century, the popularity of social entrepreneurship steadily, but gradually increases. Currently, social enterprises are operating similarly to traditional ones and thus can be seen separate from charity organizations. This concept is well practiced in emerging economies. The concept of a social enterprise and entrepreneurship can be approached in many different ways. The European Union has an operational definition of a social enterprise. In addition, in various European countries, there are some additional laws and regulations defining social entrepreneurship or a social enterprise. In Latvia, both the definition of social entrepreneurship and social enterprises are included in the Law on Social Entrepreneurship. In Sweden or Estonia, there are no common definition or legal framework for social enterprises. In Finland, the situation is the same, but there is a law concerning work integration enterprises. The EU´s operational definition for social enterprises is common for all European countries. The Baltic States and the Scandinavian countries have different perceptions of social entrepreneurship among the population and entrepreneurs. The paper analyses social enterprises in four European countries: Latvia, Estonia, Sweden and Finland by using national and EU-level knowledge sources. In the next phase, two case studies of social enterprises from each country are analysed according to the EU´s operational definition. As a result, the authors identified the similarities and differences of social enterprises in terms of their social mission, business models and governance models and suggested directions for future research.</jats:p>",

Aiming at the rigid requirements of the carbon-peaking and carbon-neutrality goals (“double-carbon”), this study established a performance evaluation index system for an energy supply chain of a four-tier structure based on the “double-carbon” goals, calculating its weight by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). On this basis, a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluation model was established to evaluate the performance of the energy supply chain in 2010–2019. According to the three-stage DEA evaluation mode, the initial input–output efficiency value of the energy supply chain was calculated by the DEA-BCC (extended by Banker, Charnes and Cooper) model and DEA-CCR (proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes) model and the influence of environmental noise was eliminated by stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) regression; we then obtained the adjusted efficiency value for the energy supply chain. At the same time, taking 2015 as the dividing point, the advantages and disadvantages between the traditional energy supply chain and new energy supply chain were analyzed and summarized. Further analysis and suggestions are provided to consumers, enterprises and countries from four aspects: energy supply, energy production and processing, energy transmission and distribution and energy consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The introduction of digital technologies in agricultural production is one of the most important elements of strategic development in the agricultural sector and rural areas in Ukraine. In agriculture, these new technologies can modernize the industry, promoting innovation in agribusiness and creating new opportunities for rural development. The introduction of digital technologies in agriculture ensures the accuracy of measurements, speed data collection and processing. Digitization in rural areas is an inevitable process that brings a number of economic, social and environmental benefits. The immediate aim of this paper is to assess the state of implementation of digital technologies in agriculture and to examine opportunities for rural development in Ukraine. Research methods: monographic, descriptive, analysis, synthesis, induction. The results indicate that only large agricultural enterprises in Ukraine are able to implement and use digital technologies. Thus, it is proposed to create an integrated digital portal for agricultural needs, combining solutions that optimize activities of agricultural enterprises: land bank management, production, crop monitoring, warehouse, procurement and supply, equipment and repairs, logistics, inventory and finished products. The article identifies technological and human barriers to introduction of digital technologies in rural areas of Ukraine. In addition it proposes strategies for development of digital literacy and skills among rural residents in Ukraine. The results of the research can have a significant impact on the development of agriculture in Ukraine, promoting digital technologies among other agricultural enterprises and ensuring the development in rural areas, attracting additional agricultural market participants and infrastructure that provide relevant information and digital services to rural residents.</jats:p>",

The study starts with an overview of the municipal cycling governance developments in Latvia as the aim of this research is to study the municipal cycling governance building frame, via the complementary set of cycling governance instruments application in terms of their development, implementation and impact evaluation – political and legal, institutional, planning, economic, infrastructure and also communication instruments. As the model’s case study area, Valmiera township municipality (case of medium and small size town municipalities in Latvia) was chosen, where our sustainable mobility studies have been step-wise continuing from 2016, particularly participatory documenting the cycling mobility development and its governance as sub-system of municipal mobility/transportation governance. The research methodologies applied included both research-and-development framework, being realized in active collaboration with municipal administration, and, case study research, allowing to provide integrative contextual analysis of the case phenomenon, including document studies, infrastructure observations with photo documentation, followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with whole set of the main stakeholders. The study highlights direct necessity of the particular cycling mobility governance system approach understanding and adaptive application, based on three governance dimensions (governance content, stakeholders and instruments). Besides social-ecological system as governance content dimension approach and stakeholders’ participation as governance stakeholders’ dimension approach, also and particularly, not only to use usually emphasized infrastructure planning, but further design and complementary use of all groups of traditional governance instruments, also additionally developing adaptive governance based disciplinary/sectorial cycling mobility instruments, esp. whole set of cycling communication instruments (information, education/training, participation, pro-cycling friendly behaviour). This triple governance dimensions’ model and principle as well as action policy recommendations elaborated may be used by the other local municipalities starting to expand cycling mobility.</jats:p>",

In this study, the joint operation of multiple hydraulic devices in the pumps shutdown process is expressed as a multi-objective optimization problem, and the hydraulic simulation-optimization model is proposed. The model is a bi-level framework, where the optimization model comprehensively considering various safety risks and efficiency through three objective functions is coupled with the MOC-based hydraulic transient simulation model. The parallel NSGA-II approach is proposed to solve the model. Besides, a process for effectively handling the constraints of the joint optimal operation of multiple hydraulic devices is proposed. Finally, the proposed model and approach are applied to a real long-distance water diversion project. The results show that the proposed model can find a set of feasible Pareto front solutions. The parallel approach greatly improves the computational efficiency. For the Pareto front schemes, the hydraulic devices are adjusted less frequently and the total regulation time is only 1/8.92–1/11.49 of that of the current operation scheme. Thus, this study provides an effective approach to formulate the joint operation scheme of multiple devices of long-distance water diversion systems.</jats:p>",

Lake Lubans is the largest lake in Latvia, as well as the largest dammed lake in Europe, included in surrounding NATURA 2000 nature reserve territory as also nationally largest inland protected wetland complex (Lubana Wetland/Ramsar site, 2009). Case Study Research methodology was applied by approaching the study area not only as a nature protection area but especially as a socio-ecological territorial and human system, using indepth semi-structured interviews in the surrounding areas/administrative territories with all main local-regional and also national stakeholder groups, as well as, applying document studies and territorial/objects’ observations. The National Nature Protection Agency’s Latgale region branch as the legal administrator supervises all nature protection territories in the region and also the Lubana Wetland, which is still lacking statutory Nature Protection Plan for the area; and, due to very limited administrative capacities, Agency is to be oriented more towards c ooperation with various other national and regional institutions from very different sectors, being organized under mainly two ministries involved – Environmental and Regional Development Ministry (nature, environmental, municipal and regional development sectors) and Agriculture Ministry (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water infrastructure sectors), as well as, particularly, with many municipalities in the wetland area. But municipalities have to take into account also interests of local communities, the basic socio-economic development situation and possibilities, having also limited capacities, sometimes also approaches, which all is to be combined with strong nature protection requirements and limitations. This governance landscape requires co-relation of various and diverse interests and creates a rather fragmented and underdeveloped management of the lake. Lake water levels are fully regulated by the national Water infrastructure agency using dams and other hydro-technical systems, while water areas are used not only for highly popular angling, but also for active commercial fishing and various recreational activities, tourism, esp. bird watching etc., thus also keeping strong nature protection status in the same time, which all represent a unique challenge for to be developed multi-stakeholders and socioecological system (SES) approach for lake governance (assessment, planning, collaborative management, monitoring, and communication) developments in Latvia and alike.</jats:p>",

Both the United Nations and the European Union have defined goals and directions of sustainable development, identifying and including the use of resources, the principles of the circular economy, the equal development of regions and other aspects. Urban agriculture has a potential in the most of them. However, the role and legal framework of urban agriculture is largely based on national or municipal initiatives. In Latvia urban agriculture does not have a legally defined status, it is not defined in strategic development plans, nor in the laws and regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the legal aspects of urban agriculture in order to determine its potential institutional framework in Latvia. To achieve the goal, tasks of the research are defined: 1) to identify the main legal aspects affecting urban agriculture in Latvia, 2) to determine the potential institutional framework for urban agriculture in Latvia. The study was conducted using systematic review analysis of laws, development strategies and regulations of the Republic of Latvia. As a result of the research, the main groups of legal aspects, influencing urban agriculture, were identified (agriculture and commerce, food chain, local government and environmental development and protection, waste management) and a possible institutional framework was developed.</jats:p>",

During four years, 946 respondents from Pieriga, Vidzeme, Kurzeme, Latgale regions were surveyed about the most important influence factors of three groups of change agents: state institutions; local governments as local government bodies; communities or residents of the municipality. The results of the survey show the following trends (the Kruskala-Wallis Test showed that the differences were not statistically significant): the state’s impact was generally positive in the years under review and had increased slightly. However, the impact of the other two groups of change agents was on a downward trend - for municipalities as local authorities and for communities living in the municipality. According to the individual assessment of each respondent, the most important agent of change was not the state institutions, but local governments or residents of the community, which is a positive indicator, because the development of the area can be most influenced by people living in its social groups, etc.</jats:p>",

Digital technologies and digital tools have caused major changes in the industry, giving rise to new tourism businesses, products, services, and consumer experience. The goal of the study is to develop recommendations for the implementation of digital services at tourism information centres (hereinafter – TICs) in the Zemgale region in the context of consumer attraction based on the theoretical findings as to the role of digitalisation in service provision and its application in the tourism industry and on the consumer and expert surveys conducted. The study employed the monographic method, secondary data analysis, qualitative data analysis including survey of experts of the tourism industry, and quantitative data analysis – an online consumer survey. This was then followed by a comparative analysis of the results to see how various digital services are rated by the experts and by consumers, while the graphic method was used to depict and interpret the results. The results of the study show that the following five digital services would be key to attracting consumers to TICs in the Zemgale region: interactive digital tourism games and amusement activities, educational activities at the TICs using virtual reality 3D glasses, a complex visitor’s map of the city or municipality, an individually personalised tourism guide, and a 360-degree tour of the city. Regardless of generation, consumers mostly prefer tourism activities and experience at the tourism destination. When it comes to implementing sustainable, digital and more environmentally friendly services at TICs, one needs to consider the differences among generations in terms of views and preferences, digital skills, and daily use of digital technologies.</jats:p>",

By determining the spatiotemporal changes in the supply and demand and the factors underlying these changes, the ecosystem service supply in river basins can be increased to match the demand; this information has great significance for the sustainable development of the basin. By focusing on the cities in China’s Huai River Basin, the data on ecosystem service supply and demand from 2010 to 2020 were measured using supply–demand matrices, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the supply–demand balance were analyzed using the supply–demand index and Moran’s I statistics. Next, geographical detectors and multiscale geographically weighted regression models were used to examine the factors influencing the spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem service supply and demand and their spatial effects. The results indicated the following: (1) From 2010 to 2020, ecosystem service supply in the Huai River Basin decreased by 2.51 × 108, whereas the ecosystem service demand increased by 4.43 × 108; in general, the demand exceeded the supply, and 69.74% cities were in a state of deficit. (2) The Moran’s I index of the ecosystem service supply and demand was greater than 0.4, which means that there was a strong spatial clustering, and the characteristics of high–high clusters gradually weakened and those of low–low clusters enhanced in the northern and eastern cities. (3) The q values of the ecological-use land area, construction-use land area, rain, and temperature were greater than 0.3, indicating a significant effect on the supply and demand. These findings can provide a targeted reference and basis for the ecological management of the Huai River Basin.</jats:p>"

Methodology: Thus, to figure out this issue, this study put forward a multistep prediction model based on a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM) model. The spatial characteristics of traffic data were considered as input of the BILSTM model to extract the time series characteristics of the traffic. Results: The experimental results validated that the BILSTM model improved the prediction accuracy in comparison to the support vector regression and gated recurring unit models. Furthermore, the proposed model was comparatively analyzed in terms of mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which were reduced by 30.4%, 32.2%, and 39.6%, respectively. Managerial implications: Our study provides useful insights into predicting the short-term traffic flow on highways and will improve the management of traffic flow optimization.</jats:p>"

Previous research studies have emphasized that processes within the local food system (LFS) occur over a relatively short geographical distance, thereby creating a number of economic advantages as well as making a significant impact on the community economy. In other words, this diversifies the rural economy, makes enterprises more economically independent, develops local potential and contributes to the image of the area. Most of the food produced in Latvia was sold in the domestic market, and only approximately a third of the food output was exported over the last decade. The expansion of the domestic market is therefore very important for local producers. Food production is spread throughout the country, and both home producers and rural small and medium enterprises producing food participate in the market, which contributes particularly to the socio-economic viability of the population living in rural communities. As a result, local food systems emerge, which is a complex phenomenon, as it involves more than just economic aspects. Food production, distribution and waste management are indirectly affected by several public policies, as the food production begins with the exploitation of primary production resources linked to the environment and ends with the development of cultural services, including the preservation of traditions and values. Accordingly, it might be argued that an LFS represents a very complex and diverse set of actors and their interrelationships, which is constrained by specific social, cultural, economic and institutional frameworks, and therefore the research aims to give insight into the public policy dimension in food systems and, based on the research findings, identify key problems and develop recommendations for the development of food systems in Latvia.</jats:p>",

The research aim is to assess tax reliefs, their dynamics and impact on the tax burden in agriculture in Latvia. The most essential tax allowance in Latvia is social support for the population; however, despite this, Latvia still has one of the highest income inequality rates in the EU Member States. It is necessary to continue the reduction of labour taxes, which is also very important in agriculture, in order to reduce the income inequality. In line with the country’s move towards the “green deal” and an increasing use of more economical technologies in agriculture, it is recommended to improve the application of excise duty reliefs on diesel fuel. The tax exemption for subsidies needs to be assessed in detail, as the positive aspects of this relief have a number of negative ones, mainly income inequality related with the tax imposition and lower social guarantees for farmers.</jats:p>",

In total, 56 genetic edits were performed, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants, as well as deletions, knock-downs and overexpression of ten yeast genes to improve precursor supplies towards de novo production of catharanthine and vindoline, from which semisynthesis to vinblastine occurs. As the vinblastine pathway is one of the longest MIA biosynthetic pathways, this study positions yeast as a scalable platform to produce more than 3,000 natural MIAs and a virtually infinite number of new-to-nature analogues.</jats:p>",

In Uzbekistan, almost half of the population lives in rural areas and most of them are smallholders. This paper examines how agricultural production diversification (APD) impacts rural households’ dietary diversity (HDD) using crop and livestock diversification separately at a household level. Data were analysed using a multivariate regression model, according to the results APD was positively correlated with HDD consumed their own production. Nevertheless, in terms of livestock diversification, there was a negative association with HDD which consumption comes from the market. Furthermore, it is identified that APD will increase productivity, especially livestock diversification is beneficial for nutrition. Along with, encouraging APD by the government can increase food availability and access by linking to agriculture in Uzbekistan. Besides that, dissemination of information on healthy eating by community self-government bodies, in the mass media, and at educational institutions will further increase their knowledge of dietary diversity as a food security indicator.</jats:p>",

The significance of the research topic stems from the need to use social capital as a factor in increasing the profitability of rural households in conditions of high deprivation poverty and low living standards in rural areas. Social capital is a resource, the capitalization of which forms the preconditions for increasing the profitability of households by converting social capital into other types of capital and minimizing transaction costs. The purpose of the study is to assess current trends in income generation of rural households in Ukraine and to define specifics of the relationship between income and social capital of villagers’ families. The study uses statistical methods, general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, dialectics and abstract-logical methods, the method of comparison. The methods of studying the relationship between social capital and household income are based on understanding the interaction of these economic categories in development. It is established that the vast majority of rural households in Ukraine are not involved in social networks that have a high potential for income growth, and the level and structure of their income are a barrier to the formation of social capital. The income and social capital of rural UTCs are accumulated mainly by the local elite, which is the reason for the spread of fragmented social capital, which is formed on the basis of closed networks.</jats:p>",

To investigate these effects, a field trial was established in the fall of 2010 with low (2.4 t ha−1), intermediate (6 t ha−1) and high (12 t ha−1) biochar doses. The biochar effect on soil nutrients is more pronounced in the surface soil and is dose dependent. In the surface soil, biochar application increased the availability of soil N, P and K. High dose decreased soil total Fe by 11.6% and Mn by 20.7%, leading to a slight but insignificant decrease in grain Fe and Mn concentration. The intermediate and high doses significantly increased the soil available Zn by 96.2% and 227.9% but did not affect the grain Zn concentration. Grain Cu concentration was significantly decreased by the intermediate (−19.6%) and high (−14.3%) dose of biochar. Biochar had a slight but insignificant boost on rice yield. Soil total C and N increased linearly with biochar application for the surface soil only where biochar was applied. In conclusion, with great soil C sequestration capacity, the long-term field return of biochar is beneficial for improving the soil macronutrient and Zn fertility, but caution is needed, as higher doses of biochar could potentially lead to a decrease in soil Fe and Mn and a reduction in grain Cu concentration.</jats:p>"

Therefore, financial institutions were forced to develop new types and directions of financing offer. The aim of our study is to find the financial needs of the micro-enterprises and the possible solutions to meet these needs. Micro-enterprises are more than 90% of all the SMEs in Latvia; therefore, analysis on their performance is essential. The survey in empirical research was focused to find out to what extent companies had access to finance, whether they needed new or additional funding and for what purposes financial support was needed. Research methods: analysis of scientific publications and pre-crisis research results, survey of entrepreneurs. Based on survey data, the authors have used main indicators of descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations, have conducted correlation analysis. In addition, the entrepreneurs were asked to disclose the funding used for their development and entrepreneurship. During the COVID-19 crisis, companies were seeking to fund their working capital to compensate for business disruptions caused by the loss of revenue, while in the long-term they seek capital to develop new products and services, to digitize and optimize the processes, to raise employee competence. The survey results have also revealed that micro-enterprises suffered to greater extent than larger ones, though they used much less of the offered state support, attempting to rely mainly on their internal resources. Moreover, even before the current economic crisis, it was found that micro-enterprises had more limited access to external finance than other types of SMEs. Based on the survey results, main conclusion points to the need to improve availability and diversity of public financial support for micro-enterprises, which is vital during crisis period, and as well as to adopt solutions to promote the further development of micro-enterprises.</jats:p>",

A Web-based IMS is a manageable, systematic tool to generate and evaluate ideas. The following research gap was identified in IMS literature by the authors – are there industry-specific differences in web-based IMS results based on application type? To fill the gap, this paper aims to investigate how the number of ideas created (quantity), the number of ideas selected (quality), and the number of involved people (involvement) changes depending on the applied IMS type and industry. To achieve the aim of the research, the authors conducted a global survey of 504 organisation representatives from different industries that apply web-based IMS within their organisations. Based on the analysis, Chi-squared test results (p &lt;0.05) allow us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference at a confidence level of 95% in the number of ideas created and people involved using all five IMS types. Further test results (p &lt;0.05) allow us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference at a confidence level of 95% between industry groups in the number of ideas selected when applying external, mixed and active IMS types. All industry groups, except the manufacturing industry, generate more ideas with mixed and active IMS. Agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying and activities of households as employers generate the greatest involvement when using mixed, external, and active IMS, while more ideas are selected when using mixed, active and internal IMS. Results show that different types of IMS applications could result in different outcomes in different industries. The main contribution of this research highlights the most likely IMS type industry should use to achieve a desired idea management outcome.</jats:p>",

Ensuring interference immunity of power supply bus (PSB) of on-board REE of SC. When designing the PSB, the task of ensuring the integrity of the power supply was solved by developing a protection device against conductive interference, including protection against ultra-short pulses (USP). The duration of such interference is in the nanosecond and subnanosecond range. Due to their wide range, such interference overcomes traditional means of protection. To protect against USP, devices called modal filters (MF) have been proposed. MFs are designed to be integrated into PSBs and provide effective protection against USP. Meanwhile, in order to obtain a complex protection effect of a spacecraft against radiated and conductive large-amplitude USP, a joint use of MF and an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter on elements with concentrated parameters is proposed. For the first time, recommendations on step-by-step development of an PSB protection device against USP, which is a hybrid consisting of MF and EMI-filter, are presented. Experimental studies have shown that such a hybrid attenuates common and differential interference in the frequency range up to 5 GHz by 5.81 and 11.9 times, respectively. In addition, the device is small and lightweight, which is important for space applications.</jats:p>"

The theory of property rights and externalities provides us with a new method to understand ecological compensation, which helps us to put forward a clear policy path to effectively solve the problem of ‘the tragedgy of the Commons’ in the ecological environment protection of river basins. Based on the externality problems of social and economic activities for a river basin, a standard calculation method under the combined scenario of ‘clear property rights, water quality and quantity, and opportunity cost’ was built in this paper. Taking the Minjiang River basin as an example, the definition of ecological property rights of the basin was divided into three scenarios: ‘upstream has pollution rights’, ‘upstream has no pollution rights’ and ‘upstream and downstream co-construction and sharing’. Ecological compensation standards of the Minjiang River basin under different property rights from 2015 to 2019 were calculated. The results showed that: (i) in the case where the upstream has pollution rights, the ecological compensation amount of Sanming City ranged from 2.41–9.36 × 108 Yuan, the final compensation value of Nanping City was 2.29–18.99 × 108 Yuan, and the ecological compensation cost of Fuzhou City was 6.78–28.35 × 108 Yuan; (ii) if the upstream area has no pollution rights, the compensation values of Sanming City and Nanping City to the downstream area were each 0; and (iii) under the case of upstream and downstream co-construction and sharing, the ecological compensation value of Sanming City was 6.25–21.34 × 108 Yuan, the final compensation value of Nanping City was 5.80–20.38 × 108 Yuan, and Fuzhou City needed to pay 12.05–36.38 × 108 Yuan for eco-compensation. The calculated results of ecological compensation standards in the Minjiang River basin indicated the amount of ecological compensation paid by the downstream to the upstream showing an upward trend on the whole. This method was relatively easy to define property rights and obtain data, taking into account the benefits of upstream and downstream, and the calculation process was relatively simple, which developed and supplemented the traditional ecological compensation method used for river basins.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to develop accelerometry‐based equations to predict both pGRF and pLR during walking and running. One hundred and thirty one subjects (79 females; 76.9 ± 19.6 kg) walked and ran at different speeds (2–14 km·h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) on a force plate–instrumented treadmill while wearing accelerometers at their ankle, lower back and hip. Regression equations were developed to predict pGRF and pLR from accelerometry data. Leave‐one‐out cross‐validation was used to calculate prediction accuracy and Bland–Altman plots. Our pGRF prediction equation was compared with a reference equation previously published. Body mass and peak acceleration were included for pGRF prediction and body mass and peak acceleration rate for pLR prediction. All pGRF equation coefficients of determination were above 0.96, and a good agreement between actual and predicted pGRF was observed, with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) below 7.3%. Accuracy indices from our equations were better than previously developed equations. All pLR prediction equations presented a lower accuracy compared to those developed to predict pGRF. Walking and running pGRF can be predicted with high accuracy by accelerometry‐based equations, representing an easy way to determine mechanical loading in free‐living conditions. The pLR prediction equations yielded a somewhat lower prediction accuracy compared with the pGRF equations.</jats:p>",
