      "abstract": "<jats:p>A great deal of research on innovation implicitly relies upon the network in which a firm is embedded to explain its innovative capabilities. Interestingly, however, most research examines innovation at the firm level, rather than at the network level. Thus, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding the effects of network structure on innovation within a firm's network. In this research, we contribute to the literature of supply chain innovations by developing and testing theoretically derived hypotheses regarding the effect of network structure on innovation output and distribution, as measured by the aggregate count and variance in the distribution of patents of the ego network in which a firm exists. Utilizing a manufacturing joint venture network dataset, we identify effects of various ego network constructs such as betweenness, density, brokerage, and weakness on ego network innovation. We find support for the idea that innovation in a supply chain is highly dependent upon the network structure of the interfirm relationships. Thus, it is not just what you know or how well you individually innovate, but also how well the firm can leverage its supply network connections that engender superior innovation outcomes.</jats:p>",

A conceptual rainfall–runoff model was used to simulate catchment runoff which, together with evapotranspiration, served as inputs into a reservoir model. Outputs from a regional climate model coupled with a weather generator indicate an increase in rainfall variability and evapotranspiration throughout the 21st century, resulting in a decrease in both the time-based and volumetric reliability of the reservoirs under the assumption of an unchanging demand, albeit with a less drastic reduction for the volumetric approach. It was found that the variability of rainfall had the greatest effect on reservoir reliability, outweighing the positive effect of an increase in total annual precipitation, while evapotranspiration had a lesser impact. A more drastic reduction in reliability was observed for the river intake schemes given their lack of storage capacity. The increase in water demand based on demographic projections further reduced reservoir reliability, especially when monthly variations in demand were taken into account. This paper concludes by suggesting adaptive strategies to deal with the projected changes in the supply and demand for water.</jats:p>",

It analyzes horticultural exporting firms in southeastern Spain, which are the main suppliers of European markets. Together with their primary customers (large-scale retail companies such as Carrefour, Tesco and Aldi), these firms constitute a complex supply network composed of a variety of agents and sales channels. This network will be studied from the perspective of the supplier–supplier relationship that is critical to their survival.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– Starting with a detailed description of Europe’s vegetable supply chain, a hierarchical regression is used with an index of cooperation intensity, moderated by retail sales and market concentration.

Moreover, the retail channel and market diversification are observed to have a positive effect on the relationship between cooperation and the supplier’s performance. They demonstrate that active cooperation strategies have a greater bearing on performance in those firms whose primary customers are retailers. This circumstance provides evidence of the synergies and benefits that may arise when the supplier integrates the retailer in the supply chain, but which do not arise with other types of customers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Although this study refers to a specific sector (fruits and vegetables) and the statistical results are limited, they provide insights that may assist in understanding how other perishable produce-related industries work: such industries share many common features.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– A more stable relationship between suppliers and retailers in the perishable produce market will render the supply firm more cooperative, competitive and profitable. Increased performance does not arise from the better conditions and improved sales power offered by the customer but instead from the adaptability of the supplier. Likewise, market diversification drives the supply firm toward a cooperative strategy, making it more profitable and competitive. As a practical norm, market diversification alone will not have positive results on performance unless the firm proves capable of enhancing its capacity for cooperation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Proper management of the agricultural produce supply chain has repercussions on all of the members of that chain, although special emphasis should be placed on producers and consumers. The availability of food, its quality and its safety depend on management during the production phase. Along these lines, and more specifically for the consumer, this work is relevant because the sector analyzed accounts for 40 per cent of the vegetables consumed in Europe.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This article defends the supplier–supplier relationship as the starting point for the analysis of a supply network. In certain sectors, the suppliers’ ability both to solve their clients’ problems and to be profitable is conditioned on maintaining the network and, therefore, the basic focus must center on analyzing their relationships, always including the customer, who has a direct or indirect influence on those relationships. Previous research has not comprehensively addressed this issue, let alone that of a sector with agile and perishable products in which, due to its nature, decision-making about market destinations and sales channels is the order of the day.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The long-term industry expectations of a leading provider in food service logistics are compared with an industry-wide external panel. The questions were designed to understand how managers perceive the emerging domain of sustainability in supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Environmentally oriented sustainability will remain a key driver of success in the field. However, after applying the dominant logic concept for analyzing results, it becomes apparent that managers have to continuously challenge internal existing expectations to translate an emerging domain into strategy. We show how the senior management team under investigation was challenged in its dominant logic and how it tried to overcome this situation during strategy development.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The study shows how managers perceive and cope with the emerging domain of environmentally oriented sustainability, how they translate it into strategy, and utilize resources for creating customer value. The research supports managers in adapting to new competitive environments. Furthermore, the study contributes by visualizing the dominant logic of a firm and the approach of top management for adjustment.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Since a large share of rotary converters can be expected to be in operation for decades to come in the railway power supply systems (RPSSs), it is important to make their operation as efficient as possible. The existing rotary converters may have unused capabilities particularly in load sharing, but also to some extent in reactive power compensation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Load-sharing improvement can be done in two steps; (1) coarsely by unit commitment within a converter station, (2) fine-tuned by controlling the terminal voltage of the converter station on the railway-side. The proposed optimization models minimize RPSS losses, including losses in the converters. The models are implemented and solved in the GAMS environment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The case studies are applied on Sweden-inspired RPSS designs and configurations, and the train load situations are varied.

Moreover, the participation rate of married women is positively correlated with their husbands’ income. We show that these two features can be partly explained by the tax system: a high tax rate together with tax credits and transfers raise the burden of two-earner households, generating disincentives to work. We estimate two structural models of labor supply: one where the husband’s labor supply is inelastic and one with joint couple decisions. Then we use the estimated parameters to simulate the effects of alternative revenue-neutral tax systems on labor supply. We find that working tax credit and gender-based taxation boost it, with the effects of the former being concentrated on low educated women. Conversely, joint taxation implies a drop in the participation rate.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>JEL codes:</jats:bold>J21, J22, H31</jats:p>",

Given this study’s historically qualitative approach to reporting, this paper aims to introduce quantitative analysis. In this paper, responses that report membership in Standard Industrial Classification 2007 industry sectors from the 2013 Supply Chain Resilience Survey were disaggregated and related to supply chain disruption reporting. A chi-square test of independence reveals that membership in a particular industry sector influences reporting of supply chain disruption. Nonetheless, the relationship between these variables is weak. This study demonstrates interesting differences between industry sectors in terms of supply chain resilience. Further research is required in terms of other variables in order to provide granularity and relevant findings to supply chain planners.</jats:p>"

We discuss the effects of pH and coexisting salts on VUV photolysis. In experiments at various pH levels, the VUV photolysis performance decreased in the alkaline region for pH above 7. Furthermore, nitrate and inorganic carbon compromised the performance, probably owing to the generation of active oxidant species (such as hydroxyl radicals and carbonate radicals) during the photolysis. However, photochemical experiments conducted in pure water revealed that VUV photolysis is 4.1-fold more energy efficient than UV photolysis using a low-pressure mercury lamp. Although the performance of VUV photolysis in tap water was about 40% less efficient than that in pure water, mainly owing to the presence of bicarbonate ions, the performance was still higher than that of UV photolysis in pure water. However, VUV photolysis may not be feasible in tap water with a high concentration of nitrate ions, because nitrate produces a stronger inhibition effect than other salts.</jats:p>",

Each supply chain partner is important for achievement of customer requirements. On the one hand, supply chain is an inexhaustible source of competitive advantage, created by the companies, which constitute it. However, on the other hand, due to its complexness, supply chain is an easy target of numerous factors, which jeopardize its competitiveness. Some of those factors are: turbulence, deliberate threats, external pressures, resource limits, sensitivity, and supplier/customer disruptions. Successful dealing with those factors assumes establishment of mechanisms for increasing supply chain resilience. Many researches indicate that some factors have greater influence on supply chain disruption and discontinuance. If those factors can be isolated, it will be easier to manage them or to avoid their influence. Therefore, the objective of the research presented in this paper is identification of the most frequent causes of supply chain disturbances, as a first step for developing supply chain resilience. According to the research results, the authors suggest what should be a primary focus of supply chain management, dealing with issues of resilience. Also, the authors indicate which characteristics (capability factors) supply chains have to have in order to be considered resistant.</jats:p>"

A multi‐study approach led to increasing levels of measure refinement and facilitated examination of various assumptions researchers have made about the consumer market for remanufactured products. Based in part on the measure building studies, an experimental study examined remanufactured product perceptions from a national panel of consumers. The consumers responded to remanufactured product descriptions that manipulated price discount and brand equity. The results indicate that discounting had a consistently positive, linear effect on remanufactured product attractiveness. Curiously, the brand equity manipulation proved less important to consumers than specific remanufactured product quality perceptions. The results also show that green consumers and consumers who consider remanufactured products green typically found remanufactured products significantly more attractive. Finally, the findings introduce the concept of negative attribute perceptions, such as disgust, that had a significantly detrimental effect on remanufactured product attractiveness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are commonly used as food containers as they are lightweight. PET bottles contain antimony (Sb) and phthalate compounds. In contact with food, antimony and phthalate molecules could migrate from the inner surface of a PET bottle to the food. Therefore, we studied the effect of NaCl concentration in PET bottles on the leakage of antimony and phthalates. It was found that the concentration of antimony leached into the solution was about 6 ngl−1 after 5 days storage at room temperature in the absence of NaCl. Increasing NaCl concentrations to 6% caused a decrease in the amount of soluble antimony in the solution to 2 ngl−1 under the same conditions. In addition, the maximum leakage of phthalate compounds of about 130 ngl−1 occurred after 35 days of storage at 60 °C in 0.1% NaCl. It was found that the leakage of phthalate compounds decreased at higher NaCl concentrations (NaCl 0.5%–30%). Higher NaCl concentrations led to a decrease in the migration of antimony and phthalate compounds into the solution. This might be due to the fact that antimony and phthalate compounds form complexes with NaCl. However, the leakage of these compounds was lower than the standard guidelines of the United States Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water.</jats:p>",

In previous sediment-runoff models, the sediment production rates of mountain slopes, and the sediment supply rates to streams typically have been developed using empirical methods. A process-based model for sediment production and supply is, however, required for more exact simulations of sediment runoff. In this study, we develop a method to calculate the sediment production rate due to both freeze-thaw action and the sediment supply rate (i.e. erosion rate of talus). These numerical models were then connected to an existing sediment transport model. The integrated model presented here was applied to a small mountainous watershed. We found that the calculated sediment production rate was within the range of values typically observed for this region. Additionally, the estimated annual sediment discharge using the model agreed with observational results. Lastly, we found that the model can be used to qualitatively characterize typical features of the actual sediment routine in mountainous watersheds.\n                    </jats:p>"

I find a substantial positive and independent effect of a country's egalitarian gender-role attitudes on individual women's odds of labor market attachment. The original, gross effect can for one-fourth be attributed to an effect of individual gender-role attitudes and one-tenth to an institutional effect.

This article examines what factors prolonged the recovery of plants, using Research Institute for Economy, Trade and Industry’s (RIETI) survey of affected plants in the Tohoku area. Our study reveals that not only the loss of infrastructure, such as, electricity, water and transport, but also the collapse of the supply chain caused a nationwide fall in production and the breakdown of the supply chain extended the recovery period for plants even after the restoration of electricity, the industrial water supply and the transport network. Our study concludes that disaster-hit firms suffer for a longer period and can adversely affect firms untouched by disaster, if the recovery of the supply chain is delayed. </jats:p>",

This paper explores the operations of a global supply chain for extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) according to a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The LCA assessment methodology is applied to determine the environmental impact categories associated with the bottled EVOO life cycle, focusing on packaging decisions. The proposed analysis identifies the greatest environmental stressors of the EVOO supply chain, thereby supporting strategic and operative decisions toward more efficient and environmentally-friendly operations management and packaging choices. This paper quantifies the environmental categories of the impacts of global warming potential, ozone layer depletion, non-renewable energy use, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical smog, for the observed EVOO supply chain, given alternative packaging configurations, i.e., a glass bottle vs. a plastic bottle. The observed system includes the supply of EVOO, the EVOO processing and bottling, the supply of packaging, the distribution of final products to customers, the end-of-life (EOL) treatments regarding the management, recycling and the disposal of waste across a global supply chain. The findings from the LCA highlight the potential of PET bottles in reducing the environmental impact of EVOO supply chains and identifies hotspots of discussion for policy-makers, EVOO producers and consumers.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the internal structure as well as performance parameters of LM2577 boosting converter were deeply investigated and based on this investigation we proposed two new methods of improving its Load Regulation. One method (method 1) is to replace the resistor connected to the feedback pin of LM2577 with a programmable potentiometer and sample the variation of output voltage using an AD converter. The potentiometer is adjusted under the control of feedback algorithm to keep the output voltage stable, thus the load regulation enhanced. In the other method (method 2), the feedback pin of LM2577 is connected to an adder to stabilize the output voltage of DC power supply and increase the load regulation. A voltage divider made up of resistors divides the output voltage and provide the divided voltage to one input of the adder. The other adder input comes from DA converter controlled by microcontroller. To reduce the adjust time and increase the efficiency, PID algorithm is applied in the software part of the system. We use 12-bit AD (ADS1115), 12-bit DA (TLV 5638) and 10-bit programmable potentiometer (AD5293) to test the methods above under the condition of 5V input voltage and 600mA load current. When output is set to 7V, the load regulation is improved from 1.043%, the rate from application circuit in LM2577’s Datasheet, to 0.700% and 0.042% by applying the first and second method, respectively. When output voltage equals 12V, the improvement is from 0.658% to 0.008% and 0.008%. Meanwhile, the method 2 suppresses output voltage ripple to be less than 10mV.</jats:p>"

Water resources allocation is usually a multi-objective problem, and has been of concern for many researchers. In the north of China, the lack of water resources in the Huai River Basin has handicapped the development of the economy, especially badly in the low-flow period. So it is necessary to study water resources allocation in this area. In this paper, a multi-objective dynamic water resources allocation model has been developed. The developed model took the overall satisfaction of water users in a time interval as the objective function, applied an improved simplex method to solve the calculation, considered the overall users' satisfaction variation with time, and followed the principle that the variation of the system satisfaction within adjacent periods of time must be minimal. The established model was then applied to the Huai River, for the present situation (2010), short-term (2020) and long-term (2030) planning timeframes. From the calculation results, the overall satisfaction in late May and mid September in 2030 was 0.65 and 0.70. After using the model allocation optimization, the overall satisfaction was improved, increasing to 0.78 and 0.79, respectively, thus achieving the dynamic balance optimization of water resources allocation in time and space. This model can provide useful decision support in water resources allocation, when it is used to alleviate water shortages occurring in the low-flow period.</jats:p>",

In these biofilters, planned or inadvertent oxygen deprivation may occur for a variety of reasons. The water quality effects of oxygen deprivation on the function of drinking water biofilters, however, have not previously been reported. In this study, a 5-day oxygen deprivation period in full-scale biofilters was found to affect iron, manganese and ammonium concentrations differently. During the oxygen deprivation period, iron continued to be removed, although a greater depth of filter media was required to carry out the removal. Manganese oxide in filter media was mobilized, causing manganese water concentrations to increase well above raw water levels. The ammonium in the raw water passed through the biofilters unchanged, indicating the dependence of nitrification microorganisms on oxygen as their sole electron acceptor. Stringent national drinking water criteria were exceeded during the deprivation period but were once again met within hours after oxygenation was recommenced. Manganese and nitrite recovery to pre-deprivation concentrations, however, required days. The results illustrate the interdependence of treatment parameters and provide valuable practical information to waterworks that experience or plan oxygen stoppage.</jats:p>",

Water samples were collected from 13 sampling stations; observing the river and its most important tributary. The analysis of these samples showed that the water index of the river ranked as poor. The degradation of water quality of the river is mainly due to the lack of control over discharged materials and lack of water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>2014 marks the 40th anniversary of the seminal discovery by Johannes Rook, in 1974, that trihalomethanes (THMs) were formed by the chlorination of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water. Since this discovery, which revolutionized how we viewed drinking water safety and quality, hundreds of other classes of disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been discovered. The finding in 1976 by the US National Cancer Institute that chloroform, the dominant THM, was a rodent carcinogen spurred a large number of epidemiology and toxicology studies into chlorinated drinking water. In 1985, this cancer finding was shown to be wrong. We should now be asking: What do we know about the human health impacts of DBPs in drinking water? Bladder cancer has been the most consistent finding from epidemiologic studies in North America and Europe and the possibility that chlorinated drinking water contributes an increased risk of bladder cancer remains a viable hypothesis. Despite some recent improvements in exposure assessments to focus on inhalation and dermal exposures rather than ingestion, no causal agent with sufficient carcinogenic potency has been identified, nor has a mechanistic model been validated. Consequently, a sensible precautionary approach to managing DBPs remains the only viable option based on four decades of evidence.</jats:p>",

We review the present status and developments focusing on the rational metabolic engineering of such cells to optimize the supply chain for building blocks and energy. Methods comprise selection of beneficial genetic modifications, rational design of media and feeding strategies. Design of better producer cells based on whole genome-wide metabolic network analysis becomes increasingly possible. High-resolution methods of metabolic flux analysis for the complex networks in these compartmented cells are increasingly available. We discuss phenomena that are common to both types of organisms but also those that are different with respect to the supply chain for the production and secretion of pharmaceutical proteins.</jats:p>",

Among the different ambient energy sources in marine gearboxes, frictional heat has been identified to be appropriate to thermally power a thermoelectric generator (TEG). The such generated electricity may power wireless sensor nodes for detecting temperature, vibration, torque and rotational speed. Requirements for a corresponding energy supply are formulated, constructive solutions are presented and thermal simulations and practical experiments are reviewed. The results are evaluated and a solution is selected for further implementation, which provides for an actively cooled TEG in the area of the ship gearbox’s heat exchanger. This can provide continuous electrical power of up to 14 mW, thus supplying the planned sensor nodes. The disadvantage of this solution is that a comparatively extensive mechanical modification, for example, to the oil and cooling water pipelines is required.</jats:p>",

The main supplier is prone to supply disruption and recurrent supply uncertainty, and the backup supplier is perfectly reliable but supply goods at higher prices. Three kinds of backup contracts between the buyer and the backup supplier are investigated to mitigate supply risks: A capacity reservation contract, a make-to-order contract, and a buy-back contract. Models are developed to study how the buyer's expected profit and optimal decisions related to each contract change with the supply risks. We also examine the sensitivity of various cost parameters on the optimal decisions, and compare the values of three backup contracts for the buyer. Furthermore, we present how these results differ from those obtained in the analysis with demand uncertainty considered. Our study provides managerial insights into the positive effects of different backup contracts on the buyer's expected profit in the events of unexpected disruption. </jats:p>",

Intermodal transportation involves the use of container ships, planes, railway systems, land bridges, road networks and barges. This paper examines the the nefarious nature of intentional disruption and nefarious risks associated with the movement of cargo and container freight. The paper explores main threats, vulnerabilities and security measures relevant to significant intermodal transit risk issues such as theft, piracy, terrorism, contamination, counterfeiting and product tampering. Three risk and vulnerability models are examined and basic standards and regulations that are relevant to safe and secure transit of container goods across international supply networks are outlined.</jats:p>"

Benzodiazepine prescriptions were frequently encountered in practice and commonly for extended durations of 28 days. Pharmacists’ involvement in roles extending beyond dispensing was limited. In the 6 months prior to the questionnaire, fewer than half of pharmacists reported having suggested discontinuation to a patient (43.7%) or having contacted a prescriber about a patient’s benzodiazepine use (47.1%).

The findings indicate the need to revisit existing benzodiazepine guidelines to improve pharmacists’ awareness of them and to address long-term prescribing. The apparent lack of active pharmacist involvement in roles and activities extending beyond dispensing needs to be addressed. Given that most pharmacists encountered benzodiazepine prescriptions at least once daily in practice, they are well positioned to promote safe and appropriate benzodiazepine use. Sizeable proportions of pharmacists expressed willingness to expand upon their existing role and facilitate long-term patients in attempting discontinuation. Further research is needed to explore barriers and facilitators to pharmacists undertaking extended roles in benzodiazepine supply in greater detail.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The operations of reservoirs produce enormous economic and social benefits but also impact species composition and habitat distribution of the riverine ecosystem. Hence, the realization of conservation and restoration of the ecosystem calls for reservoir reoperation. It is a widespread consensus that providing suitable ecological flow (SEF) for ecosystems is a useful way to cushion adverse effects. In contrast to the conventional methods that take a minimum ecological flow as a constraint, studies have been conducted to establish multi-objective operation models with an ecological objective recently. This paper considers two cascaded reservoirs: the Three Gorges Project (TGP) and the Gezhouba Dam in the middle Yangtze River. By concentrating on urgent ecological problems such as the reproduction of four major species of Chinese carp and the propagation of Chinese sturgeon, a series of monthly SEF was synthesized. Afterward, a long-term multi-objective optimization model that maximizes power generation and minimizes the water volume that violates ecosystem water requirements was developed to study the relationship between the two objectives. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II method was applied to solve the proposed model. The optimized results show that according to the present water control operating regulations, the monthly amount of released water of TGP can be sufficient for ecosystem requirements except in October. The ecological model is better in improving the river ecosystem, but at the expense of power generation loss. Moreover, this method provides a set of operational non-dominated schemes between the target objectives for decision-makers to select and could be useful for water resource management of reservoirs.</jats:p>",

Optimális esetben a vállalatok integrált rendszerben működnek, az együttműködés bizal mi alapon nyugszik, így a közös stratégiai döntések révén versenyképes lesz a lánc. Az ellátási láncban lehet egy kulcsfontosságú vállalat, amelyik domináns hatalmi pozícióval rendelkezik. A kutatás célja, hogy feltárja a hatalommal rendelkező vállalat szerepét a partnercégek és az ellátási lánc versenyképességének alakulásában. A szakirodalom alapján a hipotézis feltételezi, hogy van kapcsolat a versenyképesség és a domináns vállalat szerepvállalása között. A szerzők elemzése primer kutatáson alapul, a kérdőív válaszait SPSS statisztikai kiértékeléssel végezték. Az eredmények azt mutatták, hogy a domináns vállalat versenyképességétől valóban függ a partnercégek versenyképessége. Szignifikáns kapcsolat megléte bizonyítja a hipotézist. A vizsgálatok kiemelik, hogy a verseny már egy szinttel feljebb, az ellátási lánc szintjén értelmezhető: globális ellátási láncok versenyeznek egymással. _____ Supplier, producer and buyer companies make up a supply chain. In an optimal case the companies are integrated, partnership rests on trust which results in common strategic decisions leading to competitiveness. Each supply chain has a key company with dominant power position. The objective of the research is to analyse how the company with power affects competitiveness of partner firms and the supply chain as a whole. Based on theories hypothesis assumes a link between competitiveness and power position and its influence. Methodology of the analysis is based on primary research; the authors used SPSS statistical analysis to evaluate the answers of questionnaire. Findings include that partner firms’ competitiveness rely on competitiveness of the company with dominant power position. Significant connections prove that the hypothesis is true. Results show that competitiveness is being moved up to supply chain level. Global supply chains compete with each other.</jats:p>",

The air conditioner manufacturer should first focus on the product energy efficiency increase, and secondly the eco-design, especially the refrigerant improvement. But the energy efficiency increase would be the only effective way for microwave.

As a result, the input power factor of the main converter used in the rolling stock has been controlled to 1. In accordance with this change, the role of reactive compensation of static var compensators (SVC) has shifted from the load power of trains to the power consumed by the reactance in the electrical power system. Therefore, when taking into consideration the aging of power converters, it is time to reassess their layout and the configuration for the future of the Tokaido Shinkansen. We reassessed the equipment configuration, capacity, and layout of power converters and verified the impact on the stabilization of the power supply when introducing self‐commutated power converters.</jats:p>",

Despite the extensive research on forward logistics and RL, there is a paucity of studies that examine the barriers to implementing RL particularly within the Australian construction industry. This study builds on the ongoing research being undertaken by the authors, entitled “Designing for reverse logistics (DfRL) within the building life cycle: practices, drivers and barriers”, which is examining the best practices and drivers that could be used as a “road map” for developing appropriate solutions for the successful implementation of RL. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Data were collected by utilising a triangulated data collection approach, a literature review and 49 questionnaires.

The least ranked barriers were mostly drawn from the operational and industrial categories as being: organisational lack of support for deconstruction due to incompatible design; lack of organisational support for deconstructing buildings due to higher health and safety risks; and inadequate skills and experience for deconstruction (operational). The industrial barrier was related to “higher costs of salvaged materials in comparison to virgin products”. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – First, the reported findings are focussed on one study that used questionnaire surveys within the construction industry; therefore, the results may not be generalisable to other contexts. Further, studies should be conducted and extended to other industrial sectors beyond the construction industry.

Output is regulated with production quotas, and imports are restricted through a system of tariff-rate quotas. Many of Canada's trading partners are seeking better access to Canadian dairy and poultry markets in negotiations over proposed preferential trade agreements. These pressures have renewed debate about the future of SM in Canada. We investigate one criticism of SM: that high prices for dairy and poultry products impose regressive distributional effects on Canadian consumers. We apply the Exact Affine Stone Index demand model to data from the Canadian Food Expenditure Survey to estimate consumer responses to price changes for dairy and poultry products. Parameters from the demand model are used to generate welfare comparisons between the current SM regime and a counterfactual liberalized market. Canada's SM policies are highly regressive, imposing a burden of approximately 2.3 percent ($339) of income per year on the poorest households, compared to 0.5 percent ($554) for the richest households. The burden is larger for households with children. </jats:p>",

A total of 20 quaternary loose rock pore water and tertiary clastic rock cranny pore water data sets were used for Jilin City, China, as basic data, and 10 water quality parameters were selected for reduction using rough set theory and a statistical analysis of groundwater quality. Results showed that the quality of confined water was better than that of phreatic water in the study area. Confined water was of good quality, and met the permissible limits of the Quality Standards for Groundwater of China, with the exception of NH4+ and F−. For phreatic water, the five parameters of total dissolved solids, NH4+, NO2−, Fe, and F− exceeded the permissible limits, with levels of NH4+ and Fe having a 70% and 40% rate of exceedance, respectively. The results indicated that water evaluation before and after attribute reduction was consistent, which suggests that through rough set theory redundant parameters in indices were eliminated but the accuracy of water quality classification remained effective, while the complexity of the calculation was reduced. Rough set theory provides a convenient and appropriate way to manage large amounts of water quality data.</jats:p>",

Rheo-encephalographic study, research of the autonomic nervous system state, heart rate regulation and questioning of 17–29 year-old students have been conducted. Basic hemodynamic indices were normal in all surveyed students. Increase in body weight index enhanced the probability of the brain blood supply deterioration. Adaptation mechanisms tension was accompanied by reduction of the rheographic index. Higher blood filling of the brain vessels corersponded to higher ratio “blood minute volume / due blood minute volume” defined taking into account the system arterial pressure. The quantity of links with indicators of the autonomic nervous system state was limited. Nonlinear dependence of the rheographic index on the Kerdo vegetative index was observed: the rheographic index value was the lowest in students with the autonomic balance by the Kerdo vegetative index; it was the highest in the group with the sympathetic prevalence. Risk factor of blood filling decrease was the reduction in the diet variety when foodstuffs of different groups were included into the diet less than twice a week, or they were excluded from the diet completely. Positive correlation of blood supply was observed more often with frequent consumption of fish, vegetables, and fresh fruits. Increase in the regular alcohol intake experience promoted decrease in brain blood supply and increase in asymmetries of blood supply indicators. The effect of alcohol was essential, despite young age of surveyed students and low level of alcohol consumption. Increase in the experience and intensity of smoking was accompanied by deterioration of brain blood supply indicators. Students with the best blood supply had the better academic progress. Observed multiple correlations of blood supply indicators with behavioural factors allowed to assert that reduction of risk factors (control of body weight, variety and full value of a diet, refusal of smoking, alcohol restriction even below doses which are considered safe) would allow to improve the brain blood supply.</jats:p>"

A new challenge is to meet the food demands of an expanding world population in the face of pessimistic climate change scenarios and the increasing scarcity of land. Can Brazil help meet rising world food demand while conserving its tropical rainforests? To address this question we simulate outcomes using a large dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium model of Brazil to model land use over 20 years in 90 zones and 14 agricultural sectors. The model features a land‐use change module based on a transition matrix obtained from satellite imagery. We analyze two scenarios of deforestation reduction, both linked to actual policy proposals. Model results indicate several mechanisms that allow food output to increase without expanding land supply. In particular, we stress the role of Brazil's vast, low‐yield pasture area as a source of future cropland. Thus, we find that controlling deforestation leads to rather small decreases in food output—which could be neutralized by tiny exogenous productivity improvements. We conclude that the decrease in deforestation will not significantly compromise Brazilian agricultural supply capacity in the foreseeable future.</jats:p>",

Traditional statistical indicators, such as mean and standard deviation, are useful to track these trends, but they can sometimes fail to capture relevant and nontrivial properties. In this work, we first highlight the limits of these traditional statistical tools and we then offer a new network approach to study water withdrawals. Public supply water withdrawal data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2005 were used in gallons of water per capita per day for all U.S. counties. Essentially, a network is formed between counties when they have withdrawal values within a certain range, ± ξ, of one another. A giant cluster rapidly emerges, containing more than 80% of the nodes for a ξ of 1%. The counties with the highest number of connections are associated with the mode of distribution, and we found multimodal patterns for earlier years. Moreover, the average shortest‐path length can be seen as the spread of a distribution. Overall, beyond a possible process of homogenization, water withdrawal patterns do not seem to have evolved much from 1985 to 2005, and no spatial correlation was detected. Though the methodology is yet to be formalized, it manages to give meaningful insights to supplement traditional statistical analyses.</jats:p>",

Anecdotal evidence further suggests that this decline in profitability arises from a decline in operational performance. However, the results of our study, which empirically examines the bullwhip effect across supply chain partners through an analysis of 383 actual customer base‐supplier dyads, challenge this commonly held position by suggesting that while traditional bullwhip often yields reduced ROA, it ultimately has no relationship with the firm's operating margin. Additionally, our results also call into question whether or not production coordination between customers and suppliers can minimize the need for inventory and capacity buffers, which are the two commonly utilized methods for battling the bullwhip effect. Thus the relationship between bullwhip and firm performance is far more nuanced and complicated than previously believed. We also show how the managerial bullwhip levers of coordinating production across supply chain partners, or deploying inventory and capacity buffer control mechanisms, can help maximize a firm's performance along different dimensions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The aims of this paper are to determine the aquifer vulnerability of Sefid-Dasht, in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran, using the DRASTIC model. In addition, the groundwater quality index (GQI) technique was applied to assess the groundwater quality and study the spatial variability of major ion concentrations using a geographic information system (GIS). The vulnerability index ranged from 65 to 132, classified into two classes: low and moderate vulnerability. In the southern part of the aquifer, the vulnerability was moderate. Furthermore, the results indicate that the magnitude of the GQI index varies from 92% to 95%. This means the water has a suitable quality. However, from the north to the south and southwest of the aquifer, the water quality has been deteriorating, and the highest concentration of major ions was found in the southwest of the Sefid-Dasht aquifer. A comparison of the vulnerability maps with the GQI index map indicated a poor relation between them. In the DRASTIC method, movement of groundwater is not considered and may be the reason for such inconsistency. However, the movement of groundwater can transport contaminants.</jats:p>",

However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important cell factory, does not naturally accumulate fatty acids in large quantities. Therefore, metabolic engineering strategies were carried out to increase the glycolytic fluxes to fatty acid biosynthesis in yeast, specifically to enhance the supply of precursors, eliminate competing pathways, and bypass the host regulatory network. This review will focus on the genetic manipulation of both structural and regulatory genes in each step for fatty acids overproduction in S. cerevisiae, including from sugar to acetyl-CoA, from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, and from malonyl-CoA to fatty acyl-CoAs. The downstream pathways for the conversion of fatty acyl-CoAs to the desired products will also be discussed.</jats:p>",

Nuclear power (particularly, transportable nuclear power plants) provides the new possibilities of power supply, which is very important for deposits' development. This article shares the economic aspects of forecasting in the field of power development (in particular, nuclear power on the basis of transportable nuclear power plants). Economic barriers of development of innovative nuclear technologies are considered on the example of transportable nuclear power plants. At the same time, there are given the ways of elimination of such barrier to development of this technology as methodical absence of investigation of a question of distribution of added cost between producers of innovative equipment and final product. Addition of new analytical tool (“business diagonal”) is offered for a method of definition of economically efficient distribution of added cost (received as a result of introduction of innovative technologies) between participants of production and consumption of atomic energy within the “economic cross” model. There is offered the order of use of method of cash flows discounting at calculations between nuclear market participants. Economic methods, offered in this article, may be used in forecasting of development of other energy technologies and introduction of prospective energy equipment.</jats:p>"

We studied the effect of NPK fertilization and row spacing on the yield. The fertilizer doses were based on a 25-year longterm experiment. Compared to control, the N40 +PK treatment has also achieved a significant yield increase, although some hybrids responsed with yield loss to the increasing fertilizer doses; this effect was observed especially in 2014. The majority of hybrids reached higher yields in both years using the 50 cm row spacing. The water release of hybrids was measured weekly during the maturation, at the same time points. The rainy September slowed ripening and the water release of the hybrids in 2013, so the grain wet content at harvest showed higher values. The moisture contents were increased for some hybrids, in spite of the positive and favorable dynamic of water loss.</jats:p>"

It is shown that traditional revenue sharing contract does not coordinate the system. As an alternative, two new mechanisms are proposed (i) revenue sharing with coordinated effort of the retailer alone and (ii) both revenue and effort sharing contract. In addition, a crucial modification of revenue sharing fraction is also proposed. To enhance the applicability of revenue sharing contract, the contract parameters are determined by using bi-level multi-objective fuzzy goal programming technique where manufacturer sets the wholesale price greater than the marginal cost. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate all the models. </jats:p>",

We investigate the extent to which greater supply of nursing home beds or lower prices can reduce hospital bed‐blocking using a new Local Authority (LA) level administrative data from England on hospital delayed discharges in 2009–2013. The results suggest that delayed discharges respond to the availability of care home beds, but the effect is modest: an increase in care home beds by 10% (250 additional beds per LA) would reduce social care delayed discharges by about 6–9%. We also find strong evidence of spillover effects across LAs: more care home beds or fewer patients aged over 65 years in nearby LAs are associated with fewer delayed discharges. © 2015 The Authors. <jats:italic>Health Economics</jats:italic> Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate such a Marangoni-driven flow by continuously supplying isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on a film of water, using micron-sized droplets of IPA-water mixtures. These droplets create a localized depression in surface tension that leads to the opening of a circular, thin region in the water film. At the edge of the thin region, there is a growing rim that collects the water of the film, reminiscent of Marangoni spreading due to locally deposited surfactants. In contrast to the surfactant case, the driving by IPA-water drops gives rise to a dynamics of the thin zone that is independent of the initial layer thickness. The radius grows as r ∼ t1/2, which can be explained from a balance between Marangoni and viscous stresses. We derive a scaling law that accurately predicts the influence of the IPA flux as well as the thickness of the thin film at the interior of the spreading front.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dhaka Water Supply System Management (i.e.; Dhaka WASA) is the main service provider in drainage system maintenance in Dhaka city. In the mega-city of Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh, with over 10 million people facing acute problems in increasing urban flooding, storm sewrage and sanitation which affecting millions of inhabitants and businesses every year. To remedy these urban flooding problems the responsible authority, (DWASA) has started the Urban Dredging Demonstration Project (UDDP) under the existing partnership with Vitens Evides International from the Netherlands. Once Dhaka city has 49 canals which served as the natural drainage system but with the course of time most of canals are illegally occupied and disappeared and rest of them have become narrower, silted up, and blocked. To overcome this problems adoption of new dredging tecnology and longterm dredging plan with WIT (sediment information system) offers a solution. WIT is a dynamic web-based GIS application for planning and maintenance operations of drainage system. It offers a unique combination of tools which makes it possible to process data and prepare long-term dredging plans. Practical modules allow for the optimisation of maintenance dredging by calculating quantities dredged material, the testing of data quality and planning of maintenance dredging. The data can be visualized in tables, diagrams, charts for invsetgating the following questions: location of dredged waterways, volume of sediment (material) to be dredged, quality (chemical and physical) of the dredged materials, total costs of the dredging operations and maintenance, available sites for disposal. </jats:p>"

In the FO + RO process seawater was used as feed water (FW) and a concentrated aqueous solution was used as a draw solution (DS). By taking advantage of natural osmosis, pure water is transferred from the FW to the DS and then recovered from the DS by the RO process utilising low resistance membranes, and hence lower specific energy consumption (SEC). This paper presents results of FO experiments conducted on flat sheet membrane using a bench-scale rig. The osmotic agent investigated in this study was magnesium sulphate, which is non-toxic, and highly soluble in water. Furthermore experiments were carried out on the RO pilot in order to regenerate the DS for reuse in the FO process and produce clean water. This paper also presents some pilot plant results and data from commercial plants in Oman and Gibraltar. The data demonstrates the efficiency of the FO + RO compared with the conventional RO process in terms of SEC and membrane fouling performance.</jats:p>",

We consider energy management function at different levels of microgrid like, at stand-alone EV parking lot, at residential loads and at commercial building loads, etc. The energy supply and management system is not only connected to the power grid but also with a combination of fixed Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Local Area Network (LAN). First we perform load balancing among different kinds of loads in a microgrid such that extra electrical resource may be transferred to resource constrained loads by using game theoretic approach, and later we propose a distributed algorithm for load scheduling of electric vehicles parked in stand-alone parking lot in microgrid to minimize the sum of total energy cost for charging the battery of electric vehicles and spreading out the charging power equally over the charging time using interior point method (IPM). This results in reduction of peak charging power based on EVs own consumption schedule while they select the best response in energy consumption game.</jats:p>"

In an environmental centered world, logistics is called to put into action advanced programs based on technological and organizational improvement, in order to gain or maintain a concrete competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how logistics organizations try to face the recent ecological challenges and the role that the emergent green technologies play in making them finally “green” and competitive.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices have been investigated to better understand their influence on economic performance and corporate competitiveness. After providing a background discussion on Green Logistics and GSCM, the authors have also identified specific research questions that are worthy of investigation, also thorough the DHL case study.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring food safety in various steps along the entire food value chain is crucial to prevent undesired and harmful substances entering the food humans consume. Pesticides and antifungal agents used during growth, processing or along the logistic chain from the field to the consumer can be toxic causing a range of symptoms from stomach pain to the death of the consumer even at trace levels of concentrations. To prevent dangerous additives and contaminants entering the food chain governmental restrictions on a large number of hazardous components have been put into place and are tightly monitored. For a large number of tests complex and sophisticated equipment is required along with time consuming sample preparation steps, not permitting instantaneous sampling of the specimen at the point of measurement or in a timely manner. In order to become a commercially applicable technique, the complexity of the sample preparation and the analysis routine needs to be simplified without losing performance in terms of identification and quantification of the dangerous contaminants. Raman spectroscopy is a technology to allow for quick and rigid analysis of materials without a large amount of sample preparation. The use of surface enhancement of the Raman signal by means of gold or silver nanoparticles would allow for taking this measurement to the field with high accuracy for even small concentrations. The high cost and poor reproducibility of commercially available substrates has so far limited the successful application of SERS measurements along the food value chain. The use of an affordable handheld Raman instrument with mass-producible SERS substrates will be described  in the frame of the contribution with respect to requirements imposed at various stages along the food value chain.</jats:p>",

There are several implications of unavailability of medicines, such as unwarranted out-of-pocket expenditures and consequent indebtedness in some cases. Medicine unavailability is also one of the major reasons for lower utilization of the public health system. Thus, present study was undertaken to enhance understanding of the problem of medicine unavailability, as well as the process of indent and supply from the primary health centre (PHC) and other functional aspects linked with availability, such as inventory management and different sources of medicine supply. Using case study method, the study examines data from two PHCs in Pune district, Maharashtra. Findings of the study indicate several lacunae in the existing indent and supply system of medicines in Maharashtra. Some of the medicines were supplied through multiple sources and yet, these medicines were NIL in stock. Inventory management of the medicines was rather inadequate. Medicine supply system is not demand responsive. Hence, major reforms in the current medicine indent–supply system are essential to ensure adequate supply of medicines to the patients in the public health system. </jats:p>",

The optimal sequencing of urban water supply augmentation options is one example of this. In this paper, an adaptive, multiobjective optimal sequencing approach for urban water supply augmentation under deep uncertainty is introduced. As part of the approach, optimal long‐term sequence plans are updated at regular intervals and trade‐offs between the robustness and flexibility of the solutions that have to be fixed at the current time and objectives over the entire planning horizon are considered when selecting the most appropriate course of action. The approach is demonstrated for the sequencing of urban water supply augmentation options for the southern Adelaide water supply system for two assumed future realities. The results demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach, as it is able to identify optimal sequences that perform better than those obtained using static approaches.</jats:p>",

Discussions around extending criteria to solid and gaseous biomass, including wood pellets, have been ongoing. Continued investment in forest bioenergy feedstock production is partly dependent on the stability of global market demand and the economic viability of feedstock production and trade. For trans‐boundary governance mechanisms such as the <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RED</jats:styled-content></jats:italic> to be efficient, a proper assessment of the specific forest and land policy contexts of wood pellet exporters that the mechanism will affect, such as Canada, the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USA</jats:styled-content>, and Russia, is crucial. This paper builds on sustainability criteria for biodiversity protection and assurance of sustainable forest management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SFM</jats:styled-content>) for woody biomass that are currently under discussion for inclusion in the <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RED</jats:styled-content></jats:italic> and compares them with national and local regulations of those three countries. This illustrates potential challenges in the establishment of sustainability criteria related to: differences in land definitions, delineation and reporting systems; lack of a uniform definitional paradigm for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SFM</jats:styled-content>; and difficulties in establishing efficient monitoring/auditing systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Supply chains are changing their business paradigm as they strive for sustainability and not just for increasing profits. Sustainability, however, is a concept that is open to interpretation since it is based on societal and organizational values. Little is known about what companies actually mean when referring to sustainability, and how this contrasts with the understanding at different echelons of the supply chain. Diverging interpretations and translations of sustainability among stakeholders, termed wicked problems, affect the progress of sustainable supply chain management. This paper aims to contribute to closing the gap between our common sense expectations and the actual evidence from sustainability reports of how sustainability evolves from abstract ideas to operational practices across the supply chain. To this end, this study employs a computer‐aided content analysis of 142 corporate sustainability reports across 12 industries. Building on the findings, and using the lens of wicked problems, this paper provides guidance to practitioners on how to develop strategies that are effective across the whole supply chain.

Although external pressures, such as demands from Western consumers or international organizations and their related initiatives, may have shaped Eastern Produce Malawi's CSR agenda, strong internal organizational contingencies, including transformational leaders who recognize the significance of ethical issues and strong organizational values, led it to adopt this CSR agenda in practice. This study underscores the significance of using an integrative framework to explain various CSR drivers for companies.

This analysis provides a map of the intellectual structure of content in this field to date. The key trends and changes were identified in strategic SCM research from 1990-2014 as well as the intersection with the key schools of strategic management.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The results suggest that SCM is key to a successful deployment of strategy for competing in the global marketplace. The main theoretical foundations for research in this field were identified and discussed. Gaps were detected and combinations of theoretical foundations of strategic management and SCM suggest four poles for future research: agents and focal firm; distributions and logistics strategic models; SCM competitive requirements; SCM relational governance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Scholars in both the strategy and the SCM fields continue to search for competitive advantages. Much recent research indicates that strategic SCM can be a critical source for that advantage. One of the limitations of the research is that the analysis does not include every journal that published an article mentioning SCM. However, the 34 journals selected are reputed to be the most influential on SCM and focussed primarily on SCM.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The map of the intellectual structure of research to strategic SCM highlights the need to combine different theoretical approaches to the complex phenomenon of SCM. Practitioners should consider the supply chain as an informal organization and should devote time and resources to build a shared advantage across the supply chain. They should also consider the inherent benefits and risks that sharing.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The paper demonstrates that strategic SCM needs a balanced and rigorous combination of theoretical approaches to deliver more theory-driven evidences. The research combines both a qualitative analysis and a quantitative methodology that summarizes gaps and then outlines future research from a large sample of articles. This methodology is an original contribution to this field and offers some assistance for enlarging the sample of future literature reviews.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Our objective was to determine the relationship between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EWL</jats:styled-content> and the development of milk supply concern and anxiety and the effect of such development on breastfeeding duration. We conducted a cohort analysis using data previously obtained from a randomised controlled trial comparing two post‐hospital discharge follow‐up strategies. For 1107 well, singleton infants born at ≥34 weeks, we extracted data on all inpatient infant weights. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EWL</jats:styled-content> was defined as the loss of ≥10% of birthweight. We surveyed mothers to obtain data on state anxiety and milk supply concern at birth and at 2 weeks. Our final outcome was breastfeeding at 6 months. Seventy (6.3%) infants developed <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EWL</jats:styled-content> during the birth hospitalisation. At 2 weeks, milk supply concern and positive anxiety screen were more common (42% and 18%, respectively) among mothers whose infants had had <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EWL</jats:styled-content> than among mothers whose infants had not had <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EWL</jats:styled-content> (20% and 6%, respectively) (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001 for each comparison).

However, it is uncertain if smaller manufacturers in developed countries are more proactive than all manufacturers in developing countries. To understand this situation, we carried out surveys among small and medium‐sized Japanese manufacturers, leading Chinese manufacturers and traditional Chinese manufacturers. Statistical results show that leading Chinese manufacturers have the highest awareness of both domestic and international environmental regulations/policies, and implement all GSCM practices at the highest level. Leading Chinese manufacturers and Japanese manufacturers are aware of international environmental regulations/policies, but such awareness only motivates them to implement eco‐design practices. Traditional Chinese manufacturers have limited awareness of international environmental regulations/policies, but such awareness brings all types of GSCM practice. Such results can be helpful for different manufacturers in both developed and developing countries to develop suitable environmental strategies.

A two‐period pricing model is proposed to investigate the effect of conspicuous consumption on pricing decisions with markdown pricing policy for a supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and retailer. The optimal pricing strategies for the integrated supply chain and decentralized supply chain are derived respectively. Our results show that an anticipated conspicuous consumption can benefit the supply chain even though the conspicuous consumption aggravates the double marginalization effect. The conspicuous consumption can serve as a level to segment the market and can promote the supply chain revenue. In addition, our results indicate that the supply chain can benefit from rationing. We also introduce a revenue‐sharing contract and prove that it can be applied to coordinate the supply chain with conspicuous consumption. An interval of the revenue‐sharing rate for coordinating with the supply chain can be coordinated without any additional transfer payment being provided.</jats:p>",

This enabled us to estimate vertical nutrient fluxes and the impact of different types of turbulent mixing on biological activity. There have been no such fixed‐point observations in this region, where incoming low‐salinity water from the Pacific Ocean, river water, and sea‐ice meltwater promote a strong pycnocline (halocline) that stabilizes the water column. Previous studies have suggested that because of the strong pycnocline, wind‐induced ocean mixing could not change the stratification to impact biological activity. However, the present study indicates that a combined effect of an uplifted pycnocline accompanied by wind‐induced inertial motion and turbulent mixing caused by intense gale‐force winds (&gt;10 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) did result in increases in upward nutrient fluxes, primary productivity, and phytoplankton biomass, particularly large phytoplankton such as diatoms. Convective mixing associated with internal waves around the pycnocline also increased the upward nutrient fluxes and might have an impact on biological activity there. For diatom production at the fixed‐point observation station, it was essential that silicate was supplied from a subsurface silicate maximum, a new feature that we identified during autumn in the northern Chukchi Sea. Water mass distributions obtained from wide‐area observations suggest that the subsurface silicate maximum water was possibly derived from the ventilated halocline in the Canada Basin.</jats:p>",

B-13/H cells express a variety of liver-enriched and liver-specific genes, many at levels similar to hepatocytes in vivo. Furthermore, the B-13/H phenotype is maintained for at least several weeks in vitro, in contrast to normal hepatocytes which rapidly de-differentiate under the same simple – or even under more complex – culture conditions. The origin of the B-13 cell line and the current state of knowledge regarding differentiation to B-13/H cells are presented, followed by a review of recent advances in the use of B-13/H cells in a variety of toxicity endpoints. B-13 cells therefore offer Toxicologists a cost-effective and easy to use system to study a range of toxicologically-related questions. Dissecting the mechanism(s) regulating the formation of B-13/H cell may also increase the likelihood of engineering a human equivalent, providing Toxicologists with an expandable donor-free supply of functional rat and human hepatocytes, invaluable additions to the tool kit of in vitro toxicity tests.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>La falta de continuidad del servicio es una problemática común en los sistemas de agua potable en México, donde la mayor parte de las redes opera mediante tandeos o tandeadas, como se le conoce coloquialmente en México. Esta deficiencia es influenciada por diversos factores, tanto directa como indirectamente: crecimiento descontrolado de los asentamientos humanos, mantenimiento inadecuado, falta de monitoreo de las redes, interrupción de la energía eléctrica. Los horarios de servicio están también estrechamente vinculados con políticas de operación internas de los organismos de agua y saneamiento, y con los costos de energía eléctrica a lo largo del día. Con la finalidad de entender ese fenómeno se analizó la operación del sector de abastecimiento de agua potable “Bachilleres” de la ciudad de Chetumal, Quintana Roo, el cual presenta servicio intermitente en dos zonas, una con dos periodos al día y otra con cuatro. Para ello se llevó a cabo el examen físico de la infraestructura, se evaluaron los tiempos de operación, se obtuvieron las curvas de variación horaria del sector, se estimaron los volúmenes disponibles y utilizados, y se realizó el análisis del costo de bombeo. Los resultados indican que la forma de operar los tanques ocasiona que éstos sólo se aprovechan parcialmente, ya que el diseño interno y/o los accesorios de los equipos de bombeo incumplen las recomendaciones para ese tipo de instalaciones, lo que provoca que aun cuando el nivel del tirante de agua del tanque sea superior al 40%, los equipos se detengan, y con ello el suministro de agua. El realizar adecuaciones para corregir esta problemática y aprovechar el máximo volumen disponible incrementaría el tiempo de suministro continuo de agua al sector en un 73%, lo cual permitiría postergar inversiones en nueva infraestructura y reducir la explotación de los recursos hídricos y energéticos.</jats:p>"
