      "abstract": "<jats:p>A coronary artery and the accompanying vein were ligated temporarily for 30, 60 and 120 minutes in 39 cats. By labelling the blood with the fluorescent dye acridine orange, the intravital blood supply of the myocardium was investigated 5 minutes to 6 hours after release of the ligature. The region supplied by the temporarily ligated coronary artery (RSCA) was demonstrated by postmortal perfusion of this vessel using the dye light green. Resumption of circulation in the deeper layers of the RSCA was delayed after a prior coronary occlusion, even occasionally after occlusions lasting only 30 minutes. After a coronary ligation of 60 to 120 minutes the inner layers of the RSCA became the sites of prolonged disturbance of blood supply. The circulatory abnormality observed immediately following release of the ligature did not result from intraluminal vascular obstruction. Even after a temporary ischemia lasting 120 minutes it was still possible, immediately after removal of the ligature, to perfuse an intravitally ischemic portion of the RSCA. The significance of these results for the determination of the so-called \"revival-time\" of the cardiac muscle is pointed out.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>This is an aggregative study covering the years 1946 to 1962, with the primary objective</jats:italic> of<jats:italic>examining the most significant factors which affect a market structure for farm labor. A recursive system is used to derive an equilibrium level of both hired and family farm labor during the period studied as well as an equilibrium level of future farm labor requirement by 1970</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>The findings show that the demand for farm labor was apparently not, or weakly, responsive to the farm wage rate in all regions and it was weakly responsive to the parity ratio, farm machinery and productivity. On the supply side, farm labor also was not, or weakly, responsive to the variables included in all regions with the exception of the farm wage rate or parity ratio in B.C. and the adjusted non‐farm wage rate and farm machinery in the Atlantic region. The results also show that, in Canada as a whole, the projected family labor employment will be 294,000 manequivalents by 1910 or 42 percent decline as compared to the 1962 level, while the projected hired labor employment will be 114,000 manequivalents in 1970 or 14 percent increase in the eight years after 1962. This would likely be the tendency because of the continuous economic development on the one hand and the consolidation of farms on the other</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",
