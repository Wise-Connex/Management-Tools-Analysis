As such the purchasing function becomes central in a company's sustainability effort. In doing so, we reflect on the relationship between purchasing management and sustainable development by drawing from Kraljic's seminal article on how “Purchasing Must Become Supply Management.”</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper compares and contrasts two different forms of interorganizational relationships that deal with the production and movement of waste: industrial symbiosis and supply chains. Industrial symbiosis reuses, recycles and reprocesses byproducts and intermediates within the system of organizations, whereas conventional supply chains reduce waste within manufacturing processes and reuse end‐of‐life products. Although both these models address waste, there is surprisingly little consideration of industrial symbiosis within supply chain research. Yet, industrial symbiosis has much to offer the study of sustainable development within supply chains. Industrial symbiosis emphasizes community, cooperation and coordination among firms, which serves to protect the environmental integrity, social equity and economic prosperity of the region — all hallmarks of sustainable development. However, such tight integration among a diverse set of organizations is difficult to jump start and difficult to maintain. In this paper, we also outline the challenges and offer some ideas on how to address these challenges. We ground our insights from interviews with firms in the Sarnia‐Lambton region of Ontario, Canada. This region is home to over 130,000 people, and has a strong physical infrastructure and social structures that have facilitated symbiotic relationships among local businesses.</jats:p>",

We show through an analysis of the food industry that sustainability requires an expanded view to encompass both environmental and social elements. We interviewed and surveyed food and beverage producers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to both validate expanded sustainability elements in the industry and assess subsequent performance outcomes. A path analysis reveals that food industry managers perceive both direct and mediated impacts of sustainability programs on performance. Specifically, the results indicate that sustainability program effects are limited to the impact of conservation and land management environmental practices on overall environmental performance and human resources practices on quality performance. However, environmental performance improvements lead to improved quality performance, which in turn improves cost performance. The results highlight the complexity of sustainability impacts on performance and suggest that performance benefits from sustainability programs may be difficult to recognize.</jats:p>",

The results of our empirical analysis lend support to RBV theory in that we find that the use of BSIT is perceived to be positively associated with performance benefits. We also find that supply chain intermediaries — distributors and retailers — perceive greater performance improvements from BSIT than do manufacturers. The findings are significant in that investments in BSIT can produce important benefits for firm operations, and may forestall potential disintermediation from supply chains. Finally, we find that despite the greater perception of benefits from BSIT by intermediaries, they do not actually invest in BSIT to any greater extent than do manufacturers. This result may suggest that intermediaries are under‐investing in BSIT.</jats:p>",

To optimize their use, sourcing professionals will need to match firm requirements to market characteristics and supplier capabilities through the application of optimal sourcing strategies. To date, explanations of why sourcing managers decide to utilize an e‐RA strategy are incomplete. This study relies upon strategic sourcing concepts coupled with extant research on e‐RA use to develop a conceptual model of antecedents to the perceived <jats:italic>appropriateness</jats:italic> of e‐RA usage. The model is tested and supported via structural equation modeling. Findings demonstrate that a sourcing professional's perception as to the appropriateness of using an e‐RA for sourcing a particular requirement is influenced by (1) the specifiability of the requirement (2) supplier competition, (3) leadership influence, and (4) a price‐based selection criterion. Further, a requirement with higher specifiability was found to increase competition in an e‐RA bidding event. Contributions to theory, practice, and future research directions are identified.</jats:p>",

Although the legal obligations for social and environmental issues are increasingly devolved to suppliers, the role of lead firms in the development of ethical supply chain management (ESCM) has been the subject of considerable debate. This article focuses on two questions which are central to the development of ESCM. First, it looks at stakeholder pressure for ESCM and its implications for the involvement of lead firms in ESCM. Second, it considers the conditions under which lead firms will be able to influence suppliers and implement ESCM. It then reviews the impact of ESCM on social and environmental performance. Finally, it outlines the implications for the development of effective ESCM.</jats:p>"

Marine crew transportation has until recently being regarded as slow and more hazardous. Three specific technological advancements, high speed hull design, DP2 automatic vessel station keeping and advances in transfer capsule design, now offers high speed marine crew supply, with levels of passenger safety and comfort that exceed helicopter transfers. Utilizing the ‘state of the art’ CrewZer Class vessel, this new crew supply solution is leading many operators to re-evaluate their crew supply options.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A good crew supply solution should provide high levels of safety, speed and reliability, as well as operational flexibility. As offshore development cost rise and other assets mature, there is increased pressure to reduce operating costs, whilst attending to crew welfare and morale. The CrewZer access solution can deliver up to 30% savings on logistical costs, whilst enhancing safety or passenger welfare.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first CrewZer Class vessel, the Seacor Cheetah (the fastest offshore support vessel ever built) was introduced to the market in February 2008. Voted ‘American Ship of the Year’, it has an aluminum catamaran hull, capacity for 149 passengers and a cruising speed in excess of 40 knots. It's DP2 station-keeping and wide stable hull provide an ideal platform for personnel transfer operations. The vessel also utilizes a custom designed 9-passenger advanced transfer capsule. The entire system is expected to provide one of the safest crew transfer solutions in the industry. This integrated solution provides the following additional benefits:- An ideal emergency evacuation tool (e.g. hurricanes), capable of the rapid evacuation of large crews. This allows operators to delay evacuation decisions, possibly avoiding unnecessary shut downs, without compromise to safety.A high speed vessel suitable for early response to offshore fire, equipped with two large fire monitors.150 ton of deck load optimized for fast track logistic support.Enhanced vessel stability which increases the operational weather window for transit and loading operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After over a year in operation and tens of thousands of successful transfers, the system has been thoroughly field proven.

Heterogeneity in supply conditions across markets is shown to be essential to understanding the growing price dispersion across metropolitan areas, as well as to understanding whether positive growth shocks to a metropolitan area manifest themselves more in terms of expanding population and homebuilding or in terms of higher wages and house prices. The nature of supply obviously also influences local housing-market dynamics. Recent research has shown that differences in the elasticity of housing supply can account for the wide variation in new construction volatility (but not price volatility) across markets over time. The extraordinary nature of the recent boom only increases the need to understand how housing-market fundamentals and supply and demand affect the functioning of this huge asset market.</jats:p>",

Since the late 1990s, globalization has forced many organizations in the engineering sector to enter the Indian market. Their low‐cost high‐quality products challenged Indian SMEs. The need to become competitive is now a matter‐of‐fact for all SMEs in India. This paper provides contemporary researchers in the areas of SMEs and SCM with knowledge that will help them (i) comprehend key research issues related to SCM for SMEs and (ii) define constructs, research variables and the nature of their research (that is, either exploratory or explanatory) with logical coherence.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Initially, the paper proposes a new framework (I<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>NOC) for understanding the competitive advantage of SMEs. Subsequently, the paper introduces the central themes of SMEs and SCM, supported by various arguments and positions from the literature. The paper offers guidance to management researchers in developing, defining and presenting their research (especially in the case of business or management students undertaking doctoral research) in a systematic and convincing manner.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Obviously such situation is rather unrealistic, however our main goal is a quantitative characterization of the intermittency of wind electricity. The consumption pattern consists of marked daily and weekly cycles interrupted by periods of holidays. In contrast, wind electricity production has neither short-time nor seasonal periodicities. We show that wind power integration over a restricted area cannot provide a stable baseload supply, independently of the excess capacity. Further essential result is that the statistics are almost identical for a weekly periodic pattern of consumption and a constant load of the same average value. The length of both adequate supply and shortfall intervals exhibits a scale-free (power-law) frequency distribution, possible consequences are shortly discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SYNOPSIS: Strategic cost management is the deliberate alignment of a firm’s resources and associated cost structure with long-term strategy and short-term tactics. Although managers continue to pursue efficiency and effectiveness within the firm, increasingly, improvements are obtained across the value chain, through reconfiguring firm boundaries, relocating resources, reengineering processes, and reevaluating product and service offerings in relation to customer requirements. The first paper in this two-part series reviewed structural cost management in supply chains (Anderson and Dekker 2009). Structural cost management employs tools of organizational design, product design, and process design to create a supply chain cost structure that is coherent with firm strategy. In this second paper of the series we consider executional cost management in supply chains. Executional cost management employs measurement and analysis tools (e.g., cost driver analysis, supplier scorecards) to evaluate supply chain performance and sustainability. Using selected studies in accounting, operations management, and business strategy, we provide an overview of strategic cost management in supply chains, highlight contemporary developments, and suggest directions for future research.</jats:p>",

Still, the biggest construction projects in the world take place in Iraq with the creation of the most ambitious architectural centers. Great water production plants and distribution networks are constructed and management of available water resources is an important issue. This paper includes the identification of the hazards and introduction of control points that serve to minimize these potential hazards that providing more effect control for drinking water quality. We can conclude that end-product testing is a reactive rather than preventive way to demonstrate confidence in good and safe drinking water. This justifies the need for the formulation of a new approach in drinking water Quality Control QC based on understanding of system defense reduces for contamination and on preventive means and actions necessary to guarantee the safety of the water supplied to the consumer. Water safety plan WSP is a concept for risk assessment and risk management throughout the water cycle from the catchments to the point of consumption. This work outline and presents an overview of the first year occurrences in the developing and implementing a WSP in the multi- municipal water supply system for a city area of Baghdad. Since key personnel had contributed to the assessment of hazards and evaluation of corrective actions for control points, a greater understanding of water QC and improvements on technical operation and performance have been register, demonstrating good value for the methodology</jats:p>"

The least influential pressures are related to societal drivers and SC pressures from individual customers. Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices amongst this “average” group of UK manufacturing organisations are focusing on internal, higher risk, descriptive activities, rather than proactive, external engagement processes. Environmental attitude (EA) is a key predictor of GSCM activity and those organisations that have a progressive attitude are also operationally very active. EA shows some relationship to legislative drivers but other factors are also influential. Operational activity may also be moderated by organisational contingencies such as risk, size, and nationality.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The main limitation to this paper is the relatively small manufacturing sample.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents a series of constructs that identify GSCM operational activities companies to benchmark themselves against.

It distinguishes between IORs, chains, and networks and subsets of those, perceived through different disciplinary lenses. Different lenses lead researchers to operate at different units of analysis within relationships, chains, and networks. For example, a sociological focus gives rise to researchers observing social connections. An economic focus leads to observations of economic exchanges between organizations conceptualized as economic entities. A strategic management focus leads the researcher to observe strategic configurations and positions. These different units of analysis represent different types of relationship, chain, and network and require different methodologies, methods, and techniques to research them. In particular, this article uses an operations and supply lens to observe supply relationships, chains, and networks.</jats:p>"

Findings were analyzed and compared across all the cases studied to determine the common external and internal drivers for reverse logistics implementation as well as the obstacles faced by the whole electronic industry.

The major difficulty in implementing reverse logistics in the electronic industry of China is the lack of enforceable laws, regulations or directives to motivate manufacturers. Furthermore, economic support and preferential tax policies are absent to help manufacturers offset the high investment costs of reverse logistics. Low public awareness of environmental protection and underdevelopment of recycling technologies are also some of the obstacles to widespread reverse logistics implementation. The findings also reveal the presence of linkages between the various external factors that are not fully explored in current reverse logistics models.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study corroborates the application of transaction cost economics and resource‐based view theory to account for the different approaches to reverse logistics adopted by firms in developing countries. It also reveals a need for further research on the linkages between external factors affecting reverse logistics implementation. The four case studies of large corporations are drawn from a Chinese setting in which implementation of reverse logistics is still in an early stage. The complex nature of China's transitional economy and political considerations may influence the perspectives and practices of small manufacturers in the management of environmental issues thus limiting the generalizability of the findings.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study reveals the problems encountered in the implementation of reverse logistics in China and proposes measures to expedite the development.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents a systematic analysis of the external and the internal factors affecting reverse logistics implementation in developing countries like China.

The study also identifies the major drivers and obstacles faced by the industry, a clear understanding of which might facilitate the formulation of appropriate nation‐wide reverse logistics policy and strategy through the support of the government and the investment of the manufacturers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Child care plays a central role in allowing the primary carer time away from the young children in a household. Therefore, child‐care use is a central topic of this article, as well. There are a number of different aspects to child care, such as the price, quality, availability and type of service. This article discusses the analytical problems and challenges, taking Australian data, policy and experience as a focus, but drawing on a wide range of international empirical studies. It reports the results from previous research on child‐care use and labour supply and it outlines the areas requiring more study. The focus of the article is on economic research.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

By using the guaranteed service approach to model the multi‐echelon stochastic inventory system, we develop an optimization model to simultaneously determine the transportation, inventory, and network structure of a multi‐echelon supply chain. The model is an MINLP with a nonconvex objective function including bilinear, trilinear, and square root terms. By exploiting the properties of the basic model, we reformulate this problem as a separable concave minimization program. A spatial decomposition algorithm based on the integration of Lagrangean relaxation and piecewise linear approximation is proposed to obtain near global optimal solutions with reasonable computational expense. Examples for specialty chemicals and industrial gas supply chains with up to 15 plants, 100 potential distribution centers, and 200 markets are presented. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2010</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, privatisation of water supply continues to be a subject of intense debate, particularly as to its effects on the urban poor. The arguments for and against often reflect the intellectual divide between socialist ideals and neo-liberal pragmatism. Key issues are access, quality and price. This paper reports findings from an investigation of Thailand’s first water supply privatisation scheme implemented in 1998. Household-level data for the poor, defined by community and income status, show a significant improvement in access to piped water despite an increase in the connection cost and monthly charges. The associated benefits from access include improved water quality and service. A promising plus is the prospect of improvement in tenure status for the households living in informal settlements. </jats:p>",

In these flume experiments, the volume of mobile sediment on top of an immobile coarse sediment layer was increased stepwise and the bedform characteristics were observed. A strong relationship was found between the volume that is mobile – and therefore available for bedform formation – and the dune dimensions and regularity. If the sediment supply is limited, dunes are smaller and more regular. Series of experiments with a decreasing supply limitation were conducted for different flow velocities and water depths. The relationship between the dune dimensions and the available volume is different for each series. The observed relationships between dune dimensions and layer thickness collapse to one relationship for height and one for length if scaling parameters are introduced. Current models for bedform dimensions under alluvial conditions can be extended to partial transport conditions using this relationship.</jats:p>",

The authors document the accrual anomaly, introduced by Sloan (1996) for the complete U.S. market, in the food supply chain. A mimicked risk‐free trading strategy shorting high accrual agribusinesses and longing low accrual agribusinesses yield statistically significant annual abnormal returns of 5.9% during 1970–2004. Results for the food supply chain are different from results by Sloan and others. In particular, results for high accrual agribusiness are similar to results by Sloan for the complete U.S. market, but low accrual agribusinesses perform differently. The authors believe that this contrasting result is not industry specific, but rather a result supporting the idea that the fixation hypothesis by Sloan fails to explain the accrual anomaly problem. This is important because the fixation hypothesis is prevalent in the literature; a well‐articulated hypothesis on the accrual anomaly has not yet been offered. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

In order to optimize protein synthesis reactions in a continuous‐flow wheat embryo cell‐free system, we have examined the influence of adding GTP and found that the system does not require any supply of GTP. We report here the preparation of a wheat embryo extract from which endogenous GTP was removed by gel filtration, and the influence of adding GTP to the system on protein synthesis reactions. Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a reporter, higher levels of production were observed at lower concentrations of GTP, with the optimal level of production obtained with no supply of GTP. A HPLC‐based analysis of the extract and the translation mixture containing only ATP as an energy source revealed that GTP was not detectable in the extract, however, 35 μM of GTP was found in the translation mixture. This result suggests that GTP could be generated from other compounds, such as GDP and GMP, using ATP. A similar experiment with a C‐terminally truncated form of human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B<jats:sub>1‐320</jats:sub>) gave almost the same result. The wheat embryo cell‐free translation system worked most efficiently without exogenous GTP, producing 3.5 mg/mL of translation mixture over a 48‐h period at 26°C. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

While the purported goal of outsourcing in supply chains is to derive a competitive advantage, it is not clear whether the outsourcing decisions of firms are always strategically aligned with their overall competitive strategy. In this paper we evaluate the degree of congruence (fit or alignment) between a firm's outsourcing drivers and its competitive priorities and assess the impact of congruence on both supply chain performance and business performance, using empirical data collected from manufacturing business units operating in the United States. We find outsourcing congruence across all five competitive priorities to be positively and significantly related to supply chain performance. We also find the level of supply chain performance in a firm to be positively and significantly associated with the firm's business performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

A comprehensive analysis of more than 550 suppliers, supported by company interviews, shows that foreign‐owned producers become embedded in Poland in the automotive supplier networks they have largely created themselves. Numerous local suppliers gain access to export markets and become integrated in a Europe‐wide production system. This trend has been accompanied by significant upgrading of foreign affiliates and domestic firms in terms of product quality, cost efficiency, adaptability, and fast response, but far less in nonproduction competences such as R&amp;D. It is argued that the competences of automotive suppliers in Poland are built upon the localized capabilities, which are a product of the dynamic interplay between the activity of foreign firms and the changing local environment comprising various stakeholders. The localized capabilities constitute elements of a company's sunk costs and are embedding automotive producers in Poland. At the same time, the dependence on decisions and innovations from abroad and the limited development of local design and brands may constrain the future role of suppliers from the semiperipheral economy of Poland.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon four theories—Strategy‐Structure‐Performance framework, the resource based view of the firm, transaction cost economics, and social network analysis—and combining industry inputs, a theoretical framework of supply chain process integration is developed. It is argued that a firm's strategic priorities are key factors of supply chain process integration.

The service, which is presently controlled by Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), has been managed through different institutional arrangements involving different municipal organisations. These changes were introduced with the objective of improving the operational status, performance level and financial strength of the utility. Research was carried out to obtain feedback from related stakeholders including utility management, interest groups, relevant experts and civil society organisations. The methodology adopted for this research work comprised a review of institutional records, interviews with key informants and observations of service delivery mechanisms in various parts of the city. An absence of political will across various levels of policy making and implementation, legal anomalies, incomplete integration of KWSB into the main stream city government, ineffective revenue recovery from consumers and rising trends of unaccounted water remain the outcomes of inadequate institutional performance. This paper presents the existing status of water supply arrangements in Karachi with focus on institutional issues. Possible policy options, including ‘no change’, disaggregation, dissolution and consolidation of the utility, are also discussed. </jats:p>",

However, the majority of supply chain member firms are not leaders, and the contribution of these supply chain followers has not been described. Arguably the contribution of follower organizations is greater than that of a single supply chain leader since they are found in greater numbers in most supply chains. This paper identifies a conceptual framework of supply chain followership, classified on the basis of the behaviors exhibited by follower organizations. Data was collected via an interactive simulation, using executives as participants. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the proposed model. Results indicate that follower organizations make a greater contribution to overall supply chain performance than leaders when transformational behaviors are present.</jats:p>",

Given a set of available technologies to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen, the problem consists of determining the optimal design of the production‐distribution network capable of satisfying a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a bi‐criterion mixed‐integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which simultaneously accounts for the minimization of cost and environmental impact. The environmental impact is measured through the contribution to climate change made by the hydrogen network operation. The emissions considered in the analysis are those associated with the entire life cycle of the process, and are quantified according to the principles of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). To expedite the search of the Pareto solutions of the problem, we introduce a bi‐level algorithm that exploits its specific structure. A case study that addresses the optimal design of the hydrogen infrastructure needed to fulfill the expected hydrogen demand in Great Britain is introduced to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2010</jats:p>",

Using a global bathymetry dataset in open shelf areas in front of rivers that discharge over 25 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> tons of sediment per year, five distinct accretionary types of shelf‐break are distinguished based on along‐shelf gradient variability and inferred shelf‐break trajectory. Morphological characteristics of river‐mouth shelves (compared with adjacent areas lateral to the immediate fairway of the river) are: (1) an overall lower gradient and greater width, and (2) a relatively high slope gradient/shelf gradient ratio. The exceptions are shelves with active shelf‐edge deltas; these are narrower, steeper and have an attenuated shelf break in front of rivers. These observations are at seismic scale and have direct implications for the recognition and positioning of principal cross‐shelf, supply fairways on ancient shelves or shelf margins, and therefore the potential by‐pass routes for deepwater sands. Higher slope/shelf gradient ratios in areas of actively accreting margins, where the shelf‐break is more prominent and easier to recognize on seismic data compared with adjacent areas, predict areas with high sediment supply. Along‐strike morphological changes on supply‐dominated shelves suggest that identification of the sediment‐feed route and depocenter relative to the shelf break during a relative sea level cycle are critical for understanding/predicting the 3‐D architecture of the shelf‐slope‐basin floor clinoform.</jats:p>",

Significant variations in parental magma compositions and extent of low‐pressure fractionation over short along‐axis distances suggest small, discontinuous, or poorly mixed magma chambers. Mineralogical, petrological, and geochemical data indicate this OSC is characterized by low overall melt supply. Regional along‐axis geochemical gradients along the western GSC (e.g., in <jats:sup>206</jats:sup>Pb/<jats:sup>204</jats:sup>Pb, Nb/Zr, and La<jats:sub>(8)</jats:sub>/Sm<jats:sub>(8)</jats:sub>) are interrupted by increased variability within the OSC, consistent with less efficient mixing of melts in this region. Despite a long‐term history of westward propagation, bathymetric and geochemical data are inconsistent with recent propagation of this offset; the eastern limb appears to have recently retreated and left behind a series of abandoned ridges within the overlap zone. The eastern limb shows two progressive westward trends of decreasing ratios of highly to moderately incompatible elements, one outside and one within the overlap zone. The overlapping portion of the western limb also has low ratios of these elements. These patterns are consistent with previously depleted mantle being preferentially melted beneath this offset.</jats:p>",

The subsequent business standards set by retailers and other market role‐players and the responses of producers are reported and the responsibility for achieving desired outputs is discussed. The research methodology included open interviews with various stakeholders in the chain, as well as structured questionnaires to determine practices on farms. From the findings it is clear that perceptions of European stakeholders differ substantially from the reality found in South Africa. This has consequences for producers, from both a social and a financial perspective. Understanding the role and function of NGOs, market role‐players and national government in the governance of sustainable development in the South African–European table grape supply chain contributes to identifying barriers and opportunities to achieving sustainable practices in global supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Global trade is strongly growing and becoming connected to the issue of sustainable development in business practices. In recent years this has resulted in businesses on the demand side formulating sets of requirements for suppliers on their performance on corporate social responsibility and sustainable production. In doing this, value systems of the industrialized world are forwarded towards developing countries. It is seen as a way to complement poor sustainability policies on practices in these countries. This relatively new phenomenon of promoting sustainable development through market interactions is quite remarkable. Why would economic actors take up such public interests (abating environmental degradation and social injustice)? From the perspective of developing countries on the supply side of global value chains, being able to commit to such business‐to‐business standards requires developing world producers to possess certain qualities and capacities. This article reflects on this issue, identifying essential capacities, drawn from literature on (sustainable) entrepreneurship. It develops a model explaining business performance with characteristics of entrepreneurship. The model is tested in practice using data on exporters of table grapes in South Africa.

Traditional water quality measurements cannot conclusively differentiate fecal sources, thus microbial source tracking (MST) is necessary to identify contributions from different sources. In this study, a toolbox approach that includes both traditional indicators and multiple MST targets was used to demonstrate what measures are needed in a toolbox and how to best use these measures to obtain useful data. The authors found that several physical and chemical water quality measures were redundant and could be eliminated from a sampling plan. Their toolbox approach integrates monitoring techniques that can be tailored to meet the needs of individual watershed management agencies, even those with limited resources. The MST targets in the toolbox can incorporate with bacteriological facilities already available to most watershed management agencies.</jats:p>",

In contextualizing corporate social responsibility (CSR), more and better collaborations on environmental management between Hong‐Kong‐based companies and their supply chains within Hong Kong and the PRDR are needed. Using a qualitative approach, this research identifies and examines nine concerned business supply chain partnership cases. Stakeholders perceived that partnership is a good tool for improving corporate environmental management. However, although it has become more active since 2002, partnership is not yet popular. More time and support are needed to develop it. Businesses should take further steps to benefit themselves and the environment. Based on the first‐hand experiences and opinions of interviewees, this paper analyzes and presents recent partnership activities; their drivers and barriers; factors in their successes; and the possible roles of government and business associations in fostering partnership development.

Although free riding is, in general, considered to have a negative impact on supply chain performance, certain recent industry practices suggest an opposite view: a manufacturer may purposely induce free riding by setting up a high‐cost, customer service‐oriented direct store to allow consumers to experience the product, anticipating their purchase at a retail store. This article examines how the free riding phenomenon affects a manufacturer's supply chain structure decision when there are fixed plus incremental variable costs for operating the direct store. We consider factors such as the effort required to find and buy the product at a retail store after visiting the direct store, the existence of competing products in the market, and the extent of consumer need to obtain direct‐store service. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Astrocytes can also supply glucose to neurons as well as glucose can be taken up by neurons from extracellular fluid. Astrocytic networks can provide neuronal fuel and quickly remove lactate from activated glycolytic domains, and the lactate can be dispersed widely throughout the syncytium to endfeet along the vasculature for release to blood or other brain regions via perivascular fluid flow.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon the burgeoning critical geographical literature on the commodification and privatization of water, we formulate a conceptual framework for analyzing the ethnographic data on perceptions and experience of privatization by Belize City water users. The experience of water supply privatization was largely negative. Residents complained bitterly about an increase in water tariffs and excessive disconnection rates by the privatized Belize Water Supply Limited (BWSL). Many policy makers also accused BWSL of front‐loading profits and not making strategic investments in infrastructure. But the symbolic significance of water privatization for the residents of a small Caribbean country like Belize exceeded its practical implications. We argue that the major themes to emerge from the ethnographic data collected for the study can be synthesized into three ‘popular privatization narratives’ (PPNs). The first was based on the perception that poor governance led to privatization; the second on a preference for national‐ over global‐scale politics, so that objections to privatization were based on nationalism; the third on angst about losing control to the systemic compulsions of neoliberal globalization. Overall the privatization process not only had important (largely negative) material consequences for Belizeans but, given their historical and cultural geography, profound discursive and symbolic consequences for their sense of identity in a condition of neoliberal globalization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:italic>Cet article présente les résultats d'une vaste enquête sur les impressions, de la population et des acteurs des politiques publiques, concernant l'échec de la privatisation du réseau d'approvisionnement en eau et d'assainissement de Belize City. Utilisant les publications géographiques critiques qui se multiplient sur la marchandisation et la privatisation de l'eau, un cadre conceptuel est formulé pour analyser les données ethnographiques sur les impressions et l'expérience de la privatisation émanant des usagers de l'eau de Belize City. L'expérience de cette privatisation a été en grande partie négative. Les habitants se plaignent amèrement de l'augmentation des tarifs et de taux de coupures excessifs par la société privée Belize Water Supply Limited (BWSL). De nombreux décideurs politiques ont également accusé BWSL de prélever les bénéfices sans effectuer d'investissements stratégiques d'infrastructure. Toutefois, la place symbolique de la privatisation de l'eau pour les habitants d'un petit pays de la mer des Antilles comme Belize dépasse les incidences pratiques. Les principaux thèmes dessinés par les données ethnographiques collectées peuvent se résumer en trois ‘récits populaires de la privatization’. Le premier repose sur l'impression que la faiblesse de la gouvernance a conduit à la privatisation; le deuxième sur une préférence pour une politique à l'échelon national plutôt que mondial, de sorte que les objections à la privatisation étaient liées au nationalisme; le troisième sur l'angoisse de perdre la maîtrise des pressions systémiques exercées par la mondialisation néolibérale. En général, le processus de privatisation a eu des conséquences matérielles importantes (en grande partie négatives) pour les Béliziens mais aussi, étant donnée la géographie historique et culturelle nationale, de profondes implications discursives et symboliques sur leur sens de l'identité dans un contexte de mondialisation néolibérale.</jats:italic> </jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sugar beet (<jats:italic>Beta vulgaris</jats:italic> ssp<jats:italic>. altissima</jats:italic> Döll) was grown in the field under free‐air CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment (FACE, 550 ppm) and different nitrogen (N) supply (2001: 126 (N100) and 63 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (N50); 2004: 156 (N100) and 75 kg·ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) during two crop rotations. Canopy CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exchange rates (CCER) were measured during the main growth phase (leaf area index ≥2) using a dynamic chamber system. Canopy CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exchange data were analysed with respect to treatment effects on seasonal means and light use efficiency and light response characteristics. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment enhanced CCER throughout the season. However, in both years, CCER declined after the second half of August independent of radiation and [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]. Elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] strongly stimulated CCER on a seasonal basis, whereas the reduction of CCER caused by low N was below 10% and not significant. There were no effects of N on daily radiation use efficiency of carbon gain calculated from CCER data, but a strong enhancement by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment. CCER closely tracked diurnal variations in incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, μmol·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>·s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). The relationship between CCER and incident PPFD was curvilinear. In both seasons, initial slopes and maximum rates (CCER<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) were determined from two 6‐day periods using these relationships. The first period was measured after canopy closure (first half of July) and the second in the second half of August. In the first period, elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] increased the initial slopes. Low N supply affected neither the initial slopes nor their response to elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] in either period. In contrast to initial slopes, N stress limited the [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] response of CCER<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> in the first period. In the second period, however, this interaction of [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and N on CCER<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> was completely dominated by a general decline of CCER<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> whereas no general decline of the initial slopes occurred in the second period. This response of light response parameters to [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and N suggests that, in sugar beet, the decline of CCER in the late season may rely on limiting mechanisms such as photosynthetic acclimation responses to elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] caused by sink limitations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although most attention has been focused on mitochondrial ATP production and transfer in failing hearts, less has been focused on the nonfailing hypertensive heart. Here, energetic complications are less obvious, yet they may provide insight into disease ontogeny. We studied hearts from 12-mo-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) relative to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The ex vivo working-heart model of SHR showed reduced compliance and impaired responses to increasing preloads. High-resolution respirometry showed higher state 3 (with excess ADP) respiration in SHR left ventricle fibers with complex I substrates and maximal uncoupled respiration with complex I + complex II substrates. Respiration with ATP was depressed 15% in SHR fibers relative to WKY fibers, suggesting impaired ATP hydrolysis. This finding was consistent with a 50% depression of actomyosin ATPase activities. Superoxide production from SHR fibers was similar to that from WKY fibers respiring with ADP; however, it was increased by 15% with ATP. In addition, the apparent K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> for ADP was 54% higher for SHR fibers, and assays conducted after ex vivo work showed a 28% depression of complex I in SHR, but not WKY, fibers. Transmission electron microscopy showed similar mitochondrial volumes but a decrease in the number of cristae in SHR mitochondria. Tissue lipid peroxidation was also 15% greater in SHR left ventricle. Overall, these data suggest that although cardiac mitochondria from nonfailing SHR hearts function marginally better than those from WKY hearts, they show dysfunction after intense work. Impaired ATP turnover in hard-working SHR hearts may starve cardiac mitochondria of ADP and elevate superoxide. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>En este trabajo se presentan los resultados del análisis sistémico del sistema de abastecimiento de agua potable en el Municipio de Ecatepec, el cual forma parte de la Zona Metropolitana de la Ciudad de México, perteneciente al espacio natural denominado como la Cuenca de México. El municipio se caracteriza por una problemática compleja, debido al desarrollo urbano acelerado y al mismo tiempo poco planeado que se ha dado en los últimos 30 años. En el municipio se presenta una creciente tendencia en la construcción de unidades habitacionales que ha provocado múltiples problemas de carácter socio-económico y ambiental; entre los cuales destaca el rezago en el suministro del agua potable. En este trabajo se propone analizar la situación del suministro del agua potable en el municipio bajo la aplicación del marco teórico conceptual de sistemas complejos y de la Gestión Integral del Agua Urbana con la utilización de diferentes fuentes de información, como informes técnicos, bases de datos, mapas oficiales, artículos y libros. Para la realización del trabajo se aplicó el esquema del análisis sistémico el cual abarca una visión más integradora de diferentes factores (tanto físicos, como socio-económicos) que influyen en el proceso de la gestión de agua potable a nivel local, de un municipio. Para tal fin se definieron tres elementos como determinantes para el análisis del funcionamiento del sistema de abastecimiento: a) El entorno geográfico en el que se suscribe el municipio, a nivel regional y local; b) La dinámica demográfica a escala espacial y temporal; y c) La gestión del recurso hídrico a nivel local.  Estos tres elementos se analizaron por medio de la combinación de las siguientes etapas a) Fase documental b) Fase de campo c) Fase de análisis; donde se sistematizó la información disponible, mediante el diseño de una base de datos y apoyo de SIG; se realizó el análisis de interrelaciones. En particular, el desarrollo de la base de datos - el punto central del trabajo - se realizó en dos etapas: la primera de delimitación y compilación de la información, y la segunda fase que implicó el diseño, la elaboración y manejo de base de datos. La base de datos diseñada es compatible con el Sistema de Información Geográfica el cual permite obtener un panorama más completo sobre el proceso de la gestión del agua potable y puede servir de una herramienta práctica accesible en el proceso de planeación y toma de decisiones en materia del agua a nivel local.</jats:p>"
