To address this complexity, and with the current pressure of competition in today's business environment, improving process efficiency has become an objective for companies and supply chains. Currently, there are no concepts available that enable evaluating and improving efficiency along entire supply chains. Based on this deficit, the authors developed the Supply Chain Improvement System (SCIS). This chapter will present the theoretical concept of the SCIS and provide the reader with two case studies that consider how to apply it in entrepreneurial practice. Beginning with offering some background information, current deficits in evaluating the efficiency of supply chains will be noted. Proceeding with the principles, the chapter will give a deeper insight into the structure of the concept. </jats:p>"

However, assumption‐omitted testing and a focus on general opportunism as opposed to specific forms of opportunism have stubbornly limited our understanding of this construct. Grounded in a review of empirical studies of opportunism, we identify empirical challenges that perpetuate conceptual limitations in the study of opportunism in supply chains. Hence, we provide suggestions about research designs and data sources that support an agenda that steers research to refine and develop the theory about opportunism. Our call for a reinvigoration of the study of opportunism supports rigor—by discussing research design and data sources—and relevance—by identifying topics for future supply chain research.</jats:p>",

The second question is “Why companies should build a resilient supply chain?” Some factors have increased firms' vulnerability and the losses associated with unpredictable events. Companies should understand that the advantages linked to building resilience do not become evident only in case of disastrous events, but also during the ordinary operations execution. The third question is: “How to build resilience?” The most relevant ways to build resilience will be illustrated by drawing on some short case studies that were purposefully chosen in order to present a practical implementation of some of the different techniques used to create resilience.

Electronic devices are products that integrate physical forms (i.e. hardware) and virtual forms (e.g. software) to deliver value to customers. These forms are very different from a product design and supply chain perspective, but nevertheless they need to work closely together in order to create value for the customers. For electronic device manufacturers, it is important that processes are in place to facilitate the seamless integration of both forms throughout the engineering, production, distribution and support stages of the product lifecycle. This chapter examines the role of physical and virtual supply chain innovation strategies in electronic device supply chains by exploring the commonalities and differences between the design, manufacturing, and distribution models of digital and physical elements. It also explores to what extent such strategies can be employed for engineer-to-order (ETO) supply chains.</jats:p>"

Findings summary were that the South African construction industry exists in a very dynamic and volatile environment with common challenges as evident in other countries. This challenge, necessitates the use of collaborative means of managing the various phases of the supply chain. It was also found that the use of collaborative models such as Public Private Partnership (PPP) can prove rewarding when stakeholders involved in a project have an understanding of the model and its dynamics. This chapter contributes to the use of PPP collaborative models in construction project delivery in South Africa. </jats:p>"

For most companies around the world, resources have been reduced, inventory drained, technology spending curtailed, and core processes scaled back in order to adjust to the current reality of reduced demand. So, this paper mainly concentrates on giving some tips based on recession recovery strategies. Firstly, this paper discussed the supply chain management trends in and up to 2015, then general concept of recession and the relation between recession and supply chain management system, then some fatal mistakes of recession recovery according to the supply chain experts and recession and recovery related literature reviews are summarized to identify ultimately the recession recovery strategies for the manufacturer. The paper ended with some supply chain management related predictions, tips for reducing supply chain barriers. Moreover, a brief section of this paper also here highlights the supply-chain infrastructure helpful for recession recovery that is one of the important factors for the reason of cost-reduction, resource planning and maintenance etc. in today's supply chain management and related environment. </jats:p>"

An emerging area in supply chain practice is green SCM, which integrates environmental management with traditional SCM. Green supply chain management is seen as an important step companies need to take on the road to sustainable practices. SCOR Model (Supply Chain Operations Reference) has been developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC now merged with APICS) in order to guide companies applying SCM principles. The GreenSCOR model was also developed as an integrated green SCM tool that allows companies to manage their supply chain's environmental impacts, resulting in more efficient operations which have minimal impact on the environment. This chapter will talk about how SCM principles can be modified to reduce the adverse effects of company operations on the environment, especially using the GreenSCOR model. </jats:p>"

It describes how to provide an approach to the security performance measurement. In order to get SI it is necessary to develop a systematization of Security Index Determination Model (SIDM). SI describes Supply Chain Security Management (SCSM) performance. SCSM implements, facilitates and maintains Security barriers, which are formed by a confluence of properly chosen and efficiently implemented security measures. The presented methodology is based on the General Model developed by Gutiérrez and Hintsa that was expanded according to research needs. The expansion was based on adding the specified barriers for each of the Sub-categories stated in the previously mentioned General Model. For this purpose different security initiatives such as AEO, C-TPAT and TAPA were analysed. SIDM is based on Objectivized Methodology for Technical Systems Conditions Assessment developed by Lansky. </jats:p>"

The current investigation adopts a social exchange perspective and investigates the importance of trust, commitment, reciprocity and power on integration of logistics capabilities and their subsequent role in developing supply chain innovation. As supply chain innovation aims to provide better performance implications for the focal firm; the impact of supply chain innovation on firm performance was also explored using a service perspective.

This article outlines supply chain collaboration, which is a critical strategy for the field of supply chain management. While firms have traditionally operated in a manner that only considers their own well-being, a transition is occurring where open market relationships are diminishing and cooperation, coordination, and collaboration are becoming much more common. There are several key dimensions of collaboration that serve as drivers to its success, and firms that engage in these activities should experience closer relationships with channel partners and ultimately achieve higher levels of success. While this issue has been thoroughly covered in the logistics and supply chain management literature, its limited implementation and lack of widespread success provides evidence that the topic should continue to be a focal point in future research. </jats:p>"

The supply chain firms put an extra effort to develop and run in the most effective &amp; efficient ways possible. There are issues of concern that need attention, like huge losses in perishables (food) because of infrastructural deficiencies. The demand for food remains highly unfulfilled in most of the country and outside in spite of high production of food. This is because of highly ineffective, inadequate and very weak supply chains for food that require temperature controlled conditions to retain quality and safety of food and curb the decay process. An effective food retail supply chain thus becomes vital (Bourkakis and Weightman, 2004).Supply chains for perishable and time-sensitive products, pose specific and unique challenges. The temperature controlled supply chains or cold chains are a significant proportion of the retail food market which is still in the nascent stage. </jats:p>"

As retailers choose to concentrate either on product leadership private-label or high touch customer intimacy or on cost leadership strategies, their supply chain priorities and investment decisions are tailored to the specific requirements. While retail is extremely diverse, but retailers across the globe share many priorities — balance the availability of the inventory; control the costs and customer service in order to maintain the retail strategy. Our effort has been to explore how retailers are managing these priorities and getting ready for future. </jats:p>"

This is achieved in three steps: First, SSCM enablers were identified through a literature review. These internal enablers go through certain external challenges when supply chain players practice Sustainability. Second, an attempt is made to explain these challenges from the perspective of Institutional Theory. The role of Institutional Isomorphism in regulating and creating a direction for achieving the sustainability goal is identified.

This study attempts to synthesise both existing and new elements in comprehensive frameworks. The main contribution of this chapter is the application of an assessment tool to evaluate the impact of SC operations on sustainability. Subsequently, a performance measurement model is proposed to assess to what extent the level of sustainability could affect the operational performance areas. An adequate understanding of how SC of a fashion company could be configured toward sustainability, how sustainability must be assessed, and how SSCM performance could be measured is provided through this chapter. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As grocery retailers have limited profit margin, the players in the industry are constantly looking for cost effective supply chain model for increasing profit margins. Any convenience store should have assortment which is more suitable for the local target customers but the company might receive the inventory from multiple sources. In this chapter we have proposed a new way to handle the supply chain for the convenience store, that is, Hub and Spoke model between Hypermarket/Supermarket/Supercenter and Convenience store. In this model Spoke (Convenience Store) receives all inventory from single source, that is, Hub (Hypermarket/Supermarket/Supercenter), hence there is a significant reduction in the logistics cost. This will allow the retailer to be more focused on customer service which in turn will make more loyalists for the store. </jats:p>"

Although imitation may take the form of any management practice, operationally, we focus on whether the buyer’s control practices used with first‐tier suppliers results in similar control practices being used by these first‐tier suppliers with the second‐tier suppliers. Drawing on institutional theory, we identify relational context (i.e., affective commitment) and environmental context (i.e., environmental uncertainty) as two important factors influencing the extent to which such imitation takes place. Using unique survey data of vertically linked supply chain triads, we generally find support for the occurrence of imitation and more so in cases of high affective commitment. The results regarding environmental uncertainty further reveal selectivity in imitative behavior, calling attention to the level of deliberateness in imitation decisions in supply networks. Besides contributing to theory on imitative behaviors in the supply chain, this study also generates practical implications on the spread of management practices across multiple tiers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains today are, primarily, measured by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as order-fulfillment, availability to the consumer (percent in-stock) and cost reduction, as well as financial KPIs such as return on investment (ROI), return on brand equity and inventory. These KPIs measure the performance of supply chain as a whole. A supply chain is a network of nodes. The performances of individual nodes are measured with KPIs such as production rate, shipment rate, inventory and the like. These metrics may indicate the performance but may not indicate the cause of such performance. For example, a node whose production rate is below the desired level may be because of poor supply of inputs of production by its supplier node.Thus mere identification of KPIs and their evaluation will not enable to identify the root cause of a problem in a supply chain. Therefore, we need a business intelligence framework that will satisfy the objectives, namely, identification of outcome of each node of the supply chain and its cause. The existing Supply Chain Intelligence (SCI) frameworks aims at identifying metrics that reflect the performance of individual nodes and the total supply chain, but fail to identify the cause of such outcomes. It implies that the linkages or association between the KPIs of individual nodes are required to be identified and defined. In this paper, contingency and systems approach has been used to identify the dimensions of the firm, its internal environment, the complement and the external environment. A system dynamics based approach has been used to identify the causality and resulting behavior of the supply chain. The paper proposes a SCI framework and a System dynamics Model that help in identifying the reasons for supply chin performance and lead to the actions required to be taken for improvement in performance of the supply chain. </jats:p>"

Notable features are that more systems support knowledge exploitation than knowledge exploration, and that general-purpose software (e.g., internet search, database) is used more than software specific to knowledge management (e.g., data mining, “people finder”).

Based on the long-term goals of the SCM, the organizational performance measures are identified as financial and market performance and customer satisfaction. In the context of SCM, the financial and market performance factor is operational zed in terms of market share, return of total assets, annuals sales growth (Tan et al, 1999).The research paper attempts to find out the relationship between the dairy supply chain management (DSCM) practices and organizational performance. Various practices of DSCM through extensive literature review is taken into account i.e. Information and Communication Technology Practices, Supplier Relationship Practices, Supply Chain Manufacturing Practices, Inventory management system, Warehousing Management System, Transportation Management System, Customer Relationship Management for establishing the relationship with organizational performance. The aim of this study is to recommend these findings to companies which are still at the infancy stage when it comes to dairy supply chain management and integration with customers and suppliers. </jats:p>"

Traditionally, a single centralized model that encompasses multiple participants in the supply chain is built when optimization of the supply chain through simulation is required. However, due to the heterogeneity of supply chain, a centralized simulation model has a limit to reflect the dynamics of each supply chain participant. This research focuses on the conceptual and the technical issues about the supply chain simulation with a parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) concept. In particular, to ensure the decomposition of supply chain simulation model by each supply chain participant, the simulation framework is proposed using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in e-collaboration environment. For a clear proof of concept, the virtual supply chain simulation model is implemented and experienced using business process modeling tools in SOA. Due to the reusable, interoperable, and scalable characteristics of the proposed supply chain simulation framework, various alternatives for supply chin optimization can be generated and evaluated. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a supply chain network, facilities are the primary components where a product is manufactured or stored. During the phase of design of a supply chain network, a company decides how to configure the supply chain over the next several years. Key driver of supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency will be taken into consideration in the decision process and the decisions include the role assigned to each facility, its capacity to perform the assigned role, the number and location of the facilities. Since supply chain design decisions pertaining to facilities are typically made for the long term and are very expensive to alter on short notice, the decisions must take into account uncertainty in anticipated market conditions over the next few years. Decisions regarding facilities are therefore a crucial part of supply chain design. This chapter explains the practical application of theories, concepts and frameworks in the area of Supply Chain Design, Risk Mitigation and Social Networks. The practical application is based on a case study of ABC, one of the world's leading agribusiness companies with global operations that made a successful foray in emerging markets facilitated by sound decisions pertaining to the design of its global supply chain network.

Unlike the case of the traditional manufacturer-retailer channels, the delivery capacity is a kind of “service product” that cannot be inventoried. To avoid the risk of unprofitable capacity, the delivery provider tends to build a limited delivery capacity which is smaller than the system-wide optimal capacity. To solve such a problem, the authors investigate the capacity coordination issue in this service supply chain using option contracts. By allowing the online retailer to reserve the capacity in advance, the delivery provider could rent a part of capacity which surpasses its self-owned capacity from a third party logistics. It is demonstrated that, compared with the benchmark based on a newsvendor model, option contracts can coordinate the delivery service supply chain. The authors also figure out the feasible option contracts that improve member's expected profit and show the degree of improvement that could be achieved. </jats:p>"

Furthermore, impact of suppliers-specific characteristics (firm size, resources dependence setting and self-sustainability) on SCSIs are investigated. According to the findings, we propose a performance implication-based conceptual model of SCSIs from the perspective of suppliers. We conclude that costs of SCSIs happen immediately to suppliers in implementation, but the benefits are expected in long run. These suppliers-specific characteristics are the decisive factors if suppliers can survive over short-run costs and reach the long-run benefits.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management involves efficiently integrating suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, stores, and customers. To survive in a highly competitive business environment, manufacturing, resource planning and scheduling and distribution operations are the significant drivers that need to be optimized within supply chain management. In this chapter, we design the supply chain system considering dual demand management strategies simultaneously for the same company, both engineer-to-order (ETO) and make-to-order (MTO). This research has been inspired from the window manufacturer which manufactures and distributes vinyl windows to meet new construction and replacement/remodeling sector demand in the State of Ohio. The company manufacturers windows based on make-to-order strategy for new construction projects and at the same time builds replacement windows to individual customer specifications in very small quantities to be used for replacement in homes. In this study, a total of 174 individual customers and six big contractors are considered throughout the State of Ohio. This paper proposes to separate products based on demand management strategy and develop different supply chain networks for each group. The idea is to design bigger facilities for high volume (make-to-order products) as transportation cost per unit is reduced due to economies of scale whereas to place smaller and more facilities for low volume engineer-to-order products to be closer to the clients where it may not feasible to carry a only few products over long distances. All in all, this study provides nested models to integrate both design and operational aspects of supply chain system in the presence high-volume and low-volume of window products. Moreover, all location, design and manufacturing operations are performed by considering new mathematical models (mixed-integer and integer mathematical models) and heuristics in engineer-to-order demand management environment. Normally-distributed, probabilistic demand environment is considered in our design and operational phase of the study. Preliminary results show that, each design has its own strategic advantage and outcome and the ultimate objective has been accomplished in our design in this study. Briefly, four manufacturing facilities are established to meet the demand of replacement/remodeling sector and two manufacturing facilities are situated to meet the demand of new construction sector. The results revealed that, 29 layered-cells and a total of 200 machines are opened and utilized for replacement/remodeling sector. Additionally, 15 layered-cells and a total of 104 machines are needed to cover the entire demand of new construction sector. Also for the new construction sector, three distribution centers are needed to facilitate the products over the region. In terms of daily cell loading and scheduling phase, the results are almost doubled in replacement/remodeling sector demand compared to new construction sector demand volume due to having more cells and machines in the new construction design strategy. The supply chain work involves location and number of manufacturing facilities, number and location of distribution centers, detailed design of manufacturing systems and performing scheduling to confirm the validity of the manufacturing system design. </jats:p>"

This chapter attempts to identify the Risk Factors (RFs) in SCIS implementation and evaluate them. Sixteen risk factors were identified based on an extensive literature survey. A comprehensive framework is presented with three major phases to select an adequate SCIS. The risk assessment for SCIS implementation is then empirically investigated. The RFs are formulated as hierarchy structures and Fuzzy AHPs as a Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) tool applied to judge the viable candidates. Based on a fuzzy AHP approach, a revised risk matrix with a continuous scale is proposed to assess the RFs' classes. The result classifies the risk factors in different categories (Extreme, High, Medium and Low). The revised risk matrix with continuous scale for risk assessment in SCIS implementation is a novel approach. </jats:p>"

A wide literature review is conducted to identify the relative important factors constitute of Sustainable Supply Chain Integration framework. Content analysis is introduced and applied for reviewing literature reviews of supply chain management, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2014. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic categories derived from a typical research process. With best understanding the concept of SSCM and gap identification from literature review, this chapter can contribute to extended model of SSCM and enhance firm competitiveness. This understanding is vital due to the increase of economic importance of sustainable supply chains in addition to their role in enhancing competitive power of companies in international markets. </jats:p>"

Petri nets have been successfully introduced as an effective tool for describing control specifications and realizing the control in automated supply chain processes. The extended net representation of the productive task flows can provide more synthetic specifications for consistent management and control of supply chain systems by a top-down refinement methodology.

The overall results highlight the importance of a holistic approach to international supply chain management. Findings from Samsung's smart phone production network and Tesco's global distribution suggest that firms are able to be successful when they exploit specific opportunities wherever they are located in the world. Whilst Samsung have been successful with keeping in-house production, Airbus are doing well with outsourcing. The Airbus case highlights the importance of risk management in global supply chains.

The focus will be on the advantages of the use of information technologies to improve company's efficiency to be competitive and for the reduction of costs, improvement of operations, improvement of relationships with customers, suppliers and partners, shortening of delivering times, streamlining and optimization of business processes and operations. The use of new technologies contributes to improve efficiency of supply chain management: raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, finished product manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. Technologies allow an integrated approach to planning, control and monitoring of product flows, from suppliers to end users. They aim at improve customer service at reduced overall costs, and leads to the development of important relationships with logistics providers, suppliers, and customers in order to enhance information exchange and the coordination of business activities, which are the key advantages of an integrated supply chain with the collaboration among all the participants in the value chain. </jats:p>"

The third section presents the eco-certification decisions at the supply chain level in four subsections. It first builds a theoretical framework regarding the downstream firms' sustainability-related decisions by offering conceptual definitions. Next the farm business decision logic is given, followed by the discrete choice model. The specialization of the model is presented in the third subsection, followed by the results, discussions, and implications for practitioners. Some conclusions and implications for future research are offered in the last section. </jats:p>"

This creates structural organizational opportunities for Global Supply Chain Centers, organized as a corporate functional unit for an organization, a shared service center or a Business Process Organization that manages supply chain intermediation. The opportunities of such units are unravelled, the major of which: closing bulk contracts at a large discount price, especially for commodities; closing contracts with suppliers to assure supply availability and quality; economies of scale; complex product over lifetime advantages.

Few studies in literature discuss ambidexterity in a supply chain context. The research presented in this paper highlights issues that act as barriers and deserve attention in implementing ambidextrous supply chain strategy in SMEs. To develop a relationship structure existing among these variables, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) technique is used. Further, variables' impact and dependency is calculated using Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) approach. ISM algorithm proves to be a better tool as compared to a large-scale generic questionnaire based study due to its iterative nature that helps to bring forth issues that are difficult to identify otherwise. SMEs in India under tremendous pressure to excel on exploration and exploitation dimensions would be the major beneficiaries of this study. The hierarchy based structure and the classification of factors based on their impact and dependence, will enhance the understanding of SMEs mangers/owners to improve supply chain performance by eliminating barriers and thereby implementing ambidextrous strategy across the supply chain.</jats:p>"

It is argued that relationship based supply chain produces financially tangible results in many areas of supply chain. The concept is based on transaction cost theory arguing that the final price is determined in the market by total cost. A collaborative relationship fosters trust that leads to lowering transaction cost and speed up time to market which creates “serial equity” rather than “spot equity”. Recent research on collaboration and supply chain performance seems to suggest tangible financial gains. Yet, no theoretical framework has been developed and empirical evidences have been lacking to support such hypothesis. A clearly defined theoretical framework and supportive empirical evidence between these two constructs are needed for future research in this area.

It is considered as a key element in defining and managing supply chain risks. The great complexity of a global supply chain and of its environment, coupled with managerial trends, makes such a chain more vulnerable to disruptive events. A clear understanding of the possible consequences generated of this combination is a fundamental step to build an effective risk management plan and strategies. However, more studies are needed in order to develop the understanding of supply chain vulnerability. This article provides an explorative framework in order to analyze and quantify vulnerability within supply chains. Based on the existent literature, this article explores the factors that affect the level of Supply Chain Vulnerability (SCV). Four key components of SCV are identified (i.e. Exposure, Sensitivity, Susceptibility and Preparedness level). Based on these four categories of SCV, a conceptual model is developed. Such a model enables the definition of clear metrics and can further be used by researchers and practitioners to build consistent quantification methodologies. </jats:p>"

This article first studies the asymmetry among the retailers in terms of the different characteristics of the cost, price, quantity. This article finds that a supplier's profits increase when the number of retailers are high enough in the retail market, even though the retail price of the retailers is lower than that of the supplier, or the wholesale price is cut down when there are many retailers competing in the retail market. On the other hand, under certain conditions, the efficiency of supply chain goes to 1. In this article, the authors show that some traditional contracts that can perfectly coordinate the single-channel supply chain, while failing to coordinate the dual-channel supply chain. Therefore, this article puts forth a linear quantity discount contract and first proves it can be applicable to the dual-channel supply chain with asymmetric retailers under a certain special condition where the lead retailer exits the retail market. The authors examine contracts which can reduce the loss of the efficiency, though they cannot completely coordinate a dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

Since an agile supply chain comprises of a plethora of components, it is imperative that there should be a set of uncertainties associated with its functioning. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a set of critical risks associated with the agility of an organization's supply chain. Identification and prioritization of the risks to assess their relative criticality form the backbone of the research process. This research is expected to aid the decision-makers develop robust risk management strategies as related to their organizational supply chain agility, thereby ensuring their growth and sustainability in the market. </jats:p>"

This study used a survey questionnaire for a sample size of 277 managers from various sectors in the manufacturing industry in Jordan.  This study utilised PLS Structural Equation Modeling for testing the hypothesis.  The finding indicates a significant positive relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain performance and that knowledge sharing plays partial mediation in this relationship. This study provides an important implication on the role of knowledge sharing. The performance of the supply chain can be maximised if the supply chain partners share knowledge among them. This will expedite the process of delivering the products to the customers.  Awareness among partners on the importance to share and utilise knowledge better should be raised. The study contributes to the research on supply chain management by advancing the understanding of the role of knowledge sharing that can increase the performance of the supply chain partners.   Keywords: Supply chain integration, supply chain management, knowledge sharing, supply chain performance, supplier integration.</jats:p>"

Historically, decision-makers have paid limited attention to menstruation—either due to oversight and neglect or due to deliberate exclusion. Yet, the last decade has seen enormous developments; at various levels, menstruation is rising to the level of global awareness. This might be what most distinguishes the current state of the menstrual movement from its past. Menstruation is gaining traction. Against this background, this section offers an overview and early assessment of these developments at various levels including those driven by practitioners, policy-makers, activists, and civil society actors. It seeks to capture these trends and initiatives through a combination of practice-based and research-based chapters that bring together different perspectives, voices, and experiences. This diversity is essential to engage different types of emerging knowledge in this field and to combine practical experience with critical reflection.</jats:p>"

But it is especially written for those who desire an intricate and detailed knowledge of how and why these policies worked with respect to the supply of adequate credit for economic development. A thorough examination of key credit institutions and their specific powers, functions, mechanisms, context, and economic impact brings the reader to a recognition of which policies and institutions were successful and unsuccessful in supporting the economy and preventing crisis. \r\n\r\nIts extensive use of primary sources, period literature, and carefully chosen quotations allows the reader to participate in the original discussion and issues that faced Americans in each era. This vivid account leads to a unique grasp of relationships between essential facts, ideas, and time periods. The reader is rewarded with the rare experience of seeing the evolution of three hundred years of policy development as an integrated process. \r\n\r\nThe book’s content will be new and provoking to the academic, policy maker, and economist, but is presented in a manner and style ensuring comprehension for a general audience and those new to the topics involved. Many of the lessons learned in the course of the investigation are relevant and applicable to modern economic and financial policies. \r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

Each design is analyzed for the optimum cost, time and environmental impact which form objective functions. The problem is modeled as a tri-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The cost objective aggregates the opening cost (fixed cost) and the variable costs in both forward and reverses material flow. The time objective considers the longest transportation time from plants to customers and reverse. Factors of environmental impact are categorized and weighed using an analytic network process (ANP) which forms the environmental objective function. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied as a solution methodology to solve the MILP model. Ultimately, a case problem is also used to illustrate the model developed and concluding remarks are made regarding the results. </jats:p>"

Adopting a qualitative approach, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders based in New Zealand who are involved in international supply chains. The interviews find that compliance behaviour is affected by the influence of other organizations, organizational perceptions of compliance, and the rules and norms of exchange in different contexts. The results also indicate that compliance behaviour is more symbolic than substantive in the supply chain environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A crystal ball methodology that foresees the future is probably one of the most sought-after tools by any organization operating in this ever-changing world. The ability to correctly navigate through uncertainties and drastic changes in the external environment is found to be limited when an inward perspective of the company is utilized. The measurement of performance indicator and the mining of usable information in a sea of big data, among other approaches, may provide limited results in guiding the company towards choosing effective strategic decisions that will sustain the company in the future. This chapter is an effort to pursue an alternative perspective in planning by using Scenario Planning, a group thinking process that encourages knowledge exchange and development of mutual deeper understanding of central issues important to the future of an organization. Applying Scenario Planning framework, a structured approach is elaborated to describe a replicable methodology for sensing critical uncertainties in the external environment. These uncertainties are then utilized as the foundations for creating scenarios, which are attempts at vivid visualizations of how the future may look like. In this research, the effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated on the supply chain of Clariant, a Specialty Chemicals Company headquartered in Switzerland, by developing three scenarios that are sample representations of a whole range of plausible futures. These scenarios are differentiated by combinations of high and low conditions of the three critical uncertainties identified: (1) Emergence of trading blocks, (2) Changing consumer needs/behavior, and (3) Changes in logistics infrastructure. These critical uncertainties are also used to further design a new breed of indicators that are used as ground-sensors to monitor which direction the future is heading to. In addition, Scenario Planning also provides a fertile platform on which organizational learning can organically grow. The steps used in the methodology forces users of the scenarios to challenge existing mental models resulting to a wider perspective and appreciation of the dynamics that surround and impact an organization in the future.</jats:p>"

A simple interface is developed that can be used to increase the ease of communication and provide an interactive approach to the decision-making process. The model contains three echelons: farmers, processors and retailers. The main results show that under normal circumstances, the behavior of the system reaches equilibrium after a few oscillations. However, these oscillations can be smoothed out if the adjustment time of the order placement is increased. Under an extreme event that reduces the demand for milk, behavior changes and the system remains in dis-equilibrium for the entire simulation. Once again, adjustment times remain the leverages that can influence and mitigate those negative effects. Finally, a more robust and collaborative decision-making process among the actors of the chain could be beneficial for all not only under normal circumstances, but also in the presence of extreme uncertainty. </jats:p>"

While exploring and analyzing the different patterns of menstrual taboos and their implications, Sukumar shows the gaps in feminist understanding of the intersectionality of caste and patriarchy. She concludes by observing that the discourse on menstrual taboos should become the focal point to build inclusion and understand gender inequality and oppression within the framework of intersectionality.</jats:p>"

The Dempster Shafer/Analytical Hierarchy Processes (DS/AHP) model is employed to link SCPE to the firm's financial efficiency through defining the relevant importance weights of SCPE measures regarding the preferences of FFE. The chapter also introduces a SC Financial Link Index (SCFLI) to examine the degree to which SCPE is linked to the FFE objectives. This index offers an effective supply chain management (SCM) tool to provide continuous feedback on SCPE and recognise the suitable employed remedial actions. Analysing this index offers opportunities for detailed evaluation of SCPE and empowers firms to trace SC processes that need improvement, causing in more control on daily SC operations. The proposed method permits the evaluation, monitoring, and control of SCPE to enhance SC policy for better alignment with the FFP. Linking SCPE to the FFP objectives empowers firms to gain competitive advantages and formulate strategies for improved SCM through linking such strategies to the focus area of improving the FFE. </jats:p>"

With growing population and their demand; especially in retail and pharmaceutical sectors drives Indian cold chain market and it has huge potential to grow in the near future. India's greatest need is for an effective and economically viable cold chain solution that will integrate the supply chains for all commodities from the production centers to the consumption centers; thereby reducing physical waste and loss of value of perishable commodities.

From there, the chapter explores the wide variety of ways that the Hebrew Bible in particular, as well as several other religious traditions, have shaped menstrual taboos (including, but going well beyond, the notion of a “curse”). Such taboos have operated in diverse ways and diverse places, hence this chapter also explores how both individual and whole communities may experience them differently, including offering less negative interpretations. As such, the chapter introduces readers to a striking diversity of menstrual experiences. Moreover, people and communities in both the Global North and the Global South increasingly challenge taboos with creative activism. The chapter concludes with a brief survey of what has become a menstrual movement.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is to develop a multi-objective model to capture the trade-off between total cost and environmental performance in the green dual-channel supply chain network. Moreover, the transportation mode has been considered as a decision variable. With regard to the complexity of such network, a new swarm intelligence algorithm known as a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm has been employed to tackle this problem. The effectiveness of the present model and approach is evaluated by a numerical experiment, and the results show that the added environmental performance is actually proportional with the increased cost. Additionally, the comparison between different mode decisions shows that a better trade-off between two objectives will be obtained when considering the transportation mode selection.</jats:p>"

The benefits that UDI brings to hospitals and patients is relatively obvious, including inventory transparency, product safety, product equivalency, business intelligence. However, adoption by manufacturers, who face the mandate, has been slow in part because the benefit to them is not as readily perceived. This study focuses on the incentives, barriers, and benefits that medical device manufacturers perceive in UDI adoption. This study seeks to understand which adoption pressures are driving manufacturers to act, and attempts to gauge the benefits to manufacturers from UDI adoption. Through survey methods, the evidence suggests that medical device manufacturers implement UDI largely as a response to the coercive and normative pressures they face. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty regarding the return on investment for the medical device manufacturers, particularly from the late adopters.</jats:p>",

Stella Nyanzi powerfully examines the strategies she used for popularizing the campaign, mobilizing citizen participation, and smashing the silence and taboo around menstruation. Above all, she dissects the countertactics employed by the government to discredit and criminalize the campaign. Stella Nyanzi demonstrates that menstruation and women’s bodies are political and politicized—to the extent that her activism and criticism has led to her imprisonment.</jats:p>"

First, she shows that girls’ temporary freedom of engagement in the physical territory alongside boys ends at menarche, compromising embodied joy, agency, and positive connection to the physical environment. Second, she examines how strongly enforced ‘femininity’-related discourses at menarche, which are further imposed by menstruation-related discourses, corset the way girls can inhabit their bodies. Third, Piran argues that menarche is a biological event that is associated with embodied demotion in social power and with disrupting relational networks. She concludes that positive embodiment at menarche depends on the availability of relational connections and norms that can counteract these adverse social experiences.</jats:p>"

This chapter critiques the medical system and menstrual hygiene industry for the (bio)medicalization of menstruation that establishes women as diseased and as unable to know their bodies. Wood suggests that women’s vigilance about menstrual concealment is not freely chosen, but a required self-disciplinary practice rooted in menstrual discourse that characterizes menstruation as stigmatized, taboo, and therefore shrouded in secrecy. The concealment imperative is a form of social control and a body project that keeps women disembodied and objectified. As a conceptual tool it has implications to understand the various ways that women’s bodies are regulated both at individual and social levels.</jats:p>"

But the rapid changes occurring in the business environment due to globalization and emergence of new markets have created many new opportunities as well as challenges for organizations in supply chain. Effectiveness of management institutions can be improved if they focus on changing needs of SCM and provide dynamic leadership in line with the changing needs of students and other stakeholders. This created the need for acquiring a completely different kind of supply chain skill sets and competencies among the leaders of these institutions, which they were hitherto unfamiliar with. This chapter attempts to develop a supply chain leadership model for business schools and management institutions to align themselves with the changing needs of the emerging markets of management education. It will enable the management institutes to redesign their strategies to suit the required changes. </jats:p>"

Green-Cole examines these hegemonic and patriarchal codes controlling discussion, commemoration, or visualization of menstruation, which have been internalized by millions of women worldwide as negative and shameful. One of the main tools used to maintain menstrual stigma is to erase the presence of the scene of menstruation in speech, image, and representation. Green-Cole argues that by publicly acknowledging menstruation and making it visible, the artworks discussed in this chapter are instrumental in undermining this stigma. She demonstrates how this process of undermining also changes what we assume to be the function and value of art. Finally, Green-Cole analyzes the ways in which artists have used paint to signify or stand in for blood as a challenge to the decorum of modernist formalism, which conveniently erased women’s issues.</jats:p>"

The research focuses on the e-business/e-commerce, a new but fast growing concept as a supply chain operation model, to compare and discuss the differences of related aspects to global supply chain management versus similar practices a decade earlier. An online questionnaire was used to collect data and the participants were all supply chain experts working for the same global logistics and transportation company. Participants' perceptions were collected about their online experience and how they have experienced the change in supply chain management as a result. The research revealed that there is a relationship between globalization, technology use, and the impact of these two elements on the evolution of the global supply chain in the e-business industry. Also, the ‘digitalization' is leading the global supply chain operations to a new operation platform. There were two main limitations in this study; a) relatively small sample size, and b) the majority of participants had a logistics background and this may have impacted their reported perceptions. </jats:p>"

Sustainable supply chain development typically focuses on three major dimensions of organizational competitiveness, economic, social, and environmental. Organizations make product deletion continuously. These decisions can profoundly contribute to sustainability.

However, due to the acquisitions that the company has made in the last two years in different countries of the region and the growth in the consumption of flexible packaging, the strategies among the different areas of the company have not been aligned, creating incompatibilities between the strategies of the functional areas like sales, operations, finance, and supply chain.

They associate birth control pills with “prostitutes” and express broad apprehension about sexual activity. These attitudes, coupled with their rejection of the pill and tampons, reveal girls’ sensitivity to the taboo surrounding female sexuality and demonstrate their desire to be “good girls.” At the same time, they are aware that they exist within a set of gender and power relations that limit their ability to define their bodies and their sexuality.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management has been used by businesses and the companies have attributed their success to effective supply chain management. But in case of healthcare sector, supply chain management is not that prominent since it deals with finished products. Supply Chain Management is a concept, strategy and approach that is proving its worth in hospital management all over the world. The pressures on hospital supply chains are changing. In response to these pressures some hospitals have initiated green supply chain management (GSCM) practices that provide tremendous opportunities to improve supply chain performance. This paper tries to provide empirical results in order to examine the impact of GSCM practices in building the positive image of the Indian hospitals incorporating two moderating variables namely regulatory and competition. In order to gain unique insights of current levels of awareness/adoption of GSCM and the potential impact GSCM could have in building organizational image, a survey was conducted among 53 hospitals from NCR (National Capital Region) India. Moderated hierarchical regression analysis has been used to arrive at the following results: (1) Indian hospitals have experienced increasing environmental pressure to implement GSCM practices; (2) The implementation of GSCM practices have helped in building positive organizational image (3) The existence of competitive and regulatory pressures influence hospitals to implement green supply chain practices that eventually help in building positive organizational image especially when these pressures cause adoption of green purchasing and green hospital services even though organizational image is most influenced by Internal environment management; (4) Hospitals implement green transportation policies under regulatory and competitive pressures. Implications for operations strategists from these relationships are also discussed. </jats:p>"

In so doing, Cohen moves beyond the question of how religious women meaningfully navigate compliance with menstrual practices and restrictions to draw attention to the ways religiously motivated menstrual practices create gendered roles and expectations and channel women’s sexuality for specific reproductive purposes. Through a comparative discussion of how the laws of Niddah in Judaism have evolved and a discussion of the different ways menstruation is linked to communicative states of being in Hinduism, Cohen explores how studying the intersection of menstruation and religion can contribute to better understanding how religious communities and cultures define and (re)produce themselves.</jats:p>"

The focus of the paper is on defining new knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches to address the network and community nature of current supply chains. Based on critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in the topic area, a knowledge network and mobilisation framework for lean supply chain management has been developed. The framework has then been evaluated using a case study from the food supply chain. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to incorporate expert's view on the defined knowledge networks and mobilisation approaches with respect to their contribution to achieving various lean performance objectives.

She asserts that men are willing and essential agents of change for gender equality when presented with pragmatic problems and implementable solutions. Basic noncontroversial and essential services and infrastructure, such as taps and toilets, serve as powerful entry points to articulating, exploring, and addressing wider gender and exclusion issues. Drawing on her experiences working with governments in Africa and Asia and reflecting on her journey over the past decades, Patkar outlines a methodology and pathway to transform the silence around menstruation into policy and action.</jats:p>"

Considering the period of 2005 to 2016, a systematic review was performed using research studies in the area of tourism supply chain management. The results show that game theory is used as a theoretical base in the majority of the cases, but several novel approaches are also incorporated to the analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of this paper is to unsettle prevailing assumptions of sustainability in architecture by analyzing the supply chain of building materials. By closely following the transformations of architectural materials and those that transform them, the tangible effects of design become more apparent (e.g. material extraction, environmental pollution, waste streams), and the intangible forces become more visible (e.g. economic incentives, labor abuses, political spending). The paper begins by outlining several theoretical and representational challenges of supply chains, followed by examples of how these ideas can be applied in teaching and practice.   Methods of representing supply chains fall into two categories. The first category documents supply chains in abstract or distanced representations, in what Donna Haraway might call “a view from nowhere.” These often take the form of maps, diagrams, or explanatory text that attempt to communicate the networked topology of material production. However, the comprehensive ambition of these representations often com¬promises their affective appeal. The second category adopts a momentary or situated representational strategy, often in the form of installations, images, or narrative text. These representations aim to highlight specific spaces or embodied relationships that speak to the character of the process, what Haraway might consider the “partial perspectives” that offer a more visceral understanding of a process. These types of representations, however, often risk underselling the extent to which decisions affect distributed sites and relationships.   To better grasp the impacts of design, this paper argues for hybrid approaches that draw from both methodological categories. It explores these ideas by describing the format and content of a graduate seminar called “Supply Chain Materialism.” The course itself is structured as a specula¬tive supply chain. At the beginning of the semester, students select an everyday construction material (e.g. steel, concrete, glass, plastic, wood, brick, silicone) and document its trans¬formations alongside the weekly theme. Paired with this independent research, the course offers a range of theories that help frame a more critical understanding of sustainability, drawing on texts in architecture and other spatial disciplines. The course also presents a catalog of spatial practices that align with different stages in the supply chain, including art installations, activist demonstrations, architectural projects, curated exhibitions, and performances.   Throughout the semester, students demonstrate their understanding of the course content through three representational techniques. First, students make collages using images clipped from trade magazines. These collages exploit the disjointed nature of material production by juxtaposing images of the seemingly dissociated sites, actors, and effects. Second, they create a narrative that documents specific activities involved in each stage of production of their selected material. Third, students design a folly that highlights the invisible aspects of their reconstructed supply chain. By creating a useless object out of a useful material, the folly seeks to challenge notions about the ubiquitous materiality of building design through techniques of estrangement, hesitation, or defamiliarization. Ultimately, the course exposes students to a broadened conception of sustainability and a widened field for intervention through a careful examination of the supply chain of mate¬rial production.</jats:p>"

Across these contexts, she finds that new definitions of ‘menstruation’ converge on the distinction between bleeding that occurs when women are taking hormonal birth control and when they are not. Finally, Hasson draws attention to the concept of redefining a biological process that is deeply significant for gendered embodiment, as well as a challenge to consider both the social and material construction of gendered bodies.</jats:p>"

Gideon Toury argues that a target culture translates to fill gaps exposed by a source culture which the target culture views as prestigious. While this notion may work historically for the purposes of comparative literature, literary historians and translation theory, and in the context of high-brow literature, this chapter considers it unsuited to other genres, less widely translated literatures or the contemporary book industry. Using mainly Scandinavian and Czech examples, and others found in this volume, the chapter elucidates the notion of supply-driven translation from smaller European literatures, aimed at fighting the norm of non-translation. The chapter concludes by providing a typology of supply-driven interventions, with some commentary on their apparent advantages and drawbacks that sheds light on the roles, motivations and contributions of different intermediaries in the translation process.</p>",

The samples were tested using a comparator which showed exactly how much chlorine  (in mg/L) is in the water if present. Several factors may affect the amount of residual chlorine in water which include pH, temperature and chlorine decay. These  factors greatly dictates the results depending on the time and conditions in which the sample is kept before the testing. This  shows why water tests differently at different distance points from the treatment plant. The results were tabulated in excel  spreadsheets while graphs and charts were used to show comparison of residual chlorine at different sampling points.</jats:p>"

But some of them have become a seller, selling directly to the customer. In logistics, some of them do not open the self-logistics to the third-party sellers, but some of them do open. As a result, a new form of channel conflict emerged. Therefore, the authors consider a self-logistics-type e-platform, who can sell directly to consumers; and a single retailer, who sells through the e-platform without self-logistics, but who may choose to contract with e-platform to deliver its products through the self-logistics. Thus, key questions for the e-platform are whether to sell directly to the customer; if they sell, the decision is whether to deliver the products through self-logistics and whether to open the self-logistics. To solve these questions, the optimal decisions of the retailer and self-logistics-type e-platforms and the system equilibrium results are analyzed under different situations. Finally, the logic tree to get the overall equilibrium is obtained.</jats:p>",

The Indian state’s health policies fail women because they do not recognize that the marking of women as impure menstruating bodies is a cause of women’s health inequity from birth to death. This very denial by the state policy of women’s gendered experience of health is menstrual injustice. The chapter elaborates on this idea by establishing the links between women’s stigmatization as menstruating bodies, lack of control over their bodies, and ill-health, pointing to the high incidence of a variety of menstrual health problems in pre-menarche, during menstruation, perimenopause and postmenopause. The chapter then identifies the gender-specific biases, blind spots, gaps, and barriers in state policies that impede the security of women’s health across their life-cycles.</jats:p>"

A computational experiment proves that the performance of inventory management in the supply chain and among retail stores can be significantly improved by application of CCSD, irrespective of demand and size distribution. In this paper, we illustrate its benefits for both normal and right-skewed demand distribution. We find that different stages in supply chain can also be coordinated by using the CCSD platform.

This article attempts to fulfill such need by investigating the relationship between supply chain agility (SCA) and organizational performance (OP) in the context of Iran. Primary data were collected through surveys distribution to 500 SC managers of all levels in Iranian SMEs. Subsequently, hypotheses were tested through SPSS and Structure Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed a positive relationship between SCA and OP along with positive relationships of each dimension of SCA (e.g., alertness, decisiveness, flexibility, accessibility, and swiftness). This article ensures that organizational OP might be improved by focusing SCA in the today's competitive environment. </jats:p>"

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 60 countries around the world, voluntary unpaid donors provide 100% of blood supplies. They do it due to effective marketing programs. There is shortage of donor blood in Ukraine and the number of blood donations is almost three times less than recommended by WHO. Therefore, it is important to analyze the positive experience of leading blood supply service centers. The objective of the investigation is to determine the role of advertising in print media as part of the blood supply service marketing activities. The advantages and disadvantages of print media advertising are systematized. 71 articles about Sumy Regional Blood Supply Service Center published in 11 printed sources during 1990 – May 2020 were analyzed. Printed sources where most of the articles were published were defined. Methods of analysis and logical generalization, trend analysis and content analysis were used. The main themes of the articles at each stage of their formation are determined: emphasis on the fellowship in problems solution, fight against incompetent actions, donor as the basis of the blood supply service functioning. It is advisable to use print advertising with the basic motto «everyone can easily help other people who need blood.» in order to involve people the donor movement. Blood supply service should be regularly cited in the local periodical press. As modern print media have both printed version of the publication and informational Internet-website, it is possible to distribute the necessary information among the wide range of the public. Particularly, it is reasonable to show examples of people and organizations donating blood; tell about the internal activities of blood supply service, show the most active people in donation promotion, so they can involve more people into donation, demonstrate examples of problems successfully solved by blood supply service and point out the idea: being a donor is simple and beneficial for both the donor and society. In the future it will optimize advertising in print media and increase its effectiveness as well as and develop complete marketing program with high rates of donors recruitment and support.</jats:p>"

The mutual influence between supply chains and communities offers opportunities to integrate sustainability initiatives into the chain. The concept of supply chain responsibility (SCR) represents a new philosophy that helps create value for communities, but so far does not link well with the idea of community and is viewed one chain at a time. A more integrated and holistic consideration of supply chain-community interactions incorporating multiple supply chains and communities adds to the perspective of community development through SCR. It not only leverages community development as a significant level of analysis in supply chains, but also considers all chains that interact with a community. We use a case study in China’s rice industry to examine the complex and multifaceted supply chain-community interactions in a network of three types of rice supply chain and two rural communities, to understand the theoretical and practical potential in an enriched conceptualization of SCR. The interactions among the supply chains and communities provide significant insights into how to create sustainability for both.</jats:p>"

Fox and Epstein present two case studies: (1) examining core issues of usability and inclusion in the design of existing applications; and (2) using participatory approaches to highlight the lived experiences of menstruators and introduce alternatives to dominant menstrual app protocols.

In the new stage of social development and environmental management system construction in the new era, the organic combination of green supply chain and green finance will be very important for speeding up the construction of ecological civilization and achieving the sustainable development of the Chinese nation. This chapter summarizes the current situation and existing problems of green supply chain and green finance, and analyses the reasons why green supply chain finance can be used as a means to break through the bottleneck of environmental management, and creatively puts forward a new model of green supply chain finance with multi-participation, which provides reference for the government, financial institutions, and enterprises to make environmental management decisions. </jats:p>"

To deploy its activities and to achieve its objectives, any organization must dispose resources such as material, human, financial, informational, and technological. This chapter treats a very interesting theme, that of procurement, as commercial activity, in the complex activities of organizations. The chapter starts with the literature in the field and presents the evolution of the process, the objectives, the roles, the functions, the activities, and the typology.

Affecting an estimated 176 million individuals worldwide, endometriosis is a major cause of non-menstrual pain, dyspareunia, painful menses and reduced quality of life among individuals of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds. Wide-ranging symptoms may be dismissed as routine by both patients and practitioners alike due to lack of disease literacy, and lengthy diagnostic delays can exacerbate the negative impact of endometriosis on the physical, psychological, emotional and social well-being of those affected. This chapter identifies some of these challenges and explores how obstacles to best practice can be reduced in part through adoption of early educational campaigns which incorporate endometriosis as a major component of menstrual health education.</jats:p>"

Each of these arenas is permeated by the biologically and socially constructed gender/sex binary, and as a result trans and genderqueer menstruators confront preexisting constraints ranging from social interactions to the built environment.

Through personal interviews, Vora reveals that menstruation is regarded as a negative, emotional, and expensive experience.

Expectations for cost reductions are ongoing and influence both new and existing products and services. The costs for new product and service introductions are managed differently than ongoing cost reductions. Purchasing plays a central role, with different goals, in cost control for new products and services versus ongoing cost savings. This research uses a case study methodology to understand the conflict purchasing faces in managing both new product costs and ongoing cost reductions. Due to goal incongruence between new product development and ongoing savings initiatives, purchasing may act in its own best interest, rather than in the best interest of the organization or team. This is both a contracting and an information uncertainty problem, creating an opening for passive opportunism by purchasing. Thus, agency theory and information processing theory (IPT) are combined to examine how information uncertainty can be reduced and contractual goal alignment improved in these situations. The outcome of this research is to expose potential goal misalignment between new product development cost processes and ongoing cost savings, and suggest theoretically grounded methods for reducing the potential conflict.</jats:p>",

It is named the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. The triggering technologies, concepts, or driving forces mentioned with Industry 4.0 are cyber-physical systems, vertical and horizontal integration, augmented reality, internet of things, internet of services, additive manufacturing and 3D Printers, big data analytics, cloud computing, cybersecurity. Through Industry 4.0, production activities will be made by automatic machines and robot communicating each other. Supply chains will be more integrated due to information and communication technologies based on real-time data sharing. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Industry 4.0 on supply chain management. For this purpose, literature is reviewed according to effects of Industry 4.0 on procurement, production, warehousing, transportation, and fulfillment functions of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Levitt and Barnack-Tavlaris argue that without addressing underlying sexist beliefs and attitudes as well as gender discrimination, menstrual leave could have negative effects on menstruators. The authors augment this research with findings from their previous study, which examines attitudes toward and perceptions of menstrual leave. Against this background, the chapter concludes with a discussion of alternative approaches to menstrual leave.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to information asymmetry and a prevailing focus on production that ignores safety among small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs), it is difficult for core enterprises in the supply chain (SC) to establish partnerships with SMMEs that have a high safe production level (SPL). We found that SMMEs would conceal their real SPL when being selected as core enterprise suppliers. This is known as adverse selection. According to the principal-agent theory, we built a signaling model to analyze the conditions of the pooling equilibrium and the separate equilibrium of the signaling game between core enterprises and SMMEs. The equilibrium results showed that adjusting the signal cost parameters of the SMMEs can guide the market to separate equilibrium and stop SMMEs from concealing or exaggerating their SPL. We also discuss corresponding suggestions. This research can reduce SC risks and promote the establishment of sustainable cooperative relationships between core enterprises and SMMEs with high SPLs. This study is applicable globally.</jats:p>",

Optimizing supply chain performance is a primary concern of manufacturing and logistics organizations. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is helping organizations to build automated and interconnected smart environment by object identification and tracking, motivating the first step towards an IoT-enabled world. This chapter attempts to understand extant literature studying applications of RFID in implementing the IoT in supply chain management. We categorize extant literature, firstly, based on research methodology and secondly, based on supply chain processes. We find that presently academic activity is around conceptualizing the usability of RFID in the IoT with limited analytical and empirical evidence. Supply chain processes such as demand planning, procurement, retail shelf space management and product returns are prospective areas for interesting future research.</jats:p>"

The performance of the supply chains is evaluated in terms of order rate variance ratio and bullwhip slope under four realistic customer demand models such normal, normal with a sudden change in mean, normal with seasonality, and normal with seasonality and a sudden change in mean. The impact of sharing of customer demand among the other members of the supply chain and the introduction of order smoothing parameter on both policies are also studied. The results show that under non-stationary customer demand models the difference in the performance of serial and divergent supply chains is noticeable. The bullwhip slope under OUT policy is significantly differing from the bullwhip slope under the SPC-based policy. OUT policy with order smoothing performs better than the SPC-based policy with order smoothing. This finding provides proper guidelines for a supply chain manager to make a decision in a practical scenario. </jats:p>"

Negative responses involve four themes: discomfort and labor to clean ‘messes,’ overt partner discomfort, negative self-perception, and managing partner’s disgust. Positive responses cohere around physical and emotional pleasure from sex while menstruating and rebellion against anti-menstrual attitudes. Race and sexual identity differences appear: White women and bisexual or lesbian-identified women describe more positive feelings than women of color or heterosexual women. Bisexual women with male partners describe more positive reactions than heterosexual women with male partners, implying that heterosexual identity relates to negative attitudes more than heterosexual behavior. Those with positive attitudes also enjoy masturbation more than others. Additionally, interviews address sexual and racial identities’ informing body practices, partner choice affecting body affirmation, and resistance against ideas about women’s bodies as ‘disgusting.’</jats:p>"

Instead, those working in the field specify that menstruators are taught about menstrual health and menstrual decision-making outside of school, with emphases on health literacy and education through a human-rights or justice-based learning experience.

These narratives are distinct but often co-occur; for example, some women experience freedom<jats:italic>after</jats:italic>going through distress.

From a Latin-American perspective, this new way to menstruate was also understood to be a sign of modernization. In this chapter, Tarzibachi describes and analyzes how the dissemination and proliferation of disposable pads and tampons have unfolded first in the United States and later in Latin America, with a particular focus on Argentina. She pays particular attention to how the Femcare industry shaped the meanings of the menstrual body through discourses circulated in advertisements and educational materials. Tarzibachi explores how the contemporary meanings of menstruation are contested globally, as the traditional Femcare industry shifts its rhetoric in response to challenges from new menstrual management technologies, new forms of menstrual activism, and the increasing visibility of menstruation in mainstream culture.</jats:p>"

Bacalja Perianes and Ndaferankhande read these rituals through an African ontological position to move beyond understanding African women’s subjectivity through the lens of oppression and gender-based hierarchies. By situating menstruation in local epistemologies, Bacalja Perianes and Ndaferankhande demonstrate how gender can be understood at a personal level, through the collective and relational experience of menstruation in Malawi. Findings from the research suggest that within Malawi, to be female is collectively ascribed, and individually understood, through the active and intelligible performance of menarche rituals and consequent menstrual practices. It is through such traditions, Bacalja Perianes and Ndaferankhande show, that women are “made,” with their newly ascribed gender imbuing them with a locus of power within their communities.</jats:p>"

The lexicon of extant literature focuses on enhancing supply chain leadership and development of efficient and effective strategies in developed economies, yet the corresponding literature in emerging economies is very fragmented. The aim of this chapter is to synthesize the current literature to understand the phenomenon including its definitions, dimensions, and constructs and to propose a conceptual model for successful supply chain leadership in emerging markets. The study tries to understand and establish the impact of various factors of supply chain leadership, which leads to sustainable supply chain performance. Collaboration and information management emerge as the major drivers for supply chain leadership in emerging markets and identifies trust as a mediating factor. </jats:p>"

In drawing on her past research, Reame shows how critical it is to innovate research methods and materials and to ensure that federal standards for tampon absorbency ranges and nomenclature, as well as testing procedures for tampon safety, don’t lose ground. Reame draws attention to the fact that tampon producers continue to introduce various product innovations with little government oversight for testing standards or ingredient disclosure. She concludes by offering suggestions for crucial ways in which activists in the ‘second menstrual moment’ can partner with the federal research enterprise to improve the research ‘vagenda’ in menstrual health.</jats:p>"

SCM in construction supports firms by aiding in the improvement of competitiveness between firms and the increase of the company's profits and control over projects. Although generic supply chains should be simple and linear, the construction sector is much more complex. These problems are present in different parts of SCM due to interdependence in the organization and supply chain.

Drawing on feminist menstrual scholarship, they argue that menstrual positivity is thinned and transformed when commodified. They argue that “positivity”—while important to feminist menstrual activism, praxis, and theorizing—is easily co-optable within neoliberal marketing cultures. While the authors acknowledge the importance of affirmative messaging, they nevertheless develop a “menstrual crankiness” that draws on positivity but also holds it critically at bay. Aligned with queer theoretical work on the political import of negative affects, they assert the importance of menstrual crankiness in pushing at sexist, transphobic, ableist, and white discourses around bodies and embodiment, arguing that menstrual crankiness is vital to thinking about the material pains and pleasures of menstrual bleeding.</jats:p>"

Supply and access to safe blood for transfusions are closely related to the organization and degree of development of blood services, with the governance and participation of society through voluntary unpaid donation.    Since 2004, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has been collecting and publishing indicators related to blood supply in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2014, the countries of the Region of the Americas reaffirmed their commitment to universal health through the approval of the Action Plan for Universal Access to Safe Blood 2014-2019, approved by the 53rd Directing Council held in October 2014 (CD53.6), this plan promotes universal access to safe blood for transfusion in the region, through unpaid voluntary donations, the organization of blood services, the implementation of quality and safety standards and the implementation of governance actions. The data presented here allows monitoring and reporting on progress and limitations in the implementation of the Action Plan for Universal Access to Safe Blood. Furthermore, it is hoped that these data will promote the analysis and evaluation of the indicators at the national and subregional levels, and that strategies that improve blood safety and accessibility to transfusions will be strengthened or modified. The information was provided by the authorities of the countries and corresponds to the years 2016 and 2017.</jats:p>"

Through a systematic literature review, the notable business model innovations in the food industry are identified, surveyed, and evaluated. Findings reveal that the innovations in value proposition, value creation processes, and value delivery processes of business models are the successful strategies proposed in food industry. It is further disclosed that rural female entrepreneurs, social movements, and also urban conditions are the most important driving forces inducing the farmers to reconsider their business models. In addition, the new technologies and environmental factors are the secondary contributors in business model innovation for the food processors. It is concluded that digitalization has disruptively changed the food distributors models. E-commerce models and internet of things are reported as the essential factors imposing the retailers to innovate their business models. Furthermore, the consumption demand and the product quality are two main factors affecting the business models of all the firms operating in the food supply chain regardless of their positions in the chain. The findings of the current study provide an insight into the food industry to design a sustainable business model to bridge the gap between food supply and food demand.</jats:p>"

In this examination, Ussher and Perz draw on interviews they conducted with women who self-diagnose as ‘PMS sufferers.’ They theorize that this self-positioning is subjectification, wherein women take up cultural discourse regarding idealized femininity and the stigmatized fat body; according to the authors, this results in distress, self-objectification, and self-condemnation. However, they argue that women can reduce premenstrual distress and resist negative cultural constructions of premenstrual embodiment and fat bodies through women-centered psychological therapy, which increases awareness of embodied change and leads to greater self-care and acceptance of the premenstrual body.</jats:p>"

Proposals will recover organic and inorganic waste and reincorporate it into the supply chain or add it to new chains through new products generated from food waste. A literature review is presented regarding the causes of food losses and waste within the supply chain and the strategic opportunities in the logistical process to reduce such losses. The creation of models that include the three dimensions of sustainability in food logistics is required in order to achieve a reduction in waste and food losses in transport, as well as to minimize costs and environmental impacts. If a correct sustainable logistics is carried out, it would favor the reincorporation of waste into new supply chains. </jats:p>"

In the Peruvian context, the studied company is the only local company that has a factory which is able to process post-consumer plastic bottles in order to transform them into recycled resin; this is why it performs a fundamental role. This recycled resin is used for elaborating new packages, generating a circular economy into line with the new global paradigm of switching to a model that seeks to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Finally, it was concluded that the collection center implementation will allow the recycling unit to purchase an average of 76 TN additional annual raw materials. The project would have a cost of US$ 151,383, generating a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 144,500 with a 25.9% of Internal Rate of Return (IRR), making it viable in a moderate scenario with a recovery period of five years. </jats:p>"

This study is an attempt to explore the enablers to overcome these issues and prioritize them. Decisions are more complex if they are intangible, non-expressible, qualitative, etc. To overcome this problem in the present study, AHP technique is used. With the help of AHP, 4 enablers and 14 sub-enablers of construction supply chain are prioritized. E-supply chain management is ranked first followed by digitization, tracking and localization, and cloud computing. In the case of sub-enablers, web service technology comes at first rank whereas management information system comes at 14th rank. This study will help the managers and professionals in construction organizations in building a good setup by focusing on these explored enablers. </jats:p>"

To demonstrate, this study looks through the lens of women living under three challenging circumstances—women with disabilities, incarcerated women, and women living in a disaster zone—to explore how they understand, manage, and respond to their menstrual needs. The authors show how the double stigma of the women’s condition or context, with that of their menstruating status, exacerbates their vulnerability, creating further boundaries to their health and well-being.</jats:p>"

But in the process of building a green supply chain of agricultural products and exploring circulation mode, there are many problems that hinder the development of green industry economy.

First, they identify bias in data sources, such as school records and recall data. Second, they show that limiting the focus to menstrual-related absenteeism obscures other threats that menstruation poses to educational attainment, health, and psychosocial well-being. To address these issues, the authors recommend the use of mixed methods, pre-analysis plans, and thoughtful consideration and validation of variables prior to study implementation. They also caution policymakers against overreliance on absenteeism as the sole outcome and overinterpreting results from existing studies that often lack scope and precision. They conclude with a call for more research on the links between menstruation and concentration, learning, self-esteem, and pain management.</jats:p>"

These clear objectives should help those responsible for the supply chain achieve a better performance within organizations. The information analyzed was obtained from a questionnaire provided to 284 managers in companies located in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The results were used to generate a structural equation model in order to learn the relationships between variables.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, the problem of choosing methods of establishing transit tariffs for natural gas transportation services to consumers of EU countries and finding ways to adapt them to the conditions of an international gas transportation consortium (IGTC) has become even more significant. The subject of the article is the problems of Ukrainian gas supply security to consumers of the EU countries using international economic and legal mechanisms. The purpose of the article is to develop a methodology for regulating transit Ukrainian-European gas supplies by creating IGTC \"Ukraine-EU\" to increase competition and establish an acceptable and mutually beneficial gas price for the end European consumer and for the gas transportation system itself. Research objectives: substantiating the solution of the problems associated with gas transit with the help of economic policy instruments; developing a method of forming IGTC \"Ukraine-EU\". General scientific research methods were used: synthesis, analysis, systematic approach, statistical analysis of international tariff setting practice application to resolve controversial issues related to the transit of natural gas. Main results and their scientific novelty. Based on the forecast of growth in demand for natural gas in the EU, the author shows the effectiveness of forming IGTC \"Ukraine-EU\" to ensure reliable gas transit through the territory of Ukraine. A unified mechanism for transit gas supplies through the gas pipeline system of Ukraine under the conditions of the functioning of the “Ukraine-EU” consortium has been proposed. Conclusions: using the mechanism for coordinating the interests of individual participants with the proposed methods will significantly raise the level of security of gas supplies to consumers in the EU countries - both within the framework of the proposed gas transportation consortium with European countries, and for other gas transportation projects.</jats:p>"

Although autistic respondents report many overlapping issues and experiences with non-autistic respondents, they also highlight distinct—and sometimes distressing—issues relating to menstruation, especially a cyclical amplification of autistic-related challenges, including sensory differences and difficulties with regulating emotion and behavior, which have a significant, negative impact on their lives. These initial findings call for systematic research on the potential causes, correlates, and consequences of menstrual-related problems in autistic individuals—across the spectrum and the lifespan.</jats:p>"

These barriers are raw material costs are higher in green applications, green projects having high operating costs, and high prices in green applications unable to compete with lower prices of competitors, respectively. Another finding of the study is that there is no significant difference between the implementation status of the green projects and the duration of the export activity on the barriers encountered in the implementation of GSCM.</jats:p>"

An emerging area in supply chain practice is green SCM, which integrates environmental management with traditional SCM. Green supply chain management is seen as an important step companies need to take on the road to sustainable practices. SCOR Model (Supply Chain Operations Reference) has been developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC now merged with APICS) in order to guide companies applying SCM principles. The GreenSCOR model was also developed as an integrated green SCM tool that allows companies to manage their supply chain's environmental impacts, resulting in more efficient operations which have minimal impact on the environment. This chapter will talk about how SCM principles can be modified to reduce the adverse effects of company operations on the environment, especially using the GreenSCOR model. </jats:p>"

Data collection is conducted using questionnaires designed with a five-point Likert scale. From 70 questionnaires distributed, 64 were considered valid for further analysis. Data analysis uses the SEM-PLS technique with SmartPLS software version 3.0. This study assesses the extent to which the corporate apply IT and adopt the green supply chain management in improving the supply chain performance. The results of this study indicate that the use of IT applications influences supply chain performance. The IT application affects the green supply chain management. Green supply chain management affects the supply chain management. One of the interesting findings is that the IT application indirectly affects supply chain performance through green supply chain management. The findings of this study provide an insight for the manager on how to improve supply chain management. This research also contributes to the on-going research in the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Toyota is one of the world's leading companies in many aspects of successful business practice, particularly in logistics. The techniques developed in the company since the 1950s provide a competitive advantage to Toyota and provide efficiency in many business functions with supply chain management. For that reason, it is imperative to understand how lean logistics practices are applied in the Toyota Boshoku Turkey(TBT). This chapter examines practical logistics applications in TBT, one of the suppliers of Toyota located outside of Japan. In addition to theoretical research, it is also important that practical applications in enterprises such as a Toyota plant contribute to the literature. Consequently, as a case study, discussion and explanation of logistics and supply chains of TBT will spark reader interest. </jats:p>"

Operations in these IBLCs aim to achieve economies of scale through integration of resources and business lines, while creating technical and environmental advantages for firms and societies. The experience from one agro-industry case study in Spain (fodder production) highlights the importance of leadership roles to manage the newly created supply chains, through the identification of strategic objectives and the coordination of operational activities. Hence, the scope of this chapter is to review the concept of IBLCs under the lens of supply chain management leadership. Thereafter, it will discuss the potential to transfer the IBLC concept to emerging markets, with examples for African agricultural crops.</jats:p>"

Several management options were selected for the case of the public water supply of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. The major management actions for improving drinking water safety are (1) land-use limitations within the drinking water protection areas and (2) drinking water treatment. Trends in groundwater level are decreasing, above all in the area of well fields; therefore, artificial recharge and setting up a new independent well field were also considered. The management actions were evaluated according to several criteria, such as water supply risk reduction for the various users (drinking, agricultural, and industrial) and realization of the actions (cost, flexibility, and leg time). For management options, the ranking “Fuzzy Decimaker” tool was applied, which is based on a Multiple Criterion Decision Making (MCDM) technique. Ranking of management actions has shown that all management actions are good as they are clustering in the corner close to the ideal value. For a particular well field, farming limitations in the drinking water protection areas are the best and water treatment is the worst management action, which is due to high costs, low flexibility, and longer lag time.</jats:p>"

The authors discuss methods that have been applied historically and how those have shown vast variation in menstrual cycle characteristics around the globe. They then review and explore how innovation in technologies can be used to detect and disseminate new menstrual cycle knowledge. Additionally, the authors show how interdisciplinary efforts across anthropology, public health, and data science can leverage the advances in mobile menstrual tracking and hormone measurement to better characterize the menstrual cycle at the population level. This analysis concludes with a breakdown of how personalized menstrual norms and predictions can help individuals to be better stewards of their own menstrual health.</jats:p>"

Using a structured search strategy, articles that investigate young girls’ preparedness for menarche, knowledge of menstruation, and practices surrounding menstrual hygiene in LMIC were identified. A total of 81 studies published in peer-reviewed journals between the years 2000 and 2015 that describe the experiences of adolescent girls from 25 different countries were included. Adolescent girls in LMIC are often uninformed and unprepared for menarche. Information is primarily obtained from mothers and other female family members who are not necessarily well equipped to fill gaps in girls’ knowledge. Exclusion and shame lead to misconceptions and unhygienic practices during menstruation. Rather than seek medical consultation, girls tend to miss school, self-medicate, and refrain from social interaction. Also problematic is that relatives and teachers are often not prepared to respond to the needs of girls. LMIC must recognize that lack of preparation, knowledge, and poor practices surrounding menstruation are key impediments not only to girls’ education, but also to self-confidence and personal development. In addition to investment in private latrines with clean water for girls in both schools and communities, countries must consider how to improve the provision of knowledge and understanding and how to better respond to the needs of adolescent girls.</jats:p>"

The capability of the supply chain to adapt to all, more and more demanding conditions is one of the main factors that guarantee long-term competitiveness and success. R. Kalakota, M. Robinson and P. Gundepudi consider inventory visibility, fulfilment velocity and coordination versatility as three fundamental pillars of adaptive supply chains, also termed as 3V in the literature. The chief objective of this paper is the identification of features that a supply chain should have in order to be called adaptive, as well as the verification of their compliance with the 3V principle. The review of the available literature sources that focus on the subject of the major features of adaptive supply chains (in particular having a decisive effect on their adaptive capabilities) has resulted in certain common elements. The authors of all the described approaches emphasise the two features: visibility and velocity. The third, frequently indicated, feature is also versatility or variety (that can be treated as one of the elements of the versatility of the supply chain). Visibility involves ensuring access to the information for all participants in the supply chain, also customers. Velocity, in turn, refers to the reaction time of the supply chain to all sorts of events and the time of implementing necessary changes. The third element is versatility. It primarily involves balancing the operational capability of a supply chain with market requirements, in particular delivering suitable products and services of the required quality and in the ordered volume. It is also vital to adjust the offer to the individual needs of customers.</jats:p>"

The results obtained from structural equation modeling indicate that ICT are decisive for operational alignment of actors in the supply chain, also vital to support the innovation process as a key element in the construction of set capabilities to establish improvements at the products and services. Furthermore, SCM mediates the relationship between ICT and Innovation, substantially relevant to business performance.

While there are some chains that have low frequencies of unfavorable events, many continuously face uncertainty. Food production has many uncertainties along the global supply chain. The global nature of the large logistical networks increases its complexity. Two main sources of uncertainty arise: External and internal to the SC. External factors mainly come from nature (such as “El Niño” phenomenon) and from human activities (such as food and nutrition policy and standards). Internal factors mainly come from operations such as a cold chain disruption. Thus, one needs to minimize risk and improve resilience in order to achieve food security and sustainability. It is then imperative that risk management practices be integrated into the supply chain design and management process. This chapter presents an overview of the main risks involved in global food supply chains, as well as some techniques for risk management. </jats:p>"

Theoretical perspectives used in sustainable supply chain literature are presented, focusing on procurement management and the three dimensions of sustainability. The chapter discusses current procurement practices as a source of competitive advantage. It also highlights techniques, tools, and methodologies from research case studies, and presents sustainable procurement practices as a driver of performance improvement. Finally, this chapter provides further research directions and confirms sustainable procurement as a key process to performance enhancement in supply chain management, and as a source for global business improvement and competitive advantage achievement. </jats:p>"

They demonstrate how migrant and refugee women variably adopted, adapted, and questioned cultural practices and how this impacted their engagement with their daughters, showing women’s negotiation or navigation of differing cultural contexts following migration.

Skills dedicated years ago to a narrow group of specialists are now available to millions of people around the world. Nowadays, we can deal with more and more issues using only the electronic way, whether we are willing to use this solution. In logistics, we can specify many technologies that can help to increase company efficiency and to build a competitive advantage.

Through a systematic literature review, the notable business model innovations in the food industry are identified, surveyed, and evaluated. Findings reveal that the innovations in value proposition, value creation processes, and value delivery processes of business models are the successful strategies proposed in food industry. It is further disclosed that rural female entrepreneurs, social movements, and also urban conditions are the most important driving forces causing farmers to reconsider their business models. In addition, the new technologies and environmental factors are the secondary contributors in business model innovation for the food processors. It is concluded that digitalization has disruptively changed the food distributor models. E-commerce models and Internet-of-Things are reported as the essential factors causing retailers to innovate their business models. Furthermore, consumption demand and product quality are two main factors affecting the business models of all the firms operating in the food supply chain regardless of their positions in the chain. The findings of the current study provide an insight into the food industry to design a sustainable business model to bridge the gap between food supply and food demand.</jats:p>"

They look back at country missions and the many conversations with women and girls that led to a closer examination of how stigma around menstruation limits access to education, work, and a life in dignity. WASH provides a strong entry point for addressing taboos relating to menstruation, but the authors identify that one must get past this often technical understanding to address deeply entrenched gender stereotypes.</jats:p>"

Rantai Pasokan (Supply Chain)  mencakup semua kegiatan yang terkait dengan aliran dan transformasi barang dan jasa dari tahap bahan baku (raw materials) ke pengguna akhir (pelanggan). Sedangkan Value chain adalah rantai nilai yang  yang digunakan untuk mengetahui kondisi internal perusahaan. Pelumas dan Pelumas (lubricant) adalah zat kimia, yang umumnya cairan, yang sangat diperlukan untuk semua bagian mesin yang bergerak di antara dua benda atau lebih untuk mengurangi gaya gesek, agar bagian yang sangat penting dapat berfungsi dengan baik dan tahan lama. Metode analisis yang digunakan adalah  supply chain management.dan value chain analisis. Adapun hasil penelitian ini adalah diketahui Suplai Chain Management Pelumas terdiri dari dua macam suplly chain, yakni: Suplly  Chain pelumas produk lokal 60% dan Suplly Chain pelumas import 40%. Untuk .bahan baku base oil sebagian bersumber dari local dan sebagian import sedangkan bahan baku additive bersumber dari import. Diketahui kondisi aktivitas pokok industri pelumas untuk tiga perusahaan yang diobservasi value chain, yakni PT.Pertamina Lubricants, PT. Idemitsu Lube Techno Indonesia dan  PT. Federal Karyatama dengan Inbound Logistic: Tiga perusahaan yang diteliti masih menggunakan metoda metoda yang sudah baik dengan menggunakan salah satu sistem otomatis (automated warehouse) atau  menggunakan informasi teknologi (IT). Operations: dua perusahaan sudah menggunakan mesin sebagian telah dikendaliakan dengan komputer (otomatis) dan sebagain semi otomatis. dan satu perusahaan menggunakan mesin semi otomatis Outbound Logistics, Tiga perusahaan yang diteliti aktivitas proses penyaluran produksi digudang telah melalui jalur distribusi dengan baik sehingga berjalan dengan cepat. Usulan perbaikan untuk Inbound Logistic:dapat ditingkatkan dengan menerapkan otomatis (automated warehouse) dan sistem just-in-time (JIT). Usulan perbaikan untuk Operations: dapat ditingkatkan dengan menggunakan mesin semi otomatis atau menggunakan otomatisasi penuh (mesin-mesin dikendalikan komputer, hingga kerja mesin lebih cepat, lebih akurat, dan lebih fleksibel). Usulan perbaikan untuk Outbound Logistics, dapat ditingkatkan dengan menggunakan proses order yang otomatis (automated order processing) menggunakan jaringan IT melalui jalur distribusi yang sudah ada.</jats:p>"

The primary motivation for doing so is to enable interoperability among different IT systems in logistics, all with their own database scheme. We first analyze different standards for logistics interoperability, which are implemented by XML schema definition (XSD) or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with implicit and inconsistent semantics across these open standards. To analyze the applicability of ontology alignment, we create two ontologies from two well-known standards that are rich in terms of semantic relations between entities. These ontologies are subjected to the state-of-the-art alignment systems, applying matching with and without logistics background knowledge. Our experimental analyses show that the alignment using background knowledge with some annotations finds better mappings between the given logistics standards and is thus applicable to real-world situations under particular conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The automotive industry is truly a global industry. Manufacturing plant of the company is set up in one corner of the earth, sourcing the automobile parts from many companies located all over the globes, and selling the final product in another country. This leads to complex supply chain. Production strategies like just-in-time (JIT) and just-in-sequence (JIS) creates testing times but presents opportunities for the logistics management. But currently, the industry is going through a rough phase. Manufacturing costs are increasing, rise in fuel prices is having its own affect on the industry, competitive landscape is changing, and globalization presents new political and economic challenges. Currently, the company needs to manage its supply chains efficiently, reduce cost and improve the accuracy of processes delivery. Today, the automobile industry is facing significant other challenges due to complex logistics. Logistics is about co-coordinating various activities like materials handling, storage, inventory management, freight transport and the related information flow and processing in a way that meets customer requirements at minimum cost. This paper will talk about the current challenges, opportunities, growth drivers and future strategies of the companies' logistics management. It will also cover how companies are adapting to the changing economic environment. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of secondary data. The challenges and opportunities for the companies exist from the current operations management and risks of globalization. Authors have looked at the challenges and opportunities in detail in this chapter. Improving the organization's performance and securing competitive advantage over others greatly depends on the supply chain management as it is seen that the competition is no longer between the organizations, rather they are amongst supply chains. From the research, it has been found that companies believe that for sustainable transportation and logistics, green supply chain is a must for long term sustainability of the company. Companies finds export compliance to the emerging markets as another major challenge. Transport and warehouse systems are, more or less, stabilized and companies are looking to get most out of them. Though there is connectivity between automobile companies and its suppliers but information is not available real time and hence it's difficult to collaborate. Visibility into logistics has come out as the biggest need for the companies. </jats:p>"

Çalışmada Türkiye genelinde işsiz bireylerle yüz yüze gerçekleştirilen anket çalışması ile elde edilen veriler kullanılmıştır. İstatistiksel olarak oluşturulan 12 bölgenin her birinde, bölgeyi temsil edebilecek en az bir ilde, anket gerçekleştirilmiştir. Her bölgedeki erkek ve kadın işsiz sayısına oranlanarak anket sayısı belirlenmiştir. Böylece toplam 2162 işsiz bireye ulaşılmıştır. Anket çalışması işsizlerle işverenlerin bağlantı kurması için kurulmuş olan Türkiye İş Kurumunda gerçekleştirilmiştir. Sıralı Probit yöntemi sonuçlarına göre; yaşlı bireyler, kadınlar, evli erkekler, fiziksel engeli olanlar, eğitim düzeyi yüksek olanlar daha düşük çalışma süresini arzu etmektedirler. Beklenen ücretteki artış, ücret dışı gelirdeki artış, küçük çocuk sahibi olma ve ailede bakıma muhtaç bireyin bulunması ise daha fazla emek arz etme isteği oluşturmaktadır. Cinsiyet, eğitim durumu, fiziksel engel ve yaşa göre farklı çalışma saatleri sunulması gerekliliği tespit edilmiştir. İşsizlik süresindeki artışın kadınları emek piyasasından uzaklaştırdığı belirlenmiştir. Devletin bakıma muhtaç bireylere bakım hizmeti vermesinin emek arzı isteğine olumlu etkisi olduğu görülmüştür.</jats:p>"

For efficient management of trickle irrigation moisture distribution plays an important role. The degree of soil wetted volume in an irrigation system determines the amount of water required to wet the root zone. This article helps in understanding moisture distribution for different lateral spacing, emitter spacing, emitter discharge rates and drip line installation depth for trickle irrigation under various soil conditions all over the world. This review reveals that soil moisture distribution and uniformity within the soil profile were affected by the distance between emitters rather than the distance between drip lines. In drip irrigation systems, the less the dripper spacing, the greater the moisture distribution as well as water use efficiency and crop yield. The radial spread of moisture was greater at lower water application rates, whereas the vertical spread was greater at higher water application rates. The vertical movement of soil moisture was greater than the horizontal movement under surface as well as subsurface drip irrigation systems. Deeper drip tape installations had a potential risk of not providing moisture to shallow rooted crops.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An enterprise carrying out operations according to the sustainable development (SD) concept should maximize its business goals without affecting interest groups. It requires not only a rethinking, but also a partial allocation of profit to social goals—used to contribute to and create a positive image of the enterprise and improve its competitiveness—over the long-term. Operations should result in an increase in profit—indirectly—by way of demand. This paper explores the sustainable supply chain (SSC) concept and the interplay of corporate social responsibility (CSR) within business objectives. The concept of SSC-compliant CSR is primarily stressed as an executive, top-down centric role. Businesses and societies at large that foster an SD continuum are considered healthy economies. The SD of enterprises and CSR in business are explored in relation to social investment and considered a viable long-term strategy for doing business. A pilot case study of Poland is carried out as a value analysis of the SSCs of enterprises. The key findings illustrate the benefits and problems of SSCs applied at the enterprise level. The problems of applying the principles of SSC within the enterprise and the connection between its levels of strategy and social value in terms of CSR and entrepreneurial operations are examined. Comparative studies indicate a number of overlapping trends in which positive SSC is cross-functional toward business partners, suppliers, customers, investors, and local communities.</jats:p>"

It is established that the strategies of vertical integration in the process of interaction with suppliers are based on the acquisition of suppliers' business in order to enter new markets and develop new areas of activity. Strategies of strategic partnership are to develop strategic forms of interaction with suppliers of goods and services (outsourcing, strategic alliances, alliances, etc.) in order to minimize the overall costs of the logistics system and the highest quality satisfaction of end users. Cost minimization strategies are based on procurement management from the standpoint of minimizing the cost of purchasing goods, ie here the main point when choosing a source of supply is the lowest price with the most complete range of related services. Logistics, in our opinion, in modern society is a means of achieving strategic goals of enterprises through the coordination of flow processes and cross-functional integration. In turn, many scientists divide logistics into two main types: basic and innovative. The most important component of innovation logistics is strategic, which is the science and practice of building the logistics potential of various flow control systems by developing long-term programs of innovative transformations within the outlined paradigm of their strategic development. In the case of implementation of supply strategies, the goals of the logistics strategy will be achieved by solving a set of tasks to strengthen cross-functional and inter-organizational integration and (or) coordination by: introduction of a logistics information system, without which it is impossible to implement strategies of the supply process; cost optimization at all stages of the promotion of flow processes; raising the levels of customer service quality indicators.</jats:p>"

Akan tetapi, supply chain perusahaan mengalami permasalahan pada produk resin acryic yang berkaitan dengan meningkatnya jumlah Costumer Complaint pada tahun 2019. Peningkatan jumlah tersebut mungkin diakibatkan oleh beberapa faktor, diantaranya spesifikasi dan jumlah produk yang tidak sesuai sampai keterlambatan pengiriman. Maka dibuatlah penelitian untuk mengukur kinerja perusahaan dengan metode Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR). Dari pengukuran tersebut didapatkan hasil kinerja yang akan mengarahkan perusahaan dan memberikan keuntungan, baik itu untuk perusahaan itu sendiri, supplier maupun konsumen. Dari hasil pengukuran performansi supply chain PT. XYZ maka dapat diketahui bahwa nilai performansi supply chain di PT. XYZ pada bulan April 2018 sampai Maret 2019 dikategorikan baik karena nilai rata-rata performansi yang dihasilkan adalah 80,88 (baik).

      "abstract": "<p>Indonesia has enormous water resources potential up to 75,000 MW and currently uses as a national power plant that reached 11.56% of the total potential, or equal to 8,671 MW. Indonesia's electrification ratio in 2017 reached 88.5%, which means there are 11.5% of households in Indonesia who have not had access to electricity. Micro Hydro Power Plant (MHPP) is one alternative solution that can produce electricity and has been widely used, particularly in rural areas in Indonesia. The role of electricity in people’s lives has encouraged the authors to study of Kali Maron MHPP community based on the fact that it currently still operates and can determine the impact of electricity from MHPP for people's lives. This research used a qualitative method with descriptive analysis. The data collected by observation and interview. Observations were made on Kali Maron MHPP and the life of the community users of Kali Maron MHPP. While the interviews were conducted with 20 household electric users of Kali Maron MHPP, each respondent is a husband or a wife and also manager of Kali Maron MHPP.

In order to meet DSC (Digital Supply Chain) expectations, two areas are examined in detail during the literature review. Firstly, the current SCM models are studied. Secondly, Industry 4.0 requirements had to be surveyed. As a consequence, challenges and gaps are identified for which we seek the solution during our research. Based on the results, it can be stated that digitization has definitely required an improved technological solution that IoT frameworks can provide. The result is a technology-driven, IoT-based SCM development methodology that serves as a basis for the design of such platforms, which will manage supply chains. To prove the feasibility of the proposed development methodology, the Arrowhead industrial IoT framework is used for validation.</jats:p>"

Hospitals and other healthcare providers have been hit particularly hard. While efforts to effectively treat and eradicate the coronavirus continue, so do the efforts of supply chains to support the provision of patient care in the event of a resurgence or future pandemic. Supply chain leaders must continuously evaluate their strategic and tactical positions to address critical supply needs. Whether the supply chain can meet expectations remains uncertain, given rolling supply shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical–surgical supplies as healthcare providers resume prepandemic levels of operations. The ability to ensure a reliable, sustainable supply of critical PPE in the near term will remain a challenge. Longer-term substantive changes to the function and performance of healthcare supply chains will be necessary across multiple areas to meet demand more effectively during a crisis.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>"

It is actualized that the problem of regional water use in the conditions of deepening of transformation of infrastructural maintenance needs to be solved on separate spheres of economic activity. In this regard, the following elements of the water infrastructure of the regions are proposed — water supply and sewerage facilities, reservoirs and main canals, hydraulic inter-farm facilities of reclamation systems. Forms and tools of development of water-efficient regional systems in the form of organizational and financial tools of modernization of infrastructural maintenance of regional water use are formulated.</jats:p>"

XYZ is a company that produces chemical active ingredients for agriculture and plantations. The problem experienced by the company is that the company began to develop not only environmentally friendly products but also environmentally friendly management and supply chains that will start with Guela products. After verification of the 18 proposed indicators, through the interview session 14 indicators were verified and could be used as KPIs. Weighting for each KPI is done using the AHP method. Furthermore, performance measurement or scoring is performed using the Green Supply Chain Operation Reference (GSCOR) method and evaluating using the traffic light system (TLS) method. Based on table 4.67 it can be seen that of the 14 KPIs, 3 KPIs are included in the yellow category, 1 KPIs are included in the red category and 10 KPIs are included in the green category. The total value of the measurement of the performance of the green supply chain at PT. XYZ obtained 72.64 (Good). From these figures it can be seen that the performance of the green supply chain at PT. XYZ is in green, which means that supply chain performance is good but corrective action needs to be taken to improve the performance of PT. XYZ.</jats:p>"

In economics, mobility is the ability of an individual or a group to improve their economic status in relation to income and wealth within their lifetime or between generations. In information systems and computer science, mobility is used for the concept of mobile computing, in which a computer is transported by a person during normal use. Logistics creates by the design of logistics networks the infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods. Electric mobility is one of today’s solutions from an engineering perspective to reduce the need of energy resources and environmental impact. Moreover, for urban planning, mobility is the crunch question about how to optimize the different needs for mobility and how to link different transportation systems. In this publication we collected the ideas of practitioners, researchers, and government officials regarding the different modes of mobility in a globalised world, focusing on both domestic and international issues.</jats:p>"

Yet, how are green supply chains dimensioned as a combination of activities and practices? What phases of the supply chain can be most easily improved by adopting a green philosophy? If a company has not yet adopted a green philosophy, what stages of its supply chain can be most likely improved? This article proposes an industry framework to index and benchmark green “environmentally sustainable” supply chains. We use 21 managers and senior executives across 12 firms to derive and validate the index variables and parameters. Data from our observations and interviews allow us to derive the Green Supply Chain Index (GSCI). The comprehensive GSCI creates a baseline on which companies can measure their green supply chain performance. This article serves as a starting point for benchmarking organizational GSC initiatives and their downstream effects on organizational performance addressing requisite incentives and penalties. The index can serve as rudimentary templates for research and practices as we seek to decipher various operational and performance aspects that distinguish between green-washing and greening while offering greater scrutiny into a rapidly changing and environmentally-conscious world.</jats:p>",

There is less agreement, however, regarding what constitutes quality instruction or what credentials an instructor should have in order to be considered a certified teacher. Low enrollment in teacher preparation programs combined with increasing teacher turnover rates have created a shortage of quality educators in districts across the country for high-need schools and subject areas. Educators, labor activists, and politicians have called for teacher compensation reform as a way to increase the teacher retention rate. This article summarizes research on the impact of individual and group incentive pay schemes on student achievement, reviews alternative financial incentives to retain exceptional educators, and evaluates policy proposals to improve teacher salaries from current and former 2020 presidential candidates.</jats:p>"

The analysis of the logistics market based on intermediation standards highlights the essential role of the logistics management function, and derives the key determinants of the logistics management outsourcing. It also provides elements that contribute to the understanding of future industry trends. This chapter logically identifies that the key principles of microeconomics are well applicable to the logistics. They even help better explain the emergence of the logistics management function. It demonstrates that those principles in the context of the new technologic edge could lead to a reintermediation, creating a restructuration of some segments of the market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world of logistics has also changed considerably thanks to globalization. The most important term of logistics is the supply chain (SC). With the advent of globalization, managing SC activities has become more complex. Supply chain management (SCM) is an integral part of most businesses and is essential to company success and customer satisfaction. Supply chains (SCs) represents the paths between suppliers and buyers (customers or consumers). The role of (SCs) is to ensure a product from inception all the way into a consumer´s hands. Marketing plays an increasingly important role in the process; it balances procurement by providing essential demand information and building the relationships that help improve the efficiency of SC operations. In order to reach as many markets as possible, these products must cross international borders. Without SCs, the products that suppliers produce would not efficiently get out into the world markets therefore are vital for markets all over the world. The aims of the paper are following: to define the concept of SC and SCM, to list what advantages arising from participation in global supply chain and finally, to refer the mistakes made by companies operating in international markets in SCM.</jats:p>"

The clinical data obtained from China revealed that out of the overall reported cases, 15% severe cases and 5% critically ill patients will require oxygen therapy. Moreover, it is essential to estimate the requirement of oxygen in the hospital and it can be done by using the essential supply forecast tool. In conclusion, in order to improve the treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to ensure the supply of high quality medical-grade oxygen to the severe and critically-ill group of patients.

Those providers are now very involved in the short-term “transient” logistics needed by large retailers to organize the supply chain for some of their promotional activities that only last few days, or NGO to organize efficient relief operations after a disaster. Hence, 4PL firms can be considered dynamic assemblers of logistical resources they capture from partners in order to satisfy clients. A major criterion required for a successful 4PL intermediation is trust, as key element of social capital, and this chapter discusses the importance of trust in the efficient operations of this transient or ad hoc relationship between the 4PL and the client.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Road transportation has been the dominant mode for inland freight transportation for decades. Rail and waterways transportation are less frequently used alternatives, but in general more attractive from an environmental perspective. Even though many policies promoting the use of intermodal transportation have been proposed, they have had little impact to trigger shippers to shift mode from road transportation to rail or inland waterways transportation. One main reason might be that the requirements of shippers towards transportation modes are still not well understood. Hence this research investigates freight transportation mode choice with a new approach, multi-criteria decision analysis, as well as from the perspectives of different types of industries and experts. Reviewing the literature, the requirements for transportation modes are abstracted into a set of criteria, including transportation cost, door-to-door travel time, on-time reliability, flexibility, frequency, and reduction of CO2 emissions. As the importance of these factors might be different for different industries, we consider four segments: the manufacturing industry, the agriculture industry, the perishable food industry, and the chemical industry. Data from practitioners, industry experts, and academics are collected via online questionnaires and analyzed using the ‘best worst method’ (BWM) to identify weights for the mentioned criteria. The results indicate that transportation cost is viewed as the most important, closely followed by on-time reliability, while reduction of CO2 emission is viewed as the least important. Several comparison studies are conducted to see any difference in the importance of these factors with respect to different industries or respondent groups.</jats:p>"

Because the utility of locations to build renewable energy power plants depends on economic, social and environmental dimensions, after reviewing literature, the sustainable frameworks of criteria affecting the location of biogas, solar and wind power plants were examined in this paper. The offered frameworks are applied to determining the site of biogas, solar, and wind power plants in Iran. The provinces of Iran are assessed as alternatives in this paper. To compute the weight of criteria in the offered framework, data from a sample of experts in Iran are used via an online survey form designed based on the best-worst method (BWM). Using the results of the BWM and the performance data, the overall score are calculated for the various provinces of Iran. The results of this study indicate that energy saving, effect on resources and natural reserves and wind flow, respectively, are the most effective factors for determining the place of biogas, solar and wind power plants, and South Khorasan, Khuzestan, and Khuzestan show the best result for establishing biogas, solar, and wind power plants in Iran respectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims at understanding whether and to what extent companies are facing the challenge of improving their supply chains according to a customer-driven approach. Although the most recent supply chain management literature developed theoretical reflections and conceptualizations on the need for customer centricity in supply chain management, companies' practice does not seem to follow these prescriptions and the empirical research highlighted a frequent misalignment between market strategy and supply chain management processes. The aim of this paper is to bridge these two perspectives by answering two research questions. First, how are companies revising their supply chains, that is, what is the nature of the most recent projects concerning supply chain improvements? Second, to what extent are companies that invest in such projects prioritizing those specific projects that make a concrete alignment between market orientation and supply chain operating conditions possible? The paper reports and discusses the findings of an empirical investigation conducted among leading Italian companies or Italian subsidiaries of multinational companies. In particular, a two-step research was conducted, consisting of ten indepth interviews and a survey. According to our study, Italian companies are revising their supply chains to provide prompt availability of the product in different (but coordinated) distribution channels. This led to the launch of projects related to Demand Forecasting and to Omnichannel strategy adoption. However, in most cases, the managerial and technological readiness of companies is not in line with the relevance of the challenges. Another area of improvement concerns projects aimed at adopting up-to-date technologies, mostly connected to the Industry 4.0 paradigm, to improve operational performance. In this case the major opportunities perceived by the companies relate to the adoption of Big Data Analytics in order to better understand market trends</jats:p>",

Thus, the role of creativity or insight in solving such problems has attracted a lot of attention from scholars. Therefore, this study investigated how an emerging methodology, Future Design (and its unique intervention of asking problem solvers to take a future generation’s perspective), can facilitate insight problem solving (IPS) and the generation of sustainable solutions. In a municipality in Japan, nine officers from a bureau responsible for water supply management participated in a series of seven Future Design workshops. In two groups, these officers created visions of water supply management 30 years into the future, taking the perspective of a future generation working in the same municipality. On the basis of in-depth transcription analyses of these workshops, we obtained a hypothetical framework demonstrating that four factors mediate the influence of perspective taking on IPS: (a) Discounting the present generation’s cost, (b) contrasting the future with the present, (c) deconstructing hierarchy, and (d) intellectual joy. While the first three mediators (a, b, and c) were considered to be contributors to the problem reframing and IPS via constraint relaxation, the fourth (d) was considered to do so via positive interpretation. Further, the reason why taking a future generation’s perspective is likely to lead to sustainable solutions, useful for the future—rather than the present—generation, is also discussed.</jats:p>"

The use of the principles of centralization and decentralization with the distribution of the main functions of the parent and subsidiary construction organizations is proposed. The improving mechanism for the material and technical supply system is consolidated according to principles of planning, organization, and control. The stages of a supply system integration into the building design are proposed during the implementation of the investment- construction project. The proposed mechanism allows you to plan the work of the supply system during the construction period, reduce the time frame for the implementation of the investment-construction project and obtain savings in financial resources.</jats:p>"

In the literature, analytical solutions are available for exponential and non-exponential models based on a set of restrictive physical and mathematical assumptions. The models search for a holistic and deductive solution without basic physical and practical interpretations, simple logical inferences leading to mathematical analytical or empirical formulations. In this paper, an inductive, logical, practical, and instead of holistic modeling, physically plausible piecewise solutions are proposed with detailed inferences and interpretations. In the proposed methodology, the discharge and hydraulic head records are decomposed first into a set of verbal classes and, subsequently, physical meaning for each class is explained leading to simple general but empirical models. For this purpose, Wakula and St. Marks River (Florida) hydrograph records are used for the general solution sinkhole discharge and hydraulic head variations. The solution methodology presented in this paper does not make any distinction between relatively small or large sinkhole heads. The calibration and verification of the methodology is shown with a comparison of the available record values to partial power models. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed methodology is reliable and can be applied to hydraulic head availability with discharge records in any part of the world for karstic aquifer domains.</jats:p>",

Most of this important greenhouse gas is often vented to the atmosphere during primary aeration and gas stripping processes at drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). However, limited information exists regarding emission and fate of methane at many groundwater-fed DWTPs. This study estimates emission of methane from 1,004 DWTPs in Denmark and includes data from 3,068 groundwater wells. The fate of methane and occurrence of methane oxidizing bacteria in DWTPs was examined, including the potential role in ammonia removal. Methane emission from Danish DWTPs was estimated to be 1.38–2.95 × 10−4 Tg CH4/y which corresponds to 0.05–0.11% of the national anthropogenic methane emission. Trace levels of methane remained in the drinking water after primary aeration and entered the sand filters as a potential microbial substrate. Methanotrophic bacteria and active methane oxidation was always detected in the sand filters at groundwater-fed DWTPs. Methanotrophic consortia isolated from DWTP sandfilters were inoculated into laboratory-scale sand filters and the activity confirmed that methanotrophic consortia can play a role in the removal of ammonia via assimilation and co-oxidation. This suggests a potential for facilitating the removal of inorganic constituents from drinking water using methane as a co-substrate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The role of water resources at the present stage of human development becomes more and more significant every year and, actually, just the availability of water resources of required quality limits the further production force growth, city enlargement and the improvement of living standards and industry and agriculture development. The water supply deficit reduction and the water supply level increase are some of the priority national objectives, which are also related to the international obligations of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The prospects for fresh groundwater supply under anthropogenic impact conditions are given in the article for the water-stressed region as exemplified by Nur-Sultan city. Currently, the centralized water supply of Nur-Sultan city is provided by supplying water from the Vyacheslav Water Reservoir on the Esil River, which under the existing population size, does not satisfy completely the city’s water demand. The problem of utility and drinking water supply in the capital becomes more acute due to the growth population and its economic activity and, increased impact on natural components and geosystems. As a result of consolidation and analysis of the information on the anthropogenic impact as the most significant factor of change in the groundwater formation conditions, the article shows it's the negative impact on the fresh groundwater resource quantity and quality. It is noted that the main groundwater pollutants in the research area are the sewage ponds, domestic and industrial waste deposits of Nur-Sultan city, as well as the livestock breeding complexes, filtration fields and ash-disposal areas. According to the monitoring results, the areas of groundwater pollution have been identified in the zone of individual deposit influence. Various methods of geophysical and geochemical surveys, as well as the Earth remote sensing methods are used to identify large pollution areolas and prospective areas for groundwater exploration</jats:p>"

The aim of the paper is to compare trends in supply and demand. In the field of supply, we focused on the view of tourism business. Within the institutional support project Tourism Trends in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the impact of globalization on trends, both on the demand side and on the supply side, was analysed. Following methods were used: analysis, comparison, interview, questionnaire survey. The research revealed that most of the customers are affected by globalization, about half of the customers use the Internet to select and purchase travel agency services, one fifth use discount portals. Customers have also focused most on the following holiday trends: finding new experiences, active and adventurous trips, discovering unique places, gastronomic tourism, sightseeing and cycling. Based on the comparison of trends from the perspective of customers, travel agencies and the description of trends from the Tourism Management Strategy in the MSR 2017, it was found that traditional tourism, urban, cognitive and creative tourism, rural tourism, spa tourism are considered dominant, along with growing interest in gastronomic tourism, extreme experiences and adventure tours.</jats:p>"

Considerable feedstocks for electricity generation are process-based residues. Ukraine is the world leader in sunflower seed production, therefore, husk (a by-product of oil production) is a promising biofuel for combustion- based power plants. The plants consume primarily electricity and fossil fuels (natural gas or fuel oil) for steam production. Their usage affects the edible oil production cost and impacts on climate change. The above facts force us to look for alternatives. By-product (husk) utilization can reduce exhaustible energy consumption (fossil fuels and grid electricity) and mitigate climate change. The aim of the study is to make an energy and ecological assessment of biomass energy supply systems. Specifically, the electricity and heat consumption of Ukrainian sunflower oil mills is investigated. Different options of cogeneration systems are analyzed. The preferable mode of combustion-based husk combined heat and power plants is to meet their own heat demand and to sell surplus electricity. Relative gross income and carbon dioxide emission reductions are calculated. Our results show that husk utilization can meet electricity and heat requirements of edible plants. The surplus electricity may be sold to the grid. Husk combined heat and power plants may result in reduction of carbon dioxide by 200–300% and an increase of total income by 24.7–65.7% (compared to conventional energy supply systems).</jats:p>"

Aeolian sandy soils cover &amp;gt;90% of the sandy area of the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) in Northwest China. These soils have low water- and nutrient-retention capacity, limiting their ability to support plant growth. Pisha sandstone, a type of loose rock widely distributed in the MUSL, is regarded as an environmental hazard because it easily weathers, resulting in severe soil erosion and water loss. However, the retention capacity of the aeolian sandy soil can be significantly improved through blending with Pisha sandstone. We investigated the impacts of water supply (35% and 70% of soil water-holding capacity) and P supply (0, 5 and 20 mg P kg–1 soil) on plant growth and P and nitrogen (N) nutrition by growing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in MUSL aeolian sandy soil amended or not with Pisha sandstone. Soil type and P supply had greater effects than water supply on lucerne growth and on P and N nutrition. Biomass accumulation and shoot P and N concentrations were increased by amending the aeolian sandy soil with Pisha sandstone and increasing P supply. The N:P ratios in shoots indicated that plant growth was limited by P but not by N. Aeolian sandy soil amended with Pisha sandstone and supplied with P at 5 mg kg–1 enhanced lucerne growth; this practice is feasible for pasture development in the MUSL.\n</jats:p>"

The morphological studies of the pharynx entailed the collection of twenty-four heads together with first two cervical vertebrae from apparently healthy adult goats of both sexes from the Giza governorate. The results showed that the pharynx in goat was an irregular funnel shaped structure. It extended from the caudal end of the horizontal lamina of the palatine bone, extended caudoventrally up to the level of the caudal border of the wing of atlas. The pharyngeal fornix was smooth and concave and divided by the septum pharyngis into two deep narrow cavities. The pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube was crescent shaped slit situated at the caudodorsal part of the lateral wall of the nasopharynx. It was covered medially by a thin mucosal fold (salpingo-pharyngeal fold, contained hyaline cartilage in lamina propria). Both the Tonsilla pharyngea and the Tonsilla tubaria observed only microscopically. The oropharynx was short, wide and dilatable. The palatine tonsil was located on the caudal third of the lateral wall of the oropharynx. The pharynx of the goat received its arterial blood supply via the ascending pharyngeal, ascending palatine arteries, and the pharyngeal branches of the cranial thyroid, cranial laryngeal and Rr. musculares of the lingual artery. The soft palate is vascularized through lesser palatine artery, in addition to the branches of the pterygoid artery of the maxillary artery. The results obtained were discussed with the available literature in different animals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nRystad Energy has conducted a well level supply side study for the Australian east coast gas market, quantifying the widely expected supply shortfall and its timing. This paper presents these findings, along with an economic and technical evaluation of new sources of supply relief and their potential impacts on the market balance. The study suggests the east coast has adequate gas supply to meet demand until 2024, with an average excess of 73 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per annum over this period. However, in 2025 the market will shift to under-supply, starting at 93 Bcf in 2025 and increasing to over half a trillion cubic feet by 2030. Sufficient supply in the short term does not warrant complacency. With the average duration between discovery and first gas for the region being 7.1 years since 1990, even if new (traditional) supply is discovered in 2020, the market will still be undersupplied for at least 3 years. We have identified the four most likely sources of supply relief for the market, each with their own merits, difficulties and development timelines. These new sources include the Beetaloo Sub-basin shales of the Northern Territory, undeveloped coal seam gas acreage, electrifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities to preserve in-field usage, and finally, LNG importation. A combination of at least two of these sources is required to balance the east coast gas market to 2030. Of the options, LNG importation is the most viable to stave off undersupply in the medium term (3 to 7 years). While Beetaloo Sub-basin shale gas appears the most viable option for secure, long-term supply relief.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's (FCDO's) Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness (CASA) programme is working to increase economic opportunities for smallholders to step up and trade in growing commercial markets. The aim is to increase investment in agribusinesses that source from smallholder farmers, and to provide evidence-based guidance for creating synergistic relationships between agribusinesses and smallholders in ways that promote smallholders' productivity and commercial potential. This study is motivated by an apparent contradiction: suppliers of capital report a lack of investible opportunities in Africa, while demanders of capital cannot find willing partners to provide capital to them. In spite of significant amounts of private capital being available for investment worldwide (World Economic Forum, 2013; Vitón, 2018), institutional and impact investors have found it difficult to mobilize large amounts of private investment for agribusiness opportunities in Africa. This study identifies strategies for development and impact investment actors to bridge the gap between the risk-reward demands (or adjusted risk returns) of investment capital and the available supply of agribusinesses for investment. The study assesses whether what is needed is different forms of capital, or greater work to provide the pre-conditions for private investment in agri-food systems, or both of these. The resulting analysis addresses the needs and interests of both investors and investment support stakeholders.</jats:p>"

This topic fits in the most current trends in the research on European prehistoric archaeology. Given the lack of written sources, copper and bronze artifacts discovered in settlement and cemetery excavations and prehistoric mining sites provide the primary sources on which the studies in question are based. The aim of compositional and isotope analysis of copper and tin ores, metal tools, ornaments, and weapons is to determine the provenience of the raw materials and further an understanding of the chaine operatiore of prehistoric metal production. The Momentum Mobility Research Group of the Institute of Archaeology, Research Centre for the Humanities studies these metal artifacts using archaeological and scientific methods. It has focused on the first thousand years of the Bronze Age (2500–1500 BC). Multidisciplinary research include non-destructive XRF, PGAA (promptgamma activation), TOF-ND (time-of-flight neutron diffraction) analyses and neutron radiography, as well as destructive methods, e.g. metal sampling for compositional and lead isotope testing, alongside archaeological analysis. Microstructure studies are also efficient methods for determining the raw material and production techniques. The results suggest the use of regional ore sources and interregional connections, as well as several transformations in the exchange network of the prehistoric communities living in the Carpathian Basin.</jats:p>"

Since the supply of CRA is segmental, Our aim is to analyze the location of CRA) with non center-involving and center-involving diabetic macular edema (DME) and to evaluate the supply of CRA with segments of macular edema based on Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Design Retrospective study Methods and Materials A retrospective study in which forty-three patients at various stages of diabetic retinopathy with the presence of CRA were identified. Presence and location of CRA was recognized using fundus fluorescein angiography. Diabetic retinopathy was graded based on ETDRS classification using OCT. Results Evaluation of 26 men and 17 women of various groups of diabetic retinopathy revealed unilateral CRA in 40 subjects and bilateral CRA in 3 subjects. When CRA supplied the central area, maximum retinal thickness was noted at the temporal quadrant (271.67±164.02 μm) and had noncenter-involving DME (194.87±121.06 μm), when CRA supplied the lower area, maximum retinal thickness was noted at the superior quadrant (293.64±159.36 μm) and had center-involving DME (395±285.75 μm), and when it supplied the upper area, maximum retinal thickness was noted at the nasal quadrant (293.49±176.18μm) with center-involving DME (292±192.79 μm). Conclusion The presence of CRA seems to alter the morphology and influences the segment involved in DME. However, further studies with larger sample size are warranted to prove this association.</jats:p>"

The approach of using critical control in supply chains can provide insights for nutritional improvement, sustainable food trade and food waste reduction. The pressure points determine the provision of a secure and sustainable food system where the outcomes of reducing their criticality are identified in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and other international programmes. These seek to reduce climate change impact and improve public health provision. While policy makers are rightly focussed on these targets, the data analysis methods required to rank and associate resource flow pressure points with commercial food supply chains and nutritional goals remain untested. Here, we show how methodologies can identify where opportunities to tackle future criticality exist, and where they are currently being overlooked for food categories that have the greatest consumer and dietary protein demand. The analysis provides insights that identify where latent restrictions in resilience can occur, so that the future risk of food insecurity is reduced.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is without doubt that there are many overviews of mixed\n          methods research in supply chain management. However, there is\n          relatively little research and representation on the application of\n          robust methodological approaches and techniques that take into\n          account the dynamic nature of a multi‑embedded and specialised\n          medicine supply chain coordination (SCC) problem. In Uganda, the\n          distribution of artemisinin‑based combination therapies (ACTs)\n          involves a multi‑embedded supply chain that runs across the macro,\n          market, and micro levels of stakeholders. The multi‑embedded levels\n          have created a coordination challenge tied to stock‑outs and\n          unavailability of ACTs to the detriment of the patients. This study\n          aimed to: 1) demonstrate how a mixed methods approach facilitated a\n          better understanding of a multi‑embedded and specialised supply\n          chain coordination problem, and 2) reveal the major factors for\n          coordinating a multi‑embedded supply chain that can improve the\n          availability of ACTs in the general hospitals of Uganda. An\n          exploratory sequential mixed method approach was employed to\n          disentangle the problem. In the first phase, focus group discussions\n          were predominantly used to collect qualitative data, the findings of\n          which acted as the foundation for the quantitative survey\n          questionnaire. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to determine\n          and validate the market and macro supply chain dimensions that\n          emerged from the survey results. The results showed that the most\n          influential supply chain market environment dimensions that affect\n          the availability of ACTs include information sharing with external\n          stakeholders and supply chain interdependence. The results from the\n          macro‑environment showed that the socio‑cultural, economic,\n          technological, and legal dimensions influence the availability of\n          ACTs. The contribution of this paper advances the use of mixed\n          methods in deconstructing a complex embedded supply chain problem\n          with implications for supply chain academics and practitioners and\n          government bodies.</jats:p>"

The authors conducted an extensive search for academic publications on lean, agile, and leagile (hybrid) supply chains in context with automobile industries, published since year 1990 in reliable repositories such as Google Scholar, Scopus and ResearchGate. None of these papers used bibliometric analysis on the topic. This paper systematically maps, publications on lean, agile, and legal strategies in automobile industry published during 1990–2017. A five-step process is followed, namely (i) defining appropriate search terms, (ii) initial search results, (iii) refinement of search results, (iv) initial data, statistics, and (v) data analysis; adopted for inclusion of relevant documents for publication and citation analysis. Selected documents include primary search term ‘automobile' along with associated secondary terms such as ‘lean', ‘agile', ‘lean and agile', and ‘leagile' as part of the title, abstract, or keywords. The analysis finds several documents on lean or agile strategies, but only one document exists on ‘leagile' paradigm. Maximum articles are contributed on engineering subjects followed by business, management and accounting and computer sciences. Large publication and high citation counts were observed for lean from United States and Chinese authors, whereas Indian authors contributed in agile studies. This article identifies areas of current research interests discussing crucial contributions by several authors' and provides potential directions for further research investigations in the field. </jats:p>"

Thanks to these technologies, as well as to their subsystems and components, full integration of the supply chain is becoming possible. However, it is observed that the real impacts of Industry 4.0 technologies, rather positive or negative, are not yet totally clear and identified. This paper aims to identify and present an analysis of the challenges and obstacles that Industry 4.0 technologies may cause in the Supply Chain. For this, the most relevant papers on the topic were selected and analyzed through a systematic literature review. Twenty challenges grouped into four macrogroups were identified: (1) technical challenges, (2) financial, environmental and legal challenges, (3) technological challenges, and (4) sociocultural challenges. It should be noted that these challenges require greater attention and more in-depth studies on the part of the academy to support industry in order to mitigate them and thus allow better use of the available technological resources and optimize the performance of Supply Chain operations.</jats:p>"

The study, exploratory in nature, was divided into two phases, qualitative and quantitative. In the first phase, data from ten companies were collected, later processed by content analysis. In the second phase, there was a pre-test, with subsequent data collection from 125 national companies associated with technology, processed by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that SCM favors SM and that both SCM and SM benefit RBV, therefore increasing BP. However, SM does not influence BP positively. Thus, we concluded that, due to the competition in the supply chain, focal companies have adopted strategies to integrate and coordinate the processes of their sectors, such as production, purchase, sales, and logistics to meet the goals of business performance.</jats:p>"

Data was collected from Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals members using a 19-question web-based survey. Relative advantage that firms can achieve and the perceived benefits in improving product quality and information sharing along with better traceability in the supply chain were significant predictors of RFID adoption. Within the technological contexts, the visible obstacles of RFID adoption through quality of transmission and reliability, understanding of overly high investment costs, and importance of the privacy concerns were all significant. The IT readiness of a firm was also a significant predictor of RFID adoption in the organizational factor, however the size of an organization was not at all linked to the RFID adoption decisions. The results point to a number of important conclusions that are informative for various business and industries that might be contemplating to adopt RFID technology in their operations. </jats:p>"

According to (Koebel, Lang, &amp; Danielsen, 2004; Kolson, 2016; Myers &amp; Ryu, 2008; Shaver, 2017; Woo, 2016), the largest demographic, the millennials, prefer low- to mid-rise housing units that are in the walkable urban core areas. These areas have access to cultural activities, entertainment, restaurants, shopping and other amenities such as parks. The retiring baby boomers who are downsizing from their single-family suburban homes are also seeking the same. As suggested by Parolek (CNU. 2015).), the Missing Middle Housing types (MMH) are one possible solution to help meet the demand. However, the demand is greater than the supply (Koebel et al., 2004; Kolson, 2016; Myers &amp; Ryu, 2008; Shaver, 2017). This review discusses the factors that affect the supply of the MMH types. It reveals that although these housing types once existed in the urban core, attempts to reintroduce them in the area meet with opposition from several stakeholders. Additional factors which hurt the supply of MMH types include land use and zoning regulations, a lack of developer interest to develop these units, and a lack of developer financing (Glaeser et al, 2009, Doherty, 2017).</jats:p>"

Due to the increasingly more competition in this industry, a fast and reliably delivery is important to win customer satisfaction. Despite of the fact that many e-retailing companies are running virtual network by outsourcing logistics to third parties, there is also a trend for companies to establish their own logistics channels. In fact, self-owned logistics can be an effective approach of marketing and customer relationship development, and thus provide competitive advantage. This chapter focuses on how Chinese e-retailing companies compete through logistics management. It starts with an introduction of e-retailing and logistics management from practice and literature perspectives. Then, there are cases studies into successful Chinese re-retailing companies with a highlight on their logistics management models and customer satisfaction based on initial survey. Further discussion will address the critical issues of logistics management in e-retailing. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Highlights: Supply chain collaboration has been presented in recent decades as a solution to performance issues. However, collaborative supply chains are far from being a reality in the construction industry, especially in emerging countries. Rio de Janeiro, a state of Brazil, was used to investigate CSC (Construction Supply Chain) in an emerging country.Purpose: This article aims to evaluate the characteristics of CSC (Construction Supply Chain) collaboration and identify its critical elements. These elements were also compared in two groups of construction companies: small and medium/large construction companies, in order to verify whether size influences the degree of collaboration.Design / methodology / approach: This study used a combination of two methods: literature review and application of a survey to construction companies in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Data collection was performed from October 2018 to January 2019. The statistical analysis of the elements was performed using the software “R”, by Mann-Whitney U test.Findings: The survey revealed that the elements considered the most important for collaboration were: “joint planning and decision making”, “trust”, and “collaborative culture”. On the other hand, the element considered of minor importance for collaboration was “Information Sharing”. Comparison of the two groups of companies made it possible to conclude that there is a gap between the two groups of builders evaluated, and the medium/large builders were more prone to collaboration. Thus, the article suggests on which points effective collaboration in the CSC should be given attention.Research limitations / implications: This study was limited to researching collaboration in the CSC in construction companies located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.Originality / value: This article contributes to the literature on collaboration at CSC in Brazil and emerging countries, since there are few studies in this area for emerging countries.  </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plant polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, starch) are either direct (i.e. leaf starch) or indirect products of photosynthesis, and they belong to the most abundant organic compounds in nature. Although each of these polymers is made by a specific enzymatic machinery, frequently in different cell locations, details of their synthesis share certain common features. Thus, the production of these polysaccharides is preceded by the formation of nucleotide sugars catalyzed by fully reversible reactions of various enzymes, mostly pyrophosphorylases. These ‘buffering’ enzymes are, generally, quite active and operate close to equilibrium. The nucleotide sugars are then used as substrates for irreversible reactions of various polysaccharide-synthesizing glycosyltransferases (‘engine’ enzymes), e.g. plastidial starch synthases, or plasma membrane-bound cellulose synthase and callose synthase, or ER/Golgi-located variety of glycosyltransferases forming hemicellulose and pectin backbones. Alternatively, the irreversible step might also be provided by a carrier transporting a given immediate precursor across a membrane. Here, we argue that local equilibria, established within metabolic pathways and cycles resulting in polysaccharide production, bring stability to the system via the arrangement of a flexible supply of nucleotide sugars. This metabolic system is itself under control of adenylate kinase and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, which determine the availability of nucleotides (adenylates, uridylates, guanylates and cytidylates) and Mg2+, the latter serving as a feedback signal from the nucleotide metabolome. Under these conditions, the supply of nucleotide sugars to engine enzymes is stable and constant, and the metabolic process becomes optimized in its load and consumption, making the system steady and self-regulated.</jats:p>",

The classification of directions for evaluating the efficiency and productivity of water supply has been developed. A comprehensive system of indicators of water supply efficiency and productivity is proposed. It is shown that it is advisable to use a system of indicators of efficiency and productivity, which is developed taking into account the specifics of the value chain, to evaluate the company’s performance. This system of indicators reflects different aspects – resource, technological, financial and economic, consumer, etc. Based on the system of indicators of efficiency and productivity, it becomes possible to qualitatively analyze the balance and proportionality, quality, resource sufficiency and security, the level of manufacturability of the water supply process, as well as the degree of customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

This review investigates sustainable energy supply, applying a multi-sectoral approach from a residential site perspective, especially with focus on identifying crucial, plausible factors and their influence on the operation of the system. The traditionally separated mobility, heat, and electricity sectors are examined in more detail with regard to their decarbonization approaches. For every sector, available technologies, demand, and future perspectives are described. Furthermore, the benefits of cross-sectoral integration and technology coupling are examined, besides challenges to the electricity grid due to upcoming technologies, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Measures such as transport mode shift and improving building insulation can reduce the demand in their respective sector, although their impact remains uncertain. Moreover, flexibility measures such as Power to X or vehicle to grid couple the electricity sector to other sectors such as the mobility and heat sectors. Based on these findings, a morphological analysis is conducted. A morphological box is presented to summarize the major characteristics of the future residential energy system and investigate mutually incompatible pairs of factors. Lastly, the scenario space is further analyzed in terms of annual energy demand for a district.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain risk management has been well researched over the years. However, management of social risks in bioenergy supply chains has been studied less in contemporary research. The ability of bioenergy companies to identify, properly address, and communicate social sustainability has become crucial for many global producers. In order to meet current EU’s energy and climate targets, the development of sustainable bioenergy production is vital. However, over last decade, research of bioenergy production supply chains has indicated that upstream areas of global bioenergy production systems are vulnerable in terms of social sustainability risks. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate how the socially sustainable supply chain practices in bioenergy supply chains can help a production company manage social risks and resources-use related conflicts upstream of the supply chain. These practices can be applied in the process of negotiation between bioenergy producers, local authorities, and communities for creating win-win situations for all parties while planning new bioenergy production systems. This study pays special attention to social sustainability risks at the upstream of the supply chain in countries of raw material origin. Use of social sustainability practices intends to help identify, assess, and address social risks of supply chain activities for bioenergy companies. Moreover, such practices aim at supporting companies and their stakeholders in making right choices and preparing effective strategies ahead of time. We based our research on empirical evidence and offer solutions to multi-national bioenergy production companies on how to manage social risks, allowing them to make the right decisions and necessary adjustments before entering potential markets. Our findings show that even avoidance of market entrance can carry sustainability-related social risks for both the company and the local communities. We suggest that although the financial element plays an important role in decision-making, the no-go decision often means missed opportunities for local communities to improve their respective sustainability states.</jats:p>"

Various objectives like minimization of total operating costs, minimization of logistics &amp; transportation costs, maximization of revenue etc forms the necessary pre-requisites for effective and efficient strategies in supply chain practices. But these\nare conflicting objectives if total efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain performance is to be achieved. Adhering to one strategy does not ensure perceived/improved performance of the supply chain. Therefore, all of such conflicting\nobjectives are to be considered set wise to arrive at the total effectiveness of SCM practices. Supply chain optimization is the optimization using mathematical methods to ensure that the optimal operation of supply chains. Supply chain operations are optimized to minimize operating costs, minimization of inventories, minimization of operating expenses like inventory, transportation, manufacturing, distribution etc. and maximizing gross margin, maximization of revenue, maximization of return on investment. Supply chain operations are optimized to minimize operating costs, inventories, operating expenses like inventory, transportation, manufacturing, distribution, information sharing etc. and maximizing gross margin, revenue return on investment. These costs primarily vary from up-stream side to downstream\nside as the supply chain entities use customized information sharing facilities and technology. Supply chain optimization may include refinements at various stages of product lifecycle. Supply chain optimization problem is supply chain general problem, i.e. providing products and services to customers at the highest profit, but at the lowest\nprice possible. In this paper, multi-objective optimization of logistics and transportation costs, operating costs and revenue is carried out with the application of Non-Dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). These optimization results are used in decision making &amp; strategy formulation to develop a cost effective operation of supply\nchain.</jats:p>",

Supply Chain Council (SCC) developed Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. This paper presents a case-based action-research for a step-by-step implementation of SCOR model. The case company belongs to oil and gas sector in a developing country. As-Is model was developed and analyzed for gaps. Reasons were identified using company documents and semi-structured interviews. To-Be model was then developed along with recommendations keeping into account the challenges faced by companies operating in emerging markets. The step-by-step SCOR implementation was found to be effective. It is further found that adapting the SCOR model for developing countries is a time-intensive effort and adapting the best practices can be a better option. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern, sophisticated banking systems, in addition to endogenously creating money, banks have the ability to innovate and stretch constraints on their portfolio to potentially raise profits. They fulfill demand for credit according to their liquidity preference and expectations of profits. On the other hand, the monetary authority influences credit supply by changing the availability of liquid assets compared to other assets through monetary policy instruments. By managing liquidity in the reserves market, central banks modify the price of access to short-term liquidity – the interest rate – and, thereby, cause changes in the yield curve and transform banks’ propensity to expand credit. Even though determining credit supply is a difficult task since it depends on expectations and cannot be calculated in advance, this paper aims to determine a credit supply function for Brazil. Our empirical strategy was to estimate a dynamic panel data model on a large cross-section bank-level dataset from the Brazilian Central Bank using balance sheet information from the fifty largest banks operating in the country from 1999 to 2016. Credit outstanding was matched with time-varying indicators that were prepared using data from banks’ portfolios and then combined with macroeconomic variables. We use a Post-Keynesian framework to analyze the relation between credit supply and the balance sheet composition of banks. Our findings suggest that variations in banks’ liquidity preference which are reflected on their changes in flexibility and leverage indicators have a significant impact on credit supply in Brazil.JEL codes: E51, E52, E47</jats:p>"

In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to examine farms’ strategic adulteration behavior and the resulting EMA risk in farming supply chains. We study both “preemptive EMA,” in which farms engage in adulteration to decrease the likelihood of producing low-quality output, and “reactive EMA,” in which adulteration is done to increase the perceived quality of the output. We fully characterize the farms’ equilibrium adulteration behavior in both types of EMA and analyze how quality uncertainty, supply chain dispersion, traceability, and testing sensitivity (in detecting adulteration) jointly impact the equilibrium adulteration behavior. We determine when greater supply chain dispersion leads to a higher EMA risk and how this result depends on traceability and testing sensitivity. Furthermore, we caution that investing in quality without also enhancing testing capabilities may inadvertently increase EMA risk. Our results highlight the limitations of only relying on end-product inspection to deter EMA. We leverage our analyses to offer tangible insights that can help companies and regulators to more proactively address EMA risk in food products. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management. </jats:p>",

It is necessary to make the product and services more competitive. One of the factors determining the competitiveness of trade is how quickly and how economically the goods can be delivered. The competition in the logistics industry is continually growing, which forces participants to improve their efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs. In these conditions effective IT solutions are vital tools for logistics and the ability to manage the logistics processes in the business environment in the context of globalization is a factor of competitiveness. Within the framework of this paper, the existing business processes of cargo delivery were described. The study of the process of interaction of international supply chain participants made it possible to identify the ineffectiveness of existing processes to understand what can be replaced and corrected with the introduction of blockchain technology. The main reason of inefficiency is the low level of business processes digitalization. The cases of existing blockchain projects for the logistics industry were investigated.

The inbuilt features of this technology enrich trust through transparency and traceability within any transaction of data, goods, services, and financial resources. Notwithstanding initial doubts about this technology, lately government and large corporations have offered to adopt and enhance this technology in various fields of applications, from social and legal industries, and finance to design, maritime and port networks. In this paper, the authors review the current status of the Blockchain technology and some of its applications. The potential benefit of such a technology in port and maritime supply chain is then discussed, and a vision for the future Blockchain ready port and maritime supply chain are proposed. The importation of containerized vehicles is used as an example to demonstrate how such technology can be deployed in a global port industry. Finally, the requirements and challenges to adopt this technology in the future in relation to, port and maritime systems are discussed.</jats:p>"

One of the most common types of renewable energy is solar energy. In Ukraine today, the most promising direction of using solar energy is its direct transformation into low-potential thermal energy. To get electric power, solar radiation is the mere alternative to electric power generated from mined fuel, and without the pollution of air and water, or adverse consequences manifested in global warming. The disadvantage of this type of installation is the limitation of the duration of light time, as well as the effect of cloudiness. During the day, the number of solar radiation changes, to stabilize it is necessary to accumulate and accumulate it for further use, the technical implementation of stable operation of solar installation due to the use of terrestrial radiation and the accumulator of a specific part of solar energy is proposed. The purpose of the work is experimental studies to ensure the stable operation of the solar collector under cloudy conditions. The paper is aimed at the stabilization of the operation of the solar installation and to obtain additional heat after the Sun’s cloud cover. The use of a solar thermal collector is advisable in solar heating and hot water systems in conditions of alternating solar radiation. The results of physical modeling have proved the efficiency of the method of combining types of thermal radiation, due to the accumulation of energy it is possible to increase the quantitative index of solar energy in the conditions of cloudiness by 3 times\n\nKeywords: alternative energy, solar energy, solar collector, thermal energy, clouds, terrestrial radiation, ecology.</jats:p>"

We estimate reduced‐form and structural models derived from the reference‐dependent preference model of Koszegi and Rabin (2006) to test the income‐targeting hypothesis using data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS). We find evidence that supports the income‐targeting hypothesis, in both the reduced‐form and structural econometric models.

This paper investigates the implications of CSR upon a two-period manufacturer–retailer supply chain with cost learning effects which have been widely observed in different industries. Two scenarios are under consideration: the retailer exhibits CSR in one and the manufacturer does in the other. The analytical results demonstrate that compared with no CSR, the implementation of CSR generates higher pure profit for the entire chain. In contrast to the scenario where the manufacturer shows CSR, in the scenario where the retailer exhibits CSR, the manufacturer charges higher wholesale prices while the retailer charges lower retail prices, resulting in a higher chain-wide profit. Moreover, two-part tariff contracts are designed to coordinate the socially responsible supply chains. When coordinated, if the retailer exhibits CSR the wholesale prices are equal to the realized production cost which results from cost learning effects, while the wholesale prices are lower than the realized production cost if the manufacturer shows CSR. Interestingly, cost learning effects impair the pure profit of the coordinated supply chain when the effect of CSR is sufficiently high.</jats:p>",

Kabupaten Cianjur merupakan salah satu penghasil beras berkualitas tinggi, varietas beras yang paling terkenal adalah pandan wangi. Dinas Pertanian Tanaman Pangan dan Hortikultura Kabupaten Cianjur merupakan unsur pelaksana otonomi daerah dibidang pertanian tanaman pangan dan hortikultura, saat ini masih mengalami kesulitan untuk mengelola dan memberikan informasi yang berkaitan dengan distribusi beras pandan wangi. Permasalahan tersebut terjadi dikarenakan tidak adanya area komunikasi yang mewadahi untuk mendapatkan informasi antara pelaku bisnis atau dalam sistem Supply Chain Management (SCM) disebut sebagai anggota-anggota SCM yang ada pada ruang lingkup Dinas Pertanian Tanaman Pangan dan Hortikultura Kabupaten Cianjur, baik komunikasi yang secara langsung maupun tidak langsung. Penelitian ini menghasilkan rancangan arsitektur SCM untuk beras pandan wangi yang dipadukan dengan teknologi informasi agar dapat bersinergi untuk membangun sebuah sistem informasi yang efektif, efisien dan terintegrasi yang melibatkan setiap anggota pada aliran rantai pasokan padi varietas pandan wangi.</jats:p>"

Thai government is prioritizing the cassava production in their “Mega farm” strategy in support of agricultural economic and collaboration between farmer, public and private sectors. The collaborative model is an integrated supply chain that manages the multiple stakeholders. Moreover, implementing the collaborative supply chain (CSC) has improve overall performance of the entire supply chain. The study aims to review existing literature on collaborative model and critical success factors in the agriculture supply chain context during 2008-2018 and the 20-year agriculture and cooperatives strategy (2017-2036). The six key collaborative success factors are identified: Business Management, Information Technology, Value Added Process, SC Relationship, Top Management Commitment, Partnership, Service Quality, Process, Resource Capability, Environment Uncertainties, Customer Satisfaction. The hypothesis will be tested by the linear regression analysis and develop the prototype of CSC mobile application to create the collaboration in cassava chip industry. Then, the result will be embedded into mobile application. The application will later be used to provide more appropriate third-party system to enhance the collaborative cassava chip supply chain in Thailand. The result shows that all components are supported by the hypothesis and user acceptance test.</jats:p>"

The main aim of this research is to identify and integrate network analysis metrics in the existent literature in this realm which is applicable to characterize the position and role of organizations in the supply chain network context and their impact on the behavior and outcomes of organizations and the whole supply chain network. To this aim, we followed a systematic literature review process using Scopus database to identify high-quality papers through several screening stages. Our findings illustrate that there are two main sources of interfirm differences including atomistic properties and relational properties. With an emphasis on relational properties through the lens of network analysis metrics, we integrated influential characteristics on actor’s behavior and performance into three main categories of node level, tie level, and network level. Our findings are applicable to address any emergent phenomenon and the roles of actors based on their position in the network context such as supply chain network and study their behavior and performance.</jats:p>"

Most scholarship focuses on some form of sanction to motivate supply chain members, but we propose that the fundamental problem is not insufficient punishment, but a lack of trust. Fickle tastes, incessant demands for lower prices, and spot market indifference force suppliers into a constant struggle for economic survival. No trust can grow in such an environment, and few sustainability practices can take meaningful root. Responding to multiple calls for scholarship in the supply chain literature, we propose a trust-building process by which supply chains can evolve from indifference and hostility to a relational partnership that produces joint investments in sustainable practices. The result is a supply chain that is more efficient, more humane, and embeds sustainability in the supply chain for the long-term.</jats:p>",

With the rapid advancement of digital technologies and industrial transformations towards Industry 4.0, similar trend has been found in the forest industry and especially on its forest procurement side. Forestry 4.0 has been proposed as research initiatives in recent years. However, publications have largely focused on the digital technologies. This article is aimed at presenting a framework to provide a holistic view of Forestry 4.0 from a forest supply chain perspective. The framework consists of four major components including the digital technologies pertinent to each of the supply chain business activities; the network infrastructure; the next generation system intelligence; and the collaborative forest supply chain digital ecosystem. These components are essential for the forest industry transformation to become truly interconnected among its supply chain actors. Some economic, environmental, and social expected benefits of Forestry 4.0 are discussed as well as potential impacts and challenges.</jats:p>"

The speed, service quality, and the cost of operations impact the supply chain performance. One most popular approach for providing faster responses, improving quality and reducing cost in SCM, is LSS as it combines strengths of both Lean and Six Sigma. LSS is not just about doing things better, it is a way of doing better things. Research establishes complementary relationship of Lean and Six Sigma; summarizes benefits of LSS in SCM and develops various frameworks such as S-V framework and O-T-S framework to emphasize the role of LSS in enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of SCM processes. As a strategic management tool, LSS deployment in SCM is considered to be an important management philosophy, supporting organizations in their efforts to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of operations, satisfy customers and enhance competitive advantages.</jats:p>",

Earlier research has confirmed that IWS negatively impacts the consumers, the infrastructure and the water supply authorities.  Water supply authorities need tools to help understand IWS and the associated implications. A new indexing framework involving the causes and impacts associated with IWS is presented in this paper. In addition, a novel approach allows for quantification of the severity of IWS based on knowledge of a few readily available inputs. The severity quantification is based on two ratios: the intermittency ratio is a temporal measurement, accounting for supply duration; the connection ratio describes spatial aspects, using the number of service connections affected. The indexing framework and quantification tool could lead to improved understanding of IWS and could assist water supply authorities faced with IWS to make informed decisions. Improved planning of remedial actions to mitigate or avoid risks associated with IWS is aided. The tools presented in this paper could be used as basis for future development of a key performance indicator.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Classical logistic networks have long since struggled with the increasing demand for flexibility and responsiveness, driven by the emancipation of consumers and the globalization of our world. Hence, since 2010, researchers in the logistics domain propose the ‘Physical Internet’ (PI) as guiding vision for innovations in logistic networks. The PI model adopts concepts and ideas from the ‘Digital Internet’ (DI) world and applies these to the movement and storage of physical products. While researchers have been working with this analogy for the past decade, a debate has emerged about the value of the DI/PI analogy and its usefulness for guiding the design of the PI. Specifically, prior work has not focused on ascertaining the accuracy of the analogy, i.e., how well logistics researchers have adopted concepts from the Digital Internet, and how this may influence the value of the analogy in the current discourse. The aim of this paper is to help fill this gap, using a qualitative research approach. We use 15 semi-structured expert interviews, to determine how well the DI is understood among the experts working on the DI/PI analogy. We propose the Analogy Functionality Model to interpret the results and assess the current strength of the analogy. We find that the strength of the DI/PI analogy varies across functions. Its application value lies particularly in the persuasion of stakeholders, the accessible explanation of key concepts, and the gathering of inspiration for further design directions. This underlines the importance of the analogy for the PI innovation community. Researchers and logistics practitioners should, however, refrain from using the analogy as a blueprint for the design of PI systems. For implementation purposes, we recommend that researchers move to conceptually emancipate the PI from the DI.</jats:p>"

The study focuses on Ethiopia’s metropolitan areas (including households in town Mettu), as it is the problem of financial scarcity in Ethiopia that is particularly relevant and access to water services is a key component in calculating the human poverty index for most developing countries. Based on a survey of 79 Mettu town households, it is justified that residents view water not as a public good but as an economic good, as they are prepared to pay for it. The survey concluded that an average of 69% of Mettu households is willing to pay for improved water quality, with household income, water supply satisfaction, and supply price having a strong impact on households’ willingness to pay for improved water services. In particular, the older the locals are and the higher their income level, the more they are willing to pay for improved water quality and security of water supply. At the same time, rising levels of education in Mettu residents reduce their willingness to incur additional financial costs, more educated people view water services as a boon to the authorities. The results of the study proved that while providing local authorities with high-quality water supply services, more than 80% of households are ready and able to pay for services at a price that exceeds the tariff rate for water supply costs. The article stated that increasing the quality of water supply services by increasing the number of tariffs for water use will contribute to the growth of the financial revenues of local authorities, which will ensure the provision of water supply in the required quantity and on a stable basis.\n\nKeywords: improved water supply services, willingness, bidding Prices and tariff structure.</jats:p>"

Paradoxically, the region still suffers problems of water shortage. This is due to the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall that greatly affects water supply through its impacts on surface and groundwater. For this reason, we came up with the research topic <jats:bold>“Rainfall variability and quantity of water supply in Bamenda 1, Northwest Region of Cameroon.”</jats:bold> The objective of this study is to examine the manifestations of rainfall variability, and how it affects quantity of water supply in the humid tropics. Rainfall data use for this study comprised of annual, monthly, and daily rainfall over a period of 55 years. Water supply data was made of monthly and annual supply. With these data, a Pearson’s correlation was computed, and it gave a value of 0.701, with a rainfall proportion of 49.14% and 50.86% for other factors. The seasonality and the Standardized Precipitation Index were equally analyzed. At the end of the study, results showed that rainfall events in Bamenda I fluctuates with time and in space. It equally presented a reduction in the number of rainy days from 204 days in 1663 to 155 in 2018. This led to a reduction in length of rainy season and in rainfall amounts. In addition, the area has witnessed sedimentation of riverbeds and water reservoirs due to erosion and deposition during high rainfall peaks. Equally, floods observed during high rainfall episodes have become a potential threat to water infrastructures imposing exceptional water shortages during the rainy seasons. Due to these, actors in the water supply sector are putting in measures to remedy the situation.</jats:p>"

The assumption shapes a theoretical foundation for a serious game, Energy Game, which emerged as a result of an international interdisciplinary student collaboration. The aim of the Game, on the one hand, is the simulation of user behaviour choosing between various energy options based on their cost efficiency, and on the other hand, the education of design and engineering students, as well as other interested parties, about neighbourhood energy production and delivery. The outcome of the Game represents a distribution of various energy options across the neighbourhood, and may potentially inform planning decisions about neighbourhood energy provision. The results of game sessions with students indicate the viability of the Game for education, energy demand and supply modelling, as well as highlighted the requirements for enhancing the playfulness of the Game and, apart from costs, the need to include the environmental impact of energy provision options into game mechanics.</jats:p>",

In this regard, the study identifies and analyzes the patterns of transformation of conceptual approaches to the formation of a sustainable water supply system under environmental constraints. It is proved that one of the determining external factors that cause such transformation is the increase of environmental awareness of the population at the local, national and world levels. The system of methods of sustainable water supply in the conditions of ecological restrictions is proposed, which provides for complex scientifically grounded application of modern infrastructural, institutional and ecosystem mechanisms of water policy implementation and institutionalization of a number of strategic directions and processes of development of integrated water resources management of Ukraine. It is established that in the field of institutional support for sustainable water use, the evolution of conceptual approaches under the influence of «ecological» philosophy will determine, first and foremost, the improvement of the regulatory system of streamlining relations, its focus on optimizing the use of water resources, their conservation and reproduction. It covers all the main characteristics of the institutional environment, the system of rules and norms of behavior of economic relations, changes in the set of incentives for entrepreneurial activity and in the sphere of coordination of economic, financial and regulatory activities and state planning. Therefore, the strategic directions of transformation of the current water management system in order to ensure their expanded reproduction is the institutionalization of new rules and standards for the economic development of water resources, in particular the specification of ownership rights for water resources and the spread of modern forms of public-private partnership in the field of water use. This will increase the level of investment support for the reproduction of water resources and expand the available financial base for the modernization of water management infrastructure.</jats:p>"

There are many recycling technologies that are already serving mankind; however, the types of wastes are changing with composite materials. These types of “not only one origin” composite wastes make it difficult to recycle by the conventional methods. There are huge differences in the types of wastes discarded by different types of industries that make the situation more complicated.

In this study, DREAM(zs) algorithm has been developed to study aquifer simulation-optimization model uncertainties. DREAM(zs) is used to investigate uncertainty of parameters of the simulation-optimization model in Isfahan-Barkhar aquifer, Isfehan province, Iran. This study is carried out on an aquifer simulation model of MODFLOW that is coupled with MOPSO (multi-objective particle swarm optimization) optimization. Three likelihood functions, L1, L2, and L3, are considered as informal and the remaining (L4 and L5) are represented as formal categories. Likelihood function L1 is Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and L2 is based on minimum mean square error. L3 uses estimation of model error variance and L4 focuses on the relationship between the traditional least squares fitting and the Bayesian inference. In likelihood function L5 the serial dependence of residual errors is calculated using a first-order autoregressive model of the residuals. Results suggested that the parameters sensitivity depend on the likelihood function selection, and sensitivity of all parameters is not similar in different likelihood functions. MOPSO algorithm outputs indicated that likelihood function No. 5 has a higher speed in reaching convergence and this function also showed that objective functions had a better performance compared to the other likelihood functions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>State intervention in land supply can be a powerful tool in shaping real estate investment. Yet, few studies have examined the effect of central state intervention on land supply at the municipal level and the impact of land supply on real estate investment with respect to different tiers of prefecture-level cities in China. Varying central–local dynamics of land supply in different tiers of cities, and the often taken-for-granted relationship between land supply and real estate investment, warrant further investigation. This study aims to fill these gaps. It is found that the multi-purposed central land policy and the varying land leasing strategies adopted by different tiers of cities contribute to the varying land supply trajectories, calling for more nuanced and better-tailored central land policies that focus on the socioeconomic conditions of cities. The general significant and positive correlation between land supply and real estate investment, revealed by a panel regression analysis incorporating 280 prefecture-level Chinese cities, suggests that land supply control can function as a critical tool in governing real estate investment in China, which also sheds light on the governance and promotion of sustainable real estate markets in other parts of the world. This study also reveals a higher possibility of land speculation in first- and second-tier cities than that of low-tier cities. The nuanced correlations between land supply and real estate investment and the varying land development strategies employed in different tiers of Chinese cities imply that the effectiveness of land supply intervention in shaping healthy real estate investment may depend on local contingencies, calling for meticulous and tailored governance on land supply and real estate investment behaviors.</jats:p>"

Its objective is to properly address urban characteristics in flood risk assessment by introducing a specific urban-type set of physical, social, economic and ecological indicators. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to quantify the optimal selection weights for each of the selected 14 indicators. Five levels of flood risk will be presented in spatial maps using geographic information system (GIS) ranging from Very Low Risk to Very High Risk. Results of this study are expected to aid in understanding flood hazard and risk in Metro Manila. Moreover, the resulting flood risk information can be used as a decision tool in policy making, land-use planning, developing guidelines and countermeasures and flood disaster insurance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a single-phase photovoltaic (PV) inverter fed by a boost converter to supply a freezer motor with variable DC input is investigated. The proposed circuit has two stages. Firstly, the DC output of the PV panel that varies between 150 and 300 V will be applied to the boost converter. The boost converter will boost the input voltage to a fixed 300 V DC. Next, this voltage is supplied to the single-phase full bridge inverter to obtain 230 V AC. In the end, The output of the inverter will feed a freezer motor. The PV panels can be stand-alone or grid-connected. The grid-connected PV is divided into two categories, such as with a transformer and without a transformer, a transformer type has galvanic isolation resulting in increasing the security and also provides no further DC current toward the grid, but it is expensive, heavy and bulky. The transformerless type holds high efficiency and it is cheaper, but it suffers from leakage current between PV and the grid. This paper proposes a stand-alone direct use of PV to supply a freezer; therefore, no grid connection will result in no leakage current between the PV and Grid. The proposed circuit has some features such as no filtering circuit at the output of the inverter, no battery in the system, DC-link instead of AC link that reduces no-loads, having a higher efficiency, and holding enough energy in the DC-link capacitor to get the motor started. The circuit uses no transformers, thus, it is cheaper and has a smaller size. In addition, the system does not require a complex pulse width modulation (PWM) technique, because the motor can operate with a pulsed waveform. The control strategy uses the PWM signal with the desired timing. With this type of square wave, the harmonics (5th and 7th) of the voltage are reduced. The experimental and simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy.</jats:p>"

This safety system is important as it acts as a security measure against fire accident which could lead to death and destruction of properties. This paper propose an advanced gas leakage, fire and power supply failure monitoring system with Arduino UNO and GSM Module as its embedded system. Among the features of this system are their ability to detect the presence of smoke, gases and power failure at homes and factories, then the system will send a text message using Short Message Service (SMS) to the registered mobile number via GSM Module informing the user the situation and location of the incident. As a result, the user or person in charge can respond to the emergency situation accordingly and alert the fire departments or relevant authorities in time. This system could help the user to transform the way they protect their property and critical infrastructure. Successful safety and security transformation requires a combination of end user structural and operational changes as well as technology evolution enablement. This is in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (known as IR4.0), that propose substantial increase in the deployment of sensors for collecting, processing, and communicating measurement data in real time in order to diverse working environments, thus, resulting in advancement and convergence of technologies.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Fluorine is important for human health, and since the main route for its introduction into the body is water, hygienic assessment of drinking water quality based on the content of this microelement at the regional level is very relevant, thus it has become our research objective.Eight districts of the region are characterized by such fluoride content in water which is significantly lower than optimal values; five districts by the concentrations exceeding maximum permissible values; and only three districts by approximately optimal average values. Different concentration of fluoride in the regional water supplies depends on the natural factor of this geographical zone. To provide the population of the region with high-quality drinking water a complex of various measures including the development and implementation of programs for improving local water supplies are required.</jats:p>"

However, consideration of the innovation process in the digital intellectual supply chain network grid within the framework of the smart factory concept allows to put forward a hypothesis about the immanence nature of innovation in all parts of the supply chain network. The main purpose of the research is to study both the place and the role of the innovation process describing the concept of intelligent digital supply chain network grid. A new method of research is presented in the paper fundamental problems of innovations theory in the modern consideration of the theory of logistics and supply chain management. The authors developed a specific approach to considering the digital supply chain as an intelligent logistic network based on the researching the wide range of different compound connections instead of linear structure of traditional supply chain. It is proved that the research of influence of the new technological mode regarding the theoretical concept of implementation of digital and virtual technologies in the economy of the digital industry could be stemmed into the theoretical problem of determining the place and role of innovation in economic dynamics. From this point of view the model of network representation of an intelligent digital supply chain is substantiated. The results of the research involve the types of supply chains, the place and role of innovation process life cycle models in an intelligent digital supply chain. The conclusion is drawn that it is necessary to consider a continuous process from an innovative idea to product support. The necessity for further studies of the digital core of economic relations arising from the development of innovations in the network representation of a digital intellectual supply chain could be discussed.</jats:p>"

However, the costs and impacts of water loss reduction efforts need to be weighed against the benefits to define the optimal water loss target level. To this end, we conducted a cost–benefit analysis of three investment-based leakage reduction methods: district metering, pressure reduction, and pipe renovations. Furthermore, we conducted uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to determine the most relevant data for leakage analysis and policymaking on a national level. The results indicate that water loss management might not be directly cost-beneficial to utilities operating with moderate leakage levels. Neither leakage percentage nor the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) were suitable for leakage target setting for the Finnish utilities. The costs of investing in district metering or renovations were the most influential factors in the sensitivity analysis, but the results showed that the estimated values were sufficiently accurate for assessing leakage policies.</jats:p>"

The goal of this study was to develop a mathematical model based on supplier selection and assessment criteria using structured, multi-criteria decision-making methods. The first method was the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the second method was the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). These methods were chosen based on their acceptance and use in previous research. The hybrid model was implemented as a software tool based on Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic. The tool improved the way in which wood product firms selected their suppliers and guaranteed that the best available alternatives were selected, thus increasing the chance of a successful supplier-consumer relationship and increasing the value that the company receives from its supplier base. Seven interviews were conducted in the wood fiber industry to validate the tool. The tool was found to be applicable and a valuable approach, as reported by most participants.</jats:p>"

Thus, based on a case study in Viseu Dão Lafões Region (VDLR), we intend to identify and discuss (emphasizing potentialities and constraints) the movement of SFSCs in the region. This case study is based on document analysis and interviews with agrifood baskets’ promotors. On the one hand, the results show the wide variety of SFSCs that exist in the region and the emergence of new forms of SFSCs like the agrifood baskets. On the other hand, the empirical research also emphasizes the environmental, economic, and sociocultural benefits of SFSCs that will have a positive impact on the well-being of producers, consumers, and/or on the whole region. However, the interviews have also exposed a (certain) limitation in terms of communication and marketing that may constraint these initiatives. From a practical point of view, it became clear that producers must do their best to develop their communication and marketing strategies; from a political point of view, local authorities should provide the necessary assistance to help implement training programmes and develop suitable communication and marketing skills.</jats:p>",

Therefore it is necessary to have supply chain performance indicator standards related to the procurement of materials that can be used as a reference for the performance of a project or contractor. The purpose of this study is to measure the performance of the construction supply chain with the perfect order fulfillment (POF) indicator adopted from the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) 12.0. The adoption stage starts from the definition in construction to the calculation of indicators in the project. The results showed that suppliers of steel and ready mix concrete at close range from the project had better performance. In the case study, the perfect order fulfillment performance of steel suppliers with a distance of 345 km is worth 89.476% while suppliers with a distance of 540 km are worth 87.535%. The supplier of ready mix concrete within 7.3 km is worth 95.355% and the supplier with a distance of 15.7 km is 91.705%.</jats:p>"

Integration of these actors in a transparent yet secure way is needed, which blockchain technology has the potential to do so. In this article, different models of blockchain application in logistics are discussed and how the permissioned blockchains can be used in realizing the business case. An overview of different frameworks which enable permissioned blockchains are discussed in this article. Based on this, the authors propose an asset transfer model which can be employed to enhance supply chain trackability using permissioned blockchain.</p>",

The main aim of this article is to evaluate the effects of customer satisfaction on the cash inflow of a firm in a supply chain. In fact, this article develops an optimisation mathematical model to maximise the amount of cash received from customer within a time horizon through maximizing customer satisfaction and optimising the payment strategy parameters. Customer satisfaction in each period is defined as a dependent variable of three parameters such as penalty rate, demand variation and delivery time. All the firms in a supply chain can adjust these parameters to improve the amount of cash received from the customers. The penalty rate in each period is related to the amount and time of cash received from the customers in that period and the amount are supposed to be received from the customers in the next period. Consequently, customer discount can be applied to improve the firm's input.</jats:p>",

This competitiveness is analysed mainly in the light of cost, time and quality of the customers’ service delivered by the supply chain management. Today one of the most important resource impacting on driving business in the competitive way are the digital technologies. This is mainly due to the fact that digital technologies are strongly changing the innovation level of the company and its performance. Therefore it is worth to analyse the influence of digital technologies on supply chain competitiveness in terms of cost, time and quality. The aim of this paper is to present the most important areas that are impacted by the digital technologies in improving of supply chain competitiveness. The results of the empirical research, conducted among 120 supply chain managers in 2018, show that the aspect of quality is the weakest point in terms of digital innovation impacting on supply chain competitiveness. Thus in the second part of the paper the analyses of the role of the customers experience have been done to understand the new approach to the role of digital technologies. The digital innovation is impacting the whole customers’ journey during their relation not only with the company, but with the supply chain – that is actually the organization of several independent companies. In this way digital technologies starting to be a central point of supply chain configuration for improving its competitiveness.</jats:p>"

After collecting data of Indian manufacturing companies listed in the Bloomberg’s ESG terminal, we first tested the relationship of the three ESG factors: environmental, social and governance with the companies economic returns (ER). In the next level, we extended the study to find whether firms’ CG initiatives mediate the relationship of green supply chain management (GSCM) and socially responsible supply chain management (SRSCM) practices with the firms’ ER. In the study, it was observed that CG activities mediate the relationship between SRSCM and ER whereas it has a negligible mediation effect on the association between GSCM and ER.</jats:p>"

Dapat diketahui bahwa dalam sistem distribusi tenaga listrik baik PLN maupun Generator Set (Genset) tidaklah mungkin dapat menyediakan tenaga listrik secara kontinu. Kondisi penyediaan suplai listrik yang terdapat di pabrik rokok masih memiliki kekurangan dan masih belum bisa memberikan backup dengan baik. Analisis kekurangan sistem kerja dari sistem backup supply, penanggulangan ketika putusnya suplai listrik dan analisis perbandingan penerapan backup supply perlu dilakukan untuk mencapai hasil perbaikan yang maksimal. Setelah dilakukan analisis, maka dilakukan pemasangan UPS dengan kapasitas 100 kVA sebagai backup supply tambahan. Dengan adanya UPS, tidak ada jeda waktu ketika terjadi perpindahan suplai. Untuk membuktikan kualitas sistem backup supply energi listrik setelah dilakukannya pemasangan UPS pada pabrik rokok, dilakukan simulasi transien pada ETAP 12.6.0. Dengan dilakukannya simulasi transien pada ETAP 12.6.0 dapat diperoleh hasil grafik pada bus yang sudah dipasang UPS dan bus yang tidak dipasang UPS. Pada bus yang sudah dipasang UPS, tegangan tidak putus pada saat PLN mengalami gangguan. Sedangkan pada bus yang tidak dipasang UPS mengalami gangguan, tegangan akan terputus selama 1 menit dan setelah 1 menit Generator Set (Genset) akan mensuplai beban sampai PLN kembali normal.</jats:p>"

Using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that identifies separate oil supply shocks for the U.S. and OPEC, I find that U.S. supply shocks can account for up to 13% of the oil price variation over the 2003-2015 period. This is considerably more than what has been found in other studies. Moreover, while U.S. oil production has increased substantially since 2010, U.S. oil supply shocks first started to contribute negatively to oil prices beginning in late 2013. This mismatch implies a temporary friction in the transmission of U.S. supply shocks to the rest of the world likely caused by logistical and technological challenges observed in the downstream supply chain. </jats:p>",

These changes may increase uncertainty among employers as to the availability and training of the next generation of forest industry workers. This study reports our findings from an analysis of workforce supply and readiness in Maine's forest products industry. To estimate possible gaps in skills and work culture, we administered a survey to current forestry students and employers in the forest products industry. Skills were assessed in three domains: soft skills, knowledge skills, and technical skills. Our gap analysis focused on the difference between the stated importance of skills to employers and the current level of skill knowledge in the workforce across all three domains. Employers identified dealing with change, motivating personnel, negotiating contracts, problem solving, and financial analysis as the top educational needs. In addition, we assessed the willingness of students to accept the culture of work within the forest products industry. Despite the anecdotes shared by employers, we did not find significant evidence of a work culture mismatch between current students and their potential future employers. We recommend that gaps related to regulations, certification standards, or log scaling be addressed through workshops or on-the-job training, whereas areas such as customer relations, marketing, or problem solving could be emphasized in academic curriculum.</jats:p>"

Primary and secondary data were collected through field survey, in-depth interviews, and documentary analysis. Flow of material and energy was modelled by the software Umberto NXT Universal 7.0. The primary actors of a carrageenan supply chain are seaweed farmers, local traders, large traders or exporters, and carrageenan processors. Seaweed suppliers, farmers, local traders, and large traders/exporters exist in Sulawesi Island. Most of the carrageenan companies are national base existing in Java Island. About 75% of semi-raw dried seaweed containing carrageenan is exported. The material and energy for producing refined carrageenan are larger than semi refined carrageenan.</jats:p>",

The main idea of the method is to control the process of cyclic shifting of the switched-on power modules of the uninterruptible power supply by series switching into operation of each subsequent module from their unloaded reserve and switching out the previous one. The paper presents the control system structure where in addition to the central control module, it is proposed to add the control unit for power modules, which is responsible for implementing the process of their switching on and monitors their condition. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer simulation model describing the power modules control logic is developed. The Simulink visual modeling environment and the mathematical tools of the Stateflow library component using state and transition diagrams are used in order to develop the simulation model. The developed simulation model is tested and the simulation results are given in the form of time diagrams of state change. The іmplementation of the developed method, due to the uniform reduction of the period during which the power modules of the uninterruptible power supply are on the switched-on loaded state, makes it possible to increase their operating time to failure, which in turn increases its reliability without deteriorating energy efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the developed algorithm in various system operation modes. Based on the proposed method, hardware and software which is implemented as a part of intelligent computerized control system for uninterruptible DC power supply is created.</jats:p>"

The first of these is the increase in carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions due to the escalated use of coal, resulting in the gradual increase of the Earth’s average temperature. The second is the continually diminishing fossil fuel resources, <jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic> oil and natural gas, which are the primary sources of energy for vital services like transportation and domestic heating. The third is the unforeseen and rapid “world population boom” since the beginning of the 19th century after the invention of the steam engine by JamesWatt. The combination of these three factors signal imminent danger. With the increase of the world population, there is a subsequent rise in the usage of both electrical and non-electrical types of energy. At the same time, not only are the sources of these energy forms, <jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic> the fossil fuels, depleting because they are non-renewable but their usage is also severely detrimental to the environment. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and switch to renewable or even nuclear resources as alternatives, in order to prevent an impending climate disaster. Hence, taking the aforementioned problems into account, a method is proposed in this paper to create a safe, reliable and regenerative electrical energy supply system using renewable wind and solar energy as well as hydrogen storages.</jats:p>"

Daniel Parolek (CNU, 2018) proposed bringing back the Missing Middle Housing (MMH) types as one way to increase the supply. However, the risks of regulations, neighborhood opposition to increased densities, and apparent under-capitalization due to financing restrictions deter suppliers (developers) from helping to increase the supply. This qualitative study utilizing a grounded theory approach examines experts and industry leaders in the field supporting the claim that MMH types are “missing.” A risk, risk reduction and capital flow mapping that influence supply emerged at the thematic portion of the research. This research suggests there is a willingness to solve the MMH types issues by mitigating the risks of all three factors of neighborhood opposition to density, lack of developer, and lender interests due to regulation and costs which inhibit supply. Further research is necessary for mitigating the risks and infusing capital with the power brokers, the capital investors, and the suppliers.</jats:p>"

Many researchers have made significant efforts to improve its energy efficiency and environmental effects with important achievements. Given that the system produces heat and electricity at the same time, this study focuses on the role of CHP in the holistic urban energy system and points out the mismatch between the demand and supply sides of urban energy systems by using the heat-to-power ratio as a parameter. The calculation method and characteristics of the supply side heat-to-power ratio of eight heating methods and the maximum demand side heat-to-power ratio for 19 cities in northern China are displayed. After the analysis, it is concluded that (1) the maximum demand side heat-to-power ratio in the cities varies from 1.0 to 5.9, which is affected by the location and social, economic, and industrial structures. (2) In most of the cities, with the current energy structure, the demand side heat-to-power ratios are always larger than the supply side heat-to-power ratios. (3) The reduction in heating demand, surplus heat recovery, and the use of a highly efficient electric heating method, such as the heat pump, can help solve the mismatch of the heat-to-power ratio between the demand and supply sides. These conclusions can guide the urban energy planning and system construction.</jats:p>"

The smooth and unfettered working of transnational supply chains has facilitated efficiency increasing changes to business operations (such as just in time inventory management). The automotive sector worldwide has been at the forefront of internationally integrated supply systems. The European Union (EU) has, in part, been structured to reduce friction in Europe-wide supply chains through the single market. Transnational supply chains are at the heart of United Kingdom (UK) – EU trade, and the UK’s departure from the EU’s single market (Brexit) will increase friction in international trade. This case study of the UK’s automotive sector uses a social network approach to analyse supply chain linkages between the UK, EU and other trading partners, and how these could be impacted as a result of Brexit. We use data from Trade in Value Added (TiVA) and World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to map supply chains, estimate total value-added in exports and examine how Brexit is likely to impact the competitiveness of UK exports. Results confirm that the UK’s automotive sector is closely integrated with the EU. To offset the loss of UK’s export competitiveness after Brexit, trade facilitation measures complemented with a duty drawback scheme could be an option in the short run. Policy measures are, however, unlikely to replace the benefits of duty-free and frictionless access enjoyed under single market trading arrangements. This suggests that the UK automotive sector, which is primarily comprised of globally active firms, may have to reconfigure supply chain arrangements and in the long run alter how decisions pertaining to locations are made.\n\nKeywords: Brexit, global value chains, input-output linkages, WIOD.</jats:p>"

It is successfully established as a reliable and efficient financing platform for the auto retail industry. Due to the Blockchain built-in trust mechanism, participants in the supply chain (SC) networks work extensively and transparently to run a reliable, convenient, and traceable business. Likewise, the traditional supply chain finance (SCF), partial automation of SCF workflows with fewer human errors and disruptions was achieved through smart contract in BCautoSCF. Such open and secure features suggest the feasibility of BCautoSCF in SCF. As the first Blockchain-driven SCF application for the auto retail industry in China, our contribution lies in studying these pain points existing in traditional SCF and proposing a novel Blockchain-driven design to reshape the business logic of SCF to develop an efficient and reliable financing platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the auto retail industry to decrease the cost of financing and speed up the cash flows. Currently, there are over 600 active enterprise users that adopt BCautoSCF to run their financing business. Up to October 2019, the BCautoSCF provides services to 449 online/offline auto retailors, three B2B asset exchange platforms, nine fund providers, and 78 logistic services across 21 provinces in China. There are 3296 financing transactions successfully completed in BCautoSCF, and the amount of financing is ¥566,784,802.18. In the future, we will work towards supporting a full automation of SCF workflow by smart contracts, so that the efficiency of transaction will be further improved.</jats:p>"

Most African cities are blessed with usable groundwater, and some with the presence of major aquifers, but urban water utilities will need to take a more proactive approach to groundwater resource management and quality protection if the opportunity of a secure water supply is to be sustainably secured. Among the key policy issues that need more attention are rationalising utility groundwater use, prioritising installation of mains sewerage to reduce groundwater pollution risk, promoting enhanced groundwater recharge to improve resource sustainability, using groundwater in ‘decentralised closed-loop water-service systems’ to meet the demands of new outer urban districts, and implementing a consistent policy response to the ‘boom’ in private self-supply from waterwells. The consequences of non-action in terms of much increased exposure to water-supply crises, potentially hazardous water-supply pollution incidents, and irrational public and private investment in water-supply access are highlighted.</jats:p>",

Th is paper explore areas of integration in the tourism supply chain among Regional Economic Communities (REC’s) through contextualization of a comparative advantage to increase the share of the tourism business in Africa as a catalyst to development in the African continent. This paper adopted the text analysis that is used in social science research and involves “drawing inferences from a comparative advantage theory”. In this case, large volumes of contents are analysed. Themes that emerged revealed that a well-managed tourism supply chain in the country and in the Regional Economic Communities (REC’s) could stimulate the infrastructural development and preserve natural and historical heritage. TSCM has the ability to support the society. There is a dire need to liberalize air flight and visa regimes to benefit from the share of tourism in the REC’s in the African continent. The implication is that tourism distribution can be achieved through the recognition of the nature of strategic coordination between partners in the RECS and can also improve the performance of the tourism sector in the continent. For companies that are involved in the effective supply chain, they could benefit from coordination and communication through the distribution channels that support the core service or product.</jats:p>"

Many companies are under pressure from customers, media, governments, and investors, among others, to implement green practices. This exploratory paper investigates the relationships between internal and external green practices of eight Portuguese companies from different industrial sectors and their impact on economic and environmental performance. The relationship was analyzed based on the data collected from 22 semi‐structured interviews with general managers, procurement and environmental/safety managers, and through secondary data collected from reports, websites and companies' internal documentation. The analysis identifies the most important green practices considered by managers, as well as the performance measures that are most appropriate and most widely used to evaluate the influence of green practices on corporate performance. A conceptual model was derived to assess the influence of green practices on focal company economic and environmental performance. The results support four of five propositions of this research, and it is possible to conclude that the companies believe that with the adoption of green supply chain practices, they can be more competitive in the market. Due to the scope of the green practices, the relationship between green practices and economic performance was inconclusive. Internal and external green supply chain practices contribute to improved environmental performance because for all companies, there is a positive relationship between green practices and environmental performance in terms of energy, water consumption, waste, and air emissions reduction.</jats:p>",

The study employed document reviews, structured observations, interviews and laboratory analysis of water samples. System design data files and an Operation and Management Contract document were reviewed along with in-depth interviews with key stakeholders of the water supply system. Structured observations were made to assess the management practices of the system managers. Three rounds of sampling of water were done at monthly intervals from 10 randomly selected public standpipes, 3 boreholes and 2 filtration units. Samples were analysed to assess their bacteriological safety and aesthetic (physical) quality (turbidity and colour). Upon detection of bacteriological contamination, the adequacy of disinfection was assessed by measuring the levels of residual chlorine. It was found that the recommended schedule for some key documented water&#x0D;\nquality control and monitoring activities were not complied with.  Consequently, the quality of water delivered to consumers at several public standpipes failed to meet the WHO guidelines for drinking water. Forty percent (40%) of all samples were found with faecal contamination, with 60% and 50% exceeding the WHO’s guideline levels for turbidity and colour respectively. It is recommended that the Community Water and Sanitation Agency in Ghana intensifies on-going efforts at ensuring that small-scale water supply systems in the country are managed with comprehensive water safety plans to prevent microbial contamination which could pose significant health risks to the consumers.</jats:p>"

The emergence of new wine-producing countries over recent decades allows to evaluate its impact on the performance of a collaborative supply chain in countries with wine production tradition. This chapter describes the collaboration in the interface wine-grower/wine maker in a Portuguese wine region (Setúbal Peninsula). It reveal that intensification of collaboration between wine companies could increase their competitiveness in the domestic and the international markets, due the benefits it endorses. It also exposes some factors that stand out as conditioners to the operationalization of a deep collaboration, restricting it to just a few activities. The results of a case study performed suggested that the wine industry structure and the product characteristics are factors that negatively influence the intensity and the extension of collaboration. Trust is the intangible element that stands out as critical to the intensity of collaboration. </jats:p>"

It also theoretically analyzes the impacting path of local governmental competition, causing increased investment in public goods, thereby reducing consumption. At the same time, based on the model of China's provincial panel data from 1993 to 2015, the empirical analysis shows that a 1% increase in the level of competition among local governments will result in a corresponding decrease of 0.757% in total consumption, 0.348% in governmental competition, 0.340% in business consumption and 0.366% in household consumption. Local governmental competition leads to the government's tendency to invest in public goods and reduces the regional consumption, which especially damages the consumption capacity of the household sector.</jats:p>",

It also aims to explain sustainability in supply chain management, the needs of a sustainable supply chain, historical development and importance of sustainable supply chains. As the first step, a keyword search was conducted in the well-known databases, and then, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) studies, which have connections to and implications for management accounting are evaluated and summarized separately. Although SSCM literature is very rich, the number of SSCM studies which have implications to management accounting is scarce. They point out that management accountants may take parts especially in determining cost and profitability of sustainable products, cost and quality evaluation of input materials and risk evaluation of suppliers, developing costing models for sustainable production, measuring performance in economic, environmental and social areas, and making cost-benefit analysis in the implementation and adoption of sustainability in each steps of sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

They may benefit from increasing water charges for those who are be willing to pay little extra in lieu of their demand for improvement in water quality and service. To check the plausibility of this proposal, we investigated drinking water supply and quality, and welloff consumers demand for improved service delivery in Shah-Rukun-e-alam and Mumtazabad towns in Multan city of Pakistan. Qualitative data obtained through a questionnaire survey was analyzed using descriptive and regression techniques. Qualitative information obtained through semi structured interviews was helpful in designing survey questionnaire and to elaborate quantitative results. Results reveal that the respondents accord high importance to the provision of safe drinking water than to other daily household needs. The demand for improvement in water supply parameters exceeds the demand for improvements in water quality parameters, with the reliable supply being the most demanded improvement. Majority realize the government’s budget constraints in improving service delivery. Most respondents would pay PKR 100 in addition to what they are paying now. Their willingness to pay (WTP) this amount correlates with their awareness on water and health nexus, and depends household income, number of children under 14 years age and awareness of actual water quality tested through laboratory. Besides recommending raise of water charges by PKR 100 per month per household in both towns, the service quality improvement may consider interventions such as mobile water testing laboratory and awareness campaigns motivate citizens to pay for safe drinking water.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Projected future shoaling of the wintertime mixed layer in the northeast (NE) Atlantic has been shown to induce a regime shift in the main nutrient supply pathway from the Atlantic to the northwest European shelf (NWES) near the end of the 21st century. While reduced winter convection leads to a substantial decrease in the vertical nutrient supply and biological productivity in the open ocean, vertical mixing processes at the shelf break maintain a connection to the subpycnocline nutrient pool and thus productivity on the shelf. Here, we investigate how meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet (GIS), not yet taken into account, impacts the mixed layer shoaling and the regime shift in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variability. To this end, we have downscaled sensitivity experiments by a global Earth system model for various GIS melting rates with a regionally coupled ocean–atmosphere climate system model. The model results indicate that increasing GIS meltwater discharge leads to a general intensification of the regime shift. Atlantic subpycnocline water masses mixed up at the shelf break become richer in nutrients and thus further limit the projected nutrient decline on the shelf. Moreover, the stronger vertical nutrient gradient through the pycnocline results in an enhanced interannual variability of on-shelf nutrient fluxes which, however, do not significantly increase variations in nutrient concentrations and primary production on the shelf. Due to the impact of the GIS meltwater discharge on the NE Atlantic mixed layer depth, the regime shift becomes initiated earlier in the century. The effect on the onset timing, though, is found to be strongly damped by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. A GIS melting rate that is even 10 times higher than expected for emission scenario Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 would not lead to an onset of the regime shift until the 2070s.\n                    </jats:p>"

The effects observed indicate that NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>was taken up preferentially and that spring phytoplankton in oligotrophic lakes appear to be able to respond to variations in nitrogen forms (available NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>:NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>ratios) by adjusting their community composition. Such communal changes at the base of the food web may affect higher trophic levels. Therefore, the effects of varying available forms of nitrogen should also be considered in primarily phosphorus-limited aquatic systems.</jats:p>",

By the end of Brownback’s terms, in our experience as Kansans, many moderate Republicans were questioning the efficacy of this policy. With this in mind, we wanted to examine statistics related to this and see whether the trust of moderate republicans in this traditional conservative economic theory was lessened by Brownback’s gubernatorial tenure, or whether the shift in political landscape that led to Laura Kelly’s election stemmed from another factor.</jats:p>"

Several factors in cross-docking operations can be impacted by uncertain sources that can lead to inaccuracy and inefficiency of this process. Although many papers have been published on different aspects of cross-docking, there is a need for a comprehensive review to investigate the sources of uncertainties in cross-docking.

The project proposed in this paper will be successful if the parties carry out the process in an integrated manner according to government regulations. There has been no research on the integration of the parties from the procurement to execution stages. The existing research generally still regards the execution stage. The research objective of this project is to analyze the integration of parties in the supply chain system for the successful execution of road and bridge projects in Eastern Indonesia. To determine whether the integrated practice between parties in the supply chain system can be attributed exclusively to the successful implementation of the project, a questionnaire format was developed. Data collection took place from September 2019 to March 2020. Thirty respondents represented Owners (X1), Contractors and Subcontractors (X2), Supervisory Consultants (X3), and Suppliers (X4), whereas the success of the project’s implementation was represented with (Y). Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The analysis result of R-squared = 0.96 means that the parties are significantly integrated. F = 147.92 means that the variant of the regression model is good. P-value or significance F &lt; 0.05 means that the parties’ integration is very significant for the project’s success.</jats:p>"

The operation of the domestic hot water system in the circulation mode can be characterized by several parameters; one of which is the specific ratio of the cost of thermal energy for heating a cubic meter of hot water. The parameter is often regulated by law in Russia; exceeding this parameter is considered as administrative violation. The aim of the research is to determine the design and actual costs of thermal energy for hot water supply (hot water heating) and their comparison, analysis of the data obtained. The methodology for determining the design and real costs of thermal energy for hot water supply was to study the operation of the hot water supply system of a residential 144-apartment 9-storey building. The research showed that the actual circulating flow rate is much less than the calculated circulating flow rate. The authors note that in order to optimize the standard for heating a cubic meter of water it is necessary to observe the calculated circulation modes. This will require stabilization of the hydraulic systems of both the external and internal networks which is a difficult but feasible task. The research results are supposed to be taken into account when setting up existing hot water supply systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract In this article the authors assess the current level of water security of the population of the Rio de Janeiro metropolis supplied by the Guandu System. It sets out from the premise that water security is only achieved when universal access to water is ensured - that is, when water resources are available, in adequate quantity and quality, along with water services that guarantee the human right to safe drinking water. Based on previous research, a review of the literature and official documents, it was possible to adapt and apply an analytic schema to the case study in order to evaluate the level of water security. The authors conclude that there are many risks associated with the water resources, including climate stressors, but it is the performance of the water supply service that most jeopardizes the current water security of the population of the Rio de Janeiro metropolis; the availability of water resources, both current and future, is not an obstacle to universal access to water.</jats:p>"

The authors reviewed the relevant literature to define cloud innovation and user involvement in supply chain cloud innovation. Then the authors developed a game model based on the Bertrand model. Analysis of the model showed that user involvement affects product cost and optimal pricing in an interesting way.

Specifically, they examine the mediating effect of relationship quality on the association between collaborative activities and supply chain performance. The research model is then tested using survey data (n=219).

Since the pycnometric method provides high accuracy in determining the density and is simpler than the calorimetric method for determining the calorific value, the value of the latter can be checked using the dependence proposed in the article. In the event of a discrepancy between the calculated value of the calorific value and the experimentally obtained value of more than 0.5%, the determination of the calorific value and the density should be repeated. The relationship between the density and calorific value of a gas is subject to verification and refinement when gas from other fields is used. In all cases, a sampler should be used to accumulate an average gas sample over an appropriate period of time. The methodological error in calculating the amount of gaseous working fluid can be eliminated or reduced by using a computer as part of an automated heat supply enterprise management system.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. It was established that the calorific value of energy fuels non-linearly depends on the hydrogen and carbon contained therein; a formula has been developed to describe this relationship. When studying the energy characteristics of fuels, a previously unknown regularity was established: hydrocarbons ethylene, benzene and annelated hydrocarbons (naphthalene, anthracene, naphthacene, etc.) form the homologous series C<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>(n+6)/2</jats:sub>  with the homological difference C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, while all other series of hydrocarbons have a homological difference CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. The greatest difficulties consist in accounting (measuring) the amount of energy contained in the fuel used at TPPs, mainly natural gas, and the coolant, since there are no appropriate technical means for direct measuring the amount of a particular type of energy. The developed theoretical provisions make a certain contribution to the development of the scientific foundations of heat and gas supply, increase accuracy and reduce the complexity of calculating the technical and economic indicators of thermal power plants and boiler houses. </jats:p>"

A supply chain designed to minimize risks enables firms to establish a competitive position and provides long-term benefits to stakeholders. The SCRM system should be structured to manage both routine and extraordinary risks, such as natural disasters and major accidents. The risks should be managed both reactively, by monitoring changes in the chain, the needs of customers, technology and the strategies of suppliers and competitors, among others, to enable quick reaction to events; and proactively, to identify risks and implement actions to prevent them or minimize their impacts. The basic risk management process consists of identifying, evaluating, mitigating and controlling risks. The objective of this paper is to analyze how a carmaker identifies and manages the risk factors in its supply chain. To achieve this aim, we performed a qualitative, applied and exploratory field study of a Brazilian automaker. The data were collected by structured interviews, and the analytic hierarchy process was applied to rank the risk factors, resulting in a risk matrix that can be an instrument for making decisions by the company studied.</jats:p>"

According to the theory of oxygen- and capacity-limitation of thermal tolerance, heat stress occurs when a warming organism’s demand for oxygen exceeds its supply, triggering a widespread drop in ATP concentration. This model predicts that an organism’s heat tolerance should decrease under hypoxia, yet most terrestrial organisms tolerate the same amount of warming across a wide range of oxygen concentrations. This point is especially true for adult insects, who deliver oxygen through highly efficient respiratory systems. However, oxygen limitation at high temperatures may be more common during immature life stages, which have less developed respiratory systems. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of heat and hypoxia on the survival of locusts (<jats:italic>Schistocerca cancellata</jats:italic>) throughout development. We demonstrate that the heat tolerance of locusts depends on oxygen supply during the first instar but not during later instars. This finding provides further support for the idea that oxygen limitation of thermal tolerance depends on respiratory performance, especially during immature life stages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Living in a global world, we cannot limit supply chain to only one, two, or even three countries. Hence, supply chain manager’s key function now is to continuously reduce the time of goods flow and minimize the number of chain links making the chain more efficient and cost effective. The article outlines key components of the concept of supply chain management. We regard the management concept itself as planning, management and supply chain development on every stage of creation of goods and services: from raw materials supply to an end user service maintenance. We should streamline supply chain management to exclude all barriers, which different stakeholders may face during the flow. SCM-concept helps control the work of existing processing lines in the supply chain management system, create optimal planning what and when we should deliver, taking into account possible limits of capacity and access to raw materials. Currently, the motor vehicles do the major domestic transportation. Motor transport development is one of the most important aspects of effective economy development. In cross border transportation the share of freight transportation is growing compared to other means of transport. However, domestic motor transport and fuel quality have considerable mismatch of environment properties that lag far behind global requirements. Transport companies inside supply chain have moved beyond conventional services, at the same time they have higher market consolidation, integration, and collaboration with different agents that give new demands to transportation in logistics. The article identifies basic methods of supply chain management. We analyzed impact of modern technologies on logistics and supply chain management: 3D printing, radio frequency identification, unmanned aerial vehicles, connected and autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. Modern technologies provide small and medium enterprises opportunities to use innovative tools to obtain data-driven analytics, visualization, and processing of cargo. In order to make supply chain management efficient, we should use new technologies, modern devices, and tangible assets of high quality.</jats:p>"

This study is an attempt to measure the willingness to pay for an improved service using a model of revealed preference. Respondents are asked about the actions they are taking to reduce the impact on their household or business of scheduled and unscheduled outages and more stable voltage. We estimate the averting expenditures that were being incurred to compensate for the lack of reliability of the electricity service. The estimated cost of the averting actions as a percentage of the electricity bills is 53 % for households, 47 % for small businesses, 46 % for medium businesses, and 35 % for large businesses. Based on the estimations, we find that in 2017 the annual benefit from improving the reliability of the electricity service would be approximately US$ 188 million with a present value over 20 years of US$ 1.6 billion.</jats:p>"

By establishing a tripartite evolutionary game model among the peasants, agricultural products dealers and government under the policy of price subsidy, the effects of social benefits, the size of the penalty and the transaction volume on the evolutionary stable strategy is discussed. A simulation instance is also given to demonstrate the evolutionary game model. The results shows that the probability of government regulation is not only related to the social benefits of regulation, but also affected by the transaction volume of agricultural products, the peasants benefits can be protected effectively by the price subsidy policy and the probability of the agricultural products dealers choosing fraud strategy declines with the increase of penalty and increases with the transaction volume of agricultural products.</jats:p>",

Samples run with a UPS had significantly lower standard deviation (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) and coefficient of variation (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) across technical replicates than those run without a UPS. UPS usage also improved exponential amplification efficiency at the replicate, sample, and plate levels. Together these improvements translated to increased performance across metrics of external validity including correlation with age, within-person correlation across tissues, and correlation between parents and offspring.</jats:p>"

The objective of the present study is to calculate average annual GP utilisation in 2015–16 compared with clinical demand predicted in 2005–06.\n\nMethods\nDemand was calculated from Medicare Benefits Schedule, Department of Veterans’ Affairs and Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Length of consultation and average clinical hours worked per week (from 2002–03 to 2015–16) was drawn from GP self-reported data collected through the Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health (BEACH) program. GP workforce numbers were sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare ‘Medical practitioners workforce 2015’ report.\n\nResults\nPredicted demand from 2005–06 to 2009–10 approximated GP supply. Beyond 2011, approximately 2674 additional GPs were required in 2015–16 to maintain the average annual 2005–06 GP workload. An additional 5941 GPs were required to meet the increase in clinical demand (for GP services to patients) from 2005–06 to 2015–16.\n\nConclusions\nThe number of GP clinical hours worked decreased, and clinical demand increased. Ongoing efforts are required to ensure the supply of GPs to meet the clinical demand of Australia’s aging population.\n\nWhat is known about this topic?\nFor the past three decades there has been concern about the supply of GPs in Australia. In recent years the Australian Government has taken several steps to improve access to GP services by increasing the overall supply of GPs and encouraging a more even distribution of GPs across Australia. A 2011 Australian study calculated average annual GP service utilisation and predicted the number of GPs required to meet clinical demand to 2020. There are current concerns that the GP workforce has reached a state of oversupply.\n\nWhat does this paper add?\nThis study concludes that the GP workforce is not in a state of oversupply, confirming that patient clinical demand increased through both population growth and the aging of the population. Although the number of GPs increased, the number of clinical hours worked by (male) GPs decreased. Therefore, the rise in the number of GPs did not result in a proportional rise in GP workforce capacity. Clearly standardised definitions and inclusions for counting the GP workforce would improve accuracy in measuring this section of the health workforce.\n\nWhat are the implications for practitioners?\nGP workforce supply will require ongoing monitoring over coming years considering the increasing population, the aging of the population, declining clinical GP working hours and the approaching mass retirement of older GPs.\n\n</jats:p>"

However, the mechanisms that facilitate or impede knowledge co-creation within ASCs have not yet been elucidated. In this work, using a systems approach, the authors compare the knowledge systems in two countries with similar characteristics but also major differences in their agrifood sectors: Italy and Greece. In Italy, the analysis indicates a divided but pluralistic system, which facilitates the production and enables the exchange of various types of knowledge. In Greece, the lack of central coordination leads the involved stakeholders to create, test, and share new forms of knowledge. These findings, on the one hand, reveal the ability of interrelated actors to mutually produce context-specific knowledge while, on the other hand, emphasise the importance of creating knowledge spaces within ASCs.</jats:p>",

First, they explore the strengths and appeals of print publishing as opposed to electronic counterparts, highlighting an interesting tension in reader response – that readers prefer the long, written form of the monograph despite research evidence that suggests readers no longer read sources from start to finish. Next, they identify a disconnect between the needs and choices of the writer as well as the reader, and consider issues of formality and informality in relation to new and traditional methods of research outputs. In turn, they highlight the challenge of supplementing traditional forms with smaller units of scholarly production in a way that is verifiable, in-depth, sustains argument, and does not simply mimic monographs. The issue of evaluation in scholarship is then discussed, and institutional and cultural barriers to change are identified in terms of protection and authority. Edmond and Romary ultimately argue that it is not technology that has to change for alternative methods to emerge, become normalised and accepted; but that the culture of the institutions and disciplines needs to stretch to accommodate these possibilities.</jats:p>",

The model delivers a range of growth paths and unemployment rates rather than a single ‘natural rate’. Theoretically, the steady-state growth path may be dynamically stable or unstable, but empirical calibration favours stability. We show analytically that if demand dynamics are stable, supply will converge to the demand-determined growth path. While a minimum unemployment rate ultimately imposes a supply constraint on growth, empirical results show that a wide range of growth rates are feasible across different demand regimes. The results explain how economies can become trapped with low growth due to weak demand or fiscal austerity and suggest policy responses to stagnant demand.</jats:p>",

New trends and new approaches to doing business processes in the region require the construction of resource supply chains in the regions on the basis of self-development and self-sufficiency. There is a need to use the scientific apparatus on the basis of a system-integrated approach, which, according to the authors, is to identify sectors of the resource supply chains of regions on the basis of self-development and establish the relationship between them, forming them into a system (resources) and establishing feedback with the external environment.\nThe article reveals the essence of the formation and planning of resource supply chains in regional commodity markets based on the SCOR-model.\nThe study improved the conceptual and categorical apparatus of business process management at the regional level by introducing the concept of “resource supply chains of regional commodity markets” in a narrow and broad sense. The sectors of formation and planning of resource supply chains of regional commodity markets are proposed, namely: “supply – raw materials – production – distribution – consumption – utilization”. The relations that arise during the business process between the participants of the resource supply chains of regional commodity markets according to the model “3D: space – time – movement” are determined.\nThe process of planning and formation of resource supply chains of regional commodity markets from the standpoint of integrated planning is characterized. It is recommended to form a chain of resource provision of regional and interregional responsible cooperation in the future on the basis of generalization of modern management technologies according to the model – “Flowchart SCOR”.</jats:p>"

We assume that the market demand at the retailer’s end is stochastic, but dependent on price and quality of the product. The final product’s quality depends on the manufacturing process and the raw material’s quality. We first develop models for centralized and decentralized scenarios. Then we try to coordinate the decentralized system with some contract mechanism. We show that revenue sharing contract is not able to coordinate the system, but a composite contract comprised of sales rebate and penalty (SRP) with return is able to coordinate the system. Finally, we illustrate the developed model with a numerical example and show the efficiency of SRP with return policy. We graphically show the effects of various model-parameters on the optimal decisions. Most of the existing literature’s focus on the quality of the finished product, but in this model we incorporate the quality of the raw material as a decision variable along with the finished product quality. We also able to coordinate the three echelon model with a composite contract which is seldom addressed in the existing literatures.</jats:p>",

The structure and operation algorithm of an autonomous power supply system based on a hybrid solarwind power plant and a diesel generator for autonomous agricultural facilities of small and medium power in regions where there is no distribution electric network are proposed. This system will allow for insufficient wind load to ensure reliable power supply to an autonomous agricultural facility with minimal use of diesel fuel. The design of a vortex wind power installation has been developed. The fastening on the shaft of the wind power installation of a conical helical blade with a variable radius, decreasing in the direction from the lower to the upper cut of the socket, improves the efficiency of the installation. The proposed installation makes it possible to use small winds and low-potential thermal ascending air currents, reduce low-frequency vibration and noise, and also increase the stability and efficiency of use of wind energy.</jats:p>"

This aim is achieved by using a simulation method based on the application of volumetric stiffness theory of hydraulic systems and their elements. As a result of a numerical experiment conducted by solving the equations that make up the mathematical model of power supply, its main technical characteristics and the influence of its main design parameters on its functional features and operational properties are obtained. The obtained results showed that by changing the various design parameters of unloading machine, it is possible not only to change the upper (maximum) and lower (minimum) values of the battery charging pressure, but also to adjust their difference depending on the requirements for the power source. The main result of this study is that as a result of a numerical experiment, it is proved that the unloading machine provides a clear relay switching of the pump operation mode from unloading to operating mode and Vice versa. The identified properties make a very promising use of a pump -battery power source in the hydraulic systems of mobile machines and process equipment.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is particularly important to strengthen the real-time monitoring of power supply and distribution system. We choose PLC controller as the control core, and build the building automation power supply and distribution platform by matching with frequency converter, sensor and other equipment. We mainly take the district distribution room as the basic research object, design and optimize the monitoring system with automatic detection function. In this paper, S7-300 PLC is used as the core controller. Through the control program design and WinCC monitoring interface, the field monitoring is realized, and the realization of graphics monitoring system is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ports are primary importance infrastructures when considering the transportation of people and goods across the planet. Two of the biggest issues linked to harbor areas are the pollutant emissions from moored ships, as well as the huge energy demand coming from ships and other activities that take place inside of the port boundaries. To tackle these challenges, the effort on the ship-side is to promote the transition to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) propulsion, while on the harbor-side is to implement electrical ship feeding. In general, using LNG for bunkering purposes implies its storage onshore using dedicated tanks. The regasification of LNG in situ can be exploited to cool down a water-brine flow (i.e. ethyl-alcohol and water). The cold brine can be used to increase the efficiency of a standard inverse cycle to produce cold (i.e. -30°C) used for refrigeration purposes inside ports. Then, the NG flow can be used to produce electrical energy with a standard turbogas cycle with energy recovery from flue gases. The generated electricity directly runs the standard inverse cycle with ethyl-alcohol and water brine to completely fulfill the energy demand for cold thermal power. The electricity still available is then used to supply the onboard systems of moored ships, or otherwise is sold to the users operating in the port. The flue gas coming from the turbogas plant can be used to provide both heating and process heat, through a dedicated heat exchanger and a natural gas boiler. The new envisaged plant can exploit all possible useful effects coming from the regasification process, helping to push towards a greener energy management system in harbor areas, through smart operative integration of the several available energy systems and the implementation of efficient energy smart grids.</jats:p>"

We provide a comparison of water conveyance and potable water reuse over a range of water demands. On a unit basis (US$/1,000 gal) and under current practice, water reuse is generally less costly at low flow rates (&lt;10 mgd) as compared with water conveyances of 20 miles or more. This is true especially for advanced water treatment schemes that are based on biologically activated carbon (BAC). At greater distances (&gt;100 miles), treatment schemes that are based on reverse osmosis (RO) also become cost competitive. Similarly, both BAC‐based and RO‐based reuse schemes have a lower or comparable carbon footprint on a unit basis (g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐equiv/1,000 gal) for a flow rate of 20 mgd.

Society has increased or not in a city or region can be seen from the availability of clean water that available whenever we need it. Provision and development of clean water is an activity directly related to one of the basic needs of the community. The availability of clean water is a necessity, which, if neglected, will have a significant effect on the sustainability of human life. Clean water infrastructure functions to empower water resources for the community. The availability of adequate and enough clean water infrastructure has a significant influence on clean water services. Luwuk District receives a clean water supply from the PDAM sourced from the water treatment plants (WTP) of Keles and WTP of Mangkio. This study aims to (1) Analyze the existing conditions of the clean water infrastructure of Luwuk District, (2) Evaluate the performance of the clean water infrastructure of Luwuk District. The object of research is the PDAM clean water infrastructure. The results showed that the physical condition and performance of the WTP Keles clean water infrastructure was not good while in Mangkio was quite good. It is necessary to have regular and periodic maintenance of the clean water infrastructure in the two water treatment plants to maintain the continuity of the existing infrastructure and maximize the economic life of the support in supply the freshwater needs of the community.

Current surface water discharge conditions have decreased compared to 10 years ago so that there really must be efficiency and wise efforts in the provision of irrigation water in paddy fields. Many efforts to increase the productivity of paddy fields and one of them is by optimizing the area of paddy fields and regulating cropping patterns in the paddy fields. In the initial stage of this study an analysis of the availability of surface water discharge was then analyzed for irrigation water requirements that could be given to each paddy field in accordance with a predetermined cropping pattern. Then a land area simulation is carried out to obtain the most optimal land area. This simulation is carried out in the conditions of the wet season, the normal season and the dry season. Simulations are carried out with various cropping patterns including rice, secondary crops and sugar cane. Simulation results show that the most optimal land area is in the wet season, then the normal season and the dry season.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Methamphetamine was reclassified as a Class A drug in New Zealand in 2003. This meant harsher sentences for people convicted of its manufacture, importation or supply. Despite this, the number of convictions for methamphetamine-related offending continued to increase. In 2019, the New Zealand Court of Appeal agreed to review the sentencing of people convicted of methamphetamine offences on the grounds that some sentences were disproportionately severe. This resulted in a guideline judgment which lowered penalties for offences involving small amounts of methamphetamine (up to 5 grams). Community-based sentences replaced imprisonment as the lower bound of the starting point for sentence calculation. The Court of Appeal highlighted that the presence of addiction, mental health problems or social disadvantage should be taken into account as potential mitigating factors in sentencing. The Court accepted that these factors diminished moral culpability and reduced the deterrent impact of prison sentences. In this article we review the law and policy background to the New Zealand Court of Appeal proceedings, and discuss the reasoning behind the Court’s judgment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background: A remarkable decline in fertility rates has been observed in many countries, with a primary determinant being an increase in the use of contraceptives. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of demand and supply-side factors associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan. Method: Secondary data analysis of four data series of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS 1990–91, 2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) were used. The data includes ever-married women aged 15–49 years who had given birth in the previous five years and participated in the family-planning module of the PDHS. A total number of 25,318 women were included in the analysis. Data was analysed by investigating the associations between independent variables (demand and supply-side factors) and the use of contraceptive measures through unadjusted Odds Ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR). Results: A majority of the women were illiterate and not in employment. There was an increase in the number of women who did not use contraceptive methods in rural areas over time. Among demand-side factors, the results indicated that, in 2012–13, women without media exposure were less likely to use contraceptives (OR 0.396, 95% CI 0.353–0.442), and the trend remains almost constant for 2017–18 (OR 0.432, 95% CI 0.391–0.477). These findings change slightly in the adjusted analysis (AOR 0.664, 95% CI 0.562–0.784) in 2012–13 and (AOR 0.654, 95% CI 0.483–0.885) in 2017–18; however, they still show a lower likelihood of using contraceptives without media exposure. Among supply-side factors, the results indicated that absence of transport (2012–13) and limited visits by family-planning workers over the previous 12 months (2006–07, 2012–13, and 2017–18) remained significant factors for not using contraceptive methods. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that certain demand and supply-side factors are associated with the use of contraceptive measures in Pakistan. It highlights the need for the provision of family-planning resources and further structural factors, particularly in remote areas.</jats:p>"

This chapter provides a high-level summary of SWT to help better understand the impact that this technology will have on wider enterprise information architectures. In many cases it also reuses familiar concepts with a new twist. For example, “ontologies” for “data dictionaries” and “semantic models” for “data models.” This chapter presents the usefulness of a proposed architecture by applying a theory to integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources which entails dealing with semantic mapping between source schema and a resource description framework (RDF) ontology described declaratively using specific query language (i.e. SPARQL) queries. Finally, the semantic of query rewriting is further discussed and a query rewriting algorithm is presented. </jats:p>"

To test this, we compiled leaf vein and stomatal density data from 520 land vascular plant species including derived angiosperms, basal angiosperms, gymnosperms and ferns. We found global coordination across vascular land plants, although the relationships were not significant in gymnosperms and vessel-less angiosperms. By comparing the evolution of xylem conduit elements with variation in the density of veins and stomata and theoretical stomatal conductance among plant lineages, we found that the physiological advantage of modern angiosperms is associated with the emergence of xylem with low intraconduit resistance and leaves with high vein and stomata densities. Thus our results indicate two major events associated with surges in xylem hydraulic capacity in angiosperms: (1) the origin of vessels and (2) the emergence of vessels with simple perforation plates, which diminished physical limitations on stomatal conductance. These evolutionary innovations may have enabled derived angiosperms to be more productive and adaptive to the changing climate.\n</jats:p>"

Due to the development of a diversified supply chain financial subject platform, there is a lack of risk control in terms of theory and practice. Big data is generated in Internet applications and combined with information technology to form big data technology. It can provide financial institutions with large-scale data analysis methods and can effectively improve the efficiency and ability of financial institutions to serve supply chain members. However, big data has some problems, such as higher processing cost, lower authenticity, and difficulty in effectively protecting the privacy and security of users. There are many problems with this new development model. This article focuses on the risk problems faced by supply chain finance. It discusses the use of big data technology to effectively solve the supply chain financial risk problems, and gives some measures that can be effectively solved for how to effectively avoid these risk factors. By effectively solving the financial risk problem in the era of big data, it provides guarantee for the benign development of enterprises, and provides a certain reference for researchers engaged in related fields and workers in this field.</jats:p>"

In this regard, it is extremely urgent to develop a backbone and local IT platforms that unite participants in the supply chain to collect and analyze information for making optimal management decisions. The purpose of this study is to substantiate the main methodological principles of the formation of digital communications between participants in the supply chain to create an inter-corporate information and communication system. In preparing the material, such scientific methods as analysis and synthesis, process modeling, process method, and system approach were used. A model for organizing digital communication in the supply chain using the backbone communication IT platform is proposed. The role of digital trust in the organization of inter-corporate digital communication is shown, and the entropy factor is also taken into account when assessing the throughput of communication channels. The result of the study is the formulation and justification of methodological principles for the introduction of multi-channel digital communication, providing not only electronic data exchange between logistics partners, but also reducing the logistic and transaction costs of supply chain participants.</jats:p>"

Hijab fashion is a green and sustainable fashion in accordance with Islamic principles on the modesty, safety, cleanliness, and comfort of clothings. Hijab supply chain is an indispensable issue, predominantly for Muslim consumers, manufacturers, and suppliers that oblige global Muslim markets. Nonetheless, research on Hijab fashion is very limited. More specifically, although knowledge of products has a significant consequence on consumers’ intention to buy Hijab, no preceding research have attempted to hypothesize the relationship between the knowledge dimensions of Hijab supply chain and consumer purchase intention. This paper attempts to propose an initial framework regarding Hijab purchase behavior. After an overall search of research articles directed in journal reference lists and electronic databases, the conceptual framework was created to hand out a set of propositions highlighting how to strengthen the link between consumers’ knowledge dimensions and their intention to purchase Hijab. Recommendations for future research and strategies to boost the advantages for Hijab fashion suppliers, manufacturers, and marketers can be obtained from this model.</jats:p>"

Depending on the agrotechnical operating conditions of sprinklers, the systems diff er from each other in terms  of energy and operating costs in 1.5…4.2 times. The paper considers a problem of choosing the optimal power supply system  for a sprinkler unit working under specifi c conditions. The author has examined power supply systems for sprinklers: a hydraulic  drive with a rotating hydraulic motor; a hydraulic drive with a reciprocating hydraulic motor; a mechanical drive; an electric drive  powered by a cable line, an overhead line, a portable generator or accumulator batteries, which are all characterized by an individual resulting quality indicator. This indicator can be represented by any parameter of the system. Applying the theory of vector synthesis, he has chosen the effi ciency criterion as an indicator that takes into account the system parameters: specifi c power, energy losses, reliability indicator, operating costs, cost and mass of the system elements; as well as agrotechnical conditions: inlet pressure, distance from the water reservoir and centralized energy supply system, investments in sprinklers, irrigation rate, irrigation area and irrigation profi t. According to the effi ciency criterion, a graphical solution to the problem has been presented and it has been established that systems with an electric drive and various power sources are feasible for areas of more than 40 hectares, those with a hydraulic drive – for an irrigated area of less than 40 hectares, and those with a mechanical drive – less than 6 hectares.</jats:p>"

It is found that the increases of economic policy uncertainty will enhance the long- term volatility of copper. Moreover, the violent fluctuation of copper price caused by the impact of powerful economic policy uncertainty will weaken the demand confidence of refined copper market and lead to the phenomenon of oversupply. On the contrary, the moderate fluctuation of copper price due to the impact of weak economic policy uncertainty will boost the demand confidence of refined copper market and lead to the phenomenon of short supply.</jats:p>"

Thus, in this chapter, the authors use Collaborative Planning Forecasting Replenishment (CPFR) model as a reference and adapt it for medical tourism services. The focus of this chapter is on the collaboration between an assistance company and a medical institution. This chapter suggests a collaborative MTSSC operations framework including steps, tools, and techniques for collaboration arrangement and joint business plans, demand planning and forecasting, balancing the demand and capacity, the execution phase, and the final performance measurement. It describes how multiple supply chain partners intelligence could be combined to fulfill demand of medical tourists by aligning the planned actions and available resources with the real execution process by a set of tools and techniques. </jats:p>"

Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods for assessing HH are often associated with a high level of uncertainty and a low level of consensus. As a result, it remains challenging to perform a robust assessment of HH impacts with a suitable LCIA method. This study aims to systematically compare six commonly used LCIA methods for quantifying HH impacts, in order to empirically understand the potential impacts of aviation biofuel production on HH and how the results are affected by the choice of methods. Three aviation biofuel production pathways based on different feedstocks (sugarcane, eucalyptus, and macauba) were analyzed and compared to fossil aviation biofuels, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 MJ aviation fuel. The majority of the LCIA methods suggest that, in respect to midpoint impacts, macauba-based biofuel is associated with the lowest impacts and eucalyptus-based biofuel the highest; whereas at endpoint level, the results are more scattered. The LCIA methods agree that biomass conversion into aviation biofuel, H2 production, and feedstock cultivation are major contributors to life cycle HH impacts. Additionally, we provide a guideline for determining an appropriate method for assessing HH impacts.</jats:p>"

It has been substantiated that the most important indicators of social control are embedded in the self-assessments of servicemen in terms of the following parameters: 1) verification of compliance with the norms, rules and procedures of servicemen’s activities; 2) compliance with the norms, rules and procedures for the provision of military personnel, including food. It is proved that in modern conditions the current system of social control cannot eliminate the manifestation of negative tendencies in the system of relations of a modern military collective. The necessity is substantiated and the directions of improving the food supply system for military personnel are presented: 1) the formation of a comprehensive model of social control of food supply for military units (integration of external, internal, self-controlling substructures of control); 2) strengthening the existing model of supplying an additional component of proactive food support for military personnel, which determines the storage of food stocks and mechanisms for effective interaction with the structures of the agro-industrial complex in conditions of a destabilizing situation, local conflict, and peacekeeping operations.</jats:p>"

The Sole Gas Project was always technically robust since the first development plan was assessed and selected but required a market signal for it to be commercialised and funded. As the foundation target in its burgeoning domestic gas strategy, Cooper Energy acquired the Sole gas field (VIC/L32) and the Orbost Gas Plant in two stages and pursued creative steps to combine focused subsurface and engineering techniques, a drilling campaign, partners, funding, gas marketing, regulators and community to deliver new gas supply without a single offshore lost-time injury or incident.\n</jats:p>"

In this article, the authors proposed a collaborative system with ramp type seasonal pattern demand rate for expiring items with supplier's random lead time under crisp and fuzzy environment considering the effect of inflation and time value of money. For the seasonal kind of items, demand rate follows the combination of increasing-steady-decreasing demand patterns. A supplier's lead time is a stochastic function of his managing cost; thus, the extra costs incurred on the retailer due to the uncertainty in lead time in terms of shortages costs and lost sales costs are owed by the supplier. Numerical examples are cited to illustrate the results and its significant features. Finally, to study the effect of change of parameters sensitivity analysis is presented and necessary observations are made.</jats:p>",

This situation has led to imbalance and wastage. In addition, sustained efforts to reuse/recycle the goods produced by different business organizations are inadequate. SCM plays a role in re-usability of goods and recycling of used goods. Organizations have to redesign their supply chains to achieve the objective of the circular economy, which propagates the concept of wealth out of waste by reusing/recycling the products. The research in the area of the role of the supply chain in the circular economy is just gaining its importance, and it is still in the nascent stage.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental problems are one of the major concerns in China due to booming industries and large-scale production. Manufacturing industries must change the traditional approaches of production and supply chain management practices to cope with environmental issues. For this purpose, a multidisciplinary and empirical study has been conducted in China. In the manufacturing industries around the world, there is a noticeable transition in human resource management approaches toward green human resource management (GHRM). However, green training could be considered as a critical element of GHRM and could be used as an instrument to trigger emotional intelligence (EI) of the employees, which could make them more responsible toward the external environment and result in improved green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. Similarly, regulatory pressures could also enforce manufacturing industries to contribute positively to GSCM practices. In addition, taking into account the two critical functions of GSCM practices, that is, green purchasing and eco-design, this research study attempted to bring under consideration that GSCM practices could be enhanced through EI as well. For this purpose, data were collected from 250 manufacturing industries of China through a convenient sampling technique, and structural equation modeling was applied through Smart-PLS version 3.2.7 to measure and validate the model of this study. The findings of the study revealed that GSCM practices could be improved through regulatory pressures, and EI could be used as a mediating factor to enhance the relationship between GHRM (green training) and GSCM practices. </jats:p>",

The use of energy storage systems reduces fuel consumption for an autonomous power station. Reducing the northern import of liquid fuel is a relevant task for Russia. The organization of the charge-discharge process of an energy system storage according to the criterion of the minimum daily fuel consumption depends on both the load schedule and the type of flow rate characteristic of the primary engine. When making design and investment decisions on the feasibility of using alternative technical solutions for the modernization of sources in isolated energy supply systems, a comparative assessment of their economic efficiency is necessary. The paper studies the choice of energy storage system power in terms of fuel economy, reducing the installed capacity of a power station for electric power supply systems.</jats:p>"

For this reason, supply chain management is one of the most important strategies in knowing the needs of customers. One example of the application in supply chain management that is currently done in Malang is a small and medium enterprise (MSME). These small and medium businesses use worm media as fertilizer. The business has two manufacturing processes namely solid fertilizer and liquid fertilizer. In the supply chain management model using 3 different models and can be known the comparison between the first SCM model to the third SCM model. The difference starts from the first SCM model that is 9:11 wherein a supply chain process from the beginning to the end it can still have an error of 2 times the error in structured management. And in the second SCM model that is 10:11 were in a supply chain process from beginning to end still has an error of 1 time in structured management. In the third SCM model 11:11 which states that in a supply chain process from beginning to end there are no errors in structured management. And in this 3rd SCM model, it can be said to be a very efficient model in the supply chain process.</jats:p>"

Despite contributing to the rapid development of IoT applications, the current IoT-centric architecture has led to a myriad of isolated data silos that hinder the full potential of holistic data-driven decision-support applications with the IoT because of technical issues (e.g., standalone IoT applications suffer from security and privacy-related problems).

Some firms establish a line of moral disengagement, beyond which they distance themselves from the impact of the activities of the supply chain. This research addresses the question of why some managers choose to take responsibility for the sustainability of their supply chain, while others do not. We argue that the ethical predisposition and moral complexity of the individual employee moderates the interpretation of the drivers of sustainability, increasing or decreasing their ability to build a business case for supply chain responsibility. We also argue that ethical predisposition moderates the likelihood of a business case being enacted. We then discuss theoretical and managerial implications resulting from this finding.</jats:p>"

Linking both concepts conceptually and in policy practice could provide for synergies and enable more effective approaches against global deforestation. To operationalise such a linkage, a prerequisite is the knowledge of both concepts’ key characteristics, as well as resulting similarities and differences. This literature review firstly identifies key characteristics that affects the potential impact of such concepts, secondly analyses if and how REDD+ and DFSC define these characteristics, and thirdly compares both concepts towards a potential linkage. The results show that a linkage of REDD+ and DFSC provides numerous complementarities which could foster the goal of halting deforestation. This includes for example the driver commercial agriculture, and in terms of permanence, leakage, and degradation. But close coordination is needed to avoid unintended negative consequences, especially for subsistence and smallholder agriculture. The comparison shows that the political consensus found under REDD+ provides a good basis to be supplemented with private sectors’ DFSC initiatives, but additional initiatives like the Bonn Challenge and investments in agroforestry are needed in order to ensure the long-term effect on forest conversion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relevance of the research topic is caused by the need to form new innovative approaches in the field of heat supply, aimed at modernizing thermal power plants that provide heat to urban areas. In recent years, the Russian government has adopted several state programs related to environmental protection, directed towards reducing the emission of harmful substances into the atmosphere. Thermal power plants are objects whose emissions significantly pollute the environment. Considering the wear of equipment, according to various estimates, reaches 60-80% in different regions, such equipment is extremely necessary to be modernized. Using the mechanism of public-private partnership in the field of heat supply is examined in this study. An algorithm for constructing a model in the field of creating mini thermal power plants is considered. They provide heat supply to individual urban areas, as well as to ensure a significant reduction in the level of environmental pollution. The main financial indicators are estimated based on the above algorithm. This project’s performance is assessed on the basis of financing both from the state and private companies. Conclusions about using the proposed model for the development of heat supply are drawn.</jats:p>"

To make these targets, four management strategies of lean, agile, resilient and green have been separately proposed. Recently, studies have been performed with a consideration of these four strategies simultaneously named LARG (Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green). However, due to the novelty of this subject, the mathematical modeling of SCND (Supply Chain Network Design) has not been addressed in LARG strategy. SCND is one of the most essential parts of supply chain management that strategic decisions of it have heavily effects in both overall and partial applicability of the supply chain. The goal of this paper is to design a closed loop supply chain network considering LARG strategy using multi-objective modeling with uncertain demand. The objective functions are total profit, customer satisfaction and total pollution. The model is formulated to determine which facility sites should be selected (strategic decisions), and find out the optimal number of parts and products in the network (tactical decisions). Finally, a real industrial case study is provided to illustrate the performance and applicability of the LARG strategy in SCND in practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The past three decades have witnessed tremendous growth of supply chain activities around the globe thanks to the lowered trade barriers and free trade agreements among countries. The global supply chain management literature developed during this time provided theoretical frameworks and decision support tools for operational and supply chain decisions in the global context. Recent development in trade barrier debates as well as increasing uncertainties in countries’ trade policies have forced companies to rethink their global operational strategies. In this short paper, we draw insights from the existing global supply chain literature and in particular, focus on interpreting recent research contributions published in Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management (M&amp;SOM) on the topic to gain understanding of the implications of trade policies, especially tariffs, for firms’ global facility network design decisions. We also provide a discussion of important dimensions that were absent from the existing literature but are pertinent to providing a richer understanding of implications of trade policies for today’s interconnected supply chains. Future research that takes into consideration those previously less explored dimensions has the potential to offer insights not only to industry practitioners but also, to the policy makers. Developing an appreciation of potential reactions from complex connected supply chains in various industries would help policy makers better anticipate the impact of trade policy change. </jats:p>",

A flexible-Translog profit function permits the application of dual theory in the analysis of livestock product supply and factor demand responsiveness using farm-level household data. The results indicate that own-price elasticities were elastic for cattle, while goat and sheep were inelastic. Cross-price and scale elasticities were found to be within inelastic range in all cases, with the goat being a preferred substitute for cattle. All factor inputs demand elasticities were inelastic with the exception of elastic cattle output prices and labour cost. Thus, the recommended policy option would be supportive pro-pastoral price policies, enhanced investment in pastureland improvement and an increasing wage rate, since these assume key significance in improving the livestock production/marketing.</p>"

Within the conducted research, specialization and decentralization stand out as the elements with the greatest impact on improving the quality of products/services, shortening delivery times, resolving complaints more efficiently and reducing costs of the supply chain. The results of the study indicate that delegating competencies and responsibilities within a company, along with motivating staff to become more committed to and influence the activities they perform, is a key organizational prerequisite for establishing an efficient supply chain management, which is one of the key qualitative indicators of any company's market and business success.</jats:p>"

This article employed the qualitative research approach grounded on documents/textual content analysis of literature extracted from databases of Scopus, Science Direct, and LISTA. Findings revealed that academic libraries should utilize interlending and document supply to fulfill growing and diverse demands for information. The ability to fulfill information needs requires diverse knowledge and the skills of librarians, information resources, and infrastructure to strengthen interlending and document supply.

The interviewees were managers from Brazilian HSC organizations. Four dimensions and 14 variables identified in a literature review were used to perform categorical content analysis. The findings suggest organizations, while aware of their critical information and internal processes, lack the necessary metrics to measure the impacts of possible failures. It seems organizations tend to invest in standard security measures, while apparently ignoring the specificity and complexity of information in HSCs.</jats:p>"

The model takes the past 10 years’ data of average and worst-case sky coverage (clouds fraction) condition of a location at a time interval (window) of per 6 min in every day to predict solar energy and electrical energy harvest. The electrical energy obtained from solar energy in sunny times must meet the instantaneous energy demand and also the need for energy storage for nighttime and overcast days, so that no single day will have a shortage of energy supply in the entire year and yearly cycles. The analysis can eventually determine a best starting date of operation, a least solar collection area, and a least energy storage capacity for cost-effectiveness of the system. The algorithm provides a fundamental tool for the design of a general renewable energy harvest and storage system for non-interrupted year-round power supply. As an example, the algorithm was applied for the authors’ local city, Tucson, Arizona of the U.S. for a steady power supply of 1 MW.</jats:p>",

It aims to reveal the reasons for a considerable decline in delivery and distribution of food products at the local level and to analyze the actions of the local authorities in their efforts to solve the problems of food shortage. The research rationale consists in touching upon a subject that hasn’t yet drawn the local historians’ attention and hasn’t been highlighted in regional historiography. The study is based on the analysis of archival sources and on the implementation of microhistorical approach. The data from various documents reveals a decline in local residents’ food consumption in the studied period. There were problems with food supply in Eastern and front line areas, but the situation was most severe in the areas freed from occupation. The mortality rate due to starvation was registered in a number of areas. Apart from objective necessity to send some part of food supplies to the front line, there were also subjective factors affecting the situation with food supply in the region. Among them were malfunctioning of regional procurement, inability of trade units to achieve proper planning, timely delivery of goods, and effective control over their distribution. Food shortage was aggravated by looting, self-supply that heads of organizations and authorities practiced. Personnel issues were an acute problem. The senior posts in the kolkhozes, village Soviets, and party bodies were held by citizens who lacked managerial skills, were prone to influence peddling and often callous to the people. Therefore, mismanagement and malconduct of some administrators resulted in a situation when the potential of centralized food supply system aimed at giving help to the most vulnerable and insuring their survival under the conditions of war was not fulfilled.</jats:p>"

Steam-water injectors are very sensitive to changes in the thermodynamic parameters of water and steam. The operating range of such devices is limited to boiling liquids. The search for ranges of thermodynamic parameters that ensure the operation of the injector in real conditions of functioning of heating networks is an urgent task. The maximum energy-saving effect can be achieved by replacing devices that reduce steam pressure by injectors in which there will be a simultaneous decrease in steam pressure, heat transfer between steam and return network water to achieve the necessary thermodynamic parameters of the mixed flow. The article presents the results of modeling the operation of a steam-water injector with a cylindrical mixing chamber, taking into account the actual values of temperatures and pressures in the heating network. With constant parameters of hot steam, the possible ranges of the injector for the temperatures and pressures necessary for the implementation of temperature schedules for regulating heating networks are determined. The procedure for identifying input parameters that ensure the implementation of temperature schedules of heating networks has been carried out. Equations are obtained that allow one to determine the temperature of the water leaving the injector from the injection coefficient for the found working pressure ranges of the injected water.</jats:p>"

The method applied to achieve this goal is a system dynamics methodology which is a modeling approach based on systemic thinking and uses perspectives based on information feedback and delay to understand the complex behavior dynamics of physical, biological and social systems, which occur in the supply chain management. The results showed that through the development of a hybrid production system and quality engineering in supply chain management of the Gayo Arabica coffee industry has been able to respond to the dynamics of consumer order. Scenario I and II made changes to model parameters which resulted in an increase in business profit obtained by company, while smallholder plantations did not experience changes in the profits of their business. Scenario III carried out a structural change model that was divided into two parts, namely the Scenario IIIA which applied institutional innovation between governance of public plantation relations with agro-industrial cooperatives in the form of coffee bean delivery system, while Scenario IIIB applied the governance of public plantation relations with agroindustry cooperatives in the form of transaction systems coffee bean. The results of Scenario IIIA are able to increase the value added and benefit obtained by smallholder plantation and be able to increase company profits and maintain customer satisfaction simultaneously. Scenario IIIB results are only able to increase company profits and maintain customer satisfaction, while increasing profits and value added of smallholder plantations do not occur.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:italic>A post-publication change was made to this article on 11 Mar 2020 to correct the conference title in the PDF header.</jats:italic>\n               </jats:p>",

Developed countries are characterized by having good infrastructures such as roads, bridges, office towers, residential buildings, seaports and airports. To have these infrastructures, massive construction projects must be implemented by construction industry. This industry consists of several activities such as extracting raw materials, manufacturing construction’s materials, construction projects, infrastructure operational, and after operational activities that are run by different organizations and companies. These organizations and companies configure construction industry supply networks. Despite of the positive impact of these supply networks in improving human and product mobility, these supply networks also responsible for significant negative impacts such as consuming high energy and material resources, producing greenhouse gas emission and creating waste. To monitor and maintain these negative impacts, a sustainability assessment process is required. This paper aims to review sustainability assessment process in construction industry supply networks. It was found that different indicators are required for assessing activities in each stage of supply networks.</jats:p>",

One of the factors that caused this was the low incentives received by farmers so that farmers were reluctant to carry out production in the following year. As the main actor in the national salt industry, farmer’s welfare needs to be considered to ensure the sustainability of salt production. This study aims to develop a dynamic model of the salt production supply chain by identifying internal and external factors that influence the system. We use system dynamic methods because this framework can model nonlinear equations among variables and can represent feedbacks loop relationships. From the base model simulation results, we developed a scenario to improve the welfare of salt farmers. By using the scenario of land intensification with filtering – threaded technology, geomembrane, and tunnel system, farmer’s profits could be increased up to Rp 13,830,300 per ha per season in the shortest dry season.</jats:p>",

To overcome these challenges, there is a need for a more robust supply chain (SC) which will help in information sharing and reduce overall cost. The chapter determines the key drivers of Indian pharmaceutical SC, and draws the attention of industry, stakeholders, and top management to emphasise on these drivers to enhance the performance and profitability of SC. An interpretive structural modelling-based approach has been employed to model the pharmaceutical SC key drivers. The 16 key parameters have been identified across all major dimensions such as SC, HR, &amp; organizational, market, technology, and reverse logistics. Further fuzzy MICMAC analysis is done to categorize based on their driving and dependence power. The factors like collaborative relationship among SC partners, quality regulations, third party logistics, and end-to-end responsive SC are found to be more important enablers. </jats:p>"

The study was a descriptive survey research. The population included 942 head of departments in the two public universities located in Cross River State, Nigeria. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 250 respondents from the universities studied. The instrument designated ‘Electricity Prices For Political Socialization Questionnaire (EPFPSQ)’ was designed to collect data for the study. The instrument was validated and had a reliability co-efficient of 0.853. The data collected were analyzed using frequency counts and percentage score. The study revealed that electricity supply prices, through management techniques of cost effectiveness, cost efficiency, access to and control of education moderately empowered the university system for political socialization. Electricity prices showed inadequate contributions with weak impact on benefit-related factors for political socialization. Government did not provide support in electricity price reduction though encouraged investment in electricity supply through Power Holding Company Ltd (PHCN). It was concluded that the perception of electricity supply prices could guarantee political socialization towards functionality in university education. Some of the recommendations made were: universities should give attention to electricity supply prices for political socialization. Government should see electricity supply prices and political socialization as a sine-qua-non for functionality in university education.</jats:p>"

The traditional approach is to use a rotating motor, after a series of conversion mechanisms, and then push the load to make a linear motion. However, this method not only has shortcomings of low efficiency, low precision, high cost, slow response, but also causes a lot of energy loss during the motion conversion process. The emergence of linear motors has made these problems well solved. The driving power supply can provide a stable working voltage for the linear motor and keep the working state of the motor, so it is the core device of the linear motor.</jats:p>",

The aim of the research is to provide answers to the following questions, which refer to the hospitality sector: Are hospitality workers familiar with characteristics of functional food? Do hospitality workers face demand of functional food? Is there an option of preparing functional food in restaurants where the respondents work? Are guests willing to pay extra for preparation of food which is beneficial to their health? The survey included respondents (n= 105) in restaurants in Novi Sad (AP Vojvodina, Serbia). Based on the conducted survey, we came to a conclusion that workers are acquainted with the term of functional food. Visitors of hospitality facilities (guests) often demand such food, and restaurants have an option of preparing food which is beneficial to health, but consumers are not completely prepared to compensate on food taste for health benefits.</jats:p>"

Metaheuristics have emerged as an essential tool for effective engineering design and operations. Nevertheless, conventional metaheuristics still struggle to reach optimality in the face of highly complex engineering problems. Aiming to further boost the performance of conventional metaheuristics, strategies such as hybridization and various enhancements have been added into the existing solution methods. In this work, swarm intelligence techniques were employed to solve the real-world, large-scale biofuel supply chain problem. Additionally, the supply chain problem considered in this chapter is multiobjective (MO) in nature. Comparative analysis was then performed on the swarm techniques. To further enhance the search capability of the best solution method (GSA), the Lévy flight component from the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm was incorporated into the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) technique; developing the novel Lévy-GSA technique. Measurement metrics were then utilized to analyze the results. </jats:p>"

Many of these deaths are being attributed to fentanyl and related analogs, which have been increasingly found within street-level stimulant supplies. Within this, people experiencing socio-economic marginalization are at the greatest risk of overdose and other harms from adulterated stimulants. Current treatments for stimulant use disorder have limited effectiveness, and even less applicability to the lived realities of marginalized stimulant users. Emerging technologies, such as drug checking, are being implemented to support safer stimulant use, but the accessibility and utility of these technologies to stimulant users are framed by experiences of vulnerability that render them largely ineffective.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Stimulant safe supply</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Solutions that provide a legal and safe supply of non-adulterated stimulants of known quality, and within a health care framework, are needed to directly address the risk of an increasingly adulterated stimulant supply. Similar innovative opioid-focused interventions are being piloted with medications that have a similar pharmacological effect as their illicit counterparts. While there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for stimulant use, research has demonstrated a number of stimulant medications that are promising substitutes for cocaine and methamphetamine use. Much like with opioid-focused pharmacotherapies, having a consistent and safe supply of stimulants can lead to improved health outcomes and will drastically reduce overdose risk. However, for a stimulant safe supply intervention to be a success, it must provide the high and performance-enhancing effects that people seek from the illicit market, which requires doses and user agency that trials to date have not provided.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Efforts are needed to investigate the feasibility of pharmacological stimulant-based interventions that address safe supply needs. The promise of similar opioid-focused approaches in addressing both overdose-related risks and experiences related to vulnerability underscores the need to advance safe supply approaches targeted towards people who use stimulants. Given the current overdose crisis and rising stimulant use across North America, the implementation and evaluation of such novel stimulant-focused interventions should be a public health priority.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The soils in karst regions, with carbonate rocks as the background material, are characterized by two main factors, drought and high calcium levels. Handeliodendron bodinieri (Levl.) Rehd is an endemic plant species in this area of China. However, few studies have been carried out on the adaptation mechanism of H. bodinieri to drought and high calcium soil. To reveal the physiological responses of H. bodinieri to exogenous calcium under drought stress, 10% PEG-6000 was used to simulate drought stress, and the effects of exogenous calcium at different concentrations on the physiology of H. bodinieri seedlings under drought stress were studied. The results showed that drought stress significantly reduced the relative water content and water potential of H. bodinieri seedlings. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, O2− and H2O2 production rates significantly increased under drought stress. The addition of exogenous calcium significantly reduced MDA content and O2− and H2O2 production rates. Moreover, peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities increased significantly under drought stress. At the same time, the accumulation of osmotic regulators such as soluble sugar, betaine and free proline also increased significantly. The addition of exogenous calcium further increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the accumulation of osmotic regulatory substances. Consequently, the oxidative stress and osmotic stress induced by drought decreased. Finally, exogenous calcium enhanced the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) of H. bodinieri under drought stress and significantly improved water use efficiency (WUE). This study confirmed that the application of exogenous calcium can enhance the water condition, photosynthetic capacity, osmotic regulation and antioxidant capacity of H. bodinieri under drought stress. Of the treatments, the 10 mmol·L−1 CaCl2 treatment is more likely to improve survival of H. bodinieri under drought tolerance. This study provides an important reference for describing the adaptation mechanism and appropriate conservation of H. bodinieri under drought and high calcium conditions.</jats:p>"

The results of a numerical experiment carried out by numerically solving the equations that make up the mathematical model of a power source are also presented. As a result of a numerical experiment, the main technical capabilities of the considered power source and the influence of its main structural parameters and functional features of the system on operational properties are revealed. The results showed that due to changes in various design parameters of the unloading machine, you can not only change the upper (maximum) and lower (minimum) values of the battery charging pressure, but also adjust their difference depending on the requirements for the power source.</jats:p>"

It is interesting to note that currently the concept does not have a specific definition, because it is in a boom in recent years, which makes it an attractive topic to investigate and learn more in depth. In Colombia it has very few exponents of the subject.

Reducing competition should help domestic agricultural producers to work effectively and reach a leading position in their food segment. The importance to study the emerging risks and threats in relation to the regional food supply system in the process of import substitution is connected with the fact that without proper understanding and analysis, a significant number of problems of economic, social and managerial relations in the food turnover both within the state and within the borders of a separate region can arise.

This high voltage directs current (HVDC) power supply was built around three basic compartments that include an adjustable low voltage power supply (LVPS), a high frequency oscillator, and a line output transformer (LOPT) using flyback transformer, NE555timer, BU508D BJT, and other off-the-shelf components. The current-voltage relationship at the output of the constructed High Voltage Direct Current was found to be linear. This power source will serve any high DC voltage applications such as electrospinning. The constructed 30kV power supply has been tested in the electrospinning laboratory of the Center for Energy Research and Development (CERD) Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Ile-Ife. The unit successfully electrospun Zinc-Titaninm polymeric solution into fibers at about 8 kV. The importance of this fabricated device is its high reliability despite its low cost and capability to produce different magnitude of high voltage DC.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a comprehensive configuration for supply chain management process, and it enables to understand relationships among supply chain integration, supply chain strategies, supply chain risk factors, and performance criteria. By reviewing the literature and using experts' knowledge, supply chain configuration criteria are determined. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is employed to consider the interrelations between criteria. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is a suitable tool due to the presence of causalities and relationships among criteria and the difficulty of expressing the interrelations with crisp numbers. It also deals with uncertain and vague data and allows representing hesitation. The application is conducted in an automobile factory, which is one of the largest manufacturers in Turkey. The results show that selection of proper supplier is the most significant supply chain configuration criteria. Thus, the importance of supplier selection criteria is also analyzed as the second phase of the study.</jats:p>",

Though SCF applicability in Financial Supply Chain management has recently been studied to relieve access to capital sources, managerial perspective of SCF solutions is still uninvestigated as well as few other areas. The research suggests a managerial algorithm that contains four developed models: the model of Collaborative cash conversion cycle two models of SCF solutions and the model of Joint Working Capital optimization. The models imply using such SCF solutions as Factoring, Reverse Factoring and Inventory Financing to improve Joint Working Capital in terms of costs on it and liquidity of both supply chain members and entire chain, providing the optimal conditions of SCF solutions. Quantitative optimization with SCF solutions demonstrates on the cases of supply chains the improvement of financial position and liquidity of all chain members. The research has a potential to de applied in businesses since the algorithm represents a comprehensive managerial tool for Joint Working capital management in supply chains. It might be used to achieve optimal cash conversion cycle values for minimal supply chain costs on working capital constrained by liquidity and profitability target levels.</jats:p>"

However, technology that is adopted by many firms in an industry can shift the basic supply relationship, increasing total production while lowering farm prices. While generally beneficial to consumers, this result can reduce (or completely offset) benefits for farmers, especially late or non-adopters. Our objective is to assess the market dynamics of alternative assumptions about exogenous productivity-enhancing technology adoption by Brazilian dairy farms. Of particular interest is the distributional impact on farm incomes and on the proportion of milk production for different farm size classes. To achieve this objective, we developed an empirical System Dynamics model that evaluates market and farm profitability impacts from 2006 to 2016. We simulated six counterfactual scenarios comprising three rates of adoption (slow, medium and fast) by two farm size categories (small and large). Technology adoption impact differs in the short- and long-term and depending on the assumed rates and farm sizes. Non-adopters of technology can experience lower incomes and a smaller production and income shares when other farms adopt. The underlying causal structure of farm profitability and the herd management decisions suffices to explain the potential market exclusion of non-adopting farms (especially small-scale farms) when others adopt.</jats:p>",

Supplier selection in all these processes is a decision-making process playing a significant role in the success of enterprises. The most critical point in this decision-making process is the criteria used in the supplier selection process because they directly affect the selection of supplier that is appropriate for the strategy of the enterprise. In this chapter, the optimal quantity of products to be purchased from suppliers were determined through a solution offer that authors named as compromise optimal system design. For the recommended solution, first, a new model was introduced by arranging Multiobjective Supplier Selection problem based on the De Novo assumption, and then Compromise Programming was used for the solution of this model. The developed solution procedure was used to determine the amount of blending machine to be purchased from the green supplier of a milling machine manufacturer. </jats:p>"

Using the case study strategy, 20 interviews were carried out with enterprises, direct suppliers and outsourced suppliers to cover the direct supply chain. Hence, were analyzed three categories - social responsibility, health and safety, and supplier development - and their 15 indicators. The results indicate that the formalization impacts on the insertion of social indicators, mainly in the category of health and safety. In addition, it was identified the possibility of informal work, even in the formalized companies, which demonstrates the need for a new look at this variable. With empirical demonstration, this study contributes to the study of social indicators in the supply chain and draws attention to informal labour relations in the local context.</jats:p>"

Conventional trading has been carried out bymicro and small and medium enterprises (UMKM) entrepreneurs in the village of Penglatan who arecraftsmen of Buleleng dodol. Dodol craftsmen in the village of Penglatan, which is a home industrythat sells dodol products to collectors, then collectors distribute dodol products typical of Buleleng toall districts in Bali. This causes the home industry in the village of Penglatan difficult to developbecause it can not handle direct requests. Another problem faced is the difficulty of the craftsmen incalculating the need for raw materials in producing dodol typical of Buleleng when there is an order.Implementation of supply chain management in e-commerce that was developed to manage the supplyof dodol raw materials in accordance with orders that enter the system. This is expected to help dodolcraftsmen in the village of Penglatan in determining the need for raw materials needed to produceorders and provide electronic-based trading media. Determination of raw material requirements forproducing dodol is calculated by applying the concept of master requirements planning. Thedeveloped system can help MSMEs in managing sales transactions and calculating raw materialrequirements in producing dodol.Keywords: Supply Chain Management, Material Requirement Planning, E-Commerce, Dodol KhasBuleleng.ABSTRAKDesa Penglatan merupakan desa yang menjadi sentra produksi dodol khas Buleleng terbesar dikabupaten Buleleng yang disalurkan ke seluruh kabupaten di Bali, bahkan dodol Buleleng jugamenjadi ikon oleh-oleh khas Buleleng untuk dibawa ke luar Bali. Perdagangan secara konvesionaltelah dilakukan oleh pelaku Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah (UMKM) di desa Penglatan yangmenjadi pengrajin dodol Buleleng. Pengrajin dodol di desa Penglatan yang merupakan industri rumahtangga yang menjual produk dodolnya ke pengepul, kemudian pengepul mendistribusikan dodol khasBuleleng ke seluruh kabupaten di Bali. Hal ini menyebabkan industri rumah tangga di desa Penglatansulit berkembang karena tidak bisa menangani permintaan langsung. Permasalahan lainnya yangdihadapi adalah sulitnya pengrajin dalam memperhitungkan kebutuhan bahan baku dalammemproduksi dodol khas Buleleng ketika ada pesanan. Implementasi supply chain management padae-commerce yang dikembangkan untuk mengelola pasokan bahan baku dodol sesuai dengan pesananyang masuk ke sistem. Hal ini diharapkan dapat membantu pengrajin dodol di desa Penglatan dalammenentukan kebutuhan bahan baku yang diperlukan dalam memproduksi pesanan dan memberikanmedia perdagangan berbasis elektronik. Penentuan kebutuhan bahan baku untuk memproduksi dodoldihitung dengan menerapkan konsep master requirement planning. Sistem yang dikembangkan dapatmembantu UMKM dalam mengelola transaksi penjualan dan menghitung kebutuhan bahan bakudalam memproduksi dodol.Kata kunci: Supply Chain Management, Material Requirement Planning, E-Commerce, Dodol KhasBuleleng.</jats:p>"

AMF + Se application resulted in the highest yield, monosaccharides, and Se content in both garlic and onion bulbs; and an increase of ascorbic acid and flavonoids in onion, and flavonoids in garlic. The highest bulb concentrations of P and K were recorded under the AMF + Se application, Ca was best affected by AMF, and Mg accumulation was highest under all the treatments in garlic and upon AMF + Se application in onion bulbs. Contrary to garlic, onion bulbs were characterized by a remarkable increase in microelements (B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Si, Zn) under the AMF + Se treatment. Selenium, either with or without AMF application, promoted the accumulation of B and Si in onion and Mo and Zn in garlic bulbs. It can be inferred that the interaction between AMF and Se is highly specific, differing for garlic and onion grown in similar environmental conditions in Grozny region, Chechen Republic.</jats:p>"

An investigation was conducted into the tariffs set by rural service providers to sustain drilled boreholes equipped with Afridev handpumps. A binary logistic regression analysis identified significant explanatory variables for the most common identified considerations when setting tariffs, ‘affordability’ and ‘operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs’. The results demonstrate tariffs collected less frequently and usage above the design limit of the Afridev (300 users) had lower odds of considering affordability and higher odds of considering O&amp;M costs, than those collected per month and within the design limit. The results further suggest a recognition by service providers of an increased maintenance challenge. High usage, acquiring spare parts, and the collection of tariffs when repairs are required indicate an increased likelihood of considering O&amp;M costs, conversely to considering affordability. The balance of affordability and sustainable maintenance is a perpetual challenge under decentralised service delivery. Investment into ongoing support and supply chains is required for the financial and operational requirements of water supply, to ensure payments for services does not prevent access to clean water at the local level and to achieve the 2030 agenda.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the NK-8 engine is considered. It is modernized with a mixing chamber and a power turbine for the purpose of its ground application. A study was conducted of the injection of an additional working fluid into the flow part of a dual-circuit gas turbine engine. Steam is used as an injectable substance. For research a mathematical model was created in the AS «GRET» software package. The studies were carried out under constant load, the maximum load during injection was determined. An additional worker can be supplied with summer power limitations when it is necessary to increase the power of a gas turbine installation. Studies have shown that the maximum power that can be obtained by supplying steam to the flow part is 32.2 MW.</jats:p>"

The main effect of the proposed technology is substituting a part of the fossil fuel used at CHPP (or other heat sources) for the production of electricity and thermal energy. At the same time, CHPP operates according to the heat schedule, i.e. in accordance with changes in the heat loads of consumers. In this regard, the attention in the study is focused on the problem of the reliability analysis of the heat supply (heating) from a hybrid energy source. To assess the reliability of heat supply, one of the main complex reliability index (RI) is used - the availability factor (AF), and the system of equations of a stationary markov process is used as a mathematical model of the states evolution of the studied object. Calculation of AF is made in accordance with seasonal changes in heat loads (annual heat load schedule); the heat storage effect of consumers (thermal inertia) and the factor of a possible decrease in wind speed are also additionally taken into account. Case study is carried out on a test circuit of the hybrid energy source (WPP+CHPP), as a result of which some analytical characteristics are obtained.</jats:p>"

The analysis using ArSWAT2012 has simulated the whole watershed and the result as proven to have about 25 different sub-basins. Each sub-basin has its peculiar characteristics of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs). Base on the morphological classification, the river has accumulated a lot of sediments. The sediment yield and concentration has been analyzed from 1973- 2017 through simulation. The study compared the simulations and found out the slide differences in the sediment loads that come in and the sediment that goes out. The sediment concentration also varies with the temporal morphological changes of the Terengganu watershed especially the river mouth.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, there has been a limited study linking the concept of food security and the necessity of managing competitive advantage of the agricultural supply chains. This paper links the theoretical foundations of supply chain management the concept of food security policy. Through a review of literature, a concept of how sustainable competitive advantage can be achieved through supply chain management, which in a development context, can improve food security by bringing together the concepts of food availability as well as improved people access to sufficient food is further explored.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network that can be mutually agreed by meeting at the level of common satisfaction of conflicting objectives is designed. We construct a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model that allows decision-makers to more effectively manage firms’ closed-loop green supply chain (SC). An ecological perspective is brought by carrying out the recycling, remanufacturing and destruction to SCM in our proposed model. Maximize the rating of the regions in which they are located, minimize total cost and carbon footprint are considered as the objectives of the model. By constructing our model, the focus of customer satisfaction is met, as well as the production, location of facilities and order allocation are decided, and we also carry out the inventory control of warehouses. In our multi-product multi-component multi-time-period model, the solution is obtained with a fuzzy approach by using the min operator of Zimmermann. To illustrate the model, we provide a practical case study, and an optimal result containing a preferable level of satisfaction to the decision-maker is obtained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One reason for the low rice yields in Cambodia compared with Vietnam and Thailand has been the low use of fertilisers, even though there is a high yield response to fertiliser application. A study of the fertiliser value chain in Takeo Province was conducted. The hypothesis was that limited access to good-quality, affordable fertilisers is a major constraint to improving rice yields in the province. The study confirmed the hypothesis and concluded that farmers’ access to affordable, good-quality fertilisers could be improved by addressing the following concerns. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) could simplify and speed up the import licensing procedures and regulations for fertilisers, thus removing the scope for rent-seeking behaviour and the need for facilitators to expedite the issuing of licences. This would also reduce the incentive for illegal imports. Import licences should be approved by MAFF based on the suitability of a product’s use in Cambodia; then importers could be allowed to import any quantity of a registered fertiliser based on market demand and their own commercial risk assessment. This would also reduce the scope for illegal (and hence unregulated) imports. All imported fertiliser products should be labelled to identify the manufacturer. This would enable the sources of sub-standard fertilisers to be traced, particularly from Vietnam and China, where it is claimed that sub-standard blends and granular products are produced. MAFF should also certify third party traders who purchase and deliver fertilisers to villages for re-sale to farmers. Finally, fertiliser dealers, retailers, and other fertiliser traders should buy fertilisers only from certified importers or distributors and transport to villages for direct re-sale to farmers. Inspectors should monitor and spot-check fertiliser operators to help reduce fertiliser quality problems for smallholders.</jats:p>"

This problem acquires particular importance when a country is characterized by a lack of fuel and energy resources or adverse climatic conditions. The most effective way to reduce heat losses from heat network pipelines to environment is the use of heat insulation. This paper presents the results of application heat-insulating paint on the surface of main pipeline. The infrared thermometry devices (pyrometer and thermal imager) were used to evaluate the energy efficiency of modern high-tech insulation. The thermograms from thermal imager and the readings from pyrometer were analyzed, it was established that the absolute difference in temperatures of an isolated pipeline section and an unpainted section are 5-10 °C. The studies have also shown that when a 250×6 pipeline is coated with a 1 mm thick heat-insulating paint, it will save 126.1 m3 of natural gas per 1 running meter per year. In monetary terms it will be approximately 610 rubles or about $9 (for the first half of 2020). The payback period of this energy-saving measure should not exceed six months. Increasing the thickness of liquid heat insulation layer is not economically feasible. The equivalent fuel economy is approximately 65% when the heat-insulating paint is of 1 mm thickness, and it will increase by only 8% for a thickness of 1.5 mm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capacity to extract oxygen from the environment and transport it to respiring tissues in support of metabolic demand reportedly has implications for species’ thermal tolerance, body-size, diversity and biogeography. Here we derive a quantifiable linkage between maximum and basal metabolic rate and their oxygen, temperature and size dependencies. We show that, regardless of size or temperature, the physiological capacity for oxygen supply precisely matches the maximum evolved demand at the highest persistently available oxygen pressure and this is the critical PO2 for the maximum metabolic rate. For most terrestrial and shallow-living marine species, this “Pcrit-max” is the current atmospheric pressure, 21 kPa. Any reduction in oxygen partial pressure from current values will result in a calculable decrement in maximum metabolic performance. However, oxygen supply capacity has evolved to match demand across temperatures and body sizes and so does not constrain thermal tolerance or cause the well-known reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate with increasing body mass. The critical oxygen pressure for resting metabolic rate, typically viewed as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance, is, instead, simply a rate-specific reflection of the oxygen supply capacity. A compensatory reduction in maintenance metabolic costs in warm-adapted species constrains factorial aerobic scope and the critical PO2 to a similar range, between ∼2 and 6, across each species’ natural temperature range. The simple new relationship described here redefines many important physiological concepts and alters their ecological interpretation.</jats:p>"

Organizations are working on sustainability of their supply chain (SC). Sustainability covers environmental, social, and economic aspects of different supply chain management activities. Organizations are continuously working in the direction of making their processes and product green. On the environmental front, use of renewable source of energy, reducing waste of energy, reducing carbon footprints is important. Simultaneously, reuse of products, re-cycling, and following environmental standards while disposing off is also recommended. In this chapter, the author has identified 13 issues and challenges of SSCM from literature review and expert opinion. Simultaneously, the author has also identified nine new technologies of modern time used in industries. Further, the author has tried to analyze the linkage between the challenges of sustainability and intelligent technologies by Jaccard's similarity coefficient methodology. </jats:p>"

In terms of identifying the activities of supply chain management as the most important factors supporting the best practices of SCM in pharmaceutical companies (i.e. Alliances with suppliers, Customer Relation Management, Logistic, flow Information and knowledge sharing). The study population consisted of all the executives and directors of departments, sections and employee specialized in SCM in pharmaceutical companies, and a simple random sample was chosen from pharmaceutical companies to conduct a field survey using a tool, a questionnaire, of which 150 were distributed and 139 were retrieved. In addition, a number of statistical techniques have been used for data analysis; such as statistical analysis package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and AMOS, which depends on Structure Equation Modeling approach because of the presence one variable, as well as for the reason of examining the importance of the track. Based on the results of the statistical analysis, it was concluded that there is an impact of the independent variable managing the supply chain on operational performance, but in terms of the intermediate variable, the results showed that the relationship is partial in terms of the strategic agility variable through Path Analysis.</jats:p>"

Within this model, market segmentation is also considered to meet real-world operating conditions. Moreover, an    ε   -constraint method and two interactive fuzzy approaches are applied to find a global optimum for this model together with the decisions on the numbers, locations, and capacities of the facilities, as well as the material flow through the network.

It is shown that the level of injuries of this category of employees is at a significant level (the frequency coefficient of general injuries is higher by 2.6 times, and the frequency coefficient of fatal injuries is 5.7 times relative to the corresponding frequency coefficients in general for JSC “Russian Railways”). Based on the research results, the main causes of accidents with a fatal outcome were: poor organization and planning of work, violations of the technological process, violations in the use of personal protective equipment, lack of supervision on the part of the contractor, violation of work rules at the height, the extension of work place. The assessment of the risk of injury of contact network of electricians showed two possible types of accidents with them: electric shock and falling from a height. The probability of accidents is 0.031 and 0.051, respectively, with the number of injuries for each of the received scenarios on the five- year planning horizon being 7.85 and 12.75, respectively. The presented approach to assessing injury risks, supplemented by the method of expert assessments, will allow identifying and evaluating specific hazards at the workplace of linear level enterprises, respectively, to increase the effectiveness of developing of programs to improve working conditions and safety, and the effectiveness of implementing of tools for managing professional risks in order to reduce industrial injuries of employees of power supply divisions.</jats:p>"

In addition, in order to strengthen human resources, the leaders of each cooperative are encouraged and the service awareness of the agricultural industrial chain of the cooperative is enhanced; the membership is expanded to facilitate agricultural production and the provision of financing services by the cooperative. At the same time, the increase in post-natal strength provides a positive impact on cooperatives and optimizes the overall market environment for cooperatives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On the 20th of May 2019, the European legislator adopted new Directives on the sale of goods and supply of digital content, which determine the vector of future contract law development in the European Union. Directive 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services, and Directive 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods are the first steps in adapting European private law to the requirements of the digital economy. The article discusses the reasons and preconditions for the adoption of new Directives. The authors, making a historical excursion of the harmonization of European contract law, demonstrate the continuity of the new Directives’ norms of European tradition on the basis of Principles of European Contract Law, Acquis Principles, Draft Common Frame of Reference, Common European Sales Law and Directive 1999/44/EC on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees. The advantages and disadvantages of the selected full harmonization in new Directives are examined. The legislative freedom granted to European Union Member States on certain issues related to contractual relations for the sale of goods and the supply of digital content are analyzed. The authors pay considerable attention to the disclosure of major legislative novelties related to contractual relations for the sale of goods and the supply of digital content, in particular the conformity of goods (digital content), and requirements for conformity; the seller’s (trader’s) duty to ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates that are necessary to keep those goods (digital content) in conformity; the burden of proof; data monetization; remedies for lack of conformity of goods (digital content). The problem of the hierarchy of remedies for lack of conformity of goods in a circular economy, such as repair and replacement, is also touched upon. The authors draw attention to the fact that taking into account the peculiarities of the circular economy and in order to determine the disproportion of the chosen method of legal protection, it is necessary to enshrine in legislation on the sale of goods the requirement to take into account its impact on the environment.</jats:p>"

To maintain satisfactory research facilities, all subsystems are constantly updating their equipment. The power supply group dramatically increases the output current bandwidth on bipolar corrector magnet power supplies, thereby increasing the number of calculations of the fast orbit feedback system and improving the stability of beam current. Finally, a DC/DC high-bandwidth corrector was built in the laboratory with the maximum prototype output current and voltage of 10 A/40 V. The power switch is metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET,) and the power state is a full-bridge (H-Bridge) circuit with a 145 kHz signal. The effectiveness of the control loop design can be verified from the gain margin and output current ripple. The prototype achieved a 11 kHz bandwidth with less than 3 dB attenuation for a reference signal of 0.1 V (equal to 0.1 A). Finally, a hardware prototype circuit was constructed in a power group laboratory. It had an input voltage of 48 V, output current of 10 A and maximum power of 400 W.</jats:p>"

Three factors (economic, environmental, and social) are considered for the problem and the three following requirements are addressed while satisfying associated constraint conditions: (i) minimizing the total cost; (ii) minimizing the total amount of CO2 emission during production and transportation of products; (iii) maximizing the social influence. Further, to ensure the efficient distribution of products through the SCLSC network, three types of distribution channels (normal delivery, direct delivery, and direct shipment) are considered, enabling a reformulation of the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem that can be solved using Pareto optimal solutions. A mathematical formulation is proposed for the problem, and it is solved using a hybrid genetic algorithm (pro-HGA) approach. The performance of the pro-HGA approach is compared with those of other conventional approaches at varying scales, and the performances of the SCLSC design problems with and without three types of distribution channels are also compared. Finally, we prove that the pro-HGA approach outperforms its competitors, and that the SCLSC design problem with three types of distribution channels is more efficient than that with a single distribution channel.</jats:p>"

The aspect of nursery that have been analyzed including aspect of plant, physical features, production and marketing. Another objectives were to create website prototype for online plant marketing. Its were observed 30 nurseries in 10 sub regencies. Research results showed, there were 290 species of plants that are sold which it is consisted of 128 species of groundcovers, 55 species of herbs, 40 species of shrubs, 32 species of trees, 27 species of climber plants, and 8 species of epiphyte.. Based on correlation analysis results, it was found that plant stock was influenced by nursery area, type of nursery, and nursery utilities. Otherwise type of nursery was influenced by nursery area. Success in sales can be achieved by creating a website as a functional media that can provide the information on stock and price of plants at the nurseries in Bogor Regency. The website that have been constructed used a MySQL database system, the local desktop PHP MyAdmin, and CodeIgniter as a system framework.</jats:p>",

Thus, they should practice before they perform like athletes and musicians do, but they cannot practice by making mistakes since it would be an expensive way to learn. Serious business games serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, the sharing of expertise, and the alignment of objectives. Higher productivity along with employee satisfaction are their most prominent outcomes. Engineers should be able to work in teams, where behaviors can have both positive and negative effects. Serious business games can support organizations to develop more effective team behavior, influence the level of cooperation in a group, and, in turn, increase the company's profit. In this study, the authors examine a supply chain serious game called “The Fresh Connection” and discuss how it can improve the learning process at the university and further allow people to continue their learning process as an engineering professional. </jats:p>"

The significance of the initial test result was recognised early, partly as a result of information provided by a Havelock North pharmacist to health authorities about an unusual number of requests for anti-diarrhoeal medication. AIMTo describe the breadth of activities undertaken by pharmacists working in Hawke’s Bay in August 2016, following Campylobacter jejuni contamination of the public water supply in Havelock North, New Zealand. METHODSAll pharmacists and hospital pharmacy management staff working in Hawke’s Bay in 2017 were eligible to complete the qualitative online questionnaire. Additionally, information was requested from stakeholders with known relevant experiences. Free-text responses were thematically analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTSThirteen pharmacists and two ancillary staff from community pharmacy, hospital pharmacy, general practice, management, emergency response and dispensary management responded to the survey. Analysis of responses revealed three overarching themes and six sub-themes. The first was public wellbeing, with sub-themes of community information, local emergency response and pharmacy operational management. The second was pharmaceutical distribution, with a sub-theme of stock management. The third theme was clinical medicine management, with sub-themes of acute symptom management and medicine management. DISCUSSIONThe pharmacy profession appears to have played an important role in public wellbeing, pharmaceutical distribution and medicine therapy management during the outbreak. It is likely that through their actions, responding pharmacists reduced demand on other primary care services and prevented hospitalisations. Further research directions include exploring the effectiveness of community pharmacists in public health surveillance and the use of endorsed public health information to ensure consistent delivery of health messages.</jats:p>"

Thus diversified supply chain enterprises are more resilient and competitive, than highly specialized. The diversified supply chains have the opportunity, using the investment marketing tools to transfer capital to the most profitable industries. The use of marketing strategies can greatly enhance the effectiveness of efforts to attract capital to the diversified supply chains and able to ensure high ratio of profitability and risk for investors and lenders.\nThe purpose of the article is to justify the need to introduce modern technologies and marketing and logistics tools for clinical investment attraction research and ensuring the necessary quality and efficiency.\nIn this article proposes the ways of increasing the competitiveness of Ukraine in research and developments on the global pharmaceutical scene. Using of the investment marketing in the formation of the diversified supply chain enterprises in the realm of clinical research in Ukraine was substantiated. Clinical marketing logistics development opportunities in Ukraine were revealed. Features of innovations of logistics companies in medicine have been identified, that form of supply chain. The principles and the factors for investment decision-making were presented.\nUsing of the investment marketing in the formation of the diversified supply chain enterprises in the realm of clinical research in Ukraine can significantly improve the efficiency of efforts to attract capital. The investment marketing allows for a demanding approach to identifying the best suppliers of capital and providing them with an incentive in the form of a higher ratio of profitability to risk.</jats:p>"

Because of the perishable nature of products and limited shelf life, management of sustainability in PFSCs is critical. Many studies on sustainability in PFSCs have considered developed countries; however, developing countries have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. In this paper, a decision theory‐based framework is adopted, where a prescriptive decision analysis methodology is used to generate preferences among the challenges to sustainability in PFSC. An integrated interpretive structural modelling–analytic network process (ISM–ANP) decision framework is formulated to identify and model key challenges to sustainability in PFSCs, keeping a developing economy like India under consideration. The contextual relationships amongst the extracted challenges are analyzed using the ISM methodology. The relationships identified from ISM are used as inputs in the ANP methodology, to generate the priority weights of the challenges. The findings of the integrated methodology show that “lack of horizontal integration of farmers,” “poor pre‐harvest management,” and “lack of government regulation and support” are the most critical challenges for sustainability in PFSCs. The results show that organizations must work on aggregation of farm produce and integration of farmers with the market. Development of infrastructures and cold chain facilities at the farm level is necessary to mitigate these challenges to reduce wastages in PFSC. The study facilitates managers and planners to understand and enable sustainable practices in PFSCs.</jats:p>",

The greening process has guided supply chain practices into new ways of thinking according to green standards. The assessment of the performance of green supply chain management (GSCM) requires a holistic view for the whole supply chain. In this context, given that becoming green in the operational side of activities is essential, the performance assessment of operational activities also requires a holistic view to be taken. In this paper, an attempt has been made to improve the performance of GSCM by examining and evaluating the green operational excellence of a hot dip galvanizing company. The framework includes several green operational excellence key criteria, namely, quality management, efficiency management, green production/manufacturing, eco‐packaging, and green design. First, the weights of the criteria and the respective measurements were found by fuzzy analytic network process. Then, the overall operational performance score was found by a weighted scoring method. Finally, both managerial and theoretical implications were suggested according to the outcomes and findings of the case study.</jats:p>",

Our objectives were threefold: (a) determine the behavior of PRS probes across multiple peatland classes, (b) determine which type of peatland Sandhill Fen is most analogous to in terms of nutrient supply patterns and site chemistry, and (c) attempt to provide a repeatable approach for assessing nutrient supply in peatlands. In terms of porewater chemistry, conditions at Sandhill Fen were quite unique, yet, most comparable to the saline fen. Consistent with porewater analysis, PRS probes had low nitrate supply at all sites, high calcium and magnesium supply at all sites (except the poor fen), and much higher sulfur supply at Sandhill Fen. Site differences in PRS probe measurements were smaller for 20‐ than 2‐day burial periods due to displacement of less strongly held elements (e.g., potassium) on ion exchange membranes. Because long‐term incubations may underrepresent supply rates for weakly held ions due to displacement by divalent ions, we recommend that reclamation assessments over a wide range of fen types should use a relatively short burial period of 1 to 3 days. With few exceptions (sulfate and iron), nutrient supply patterns at Sandhill Fen were quite comparable to the reference fens. For future wetland reclamation performance assessments in the AOSR, PRS probes could serve an important role for evaluating belowground functional components.</jats:p>",

Traditional methods for the enumeration of indicator bacteria are not only expensive but also need trained personnel. We have developed a low-cost kit, MColiPAT, and have validated its application for detection of coliforms in drinking water using the IDEXX Colilert-18 Quanti tray method. MColiPAT kit medium was able to detect coliforms down to a level of 3.1 MPN/100 ml within 10.5 hours. The sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.45% and 100% respectively.

Agricultural commodities are perishable, seasonal, varying, and bulky in nature which cause difficulties in its management compared to non-agricultural products. Supply chain performance is an indicator of the success of a company. Therefore its assessment is needed to control and determine the performance feasibility of the company. This study aims at assessing the performance of the passion fruit syrup agro-industry supply chain in North Sumatra. The performance is assessed using SCOR and AHP models. The results show that the three performance assessment matrices with the highest weight are processing costs (0.165), delivery accuracy (0.146), and perfect goods condition (0.122). The supply chain performance was categorized as average (78.69%).</jats:p>",

PT Setia Utama Distrindo adalah perusahaan  yang bergerak dibidang distribusi dan penjualan berbagai macam merk Handphone. Terdapat kendala yang dialami oleh Perusahaan yaitu sales front yang tidak update terhadap jumlah stok barang sehingga sering terjadi kesalahan infomasi  stok kepada pelanggan, lamanya sistem retur barang menyebabkan komplain dari pelanggan, lamanya proses persetujuan pesanan yang mengharuskan pimpinan untuk menandatanganinya, juga terlambatnya pengiriman karena mobil yang sering mogok. Dari kendala tersebut penulis mencoba menganalisa dan memberikan solusi  dengan menerapkan sistem Electronic Supply Chain Management (E-SCM). Penelitian ini dapat membantu mengembangkan sistem yang sudah ada dengan berbagai fitur usulan, berdasarkan pengumpulan data dan proses  yang sudah berjalan di  perusahaan, seperti, adanya alert untuk service mobil berkala, persetujuan pimpinan dengan online, akses untuk  sales front agar bisa melihat stok secara realtime dan alert informasi retur barang sehingga membuat proses retur menjadi efisien.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The temperature of the water returned to the heating network from consumers largely determines the energy efficiency of the heat supply system. It depends on a number of parameters: outside air temperature, hot water supply heaters connection scheme, daily water consumption in the hot water supply system. The calculation of this temperature is usually performed numerically, which makes it difficult to control the modes of the heat supply system. From a practical point of view, a simpler toolkit is needed. In this paper, equations are proposed that allow directly determining the change in the heat output of heat exchangers depending on the outside air temperature and the temperature of the network water returned to the heating network. These equations are obtained on the basis of systematic modeling of variable operating modes of the heat supply system, using the method previously proposed by the author. The operating characteristics of the heat station are taken into account by the coefficients of the equations, for the determination of which the calculation formulas were obtained. The equations used are valid for substations with a two-stage mixed scheme of hot water supply heaters in the mode of maximum water consumption.</jats:p>"

In such situations one of power transmission lines (PTL) will be loaded below the nominal installed capacity, while the other parallel communication line will be overloaded. Elimination of uneven load in PTL can be performed by the phase angle control between the voltages at the beginning and end of the connection. One of the effective means for the phase angle control is a phase-shifting transformer (PST), the control of which is provided by the redistribution of power flows in individual PTLs of the section with the elimination of their uneven loading. On the example of simulation and computational experiments carried out in the power system of Azerbaijan, the effectiveness of use of voltage phase angle control in the power system with a significant uneven loading in the controlled sections of the supply network of the system is shown. Analysis of the effect of elimination of the unevenness on reducing losses in the network and increasing the efficiency of using power generation at stations is given.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Unfair trading practices (UTPs) imposed by parties with superior power in the context of a vertical relationship are an issue at the periphery of competition law, private law, and, sometimes, sectoral regulation. For a long time, the mainstream competition law approach has been to relegate such issues to other areas of law and regulation. In the EU, where complaints about the prevalence of such practices in the agricultural and food supply chain have been voiced for decades, the approach of the European Commission has been to pursue a strict separation between competition issues and fair-trading issues. This article questions the reasonableness of such a strict division of labour. Taking the sum of various initiatives undertaken to regulate UTPs in the agri-food supply chain as a case study, it argues that the effect of limiting competition law enforcement on this issue has been counterproductive. The article firstly explains the background of the problem and the issue of UTPs in the agri-food supply chain. Secondly, it maps the various legislative developments which have taken place at the EU Member State level. Thirdly, by referring to Grabosky’s (1995) regulatory studies typology of counterproductive regulation, the article focuses attention on some of the perverse side effects which arise when regulation of power imbalances and UTPs occurs at the national level in the context of an integrated market like the EU. In light of the analysis, it expresses doubt that these pitfalls will be fully corrected by Directive 2019/633 on UTPs in the food supply chain. The conclusion is that national legislative developments have not been able to make up for the lack of supra-national enforcement of EU competition law on this issue and have possibly even exacerbated the problem at hand. The article concludes that supranational competition law enforcement can play a key role in addressing the fundamental problems underlying business-to-business unfair trading practices. It argues that this role cannot be played by other instruments in the context of an integrated market with multi-level governance. This article shows that while competition law may not be capable of solving all the problems with UTPs, it remains indispensable in safeguarding the proper functioning of the internal market as well as the interests of consumers and taxpayers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The e-retail sector of the Indian e-commerce industry being a price-sensitive market has witnessed an increase in customer interest and flexibility to compare a product while making a purchase decision through e-commerce platforms. The increase in internet penetration and users in India has been facilitated by a boost of the telecom industry and data penetration from 34% in 2017 to 60% in 2022. While some players like Flipkart and Amazon have disrupted the sector with their customer acquisition ratio in the market, other new players, Jio Mart and Paytm Mall, are merely surviving or gearing up to the competition. The cost factors like marketing, forward logistics, inventory, and reverse logistics are associated with customer acquisition, which the organizations are not able to recover because of low average gross merchandise value (GMV) and high logistics cost to serve the customer. This chapter depicts the returns management process, which, while integrating the forward and the reverse logistics in a supply chain, is productive financially and logistically. </jats:p>"

The input of mechanical power to the ocean due to the surface wind-stress, in regions which correspond to different regimes of ocean dynamics, is considered using data from satellites observations. Its dependence on the coarse-graining range of the atmospheric and oceanic velocity in space from 0.5° to 10° and time from  6 h to 40 days is determined. In the area of the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio extensions the dependence of the power-input on space-time coarse-graining varies over tenfold for the coarse-graining considered. It decreases over twofold for the Gulf Stream extension and threefold for the Kuroshio extension, when the coarse-graining length-scale passes from a few degrees to 0.5° at a temporal coarse-graining scale of a few days. It increases over threefold in the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio extensions when the coarse-graining passes from several days to 6 h at a spatial coarse graining of a few degrees. The power input is found to increase monotonically with shorter coarse-graining in time. Its variation with coarse graining in space has no definite sign. Results show that including the dynamics at scales below a few degrees reduces considerably the power input by air-sea interaction in regions of strongly non-linear ocean currents. When the ocean velocities are not considered in the shear calculation the power-input is considerably (up to threefold) increased. The dependence of the power input on coarse graining in space and time is close to being multiplicatively separable in all regions and for most of the coarse-graining domain considered.\n                        </jats:p>"

Although the rule increases the safety of the bank's portfolio, it requires more compliance costs to verify borrower's income status. Given that the verification of the ability to repay increases the costs of lending to all banks, this study examines the effects of bank regulations adding the compliance costs on small or community‐oriented banks. From the framework of multiproduct firm, we estimate the differential input demand and output supply systems to identify the banks' behavioral changes due to the compliance costs.

This study focused on two crucial inputs—seeds and fertilizers. Six villages in Champhone District, Savannakhet Province, were selected for the study. Farmers had mostly adopted the seed-fertilizer technology. Mechanization of land preparation through the use of hand tractors was also widespread. Many also used irrigation to cultivate a dry-season crop. However, the productivity and profitability of rice farming remained low. Constraints to the supply of seeds and fertilizers explain part of this dilemma. There is scope for policy intervention to improve the supply and use of productive inputs for more intensive rice production. Further investment in the rice breeding and seed production centres may be needed to develop suitable varieties for the range of rice environments encountered by farmers and to improve the quality of seeds supplied. Intervening to control or subsidize the price of fertilizer is unlikely to be effective. The government could, however, simplify the import process, helping reduce farmers’ costs; increase the capacity to monitor and enforce fertilizer quality standards; and provide more site- and variety-specific information to farmers regarding optimal fertilizer use.</jats:p>"

During late-2017, Kinshasa, the capital ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, experienced a cholera outbreak that showed potential to spread throughout the city. A novel targeted water and hygiene response strategy was implemented to quickly stem the outbreak.\nMethods\nWe describe the first implementation of the cluster grid response strategy carried out in the community during the cholera outbreak in Kinshasa, in which response activities targeted cholera case clusters using a grid approach. Interventions focused on emergency water supply, household water treatment and safe storage, home disinfection and hygiene promotion. We also performed a preliminary community trial study to assess the temporal pattern of the outbreak before and after response interventions were implemented. Cholera surveillance databases from the Ministry of Health were analyzed to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the outbreak using epidemic curves and maps.\nResults\nFrom January 2017 to November 2018, a total of 1,712 suspected cholera cases were reported in Kinshasa. During this period, the most affected health zones included Binza Météo, Limeté, Kokolo, Kintambo and Kingabwa. Following implementation of the response strategy, the weekly cholera case numbers in Binza Météo, Kintambo and Limeté decreased by an average of 57% after two weeks and 86% after four weeks. The total weekly case numbers throughout Kinshasa Province dropped by 71% four weeks after the peak of the outbreak.\nConclusion\nDuring the 2017-2018 period, Kinshasa experienced a sharp increase in cholera case numbers. To contain the outbreak, water supply and hygieneresponse interventions targeted case households, nearby neighbors and public areas in case clusters using a grid approach. Following implementation of the response, the outbreak in Kinshasa was quickly brought under control. A similar approach may be adapted to quickly interrupt cholera transmission in other urban settings.</jats:p>"

In the current context, this issue is highly relevant and in demand, and it is a key component in ensuring the quality of education services and the effective use of resources from different levels of budgets. The calculations were based on official statistics of the State Statistics Service, the State Employment Service and regional (Kyiv city) employment centers. Information obtained over the last 3 years on the supply and demand of teachers in terms of regions, positions, pedagogical specialties and educational degrees (educational and qualification level of Junior Specialist) was used to calculate the relevant forecast staffing needs. The basis for forecasting work was the author’s methodological approaches to determining the need for specialists in specialties. The general conclusion based on the results of the conducted research is that in today’s conditions approximately 80,0 % of graduates of the relevant field do not «reach» the profile vacancies. This situation is due to financial (low wages, lack of significant social packages and preferences, etc.), general (outflow of youth abroad, etc.), and moral and ethical (difficult working conditions of teachers, falling prestige of work as teachers and educators, etc.) factors. In addition, considering the dynamic changes associated with the reform of the provision of educational services both in Ukraine and abroad, urgent changes and additions to the National Classifier of Ukraine DK 003 «Classifier of Professions» are required. This is primarily due to the obsolescence of many pedagogical positions, their dispersion and artificial underestimation of the requirements for educational degrees, especially concerning the educational and qualification level of a Junior Specialist. In-depth research and opinion polls of a wide range of respondents are required for a more detailed analysis of the reasons for the refusal of graduate teachers from further activities to provide educational services.</jats:p>"

The maximum value of adjustment accuracy of the pulse-widths and delay among multiple control signals need to be 10ns. In this paper, a fast pulse generator circuit based on an emerging ARM-embedded FPGA have been designed for HIAF-Kicker power supply. The test results show that the output performance of the fast pulse generator circuit meets the requirements of the PFN-Marx generator.</jats:p>",

This trade-off brings out an optimal supply ratio of residential land, 40%, in deterministic steady-state equilibrium. Besides, the local government is able to use dynamic pro-cyclical residential land supply policy to dampen economic fluctuations in China’s macroeconomy. </jats:p>",

It also tests the suppositions associated with the contributions of irregularities to corruption in construction procurement. An expert survey is conducted with 62 construction-related practitioners selected via non-probabilistic sampling in the context of a Ghana, to assess the criticalities of the irregularities. Eighteen irregularities were identified within the context selected for this study. A soft computing technique known as the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) method is employed to examine the identified irregularities. Other relevant techniques including factor analyses, normalization, and descriptive tools are employed to factorize the identified irregularities and test the hypotheses. Out of the 18 irregularities, 11 were revealed to be critical. The findings reveal that the top three irregularities were: payments for uncompleted works, sourcing of proforma invoices from the same supplier and the lack of proper coordination among key departments. Moreover, four constructs were developed using the identified measurement items. They are administrative-specific, procedural, compliance and contract monitoring irregularities. Out of the four, the topmost critical construct turns out to be compliance irregularities. Theoretically, this study advances the scholarship of construction by shedding lights on the irregularities associated with the procurement processes of construction projects. It also contributes to an in-depth understanding of the noted irregularities. In practical terms, this study contributes to the procurement planning and policy-making process, it assists decision makers in putting in place measures to prevent or extirpate the likelihood of any of the irregularities’ occurrences.</jats:p>",

Methodology. The research methodology is based on the fundamental principles of the application of the theory of electrical engineering, the theory of planning a scientific experiment, computer and simulation modelling. The experimental data were obtained in the laboratories of the Kremenchuk Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi National University using certified metrological measuring instruments. The system was modelled using the software packages Matthcad, Microsoft. EXCEL. StatGraphik.  Results. Conducted theoretical and experimental studies of the magnitude of arc sparking prove that the energy of sparking with a pulsed current is less than with a constant one and can be used as the basis for reducing the ignition of gas in mines and other explosive industries.  Scientific novelty. The useful use of the consumer’s reactive energy has been substantiated if the supply line or the current source is shut off for the duration of the pause and at the same time the consumer is shunted.  Practical significance. The obtained results are recommended to be used in power supply systems of consumers that operate in a pulsed mode to increase their energy efficiency and explosion and fire safety of operation.</jats:p>"

The active phase at the duty cycle operation has been demonstrated, and justified in accordance with the theoretical behavior in response to an input voltage change above and below the desired output value. A simulation of the converter's operation in the buck and boost modes in order to stabilize the output voltage at a set level has been performed in the MATLAB / Simulink package.

The distributor and retailer are the first and the second followers, respectively. We introduce the distributor into the traditional manufacturer-retailer channel through his direct involvement in advertising as being incorporated into the non-stochastic Sethi's sales-advertising dynamics. This is used to model the awareness share dynamics in which the distributor and the retailer directly engage in advertising, while the manufacturer bypasses the distributor to subsidise only the retail advertising effort. We consider a subsidised and unsubsidised channel structures, where each structure results in a system of three nonlinear equations, which cannot be solved analytically, but only numerically. However, we show that the unique solution to each of the systems exists, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The distributor and the retailer's advertising strategies are developed for both when subsidy is provided and when it is not provided. We also obtain the manufacturer's subsidy rate and the market awareness share for both when retail advertising is subsidised and when it is not subsidised. We observe that with the provision of subsidy, the distributor reduces his advertising effort. However, the resulting increase in the retail advertising effort is larger than the reduction in the distributor's advertising commitment, thus making the channel advertising effort larger with subsidy. It further shows that to avoid being shortchanged, each player should adopt only his optimal strategy or strategies as the case may be.</jats:p>"

The chapter is built on theory Rational Choice and Revealed preferences Theory, while extending using experimental approaches involving multi actors' model. The multiple actors included consumer with their preferred order of choices, entrepreneurs with their preferences, and financiers with their preferred order, under the budget constraint. This chapter interacts with practical aspects of green product innovation behavior in general, and advances research with a focus on specific behaviors, highly desired in this field investigating the rise of green purchases.

The converter consists of seven switches, five of which being controlled like high-side type. This paper presents a non-typical bootstrap-based gate-driver system so that the converter can run using a single voltage source. The converter requires a special switching pattern to drive seven switches in a steady state and also during the start-up of the converter and the regulation of the output voltage. Therefore, an FPGA-based digital control system is used with various switching algorithms and protection functions implemented. The presented converter is an autonomic device that taps the energy from the main input. Therefore, the electronic system of the converter is equipped with a self-supply system with a wide range of the input voltage. The parameters of the converter such as voltage gain, voltages and power ranges can be scalable for prospective applications with the proposed control system.</jats:p>",

This article fills a gap in recent attempts at understanding the productivity crisis, arguing that there is a negative impact of supply-side labour market reforms on innovation and productivity. The negative impact of more flexible labour relations is significant in medium-high and high-tech sectors with a high ‘cumulativeness’ of knowledge, that is if the historical accumulation of firm-specific and often tacit knowledge is important for innovative competencies. In low-tech sectors as well as for high-tech entrepreneurship, where cumulativeness of knowledge is low, there is little or no effect.</jats:p>",

Metaheuristic-type optimization techniques have become crucial for effective design, maintenance, and operations of such systems. However, in highly complex industrial systems, conventional metaheuristics are still plagued by various drawbacks. Strategies such as hybridization and algorithmic modifications have been the focus of previous efforts to improve the performance of conventional metaheuristics. This work tackles a large-scale multi-objective (MO) optimization problem: biofuel supply chain. Due to the scale and complexity of the problem, the random matrix approach was employed to modify the stochastic generator segment of the cuckoo search (CS) technique. Comparative analysis was then performed on the computational results produced by the conventional CS technique and the improved CS variants. </jats:p>"

It aims to bridge existing gaps in credit risk assessment methodologies by amalgamating empirical insights, advanced computational techniques, and comprehensive data analytics. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse attributes crucial for credit risk assessment, this study employs a meticulous methodology. It integrates machine learning algorithms, notably LightGBM, and exploratory data analysis techniques to preprocess data, examine missing values, assess variable correlations, and construct a predictive model. The empirical journey reveals insightful findings, emphasizing missing value patterns, variable interrelationships, and model performance. Precision-recall and ROC curves depict the model's ability to discern default and non-default cases, showcasing its efficacy in credit risk assessment within supply chain contexts. Our study contributes a foundational framework for strategic credit risk management within supply chain networks, offering actionable insights for stakeholders. While acknowledging limitations and the need for ongoing model refinement, this research sets the stage for future explorations and transformative practices in adaptive risk management strategies for interconnected supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

For the experiment, according to the principle of analogue pairs, 2 groups of newborn gobies were formed taking into account the live weight of the animals. The first group included Hereford bulls, the second group consisted of crossbred bulls (♀ red-motley x ♂ Hereford). We studied the productive qualities of gobies by the dynamics of growth in live weight of gobies. To assess the meat qualities, a control slaughter of experimental gobies was performed. Domestic bulls exceeded (P &lt;0.05) pure-bred calves in live weight. For the growing period (from 6 to 12 months of age), the difference in live weight between the bulls of the first and second groups was 24.3 kg or 7.5 percent (P &lt;0.1). When feeding on natural pastures for 90 days, the difference in live weight between the groups was between the first and second - 29.1 kg (7.3%). As a result of the experiment, the cost of production of 1 kg of beef obtained from cross-breed gobies is 1180.2 rubles lower. The profitability of growing crossbred bulls is 11.2 orders of magnitude higher. In order to increase meat productivity and improve meat quality in commodity cattle breeding, it is advisable to practice rearing and feeding of young animals obtained by crossing red-motley cows with Hereford bulls in order to raise fattening young animals using intensive technology of meat cattle breeding.</jats:p>",

The advantages of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the treatment and rehabilitation of senile diseases are increasingly prominent, but there is still a lack of integration between Traditional Chinese Medicine services and long-term care of the elderly, which should guide social subjects to enter the field of long-term care of the elderly in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Our findings from a longitudinal survey of 206 Chinese manufacturing firms provide empirical evidence for the coexistence and nature of macro‐ and micro‐institutional environments and their moderating effect on the GSCI performance link. Specifically, the results revealed that Chinese manufacturers can be clustered into three groups with different macro‐ and micro‐institutional environments (i.e., cognizant, sensible, and conscious manufacturers). Furthermore, the configuration of macro‐ and micro‐institutional environments moderates the effect of green supplier integration on social performance, as well as the effects of green customer integration on financial, environmental, and social performance.

A scenario-based approach is used to model these disruptions. The retailer level uncertainty due to demand-supply mismatch is handled by incorporating the newsvendor model into the last echelon of supply chain network.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nContext\nThe productivity of Ethiopian smallholder farms is considered to be low owing to different factors such as feed shortage, lack of breeding strategies, disease prevalence and missing marketing strategies.\n\nAim\nThe main objective of the study was to develop a dynamic, stochastic herd model by adopting system dynamic modelling methodology for evaluation of the effect of increased feed availability (forage production) in combination with different fattening strategies on herd dynamics and profitability of an Ethiopian sheep population.\n\nMethods\nForage production utilising part of smallholder farmers’ cropland was built into a dynamic simulation model. Two alternative feed-supply systems were evaluated: turning 25% and 50% of the current cropland into area used for forage production. The simulation period was 20 years, the first 10 years representing the baseline fattening scenario (culled rams fattened). For the last 10 years, genetic selection was introduced and two scenarios were evaluated: fattening of culled rams (Scenario I) and fattening of young rams (Scenario II).\n\nKey results\nIncreasing the feed supply resulted in an increase to the herd size when the model balanced dry matter supply and demand of the herd. Fattening of young rams (Scenario II) with genetic selection was significantly more profitable than the baseline and Scenario I in both of the simulated alternative feed-supply systems. This can be used for regular cash generation, which might reduce disposal of animals at lower price in cases of need for emergency cash.\n\nConclusions\nOverall, the simulation model demonstrates that production of improved forage crops should be combined with selective breeding and an appropriate finishing strategy. The competition for resources (land and labour) with crop production, forage seed shortage and extended family size are other challenges raised by smallholder farmers for the feasibility of the two alternative feed-supply systems.\n\n</jats:p>"

Using this technology, it will be possible to show and guarantee the traceability of the final product. Traceability in the cocoa chain begins in the production stages (harvest and post-harvest) to obtain relevant data related to cocoa beans and their producers, promptly, until finding the raw material origin and inputs used during the process. The material provider's name must be considered, as well as the manufacturer's expiration date, the batch number, and the production area's reception date. This is why authors recommend using Block chain, which is a data structure that stores information chronologically in interlinked blocks. It works as a digital master book and the participants reach an agreement to register any information in the blocks. Throughout the chapter, authors show how to apply this technology. </jats:p>"

It suggests solving problems of resource flows stabilization in a technological network by solving the equations of inverse problems of network dynamics and using calculated contours of stream disturbance rearrangement. It is advisable to construct flow disturbance parading algorithms in a process network using inverse models of path dynamics of input control streams to input nodes of flow disturbances in the network. The paper presents a software macro model that allows modeling static and dynamic modes of steam and heat supply systems, control of charging and discharge processes of steam accumulators. The controlled parameter of the model is the steam pressure in the battery. The steam pressure in the accumulator is limited by means of a special pressure regulator, which is adjusted to a minimum of steam losses on the plug at its excess in the network. This software macro model allows modeling the operation of consumers with a sharply expressed variable load.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Access to health care is an important determinant of health, but it remains unclear whether having more physicians reduces mortality. In this study, we used Taiwan’s population-level National Death Certification Registry data to investigate whether a greater supply of physicians is associated with lower rates of amenable mortality, defined as deaths that can be delayed with appropriate and timely medical treatment. Our baseline regression analysis adjusting only for age and sex shows that an increase in the number of physicians per 1000 is associated with a reduction of 1.7 ( P &lt; .01) and 0.97 ( P &lt; .01) age-standardized deaths per 100 000 for men and women, respectively. However, in our full analyses that control for socioeconomic factors and Taiwan’s health insurance expansion, we find that physician supply is no longer statistically associated with amenable mortality rates. Nevertheless, we found that greater physician supply levels are associated with a reduction in deaths from ischemic heart disease (−0.13 ( P &lt; .05) for men, and −0.066 ( P &lt; .05) for women). These findings suggest that overall, physician supply is not associated with amenable mortality rates after controlling for socioeconomic factors but may help reduce amenable mortality rates in specific causes of death. </jats:p>",

Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small-vessel (20–60 µm in diameter) arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There were no significant hemodynamic or arterial blood gas differences between groups. The control ischemic-reperfused cortex had a similar O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic-reperfused cortex with many areas of low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation (43 of 80 veins with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation below 50%). LPA did not significantly alter cerebral blood flow, but it did significantly increase O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extraction and consumption of the ischemic-reperfused region. It also significantly increased the number of small veins with low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturations in the reperfused region (76 of 80 veins with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation below 50%). This was associated with a significantly increased cortical infarct size after LPA administration (11.4 ± 0.5% control vs. 16.4 ± 0.6% LPA). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This suggests that LPA reduces cell survival and that it is associated with an increase in the number of small microregions with reduced local oxygen balance after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. </jats:p>"

The empirical material was the result of a survey carried out in 2017. The direct interview method was used to collect information. The research sample included 144 farms keeping animals of native breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs. The spatial scope of the research covered three provinces of south-eastern Poland. The group of factors positively stimulating the development of food sales in short supply chains includes the knowledge and skills of breeders and the expected demand for products from the farms. In turn, the group of factors constituting obstacles and causing farms not to undertake this activity is connected with the necessary amount of work input, the need to develop a marketing concept for this activity and to create an appropriate image on the market, as well as veterinary, sanitary and tax regulations</jats:p>"

It is important to elucidate that SA's tourism fraternity has been amongst the best performing sectors amid the challenges it is faced with. The sharing economy concept requires all tourism stakeholders to work together (public-private partnership) in order to see its fruition. The sharing economy represents the power of the collaborative consumption and become a means to create an additional value chain for the tourism industry by decreasing the barriers of entry.

This paper, however, determined that the standard due diligence measures and the enhanced due diligence measures of Marks and Spencer Group Plc. are effective enough to identify/assess the risk(s) of modern slavery in the supply chains because Marks and Spencer adopts diverse methods/methodologies for her due diligence programme. This paper also determined that both Anglo American Plc. and Marks and Spencer Group Plc. adopt diverse methods for the monitoring of their corrective action plans which are designed to mitigate the modern slavery risk(s) associated with high-risk suppliers. For example, Anglo American Plc. monitors anti-modern slavery compliance with the use of both internal Anglo American teams and third-party auditors to ensure that the identified issues are adequately addressed.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper focuses on Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Modern Slavery Statements of Anglo American Plc. and Marks and Spencer Group Plc for the year 2017/18.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Several articles have been published on this topic. Among them, is an article by Stefan Gold, Alexander Trautrims and Zoe Trodd titled “Modern slavery challenges to supply chain management”, <jats:italic>Supply Chain Management: An International Journal</jats:italic>, Vol. 20 Issue: 5, pp.485-494 and an article by Stephen John New titled “Modern slavery and the supply chain: the limits of corporate social responsibility?”, <jats:italic>Supply Chain Management: An International Journal</jats:italic>, Vol. 20 Issue: 6, pp.697-707. The article by Stefan Gold, Alexander Trautrims and Zoe Trodd drew attention to the challenges modern slavery poses to supply chain management. Although the article briefly talked about the risk-based approach to monitoring supply chains for slavery, it did not discuss about the due diligence measures that UK firms are required to apply during risk identification and risk assessment, and the risk mitigation measures that will address the risk(s) that have been identified. The article by Stephen John New examines legal attempts to encourage supply chain transparency and the use of corporate social responsibility methods. Though the article mentions the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, more attention was paid to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act [S.B. 657], State of California, 2010), enacted in 2011 and in effect from 2012. The article analysed the California Act without critically discussing the risk assessment procedures for UK companies. In addition to discussing the different stages of the risk assessment/risk management process, this paper will examine the modern slavery statements of Anglo American Plc. and Marks and Spencer Group Plc. This paper will provide recommendations on how the risk assessment/risk mitigation measures of both companies could be strengthened. This is the only paper to adopt this kind of approach. The analysis/recommendations in this paper will help UK companies to design effective due diligence procedures for their supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

In the first case, the parameters of the turbine unit are set according to the characteristics of modern vehicles turbochargers, in the second based on the parameters of modern gas microturbines. The work of microCHP based on the microturbine with the changed order of processes was considered for both traditional and low-temperature heating systems. The electric power of microCHP ranges from 2 to 15 kW, thermal power - from 45 to 160 kW. The peculiarity of MicroCHP is combustion of fuel at atmospheric pressure, which allows the use of natural gas from low-pressure networks, solid fuel, and garbage. It is concluded that this turbine unit is able to solve the problem of electricity and heat supply to most isolated consumers in various climate zones.</jats:p>"

Different flaps have been described based on these arteries. Similarly, the vascularization of the proximal half of HE has also been investigated, although to a lesser extent. The aim of this paper is to determine, in a cadaver sample, the anatomy of the hypothenar cutaneous branches in their proximal half. Methods: In all, 20 adult, red-colored-latex-injected hands were studied. Dissections were performed with a 4X to 10X magnification. Cutaneous branches in the proximal half of the HE were found. Their variants were studied, and they were classified into different types according to their relationships. Results: A cutaneous branch of the deep palmar artery (CBDPA) was identified. It was located in the subcutaneous cellular tissue thickness in the proximal half of the HE. Moreover, it presented 3 anatomical variants, classified according to its relationships with the superficial ulnar nerve branch (SUN). Type 1 variant: the CBDPA and the PDA ran in front of the SUN (60% of cases). Type 2: the CBDPA and the DPA ran behind the SUN (30% of cases). Type 3: the CBDPA ran in front of the SUN while the DPA ran behind it (10% of cases). Conclusion: There is a CBDPA which is the HE proximal half main cutaneous branch. Although it presented several variants, its existence is constant, making it possible to use it as pedicle for proximal hypothenar flaps. </jats:p>",

They ask how the inter-firm coordination and firm–union cooperation demanded by a multi-firm transnational industrial relations agreement (TIRA) developed. Synthesizing insights from the industrial relations and private governance literatures along with recent collective action theory, they identify a new pathway for the emergence of multi-firm TIRAs based on common group understandings, positive experiences of interaction, and trust. The central finding is that existing union-inclusive governance initiatives provided a platform from which spillover effects developed, facilitating the formation of new TIRAs. The authors contribute a new mapping of labor governance approaches on the dimensions of inter-firm coordination and labor inclusiveness, foregrounding socialization dynamics as a basis for collective action and problematizing the limited scalability of this mode of institutional emergence. </jats:p>",

This article discusses the issues of increasing the reliability of power supply to active consumers, which is achieved through the use of cable products with a higher level of reliability. The concept of \"reliability\", disclosed in the article, is valid for all cables and wires with insulation, which must maintain integrity as part of the product for the entire period of operation. The use of fundamentally improved technological processes, as the conducted study shows, makes it possible to reduce ohmic resistance of the conductive part of the cable product and thereby allows reducing the temperature parameters of the operating cable line. Cable failure, in most cases, is associated with insulation breakdown, the reason for which can be caused by a rise in temperature inside the cable insulation. In this regard, the creation of conditions for reducing the ohmic resistance of a current-carrying conductor is one of the ways to increase the reliability of a cable product at the stage of its manufacture. Proposed technical solution, considered in this article, is focused on the technological operation - drawing, where changes in the standard drawing route make possible reduction of the ohmic resistance of the current-carrying conductor by 3-5% for copper and aluminum, respectively.</jats:p>"

The development of the new Logistics Platforms 4.0 induces public-private actions that lead to a new territorial planning and integration of routes, corridors, logistics centres, and commercial areas, in which the metropolitan area stands out as a main actor, leading to the creation of chains of connected and intelligent logistics platforms worldwide. The new urban logistics, which is more effective and efficient, is analyzed as an essential vector for the development of the new logistics platforms. Likewise, the most important logistic problems and metropolitan restrictions that arise for the development of more sustainable and intelligent cities, and the applicable concept of aerotropolis are analyzed. </jats:p>"

Because it is used for heating, local heat supply and domestic purposes, it is crucial to determine which sources of heat are used by individual and central sources of heat. Therefore, such heat sources have been considered, whose thermal loads have been determined according to the particular region’s heat specific expenses and for the provision of local heat supply. Gas consumption was also determined by electric energy indicators of heat sources, heat losses during the transformation and transportation of the heat pipe. Accordingly, it is introduced a method to determine the storage volumes of gas storage facilities of settlements with different quantities of populations, the amount of electric power consumed by compressors and by electric drives for air cooling, the required surfaces.</jats:p>"

Two scenarios were produced with chlorine dose of 0.6 mg/l at a flow rate of 26 ml/s and chlorine dose of 0.5 mg /l at a flow rate of 22 ml/s, respectively. Residual chlorine concentration above normal limits (0.5 mg/l) was recorded in both scenarios around the injection point whereas four sample points were below 0.2 mg/l. Scenario II, all residual chlorine values were lower than 0.5 mg/l but still lower than 0.2 mg/l at the farthest four sampling points.  In order to solve the above problem, A third scenario was developed with three reservoir injection points, Junction 4 and 55'' within 0.45, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/l of chlorine in order to maintain appropriate residual chlorine concentration.  Hence, the best solution identified from the analysis was the installation of two additional chlorine injection points.</jats:p>"

Necessary data for optimization problem definition: the structure of daily water consumption by consumers and resistance of the water-supply system were found on the base of a full-scale experiment results. The adopted approach has provided both mathematical rigor of the problem formulation and solution, and real data recording of consumer behavior and water supply system conditions. The processing of the full-scale experiment data was carried out by statistical methods of analysis of non-stationary random processes. The optimization procedure was realized with the help of genetic algorithm method. Comparison of booster pumping station operation optimal plans on the base of different centrifugal pumps has allowed choosing such a type of pump, that when using it, maximum energy efficiency of the water supply system is achieved and operation of pumping station with minimum number of pumps with maximum possible efficiency is provided. Minimum essential dimensions of a reserve tank, optimal operation speed of the centrifugal pumps are determined.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Stratigraphic models typically predict accumulation of deep-water sands where coeval shelf-edge deltas are developed in reduced-accommodation and/or high-sediment-supply settings. On seismic data, these relationships are commonly investigated on a small number of clinothems, with a limited control on their lateral variability. Advanced full-volume seismic interpretation methods now offer the opportunity to identify high-order (i.e., 4th to 5th) seismic sequences (i.e., clinothems) and to evaluate the controls on shelf-to-basin sediment transfer mechanisms and deep-water sand accumulation at these high-frequency scales. This study focuses on the Lower Barrow Group (LBG), a shelf margin that prograded in the Northern Carnarvon Basin (North West Shelf, Australia) during the Early Cretaceous. Thanks to high-resolution 3D seismic data, 30 clinothems (average time span of ∼ 47,000 years) from the D. lobispinosum interval (142.3–140.9 Ma) are used to establish quantitative and statistical relationships between the shelf-margin architecture, paleoshoreline processes, and deep-water system types (i.e., quantitative 3D seismic stratigraphy). The results confirm that low values of rate of accommodation/rate of sediment supply (δA/δS) conditions on the shelf are associated with sediment bypass, whereas high δA/δS conditions are linked to increasing sediment storage on the shelf. However, coastal process regimes at the shelf edge play a more important role in the behavior of deep-water sand delivery. Fluvial-dominated coastlines are typically associated with steep slope gradients and more mature, longer run-out turbidite systems. In contrast, wave-dominated shorelines are linked to gentle slope gradients, with limited development of turbidite systems (except rare sheet sands and mass-transport deposits), where longshore drift currents contributed to shelf-margin accretion through the formation of extensive strandplains. In this context, reduced volumes of sand were transported offshore and mud belts were accumulated locally. This study highlights that variations from fluvial- to wave-dominated systems can result in significant lateral changes in shelf-margin architecture (i.e., slope gradient) and impact the coeval development of deep-water systems (i.e., architectural maturity). By integrating advanced tools in seismic interpretation, quantitative 3D seismic stratigraphy represents a novel approach in assessing at high resolution the controls on deep-water sand delivery, and potentially predicting the type and location of reservoirs in deep water based on the shelf-margin architecture and depositional process regime.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nContext. At pasture, the nutritional status of mares will change due to a dynamic association between their energy requirements and the energy supply. Change in the plane of nutrition can influence reproductive performance measures in the mares. To help optimise nutritional and operational management of mares on stud farms, the nutritional status of Thoroughbred broodmares and the factors influencing the energy supply and demand were investigated.\nAims. To assess nutritional status of the Thoroughbred broodmare herds under ‘normal’ New Zealand commercial stud-farm conditions.\nMethods. The energy intake, energy requirement and energy balance during the last 3 months of pregnancy and the first 5 months of lactation were modelled for mares with an initial bodyweight of 450 kg, 500 kg, 550 kg and 600 kg, and foaled at 0, 15, 50, and 90 days after 1 September.\nKey results. For all foaling dates and bodyweights, mares were in positive energy balance during the last 3 months of pregnancy (6.1–8.5%). Energy balance decreased as pregnancy progressed, followed by a large and acute energy deficit that was initiated soon after foaling and continued during lactation. The energy deficit during lactation varied between –8.6% and –12.4%, depending on the foaling date modelled. Mares foaling later in the season (50–90 days after 1 September) had greater and longer (30–50 days) postpartum energy deficit than did mares that foaled earlier in the season, who recovered within 20 days postpartum. The modelled changes in the energy balance would be large enough to initiate mobilisation of the fat reserve (body condition), and could, therefore, explain the observation of delayed postpartum to conception interval observed with later-foaling mares on commercial farms.\nConclusions. There is a large and prolonged energy deficit soon after foaling and throughout 150 days of lactation in Thoroughbred mares managed under New Zealand commercial grazing conditions. Foaling later in the season can cause a mismatch in energy supply and demand that would increase and prolong the energy deficit.\nImplications. These findings suggest a need for stud farms to actively manage the pasture supply and monitor the mare’s BWT and BCS changes in an attempt to optimise the mare’s nutritional status and reproductive performance.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Halal food is food in which its halalness status is regulated by a shariah institution, which is normally designated by the government. The halal status of food should be traced starting from raw materials, processing, packaging, transportation and distribution processes to end consumers. This is to make sure that halal food is free from any contamination that may change its halal status. The problem is the difficulty of tracing halal food along the supply chain as the supply chain information from the upstream to downstream in the food industry is not transparent. Currently, food tracking systems are a centralized system, where information about food status is only available to those who control the information. To improve the transparency of the food status and to increase trust from customers, a distributed and transparent system, where many parties can access the food status any time, is needed. Blockchain technology can be applied to help track the halalness status of food along its supply chain. As blockchain is inherently distributed and transparent, hence a distributed system can be developed by incorporating blockchain technology for tracking food status. This paper proposes a distributed system for tracing halal food along its supply chains using blockchain technology. This system is expected to support transparency, neutrality. </jats:p>",

To demonstrate the capability of the powder metallurgy HIP (PM/HIP) for nuclear power applications, a systematic study of 316 L commercial powder production, encapsulation/consolidation providers, and selected HIP parameters was undertaken by the Nuclear AMRC in collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). In this study, the 316 L powder specification limited the oxygen content of the powder to under 130 parts per million (ppm), which reflects the improvements that commercial powder suppliers have been making over the past decade to ensure greater powder cleanliness. The test program assessed powder supply, HIP service provider, and HIP sustain time. Excellent test results were achieved across the full range of variables studied with all billets meeting the specification requirements of ASTM A988 and additional requirements imposed based on nuclear manufacturing standards. Significantly, the study demonstrated the robustness of the PM/HIP supply chain, as material produced via differing HIP service providers resulted in very consistent material properties across the destructive test program. Furthermore, no significant difference in material properties was noted for material HIP between 2 and 8 h hold time, suggesting that the HIP process window is large. Both these results are significant from an end-user standpoint as they highlight the uniformity of the process through the full manufacturing cycle from powder procurement to destructive testing. Despite all material passing specification requirements, some property variation was noted for differing powder suppliers. Considering the systematic approach, this was attributed to powder composition, with both low oxygen and high nitrogen contents contributing to improvements in Charpy impact strength and tensile strength, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses how the Eastern Front’s Red Army solved the problem of food provision through self-supply, which was carried out by soldiers and the regimental command using requisitions and purchasing products from the local population. The emergence of this method was due to the inability of the front and army command to fully provide troops with provisions, as a result of which the leadership was forced to partially impose this task on the local regimental command, which often treated the organization of procurement and fight against soldier robbery rather carelessly. Nevertheless, food quality for the Red Army improved, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of marauding fighters. This was also facilitated by army command measures to improve the level of soldier discipline. In the article much attention is paid to the evolution of the population’s attitude to the procurement activity of soldiers and the regimental command. Despite the fact that initially the peasants rather negatively perceived the presence of the Red Army in the countryside, subsequently residents of villages began to show greater interest in cooperating with the troops, providing them with food, both on a voluntary and a monetary basis. This policy was favored by the army command, aimed at regulating procurement operations and maintaining good neighborly relations with the local population. Moreover, other means of obtaining food are listed, such as capturing enemy storage facilities at stations and in cities.</jats:p>"

The authors explore the strategic imperative of technology-based SCM innovation by performing detailed literature review regarding new automated technological innovations in SCM to understand the new set of business gains to be incurred from SCM. The authors then carried out, through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth personal interviews of the 24 SCM experts in the study. Thematic content analysis was done. The main finding of the study was that physical innovation in SCM has occurred at a slower pace as compared to digital innovation. Digital innovation was perceived to be helping firms more than physical innovation in SCM. The major challenge has been the integration of the new system with the existing SCM system. </jats:p>"

This led to the widespread of urbanisation in cities. As a developing country, this is also happening in major cities in Malaysia. In this regard, this also contributes to the needs of the residents to have affordable homes, especially in urban areas. Malaysia government is very serious in ensuring all its citizens towards owning their own homes. This can be seen clearly through the evolution of Malaysia's housing policy since the era of independence to the present. Therefore, this paper seeks to build theoretical understanding on affordable housing issues from supply and demand context. This was done based on findings by reviewing a thorough review of literature from local and global context pertaining to this issue. The findings from literature reveal that housing supply in Malaysia is leading by landed property development compare to high rise building. Most developers who developed the land with mixed development approach are having landed property housing for middle class and high-class income, while the high rise housing building is to cater the low income group. This could possibly become the main reasons for mismatch housing supply and demand in certain location. The conclusion from the literature help looking the issue of supply and demand mismatch from a broader view to help understand the underlying reason of housing supply by private sector as well as from the government sector. Furthermore, understanding Malaysian culture would also give an understanding on what are the factors that cause the buyer to buy a home.</jats:p>",

As recorded in 2014, 12% of country’s budget is from oil and gas industry and able to provide a significant increase in national economic growth. But in the other hand, supply chain performance in this industry shows inconsistencies in each year, especially in PT. XYZ. As one of the largest oil and gas companies in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. As the result, company’s targets are missed oftentimes and have not been able to achieve competitive advantage. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose performance improvements in the supply chain of PT. XYZ. This study uses the model of Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) 11.0 which focuses on the attributes of reliability, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and fishbone in collecting and processing research data. The result shows that the supply chain performance of PT. XYZ. which focused on the reliability attribute is categorized as good, starting from 2012 to 2017. There is 1 indicator that need to be improved and get further control, that is the indicator of percentage of supplier meeting environmental metrics/criteria and fill rate. One means to overcome the problem is by using big data analysis approach, because the approach can analyze big number of data in the Company, whether it’s structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.</jats:p>",

We model the interplay between these supply chain participants as a Stackelberg game and analyze their operating and financing decisions. In one capital‐constrained retailer case, we find that either the manufacturer's high loss aversion level or the retailer's low initial capital motivates the manufacturer to adopt insurance. Insurance drives more credit financing with more attractive financing terms (a lower wholesale price), which promotes the manufacturer to collect better product sales and performance. Although the retailer enjoys improved profit from insurance, its default risk increases. In contrast, in one capital‐constrained retailer and one well‐funded retailer scenario, numerically, when the manufacturer's loss aversion level is high or the weak retailer's initial capital is low, insurance is also adopted but is not always preferred by the capital‐constrained retailer due to competition. In addition, as the demand substitution rate increases, the manufacturer is more likely to prefer insurance due to better performance.</jats:p>",

For structural fields, 4 temperature ranges are allocated and a system of characterizing indicators was proposed. The regularities of the formation of daily gas consumption from the average daily outdoor air temperature for the proposed temperature ranges were established, the sensitivity coefficient of the relative change in the daily gas consumption with a relative daily change in the outdoor air temperature was determined. Daily models of the gas consumption dependence on the outdoor air temperature was developed, smoothed by a moving average over 30 days for two temperature regions: 1 - the area of the connected state of the heating system, 2 - the area of the disconnected state of the heating system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we present a novel, almost-digital approach for bolometer readout circuits to overcome the area and power dissipation bottlenecks of analog-based classical microbolometer circuits. A current-controlled oscillator (CCO)-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is utilized instead of a capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) in the classical readout circuits. This approach, which has not been reported before, both produces the required gain in the bolometer input circuit and directly digitizes the bolometer signal. With the proposed architecture, the need for large capacitances (of the order of 10–15[Formula: see text]pF for each column) at which the current is accumulated in the bolometer circuits and the voltage headroom limitation of classical microbolometer circuits are eliminated. Therefore, the proposed architecture permits to design readout circuits with reduced pixel pitch and lower power supply, both of which in turn lead to higher-resolution Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) with lower power dissipation. The new architecture is modeled and simulated using a 180-nm CMOS process for sensitivity, noise performance, and power dissipation. Unlike the 3.3-V power supply usage of classical readout circuits, the proposed design utilizes 1.2-V analog and 0.9-V digital supply voltages with a power dissipation of almost half of the classical approach. </jats:p>",

Simultaneously, the population keeps on increasing. The legitimate question that this study seeks to address is how the production capacity can meet the needs of the increasing population in the future. The chapter examines the increase in population growth and its consequences on food production with the consideration of the theory of population growth by Thomas Malthus. The result of time series data analyzed shows that population growth is increasing at a high rate whereas food production growth is increasing at a decreasing rate. The trend seems to confirm that the Malthus population theory is still relevant in Africa. The study recommends that stewards and policymakers invest immensely in agriculture to improve technology, skills, methods, and know-how to boost food production and invest in women in adopting family planning to decrease population growth for the solution of food deficiency. </jats:p>"

At the firm level, management decisions follow cost efficiency and risk management principles, pursuing a cost-risk tradeoff equilibrium. Theoretically, operations organized within the boundaries of the firm are just those for which the markets are unable to offer a more efficient alternative, whereas the link between buyers and sellers (i.e., demand and supply in the market) is intermediated by logistics services, such as transport, to mention but one.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Halal food is food in which its halalness status is regulated by a shariah institution, which is normally designated by the government. The halal status of food should be traced starting from raw materials, processing, packaging, transportation and distribution processes to end consumers. This is to make sure that halal food is free from any contamination that may change its halal status. The problem is the difficulty of tracing halal food along the supply chain as the supply chain information from the upstream to downstream in the food industry is not transparent. Currently, food tracking systems are a centralized system, where information about food status is only available to those who control the information. To improve the transparency of the food status and to increase trust from customers, a distributed and transparent system, where many parties can access the food status any time, is needed. Blockchain technology can be applied to help track the halalness status of food along its supply chain. As blockchain is inherently distributed and transparent, hence a distributed system can be developed by incorporating blockchain technology for tracking food status. This paper proposes a distributed system for tracing halal food along its supply chains using blockchain technology. This system is expected to support transparency, neutrality. </jats:p>",

We explored Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky ST198 samples from the broiler chicken supply chain and patients between 2010 and 2016. Here, we collected 180 S. Kentucky isolates from clinical cases and the poultry supply chain. We performed XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. We assessed mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions and screened for the presence of the Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1). We determined that 63 (35.0%) of the 180 isolates were S. Kentucky ST198. Chinese strains of S. Kentucky ST198 have a high transmission of ciprofloxacin resistance (38/63, 60.3%) and a high risk of multidrug resistance. The quinolone resistance of the S. Kentucky ST198 strain found in China may be due to mutations in its quinolone resistance-determining region. Our study firstly revealed that ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky ST198 strains can undergo cross-host transmission, thereby causing a serious foodborne public health problem in China.</jats:p>"

The time to send the command to turn the backup power switch on is determined on the basis of the results of approximating the dependence of the angle between the voltages of the main and backup power sources on time. The proposed algorithm can be used in microprocessor fast-acting automatic transfer switch devices to ensure acceptable levels of currents of stators and electromagnetic moments of electric motors in self-starting modes and to maintain a complex continuous technolo­gical process at industrial enterprises.

Then we consider the ships containers to storage areas assignment problem (SSAP) which finds an allocation of ship containers to storage area that minimises the travelling time and containers dispersion. In the first step, a mixed integer linear program model is designed to address the BA problem with the aim of minimising the ships stay time in the port (known as the scheduling theory by the flow time). In a second step, the output of the first model is used in another mixed integer linear program model to solve the SSA problem with a view at reducing both travelling time and containers dispersion while satisfying storage capacities for the case where the containers of one ship can be partitioned into two different and consecutive storage area when needed. The experimental part is conducted on a real case, namely the Tunisian port of Radès. </jats:p>"

Furthermore, two cases are considered (i) only one manufacturer adopts warranty policy as a competitive strategy against the other, (ii) both manufacturers offer warranty on their product, to study under which situation offering a warranty becomes more profitable for a manufacturer while the other competitive manufacturer has already adopted warranty policy. The profit functions of the manufacturers and the retailer are then maximized under manufacturers' cooperative and non-cooperative strategies. We then compare the scenarios under different decision strategies numerically, which gives some insights on changes of key parameters to help the decision makers to capture the market.</jats:p>"

Collaboration with stakeholders is a promising way to overcome these challenges. In Morocco, healthcare access and continuity of care remain difficult due, among others, to the various stakeholders involved and the lack of ambulances for extra-hospital and interhospital medical patient transportation (MPT). In this chapter, the aim was to explore collaboration in healthcare supply chain to improve the availability of ambulances for interhospital MPT (transfers). For this purpose, an overview of the MPT system in Morocco was presented while highlighting its main issues. Then, a case study of three hospitals in Casablanca City was analyzed employing a collaborative approach. It consisted in forecasting transfer requests for next periods based on past data, and redistributing the ambulances of the three hospitals according to the forecasts. Findings attest to the variability in demand in the three hospitals and therefore the need for a dynamic allocation of ambulances. </jats:p>"

Simultaneous drought in all major source regions — or perfect drought — poses the most serious challenge to water management. We examine perfect droughts relevant to Southern California (SoCal) water resources with instrumental records and tree‐ring reconstructions for the Sacramento and Colorado Rivers, and SoCal. Perfect droughts have occurred five times since 1906, lasting two to three years, except for the most recent event, 2012–2015. This number and duration of perfect droughts is not unusual in the context of the past six centuries. The modern period stands out for the relatively even distribution of perfect droughts and lacks the clusters of perfect drought documented in prior centuries. In comparison, perfect droughts of the 12th Century were both longer (up to nine years) and more widespread. Perfect droughts of the 20th and 21st Centuries have occurred under different oceanic/atmospheric patterns, zonal and meridional flow, and ENSO or non‐ENSO conditions. Multidecadal coherence across the three regions exists, but it has varied over the past six centuries, resulting in irregular intervals of perfect drought. Although the causes of perfect droughts are not clear, given the long‐term natural variability along with projected changes in climate, it is reasonable to expect more frequent and longer perfect droughts in the future.</jats:p>",

The objective of the paper is to show how Integrated Supply Chain Projects (Progetti Integrati di Filiera (PIF)), Italian rural policy tools funded in the framework of EU’s Rural Development Policy, can integrate supply chain innovation and territorial integrated strategies, fostering a multifunctional development of marginal rural areas towards a newly discovered identity. The case study is the PIF “Flora Aromatica Santa Luce” funded by the Tuscany Regional Administration RDP in 2016. The project aims at creating a new supply chain of organic aromatic plants in the Santa Luce Valley (PI). The integration is based, on the one side, on the creation and valorization of the new supply chain product, represented by an organic cosmetic line made with lavender essential oil, and, on the other side, on the territorial development of the Valley, in an economic, social, environmental and touristic perspective. From a theoretical point of view, the approach used was based on the new rural development paradigm, assuming that the processes of broadening, deepening and regrounding, together compose the main axis of rural development. The canvas model was used in order to identify a business model for the new supply chain and the territorial development of the area, while, at the methodological level, a participatory action research (PAR) approach was adopted. Results show how a supply chain project (like a PIF) can enhance innovation and stable commercial relationships within the supply chain and support processes of vertical and horizontal coordination, but also stimulate extended territorial strategies supporting the integration processes between agriculture, processing and other economic activities following a territorial multifunctional development logic. At the same time, key benefits for the policymaker and local administrations can also be identified in particular for marginal rural areas where farmers and other local actors are weaker and collective action is more difficult. Thanks to the PAR approach, a PIF can stimulate participation of farmers to relevant RDP measures but also allow convergence of individual actions towards wider regional and local strategic objectives.</jats:p>",

Total phytoplankton densities oscillate between 100 105 cells / L (August) and 321 105 cells / L (February) with high proportions of Cyanobacteria greater than 45% during each month of the rainy season. The highest values of Shannon and Equitability diversities are observed during the dry season months.</jats:p>"

However, this response is highly dependent on the availability and possibly the form of nitrogen (N) supply to plants. This study aimed to investigate changes in C and N metabolism of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in response to e-CO2 and N source. e-CO2 enhanced net CO2 assimilation but at highly variable rates depending on the form of N supply. Under e-CO2, net CO2 assimilation rate was in the order NO3– &amp;gt; NH4NO3 &amp;gt; NH4+ &amp;gt; urea. Plants supplied with ammonium and nitrate (i.e. NH4NO3) performed better in terms of biomass production and expressed a higher biomass enhancement ratio by e-CO2 than plants receiving sole applications of NO3–, NH4+ or urea. Supply of NH4NO3 also resulted in lower intercellular CO2, higher photoassimilate translocation to roots and lower accumulation of free amino acids than other N forms, indicating a better exploitation of the e-CO2 environment. Our results conclude that major physiological pathways of photosynthesis and protein and carbohydrate metabolism are differentially influenced by e-CO2 depending on the source of N supply. A balanced supply of NO3– and NH4+ to plant roots is the key to harnessing e-CO2 while minimising its adverse effects on quality of the produce.</jats:p>"

Traditionally in the USSR and further in Russia, voltage classes of 6 and 10 kV are used for urban distribution electric networks. The increasing density of electric load and electricity consumption does not allow in extremely cramped conditions of developing cities to provide electricity through existing cable lines with a voltage of 6-10 kV due to their limited bandwidth and lack of reliability. The technical condition of the equipment and cable lines in the 6-10 kV supply networks has significant physical and moral deterioration. Existing networks have insufficient redundancy and have practically exhausted their ability to connect new consumers. These circumstances required a decision to switch to a voltage class of 20 kV, which is a strategic direction for the development of medium voltage electrical networks in Moscow. According to this decision, since the 2000s, electric networks with a voltage of 20 kV have been actively developing in Russia and in Moscow. This article analyzes the implemented approaches to the use of an electric network of 20 kV in megacities of different countries.</jats:p>"

The power supply is used to supply electronic devices and laboratory-scale equipment, one of which is electrospinner. Electrospinner is an instrument used to make nanofibers consisting of several components, namely: power supply, high voltage, syringe pump, and collector drum. Electrospinner requires a stable supply of voltage so that the system can work well and requires a lot of voltage supply to supply components from the electrospinner. Arduino-based switching mode power supply (SMPS) is designed in this research. Arduino-based SMPS makes it possible to produce a stable supply with many outputs. Arduino as a PWM generator is used to control the power supply output voltage based on duty cycle. The results of the study addressed the duty cycle affecting the output of the power supply. The output voltage generated by the power supply can be set from 0-100 V with an accuracy of 98.19%, an error of 1.81% and a precision of 0.02% which is stated by the variation of the coefficient. The power supply produced also has an extra output voltage of 15 VCT and 15 V.</jats:p>",

In this study of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) we determined which growth parameters are affected by nitrate (N) availability, and whether these were confounded by differences in plant size, reflecting differences in growth. Plants were hydroponically grown on six different nitrate (N) concentrations for 28 days, and nine harvests were performed to assess the effect of N on growth parameters. Most growth parameters showed similar patterns of responses to N supply whether compared at common time points or common plant sizes. N had a significant effect on the biomass allocation: increasing N increased leaf mass ratio (LMR) and decreased root mass ratio (RMR). Specific leaf area (SLA) was not significantly affected by N. RGR increased with increasing N supply up to 1 mM, associated with increases in both LMR and net assimilation rate (NAR). Increases in N supply above 1 mM did not increase RGR as increases in LMR were offset by decreases in NAR. The high RGR at suboptimal N supply suggest a higher nitrogen use efficiency (biomass/N supply). The reasons for the homeostasis of growth under suboptimal N levels are discussed.</jats:p>"

To this end, an exploratory study was carried out, focusing on a regional DMO in Portugal: Tourism of Alentejo/Ribatejo. The methodology used in this study unfolds in three phases: (1) a content analysis of strategic and operational plans and/or activities of the DMO under study; (2) analysis of its online presence, namely its website, social networks, and positioning in the Google search engine; and, finally, (3) a semi-structured interview with the president of the DMO. The results indicate that DMOs start to wage digital communication, opting to be on the Internet through their own website and with a profile created in some social networks. However, their activity in social networks is not regular. On the other hand, DMOs are still in a very incipient phase in the use of web and social networks data to support the organization's decision making.</jats:p>"

In Colombia, particularly in the city of Medellin, several social projects are being developed seeking to provide health and other social services to vulnerable populations. The purpose of this chapter is to deal with a real application of the home health care routing and scheduling problem (HHCRSP), in which a set of health professionals grouped by teams should visit a set of users geographically scatter over the city. Here, it is proposed a mixed integer linear model and a heuristic solution approach. The mathematical model is based on vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (VRPPD) with additional features related with the specific application and geographical conditions. </jats:p>"

The improvement of the company's performance can be made by implementing supply chain practices. The implementation of supply chain practice is a policy set by the company's top management by making the system integrated. Integration of all functions, internally and externally, is done by using integrated information technology. This study takes data from companies in East Java, engaged in machinery that has a workforce of more than 100 people categorized as medium and large companies. Respondents were set on employees with a minimum of 2 yr of working experience and a middle manager position. There were 55 respondents in this study, with data analysis using partial least square (PLS) to test the research hypothesis. The result of the data processing found that the commitment of top management affects the supply chain practices and the use of information technology. This is because the management has shown its commitment by providing the necessary human resources. The top management commitment directly influences the company's operational performance. The use of information technology directly affects supply chain practices and the company's operational performance. Supply chain practices affect the company's operational performance. This is because the company has carried out the process of information sharing with the company's suppliers to control and facilitate the procurement of quality raw materials.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to fabricate multiple-winding transformers for polyphase supply that means more than the classical three-phase supply. Usually, transformers do not change the phase, that is, from single phase to three phase or vice versa, but according to the required power applications, transformer windings are connected in such a way to get the desired phase supply. Transformers are connected to implement three or more phases, which are generally referred as polyphase or multiphase transformers. In order to obtain three-phase transformers from one single unit with respect to the required phase supply of the transformer for the same kVA rating, the circuit becomes less expensive, smaller, and much lighter than when it is obtained from three single-phase individual transformers. In this work, the proposed multiphase supply is preferred as five, obtained from three individual transformers instead of five single-phase transformers. By properly connecting the secondary windings of the three multiwinding single-phase transformers, the required power output is obtained. Different multiple-winding transformer topologies are discussed and elaborated through both simulation and experimental analysis with the fabricated proposed five-phase multiple-winding transformer. </jats:p>",

It analyses steps taken towards uniformity in this area of law within the EU and contemplates whether there is a need for further harmonisation. The article attempts to evaluate the scope of the UTP Directive, focusing mainly on a material scope inherently linked to the notion of “agricultural and food products” and characteristics of unfair trading practices. It also discusses whether Member States should consider widening the national regulations beyond food supply chain so that their scope would cover vertical relationships in every sector of the economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT  Objective: to analyze the strategies used by nurses for organization and planning in the centralization process of the Central Supply Sterile Department at a General Hospital.  Method: this is a qualitative study of the history of the present time, carried out through an interview with 8 nursing professionals, such as nurses and nursing technicians at a hospital in the city of Petrópolis, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data collection took place between September 2017 and August 2018. For analysis and interpretation of the documentary corpus, pertinence, sufficiency, completeness, representativeness, homogeneity and organization of documents in chronological order of the events during the investigated period were considered. The historical context was triangulated, with social structures and the symbolic universe resulting from interviews and documentary analysis. Thus, the categories of analysis emerged.  Results: the strategies used by nurses occurred through organization and new work practices, enhancement of the Central Supply Sterile Department, hiring new nursing technicians, staff training and insertion of new technologies before, during and after centralization from the Central Supply Sterile Department.  Conclusion: material sterilization at Hospital Santa Teresa continued with fractional nursing care among surgical patients and material processing. The strategies to centralize the sterilization unit contributed to a correct sterilization of hospital materials, resulting in expressive gains for nursing, Hospital Santa Teresa, society and control of Infections Related to Health Care.</jats:p>"

The approach is based on methods of machine learning and modeling of technical systems. The primary data for machine learning was obtained on the developed software/hardware prototype of the water supply system by using a number of microcontrollers, sensors and actuators. The experiments confirmed the feasibility of the proposed approach. Several machine learning methods from scikit-learn library of the Python programming language were tested. As a result of the experiments we identified a learning method and its parameters ensuring the highest accuracy of the abnormal situations recognition.</jats:p>",

The need to use a stockpile can be caused by an interruption to supply, a rapid and unexpected peak in demand, or when both an interruption to supply and a peak in demand occur simultaneously.   The objectives of a stockpile will guide the portfolio breadth and depth to be held. Stockpile objectives are broadly driven either by government requirements to protect public health or by organisations seeking toachieve commercial gain. These drivers are not mutually exclusive as in the case of holding safety stock and Public Service Obligation stock.  An Emergency Stockpile is Public Health driven and held in order to supply essential medicines during a signifcant or catastrophic event.  Emergency stockpiles can be split into three categories — preparation for imminent event, disease specifc response and general contingency stockpiles. Governments and authorities determine which products and volumes should be held in an emergency stockpile which may be guided by the World Health Organizations (WHO) l ist of essential medicines.</jats:p>"

Companies are now trying to minimize environmental impacts by integrating environmental concerns into their supply chain operations. In the aim of reducing carbon emissions, the industry is faced with different drivers, barriers, and performance indicator. With a variety of problems faced, the practices taken to reduce carbon emissions are very diverse. Thirty papers were collected from previous studies and linked to discussion points. The result showed that good coordination with various media in the supply chain system would be able to achieve common goals in reducing gas emissions.</jats:p>",

The most direct and effective approach usually employs high-density biocatalyst, while the weakened mass transfer and evoked foam problem accompany ultrahigh-density biocatalyst loading and substrate/product titer. In high-density obligate aerobic bioconversion, oxygen as electron acceptor is a speed-limiting step in bioprocesses, but sufficient oxygen supply will lead to the foaming which results in a significant reduction in oxygen utilization and the use of additional defoamers. In this study, we designed a novel sealed-oxygen supply (SOS) biotechnology to resolve the formidable barrier of oxygen transferring rate (OTR), for bio-based fuels and chemical production process.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Based on systemic analysis of whole-cell catalysis in <jats:italic>Gluconobacter oxydans,</jats:italic> a novel sealed-oxygen supply technology was smartly designed and experimentally performed for biocatalytic oxidation of alcohols, sugars and so on.

It is also identified that there is no causality relationship between these variables. It is recommended that the countries should generate appropriate policies to minimize carbon emission problem. Within this context, new tax can be implemented for the companies that lead to high carbon emission. Additionally, governments can give incentives to the projects that aim to decrease carbon emission. In this scope, decreasing tax ratio and providing a technical support can be given as examples. </jats:p>"

This means that the tourism industry has started to change attitudes towards an ecosystem based on consumer behaviour and positive externalities. Consequently, the supply changes based on the circular economy (CE) have become one of the main issues for sustainable tourism in the Algarve. The propose is to analyse the relationship between the CE and the tourism industry based on stakeholder opinions and evaluate the tourism business model founded on a new assumption of positive externalities from the tourism sector. This chapter discusses the tourism sector and evaluation of the circular economy based on Porter's diamond model methodology. This chapter concludes that the tourism industry in the Algarve has started to show interest in changing attitudes to an efficient and smart perception of the CE. This investigation will give other sectors the opportunity to discuss the CE process based on a new supply of and innovation in products. </jats:p>"

Those three projects address the potential weaknesses – supplier diversity, provision of enriched fissile material – associated with the furbishing of nuclear fuels. First, the ESSANUF project, now terminated, resulted in the design and licensing of a fuel element for VVER-440 nuclear power plant manufactured by Westinghouse. The HERACLES-CP project aimed at preparing the conversion of high performance research reactor to low enriched uranium fuels by exploring fuels based on uranium-molybdenium. Finally, the LEU-FOREvER pursues the work initiated in HERACLES-CP, completing it by an exploration of the high-density silicide fuels, and including the diversification of fuel supplier for soviet designed European medium power research reactor.

Information no longer flows from suppliers to tourists, being the tourist, simultaneously an information consumer and an information creator or generator based on his tourism experience. Through networks, searches, and metasearch engines tourists can review and rate products and services and can access other users' information. They can access online content before, during, and after the trip. This information serves as a reference to choose the next destination to travel to, being much more influential than that generated by the tourism provider or the destination management office. As a case study, this chapter analyses online reputation of the hotel offer in the city of Porto (Portugal), the second most important city in the country, using information from Booking.com. Known as one of the most well-known search engines worldwide, Booking.com allows the guests to assess the hotel units they have stayed in, using seven different items, from staff to free Wi-Fi.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, it is not possible to carry out an integrated sustainability analysis because the quantification of the biophysical capacity of the ecosystems to supply ecosystem services is not taken into account. This paper considers a methodological proposal connecting the flow demand of a process or system product from the technosphere and the feasibility of the ecosystem to supply based on the sink capacity. The ecosystem metabolism as an analytical framework and data from a case study of an LCA of combined heat and power (CHP) plant with and without post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) technology in Mexico were applied. Three scenarios, including water and energy depletion and climate change impact, are presented to show the types of results obtained when the process effect of operation is scaled to one year. The impact of the water–energy–carbon nexus over the natural infrastructure or ecological fund in LCA is analyzed. Further, the feasibility of the biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) from this result for Mexico is discussed. On the supply side, in the three different scenarios, the CHP plant requires between 323.4 and 516 ha to supply the required oil as stock flow and 46–134 ha to supply the required freshwater. On the sink side, 52–5,096,511 ha is necessary to sequester the total CO2 emissions. Overall, the CHP plant generates 1.9–28.8 MW/ha of electricity to fulfill its function. The CHP with PCC is the option with fewer ecosystem services required.</jats:p>"

The CODEX Committee on Food Labelling is in the process of establishing standardized criteria for the definition of “high-in” for use with FOP labels highlighting excessive amounts of fats, sugars and sodium in foods. Recently, as part of Health Canada's <jats:italic>Healthy Eating Strategy</jats:italic>, regulations requiring the mandatory display of high-in FOP symbols have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which these symbols would appear on foods and beverages in the Canadian prepackaged food supply, both overall and by food category.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0029665120006667_sec_a2\" sec-type=\"methods\"><jats:title /><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Foods and beverages in the University of Toronto's Food Label Information Program database 2013 (n = 15,277) were assessed for the prevalence of products that would have to display a symbol based on criteria published in the draft Canadian regulations. The criteria include thresholds based on the % Daily Value (DV) for each nutrient, above which, products would be required to display a FOP symbol for that nutrient. Exemptions are provided for fruits and vegetables without added sodium, sugars, or saturated fats, non-flavoured whole or partly skimmed milk, eggs, sweetening agents (i.e. sugar, honey, syrups and molasses) and table salt.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S0029665120006667_sec_a3\" sec-type=\"results\"><jats:title /><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> 61.7% (n = 10,251) of products would be required to display at least one symbol.

Overall, 37% of products would display a symbol for more than one nutrient.

The proposed metaheuristic method does not require specifying the probability of mutation, the number of mutations, the number of selected new cells and allows using only binary potential solutions, which makes discrete optimization possible and reduces computational complexity by preventing permanent transformations of real potential solutions into intermediate binary ones and vice versa. An immune metaheuristic algorithm based on the T-cell model has been created, intended for implementation on the GPU using the CUDA parallel information processing technology. The proposed optimization method based on immune metaheuristics can be used to intellectualize the Lean Production technology. The prospects for further researches are to test the proposed methods on a wider set of test databases.</jats:p>"

This study quantified the water consumption of anthropic activities according to the water footprint (WF) and the water supply available (WSA) using the GR2M hydrological simulation model in the Quenane-Quenanito basin in Colombia. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamic supply–demand of water and identify potential conflicts associated with the use of water. The results of this study show that the WF of the basin was 17.01 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year, 79.97% of which was the green WF and 20.03% of which was the blue WF, and that the WSA of the basin was 272.1 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year. In addition, potential conflicts over the use of water were identified due to water scarcity in 11 sub-basins during the months of January to March. In conclusion, analyzing the demand and supply of water in basins and taking into account their spatiotemporal distribution allows us to measure the impacts of anthropic activities on water resources, which can prevent potential conflicts associated with the use of water between sectors or the involvement of ecological dynamics. </jats:p>",

This study was conducted as the quasi-experimental design. The population of the study consisted of the mothers and their infants, to whom they gave birth in a university hospitals located in either eastern or western Turkey, between December 2016 and June 2017. In this study, mothers and their infants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (kangaroo mother care, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">n</jats:italic> = 30) and the control group (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">n</jats:italic> = 30). This study included 2500 to 4000 g birth weight infants who had no serious health problems and no sucking problems. The Introductory Information Form, the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Perception of Insufficient Milk Questionnaire were used to collect the data. In this study, kangaroo mother care was provided as a nursing intervention for the mothers in the experimental group twice a day until they were discharged. Any other application was not performed in the control group's mothers apart from the routine application. Ethical principles were adhered in all stages of the study. The breastfeeding self-efficacy mean score (65.50 ± 3.95) of the mothers who performed kangaroo mother care was higher than the mean score of the mothers who did not perform kangaroo mother care (55.50 ± 7.00) (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> &lt; .001). In addition, mothers in the experimental group (46.60 ± 3.40) perceived their milk more sufficiently than mothers in the control group (30.17 ± 11.37) (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> &lt; .001). In the study, a statistically significant correlation was determined between breastfeeding self-efficacy levels of mothers in the experimental group and the perceived insufficient milk supply (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">P</jats:italic> ˂ .05). In the study, kangaroo mother care increased breastfeeding self-efficacy perception of the mothers and reduced the perceived insufficient milk supply. This shows that kangaroo mother care can potentially have an important effect on breastfeeding perceptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dietary electrolyte balance (dEB) is known to affect acid−base status and mineral metabolism, but is rarely considered in diet formulation for pigs. Yet, the use of a wide variety of local feedstuffs in Europe contributes to lowering the dEB and increasing the fibre content. Hence, mineral requirements may be modified and skeletal health affected. Therefore, the effects of a lower dEB and a higher dietary Ca level on acid−base balance and mineral status were assessed in young pigs fed a diversified diet. A total of twenty-four weaned pigs were fed a control moderate-dEB diet (C) or a diversified moderate-dEB (D), low-dEB (D-A) or low-dEB supplemented with Ca (D-CA) diet. Growth performance, venous blood gas and chemistry, urine pH, mineral balance and femur characteristics were determined. With an equivalent dEB compared with the C diet, the D diet caused an acidification of the urine and increased the excretion of P as a result of a higher dietary content of S. Low-grade metabolic acidosis occurred in piglets fed the D-A diet with changes at systemic and urine levels. A higher excretion of ammonia and P in urine was observed and some bone characteristics tended to be negatively affected. Ca supplementation partially counteracted the effects of low-grade acidosis. Urine excretion of P and ammonia was alleviated and bone characteristics improved. In conclusion, a higher Ca supply must be considered in more diversified diets to counteract the risk of evolving towards low-grade metabolic acidosis which can negatively affect bone.</jats:p>"

First, a 2PAEG model is established. Then, complete evolutionary equilibrium rules of this model are revealed during decision-making processes. Discussion shows that final evolutionary game equilibria achieved in the 2PAEG model are only determined by some payoff parameters, which are defined as relative net payoff (RNP) parameters in this paper. Finally, a case study of supply-side bidding simulation for two generator populations is conducted, which can effectively verify the universality and effectiveness of the evolutionary dynamics results obtained in the established general 2PAEG model. Moreover, it shows that reasonable policies made by the government can guide more appropriate power bidding for onto-grid electricity.</jats:p>"

To measure the spatial variability of the soil water content and to determine the optimal number of sampling sites for predicting the mean soil water content at different stages of the irrigation cycle, field experiments were carried out in a potato field in northwestern China. The soil water content was measured in 2016 and 2017 at depths of 0–20 and 20–40 cm at 116 georeferenced locations. The average coefficient of variation of the soil water content was 20.79% before irrigation and was 16.44% after irrigation at a depth of 0–20 cm. The spatial structure of the soil water content at a depth of 20–40 cm was similar throughout the irrigation cycle, but at a depth of 0–20 cm a relatively greater portion of the variation in the soil water content was spatially structured before irrigation than after irrigation. The autocorrelation of soil water contents was influenced by irrigation only in the surface soil layer. To accurately predict mean soil moisture content, 40 and 20 random sampling sites should be chosen with errors of 5% and 10%, respectively.</jats:p>",

According to the results of the analysis, the data indicate that the quality of logistic service affects logistic performance and firm performance positively and directly. Also, it is clear from the results that the mediation role of logistic performance and its indirect impact are important in the effect of logistic service quality on firm performance. In the effect of the quality of logistic performance on firm performance, the role of technology in moderation is understood.

There are three different patterns of demand: real demand, false demand, and semi-real demand. For this article, we study the product supply strategy formulated for manufacturer-to-group customers based on a semi-real demand pattern. Firstly, we construct two mathematical models in which the manufacturer obtains the best profit based on the two supply modes in the semi-real demand pattern. Secondly, we solve the optimal production volume and optimal pricing. Finally, numerical examples are used to verify the validity of the model. In accordance with the optimization principle, results of the analysis are extended to the range of optimal value of product profit in the demand model, so as to explore the mechanism of manufacturers for maximizing group customers’ product profits under the semi-real demand model.</jats:p>",

This paper will address a fuzzy robust control (FRC) approach to mitigate the BE in the uncertain CLSC with lead times. For the reverse channels for products in the CLSC, the customers’ used products are recycled by both the manufacturer and the third party recovery provider, and new products bought by customers within a certain period of time can be returned to the retailer. In the CLSC system, the state transformation equations of the inventories and the total operation cost are set up. A new FRC approach is proposed to mitigate the BE and realize the robust stability of the uncertain CLSC with lead times. A simulation example verifies the mitigation effect of the BE under the proposed FRC approach.</jats:p>",

Suppliers and traders in Beringharjo market used flexible methods of payment, such as manual receipt and trust-based relation (for instance pay on other day). The suppliers and traders had been work together for more than five years. The emerging problems were the lack of fresh fish supply and the low quality of processed fish. The supply chain model for fresh fish involved three stages (supplier-seller-ultimate customer/household) and the supply chain model for processed fish in four stages (supplier-wholesaler-trader/seller-ultimate consumer). The supply chain model for the milkfish also consisted of four stages (supplier-fish processor-seller-ultimate consumer).

The essence of this method is to combine the processes of plastic deformation from impacts of wire brush with coating for various functional purposes. The design of the feed device has been developed, which allows controlling the necessary clamping force of the coating material element (MCE) to the wire tool. The control of clamping force provides temperature stabilization in the contact between the MCE and the tool and allows to increase the uniformity of coating formation on the workpiece. The coating material is set with eccentricity relative to the axes of the brush, which makes it rotate about its axis during operation, ensuring its uniform wear. This feed device is easily dismantled, which provides a quick replacement of the MCE.</jats:p>",

It does not depend on electrical and fossil energy and robust, inexpensive, easy to install and maintain. All these qualities make it suitable for use in remote areas where water and electricity supply, especially in developing countries. The aim of this study is to construct a low cost UTM hydraulic ram pump for water supply in remote areas, provided that it must have a reliable design and made of materials available locally in Malaysia. The design must also be easy to assemble and dismantle, easy to maintain and durable with a long service life. In order to achieve these objectives, existing ram pump designs by other researchers were studied to provide the basics in designing the UTM hydraulic ram pump. The ram pump efficiency is 62%, based on drive pipe diameter of 3” and air chamber volume of 33.3 L. Referring to the guidelines and experimental data these design specifications allow a total of 7000 L/day (4.86 L/min) of water to be delivered to the storage tank. The power required is about 23.9 kW which is enough to overcome head losses of about 54.52 m. Through a test stand, the value of circulations is 49 cycle/minute and thus the overall performance of the ram pump can be calculated before installation in remote areas. Other factors such as the proper material selection and safety considerations were also prioritized.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Our focus is on understanding how the supply–demand mismatch costs affect the firm’s optimal compensation scheme. There are two main findings. First, under the deterministic demand response, the classical optimality result of the convex increasing compensation scheme breaks with the consideration of supply–demand mismatch costs. Instead, the optimal compensation is S‐shaped under certain conditions. Second, under the stochastic demand response, the classical optimality result of the menu of linear compensation schemes fails to hold with the consideration of supply–demand mismatch costs. Instead, the optimal compensation schemes consist of a menu of linear compensation coupled with a penalty of the agent’s forecast error. </jats:p>",

Studies along surface‐elevation and thus flooding‐frequency gradients in tidal wetlands are often used to understand the effects of accelerated sea‐level rise on carbon sequestration, a process that is primarily determined by the balance of primary production and microbial decomposition. It has often been hypothesized that rates of microbial decomposition would increase with elevation and associated increases in soil oxygen availability; however, previous studies yield a wide range of outcomes and equivocal results. Our mechanistic understanding of the elevation–decomposition relationship is limited because most effort has been devoted to understanding the terminal steps of the decomposition process. A few studies assessed microbial exo‐enzyme activities (EEAs) as initial and rate‐limiting steps that often reveal important insight into microbial energy and nutrient constraints. The present study assessed EEAs and microbial abundance along a coastal ecotone stretching a flooding gradient from tidal flat to high marsh in the European Wadden Sea. We found that stabilization of exo‐enzymes to mineral sediments leads to high specific EEAs at low substrate concentrations in frequently flooded, sediment‐rich zones of the studied ecotone. We argue that the high background activity of a mineral‐associated enzyme pool provides a stable decomposition matrix in highly dynamic, frequently flooded zones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microbial communities are less nutrient limited in frequently flooded zones, where inputs of nutrient‐rich marine organic matter are higher. This was reflected in both increasing exo‐enzymatic carbon versus nutrient acquisition and decreasing fungal versus bacterial abundance with increasing flooding frequency. Our findings thereby suggest two previously unrecognized mechanisms that may contribute to stimulated microbial activity despite decreasing oxygen availability in response to accelerated sea‐level rise.</jats:p>",

This chapter discusses the findings of a collaborative research project conducted through active academic-industry collaboration in South East Asia and shares an approach to identify and incorporate traceability within the supply chain. Critically, it also aims to provide a framework for both academicians and practitioners towards developing a collaborative approach of driving sustainability goals in difficult to measure parts of the supply chain. Importantly, this work also highlights the key aspects of implementing sustainability practices in the upstream palm oil supply chains, which are often ignored. </jats:p>"

Five different water quality and water pollution indices were used including the Water Quality Index (WQI), Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI), Organic Pollution Index (OPI), Eutrophication Index (EI), and Trace Metal Pollution Index (TPI). The combined water pollution indices show more serious pollution towards the river downstream. In particular, CPI and OPI reveal a high risk of eutrophication. Cluster analysis was applied to classify water monitoring points into different quality groups in order to provide a better understanding of the water status in the river. This study indicates that a combined water quality analysis could be an option for decision making water use purposes while its single index shows the current situation of water quality.</jats:p>",

Moreover, a lot of companies ignore the benefits gained from green suppliers on economic performance and marketing. Therefore, this chapter reports a structural equation model with three latent variables (Green attributes of suppliers, Marketing benefits, and Manufacturing processes benefits) and three hypotheses are proposed with relationship among them. The model is validated with information from 253 questionnaires administered to Mexican maquiladoras and evaluated using partial least squares. Findings demonstrate that maquiladoras that consider Green attributes in supplier selection process are gaining marketing and economic benefits, contributing to a green supply chain, and improving the corporate image as socially responsible organizations. </jats:p>"

Thus, nitrogen (N) concentrations and loads have been monitored in soil water, tile drains, and streams within five AMC. Moreover, extensive monitoring of N concentrations and loads in streams draining 46 mini-catchments has been conducted every year since 1989. This has resulted in two national datasets on trends in flow-weighted N concentrations relative to factors such as groundwater age and management history. We analyzed these datasets and found that the intensively monitored micro-catchments generally showed a strong signal with significant downward trends in flow-weighted N concentrations in monitored soil water (−22% to −68%), tile drains (−38% to −59%), and streams (−19% to −53%). The 46 micro-catchments monitored for N in streams also exhibited downward trends in flow-weighted N concentrations, which can mainly be ascribed to the introduction of mandatory national regulation of N in agriculture in Denmark in the mid-1980s. However, classification of the mini-catchments according to the age of the oxidized groundwater revealed significant differences in N trends between the groups of mini-catchments. Thus, the strongest downward trend in flow-weighted N concentrations was as follows: &amp;lt;1 year (−52%), 1–3 years (−44%), and &amp;gt;3 years (−38%).</jats:p>",

The tool is a tube electrode with a line of micro-holes on cylindrical surface. This paper introduces research into the processing of micro-holes in the tube electrode using a rotating helical electrode. The quantitative relationship among the feed rate, the applied voltage, and the diameter of the outlet holes was determined experimentally. A tube electrode with holes of varying diameters was fabricated by adjusting the applied voltage. Using it as a tool electrode, kerfs with a length of 10 mm and an averaged width of 0.903 mm were machined at a feed rate of 6 μm/s in a 30 mm-thick block, and there was no short circuit during processing. It was shown experimentally that using a tube electrode with holes of varying diameters as a tool electrode provides better process capacity for pulsating radial electrolyte supply in WECM.</jats:p>"

The results showed that daily solar conversion efficiency ranged from 65% to 67%. During the tobacco curing period from 10:00 hours to 14:00 hours each day, in sunny or partly cloudy weather, heating water temperatures exceeding 75?C were automatically derived for use in the bulk curing barns needed. Use of solar energy as a substitute for coal fuel in tobacco curing, in conjunction with precise automatic control, enabled solar energy to account for 18.4% of the total curing energy consumption in this study. Through comparative analysis, the use of solar hot-water installations can help the local tobacco industry to reduce absolute carbon emissions by more than 10% at the experimental location in the pay-back period.</jats:p>"

Application programming interface (API) services can be a medium for real-time data sharing and access, and have been used for data collection in the past, but the literature lacks a systematic examination of the potential value of publicly available API data for extracting policy-relevant information, specifically supply and demand, on NMS. The objectives of this study are: 1) to catalogue all the publicly available API data streams for NMS in three major cities known as the Cascadia Corridor (Vancouver, British Columbia; Seattle, Washington; and Portland, Oregon); 2) to create, apply, and share web data extraction tools (Python scripts) for each API; and 3) to assess the usefulness of the extracted data in quantifying supply and demand for each service. Results reveal some measures of supply and demand that can be extracted from API data and be useful in future analysis (mostly for bikeshare and carshare services, not ridesourcing). However, important information on supply and demand of most of the NMS in these cities cannot be obtained through API data extraction. Stronger open data policies for mobility services are therefore needed if policymakers want to obtain useful and independent insights on the usage of these services. </jats:p>",

Different attributes of blockchain technology increase trust through traceability and transparency ability of goods, data and financial resources within any transaction. Regardless of initial uncertainty about this technology, government and many major enterprises and firms have recently examined the adoption and improvement of this technology in several areas of applications, from social, legal and finance industries to manufacturing, design and supply-chain networks. An interesting research problem in this new era is that of determining provenance. At present, goods which are produced and transported using complicated medium supply chains, in this type of supply chain it is impossible to evaluate the provenance of physical goods. We have an interest in the blockchain as there are numerous favored use cases of blockchain especially for provenance tracking. In this paper we review the basics features of the blockchain along with its type like permission less and permissioned blockchain. Then discussed the need of provenance of assets in supplychain as it increase the trust of the customer and proposed a process and architecture for providing the data provenance in supply chain with blockchain using smart contract.</jats:p>"

The promotion of S. salsa growth with high nitrate supply did not enhance the facilitative effect of the species, especially at low salinity. However, high nitrate supply significantly shifted the interspecific interactions of S. planiculmis from facilitation to competition at high salinity. Our results suggest that excessive nitrate application changes the prediction of the stress-gradient hypothesis along a salinity gradient, leading to collapse of the two species coexistence in the salt-marshes. These findings make a contribution to the understanding of how S. salsa and S. planiculmis, as well as salt-marsh communities, respond to the human modification of estuarine nutritional levels.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Since forest management problems may deal with combinatorial optimization, as the scale of a problem increases, the computation complexity increases exponentially beyond the practical use of exact methods. We propose a multiple‐objective metaheuristic method, referred to as multiobjective record‐to‐record travel (MRRT), to solve such challenging problems. We examined the performance of MRRT and compared it to a mixed integer programming (MIP) optimizer on a forest supply chain multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously maximizes net revenues and greenhouse gas emission savings from salvage harvest and utilization of beetle‐killed forest stands. Testing on four cases of different problem sizes showed that MRRT performed satisfactorily in approximating the actual Pareto fronts in terms of convergence and coverage, and the distribution of solutions was approximately uniform. The gap between MRRT and MIP solutions increased as the problem size increased. But MRRT produced all solutions within a reasonable computation time, where the computational advantage over MIP was more apparent for large‐scale test cases.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Recommendations for Resource Managers</jats:bold>\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Multiobjective optimization shows trade‐offs among conflicting objectives and assists decision‐making to enhance sustainable forest management.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Multiobjective record‐to‐record travel (MRRT) has a simple algorithm structure and easy parameterization process so that it is adaptable to solve various multiobjective optimization problems.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>MRRT produces high‐quality solutions for large‐scale multiobjective optimization problems within a reasonable computation time, which promotes its applicability in practice.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>",

In addition to conventionally keeping warranty in‐house, more manufacturers choose to outsource warranty service to agents. This paper explores outsourcing strategies for manufacturer warranty services in a dual‐channel supply chain by which the demand‐enhancing service can be undertaken by different supply chain parties. We show the results of three alternative outsourcing strategies for manufacturers whereby (a) the retailer undertakes the service, (b) a third party undertakes the service, and (c) both the retailer and a third party undertake the service simultaneously. According to Stackelberg game theory, we build a two‐echelon supply chain model and discuss the corresponding expressions for supply chain members' equilibrium decisions. Additionally, we compare the profits of each supply chain member and derive interesting managerial insights. When the base market size is relatively large, Scenario R helps the manufacturer and the retailer reach a “win‐win” situation.</jats:p>",

Methods to assess fuel treatment effects and prioritise their placement are needed to guide risk mitigation efforts. We present a fuel treatment optimisation model to minimise risk to multiple water supplies based on constraints for treatment feasibility and cost. Risk is quantified as the expected sediment impact costs to water supplies by combining measures of fire likelihood and behaviour, erosion, sediment transport and water supply vulnerability. We demonstrate the model's utility for prioritising fuel treatments in two large watersheds in Colorado, USA, that are critical for municipal water supply. Our results indicate that wildfire risk to water supplies can be substantially reduced by treating a small portion of the watersheds that have dense, fire-prone forests on steep slopes that drain to water supply infrastructure. Our results also show that the cost of fuel treatments outweighs the expected cost savings from reduced sediment inputs owing to the low probability of fuel treatments encountering wildfire and the high cost of thinning forests. This highlights the need to expand use of more cost-effective treatments, like prescribed fire, and to identify fuel treatment projects that benefit multiple resources.</jats:p>"

To analyse the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labour Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 20 per cent of the US economy’s GDP, jeopardize 23 per cent of jobs, and reduce total wage income by 16 per cent. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to be output-constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining, and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants, and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply- and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks—we expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, a unique opportunity of innovation of tourism supply emerges, seizing an increasing and plural demand. The chapter intends to explore the potential of dark immersive theatre experiences (DITE) as a tourism product. By doing so, it is suggested that DITE can innovate the tourism supply of the LMA, contributing to the deconcentration and diversification of tourism, on a themed and territorial perspective, as well as to the mitigation of the impacts of over tourism.</jats:p>"

By coupling projections from four general circulation models (GCMs) with a state-of-the-art US electricity system model—the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS)—this study evaluates both the isolated and combined effects of different climate-mediated drivers of US electricity system change through 2050. Comparing results across climate models allows us to evaluate which effects are robust to uncertainty in projected climate outcomes. Comparing effects of different drivers in isolation and in combination allows us to determine the relative contributions of the climate-mediated effects on system evolution. Our results indicate that national-level energy and economic impacts are largely driven by increases in electricity demand that follow from a consistent increase in surface air temperature that is largely robust to the choice of climate model. Other electricity system changes can be equally or more significant in some regions, but these effects are more regionally variable, less significant when aggregated to the national scale, and less robust to the choice of climate model. The findings show that the impacts of climate change on the electricity system can be understood in terms of fewer drivers and with greater certainty at the national level than at the regional level.</jats:p>",

A model of national gas infrastructure creation in Mongolia is proposed. The model is linked with the model of the regional Northeast Asian gas market and the financial models of gas infrastructure facilities. The model determines the optimal design of the national gas infrastructure system, i.e. the number of the facilities, their capacities, locations and the transport modes for connecting the consumption centres. The role of autonomous consumers is considered by introducing the demand for liquefied natural gas separately from the demand for pipeline gas. The scope of the model application is demonstrated by an illustrative example. The results show the rational natural gas import and distribution patterns. The need for expanding the energy cooperation between Mongolia and the other Northeast Asian countries to create gas industry in Mongolia is highlighted.</jats:p>"

This study builds a theoretical model among GEO, green incremental innovation, and green radical innovation, and uses empirical data from 416 enterprises in China for testing. The results show that corporate GEO has a positive impact on green incremental innovation and radical innovation. Supply chain learning has a significant positive effect on green incremental and radical innovation. In addition, corporate supply chain learning plays a mediating role in the relationship between GEO and green radical innovation, as well as plays a mediating role in the relationship between GEO and green incremental innovation. This study has an important contribution to enrich the theory of entrepreneurial orientation, green innovation, and supply chain learning, and is of great significance for managers to understand how to use GEO in the process of green innovation development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The important role of vitamins for bodily functions was described for the first time by Russian pediatrician N.I. Lunin as early as in 1880. Since then, doctors, biologists, researchers, and other experts have focused on the effects of vitamins on human body and their role in various processes. In 2017, the Union of Pediatricians of Russia has developed “National program of the optimization of vitamin and mineral supply of Russian children” based on the monitoring of child nutrition. Treatment of multivitamin deficiency involves additional intake of missing substances as well as the improvement of their absorption and their synthesis in human body. The vast majority of vitamin and mineral supplements contain daily-recommended amounts of essential vitamins and microelements. However, not all substances are completely absorbed since patients with multivitamin deficiency often have gut microbiome abnormalities resulting in poor availability of supplemented vitamins and minerals. This paper discusses the rationale of additional vitamins, their role in bodily functions, and signs of vitamin deficiency.

The financial differences and political barriers in both cities, together with the vast diversity factors, development patterns, and challenges of each study area show that reconsidering different approaches is significant in developing more inclusive paradigms in water provision in informal areas. Relevant to these concerns, this study aims to clarify water practices and explore inclusive ways of developing water supply management through the analyses of water provision modes and network systems in each study area. A series of field studies on the type of water sources and facilities, parties involved in water practices, and characteristics of water development was performed in six case studies (i.e., three in Mumbai and three in Nairobi) from 2014 to 2019. The main findings of this study show that an unconventional informal tenure system constrains the settlement typology and development of the physical access of service facilities in study areas. Moreover, the different measures taken by Mumbai and Nairobi in providing water supply to informal areas result in an unequal path for water development and various vulnerability levels. Therefore, we argue that the mixtures of policy- and practice-rooted practices ensure a more inclusive water development because they would lead to the sociotechnical arrangements of the technical system and institutional arrangements that better fit the local conditions characterized by different spatial structures and social variables.</jats:p>"

Behavioural factors in green supply chains are still a critical challenge—not yet a well‐explored academic subject—when the focus is on the mining industry of emerging economies like India; the lack of studies in this field could be a factor preventing the Indian mining industry becoming more green. In terms of methodology, original survey data were processed through AMOS 4.0, adopted for assessing the causal connection among the six constructs, that is, top management support, teamwork, workplace culture, resistance to change, green innovation, and green motivation. We further explore the input from the human side of GCSM by highlighting that top management support and green motivation are the most crucial behavioural factors that influence GCSM in the Indian mining sector. The study will be helpful for mining companies because it will enable them to identify the areas that require their attention for enhancing GCSM performance related to behavioural aspects.</jats:p>",

Satellite remote sensing has also benefited from technical improvements, including better spectral and spatial resolution of sensors, which have facilitated the detection and discovery of unknown archaeological areas. This paper focuses on investigations conducted using multi-spectral satellite remote-sensing data of the ancient canal systems of the Wadi el Melah Valley (WMV) in southern Tunisia. The area used to be part of a huge military defense system along the desert border. This paper describes the use of GeoEye-1 and Ziyuan-3 satellite remote-sensing data to reveal ancient Roman canals, which were part of an advanced hydraulic system devised to capture runoff water and cope with the lack of water in the area. In general, this research provides new information on some essential sections of the Roman walled defense system Limes (Fossatum) in the southern part of the empire, where we study previously undetected sites.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and Aim: The problem of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in both humans and animals is an important public health concern globally, which is likely to increase, including in Thailand, where carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), such as Escherichia coli, are of particular concern. They are pathogens found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals as well as in the environment. They may cause opportunistic infection and are often resistant to antibiotics in various fields especially in animal husbandry, such as pets or livestock farms. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant E. coli from water samples of smallholder dairy farms in Saraburi and Maha Sarakham, Thailand.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Sixty-four water samples were collected from 32 dairy farms in Kaeng Khoi district, Muak Lek district, and Wang Muang district of Saraburi Province, and Kantharawichai district and Mueang district of Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand. All samples were cultured and isolated for E. coli by biochemical tests. All E. coli isolates were tested for drug susceptibility using imipenem, meropenem, and drug resistance genes of carbapenemases such as blaNDM, blaIMP, and blaOXA48 of drug-resistant E. coli isolates detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.\n\nResults: A total of 182 E. coli isolates were found (140 and 42 isolates from Saraburi and Maha Sarakham, respectively). Drug sensitivity tests found that two isolates of E. coli from water in Kaeng Khoi were resistant to imipenem; therefore, the incidence of E. coli resistance to carbapenem was 1.43% of Saraburi Province. On the other hand, there was no incidence of drug-resistant E. coli in Maha Sarakham. In addition, the detection of the drug-resistant gene of E. coli in both isolates by PCR showed the expression of blaNDM.\n\nConclusion: This study reports E. coli resistance to antimicrobial drugs on livestock farms. It can be considered to be the first report of E. coli CRE detection in a dairy farm at Saraburi, which should be the subject of further extended study.</jats:p>"

The work was conducted using electronic modelling, calculation methods of hydraulic parameters and numerical modelling, as well as optimization of technical solutions for adjustment of operation modes, minimization of water leakage, pressure stabilization in the network, elimination of blockages and failures of regulating and stop valves. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by the example of the city of Nizhneudinsk. As a result of the conducted research, information and computing systems and complexes were developed for simulating different modes of operation, assessing the performance, reliability and regime controllability of water supply and wastewater disposal systems, storing, analysing and accumulating information on the state of the system under analysis and its individual parameters. Such an approach served as a basis for developing a prospective scheme of development and reconstruction of the city water supply and sewage systems and provided an automated control system of its technological processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, we are witnessing active development of urban building construction, which dictates new requirements for the infrastructure of water supply and sanitation. These requirements are aimed at improving the reliability and compliance with stringent environmental standards. Dispatch supervision and control of water supply networks are among the key tasks that have to be solved under such conditions. The problem of implementing such systems lies in difficulty of setting up power supply to the equipment used in these systems. The power supply of such systems is as a rule provided by using storage batteries, which entails the need for periodic maintenance of these systems and thereby increases the cost of their operation. The problem can be solved by using an autonomous source of electricity. The energy of the water flow in the pipeline is proposed to be used as such source.  The possibility of setting up an autonomous dispatch control system for housing and utility services based on a hydrogenerator is estimated. The study is carried out by analyzing the hydraulic parameters of a bypass pipeline installed on a large-diameter pipeline. To determine the flow velocity and pressure in the bypass pipeline, the fluid flow is modeled in it. The modeling results and their subsequent analysis made it possible to calculate the range of power produced by the hydrogenerator and estimate the possibility of setting up an autonomous dispatch control system.</jats:p>"

The proposed model is used to study the influence of various parameters of the power supply system on resonant modes, including the length of lines, the short-circuit power of the external power supply system, and the spectral composition of locomotive currents. It is shown that the study of resonant modes should consider the traction power supply system and the external network as a single system.

Different PFS that provide compensation for voltage distortions in both the traction and external network have been proposed.

The research aimed to find out the supply chain management of fish in the Natuna Island border area to meet local, regional and export needs. The research used a qualitative approach and snowball information. The result showed that market formation was based on the type and quality of fish caught. Production of local fishermen was sold to the Natuna market, regional markets (Pontianak and Tanjung Pinang), and export market to Singapore, Mainland China, Hongkong, and Malaysia. Type of fish with premium quality (grouper, red snapper) was exported and sold to restaurants, with oligopolistic market characteristics. The premium quality fish market share was controlled by a large trader (Tauke) who has links to islands far Natuna (Pulau Laut, Pulau Tiga, Midai and Serasan). Non-premium quality fish marketing was carried out by fishing boat owners or collectors for local consumption and regional markets.</jats:p>"

Total serum protein decreased significantly from baseline (66.5 (56.4–73.3) mg/mL) by almost half intraoperatively (42.7 (36.8–51.5) mg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001) and remained at low level. While ANG-1 showed no significant dilutional change (baseline: 12.7 (11.9–13.9) ng/mL, postop.: 11.6 (10.8 –13.5) ng/mL, p = 0.06), serum levels of ANG-2 were even increased postoperatively (baseline: 2.2 (1.6–2.6) ng/mL vs. postop.: 3.4 (2.3–3.8) ng/mL, p &lt; 0.0001), resulting in a significant shift in ANG-2 to ANG-1 ratio.

Data were collected from 16 experts and analysed by an integrated approach of “interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and analytic network process (ANP).” ISM methodology was utilized to get a hierarchical relationship between all criteria. Further, the input to the ANP matrices was taken from the output of ISM, and three organizations that differ in their principle of operation were ranked to find out the extent of implementation of SSCP in the Indian context. The obtained results indicate that “Information technology‐enabled system support (ITS), SC member's awareness and literacy (SAL), Societal issues (SIS), and Scarcity of natural resources (SNR)” were most significant constructs for successful implementation of SSCP for the case organizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of supply chain coordination implies that it is possible to obtain an optimal result for both independent chain participants and supply chain due to participants’ coordinated actions. This paper examines the question whether a buyback contract will be coordinating or not. The authors argue that a coordinating buyback contract should have the following substantive properties: practical feasibility, collective and individual rationality. The paper off ers a mathematical defi nition of a coordinating buyback contract which highlights these properties. Entering into buyback contract process is considered as a two-step game of two players (a supplier and retailer) on the assumption that the players are risk neutral and make decisions with full information available, the market price is fixed, and the product demand is a random variable. The authors demonstrate that the buyback contract does not coordinate the chain, however, there has been obtained a non-empty set of eff ective contracts depending on the buyback price. For such contracts, the defi nition of “conditional coordination” is given to introduce the property of a supplier’s partial rationality; its existence was proved. The findings reveal that the choice of buyback price affects the allocation of profits between chain participants so the decision on its choice must be cooperative. To substantiate the nature of cooperative choice of conditionally coordinating contracts, the asymmetric Nash solution is considered. All results were obtained both in general terms and under the assumption that the product demand has uniform distribution. For the latter case, the conditionally coordinating contract parameters were found and it was justified that the conclusion of such a contract is possible only when a supplier has greater bargain power than a retailer.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we investigate price and order strategies for innovative green products using demand forecasting and sharing. We formulate the problem using a Stackelberg game and propose a dynamic contract that specifies an initial wholesale price, a minimum order quantity, a demand sharing agreement, and a decisions adjustment agreement. We arrived at the following main findings and implications. First, the manufacturer offers a higher or lower wholesale price than the initial one depending on the variation in the market status. Also, the retailer’s ordering decisions will increase with the wholesale price, which contradicts the common assumption that ordering decisions decrease with the wholesale price. Interestingly, if the market improves, the manufacturer obtains a higher profit margin than the retailer; if the market worsens, the manufacturer suffers more loss of profit margin than the retailer. Second, when the cost of information sharing is smaller than an upper bound, demand forecasting and sharing are always beneficial to the manufacturer. However, the value of demand forecasting and sharing for the retailer is significantly affected by the market status variation. Third, high information accuracy will not necessarily increase the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, even if the market status is better than expected. Finally, numerical examples show the parameters’ effects. We have several main managerial insights. When the shared demand information is received from the retailer, the manufacturer can determine wholesale price strategies according to the retailer’s demand forecast. Moreover, if the manufacturer wants to ensure profitability, they should not choose retailers with a higher capability of demand forecasting.</jats:p>"

This study estimates a demand system, including 15 major food items in Vietnam, with multiyear household survey data. We find a large variation in the estimated price elasticities (–0.05 to –0.88) and expenditure elasticities (–0.16 to 2.56). Food types, urban status and income groups can explain this variation. We also find that the staple food, rice, is already an inferior good for rich urban households in Vietnam. Moreover, food preferences are evolving away from rice but towards animal proteins (fish, pork, chicken, eggs and milk), fruits and vegetables, irrespective of urban status and income groups. As the Vietnam economy continues to grow with a doubling of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next decade, per capita rice consumption in both urban and rural areas and across different income groups will continue to decline, whereas demand for other high‐value products will rise. Thus, government policy should focus on encouraging demand‐oriented food production. In addition, crop diversification at the farm level needs to improve substantially to meet the rising demand for these food products due to income growth and urbanisation.</jats:p>",

This positive point, on one side, had its negative aspect on the other side, as it affected national tourism, excluding all residents on the Portuguese mainland and/or Madeira from having access to these fares.

A revenue-sharing contract with bank financing and a modified revenue-sharing contract with trade credit financing are explored. It is stated that none of the studied contracts is coordinating, as they do not provide the supplier’s expected profit maximum. The conditional coordination of supply chain with a modified revenue-sharing contract with trade credit financing is considered if the supply chain and the retailer’s expected profit maximum are reached and the supplier’s expected profit is greater than in case of application of a modified wholesale price contract with trade credit financing and a revenue-sharing contract with bank financing.

It is clearly shown that the possibility of electric power-supply of such consumers without using the common high-voltage line-section power-supply lines of alternative voltage of 6 or 10 kV and respective power-supply substations can be implemented in practice. The essence of the proposed is that the electric power-supply source is not a high-voltage power-supply line, but a device which converts potential mechanical energy of a train, moving along a line section between signal points of railway automatic block system, into electrical one. Putting the described power-supply devices into operation provides technical as well as economic advantages over currently and widely used power-supply systems. The conversion of energy is carried out by changing magnetic resistance of a magnetic circuit, which includes railway car wheel-set in motion and direct neodymium magnet. Change in magnetic resistance due to the law of electromagnetic induction results in alternate voltage in the inductance coil, which is used as the electric power-supply source for non-traction line-section power consumers, including but not limited to, signal point of railway automatic block system. In case there is no wheel-set on the converter, electric power-supply for the power consumer is delivered by the electric energy accumulated in an ionistor (supercapacitor).</jats:p>"

The approach suggests introducing an arc coefficient, which allows for changes in the magnitude of gas flow passing along the arc, a vector of an increase in the arc throughput, and lower constraints on the gas flow along the arc. We also propose considering a new economic environment, namely, new criteria for optimizing the flow distribution and setting fictitious gas prices for consumers. These criteria enable us to take account of the priority gas supply to a definite group of consumers. As an example, the calculation of gas flows for the aggregated Unified Gas Supply System (UGSS) for 2030 is considered. This calculation takes into account the arc coefficients and the increase in the throughput of arcs.</jats:p>"

The traditional approach in the management of the quality drinking water, and relying on end-product testing, has proven ineffective in protecting public health. Therefore, the transition to a systematic approach in drinking water supply systems management from the source to the consumer tap was taken as a water safety plan (WSP). <jats:italic>Objective</jats:italic>. The study aims to investigate the health-related hazardous events in order to decide on the best risk-reduction strategies in the supply of drinking water in the Gaza strip. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. A semiquantitative matrix method for risk assessment was applied. Also, chlorine residual, electrical conductivity, and nitrate concentration further tested in 109 water wells, 109 small-scale water desalination plants, 197 tanker trucks, and 384 households distributed over five governorates of the Gaza strip. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. The mean of the measured chlorine residual values was less than the recommended national and international limits (0.2–1 mg/liter). The mean of electrical conductivity at catchment points and household municipal water taps was 2165.1 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>S·cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 2000 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>S·cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. Furthermore, zero percent of water samples met the recommended criteria, indicating that the groundwater in the Gaza strip is nonpotable. Only 12.8% and 8.8% of water samples met the permissible levels at catchment areas and municipal water at household, respectively, indicating sever health impacts on the public. Moreover, the most hazardous events were related to high levels of groundwater salinity, the low level of disinfection, the effect of electricity outages on the efficiency of the desalination process, and leakage of water from the tanker truck tank reservoirs. Therefore, urgent interventions are required to improve the quality of water and to mitigate the possible health effects. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. The prioritization of hazardous events that are proportional to the degree of their attributed risk could help guide in making the right risk-reduction decisions. Urgent interventions are required to improve the quality of water and to mitigate the possible health effects.</jats:p>",

In order to improve the energy efficiency of the EHSS for the rolling shear while also ensuring the position tracking accuracy, the separate metering electro-hydraulic servo system with varying supply pressure (VSP-SMEHSS) is proposed in this work. The inlet valve controls the position of a hydraulic cylinder, while the outlet valve controls the back pressure of the hydraulic cylinder. However, due to the disturbance caused by the varying supply pressure, the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller or active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) cannot meet the requirements of accuracy. In order to solve this problem, based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) and a tracking differentiator (TD), a dynamic surface control (DSC) is proposed in this work. Firstly, the stability of the controller is validated using the Lyapunov method. Then, experiments are conducted to verify the proposed control strategy. As a result, the hydraulic cylinder can accurately track the reference displacement signal and effectively reduce the pressure drop at the valve’s orifice, due to which the hydraulic system achieves significant energy-savings. Compared with that of the EHSS, the energy consumption of the VSP-SMEHSS is reduced by 44.6%.</jats:p>"

Through a field research in Ciudad Juarez and making use of an instrument about 3PL, authors considered four variables: transport, transport management, information technologies, and warehouse. To find the causal model with the relationships between the variables, authors used structural equations modelling. That also identified the relevant aspects in 3PL providers companies' manufacturing and collaboration activities realized in the practice. The results indicate that mainly the information technologies and the transport management have a greater influence on the performance of the logistics process in this type of company.</jats:p>"

Bed elevations and surface imagery at high spatial resolutions were used to quantify the co‐evolution of surface grain‐size distribution (GSD), bed roughness statistics, and bed surface structures (clusters, cells and transverse features). Using a new semi‐automated method, we identified individual stone structures over a 2 m × 1 m area throughout the experiments. After an initial coarsening, surface GSD and armouring ratio remained nearly stable as sediment pulses caused net bed aggradation. In contrast, individual grain structures continued to form, increase or decrease in size, and disappear throughout the experiments. The response of the bed to sediment pulses depended on the history of surface roughness evolution and bed surface structure development, as these factors changed much more in response to supply perturbations earlier in the experiments compared to later, even as the bed continued to aggrade. We interpret that the dynamic production and destruction of bed surface structures can act as a ‘buffer’ to sediment supply pulses, maintaining a stable bed surface during aggradation with minimal change in grain size or armouring. © 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Following cell division, fruit growth is characterized by both expansion through increases in cell volume and biomass accumulation in cells. Fruit growth is limited by carbon starvation; however, the mechanism controlling fruit growth under restricted carbohydrate supply is poorly understood. In a previous study using red-fleshed kiwifruit, we showed that long-term carbon starvation had detrimental effects on carbohydrate, anthocyanin metabolism, and fruit growth. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reduction in fruit growth during kiwifruit development, we integrated phytohormone profiling with transcriptomic and developmental datasets for fruit under high or low carbohydrate supplies. Phytohormone profiling of the outer pericarp tissue of kiwifruit showed a 6-fold reduction in total cytokinin concentrations in carbon-starved fruit, whilst other hormones were less affected. Principal component analysis visualised that cytokinin composition was distinct between fruit at 16 weeks after mid bloom, based on their carbohydrate supply status. Cytokinin biosynthetic genes (IPT, CYP735A) were significantly downregulated under carbon starvation, in agreement with the metabolite data. Several genes that code for expansins, proteins involved in cell wall loosening, were also downregulated under carbon starvation. In contrast to other fleshy fruits, our results suggest that cytokinins not only promote cell division, but also drive fruit cell expansion and growth in kiwifruit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is a burning issue for modern industrial enterprises. To handle this issue, non-linear stochastic models are successfully applied to find the reasonable and efficient solutions. A need to develop a unique method to find the solutions to supply chain management tasks defined as stochastic mixed-integer non-linear programming tasks is determined by the limitations imposed by the general models. The sum of the total raw procurement costs from the Commodity Exchange over the defined planning horizon is taken to be the target function of the unique model, while the binary variables which show whether a purchasing order is included into the procurement plan are used for optimization purposes. Some parameters of model’s limitations are stochastic and consider the uncertainty factor and risks in supplying the required raw materials to the manufacturing site. Branch-and-bound and genetic algorithms are applied at some steps in the developed heuristic algorithm. The algorithm and the model are tested at a major timber processing enterprise in Primorsky Area. Four types of processors over three planning horizons were applied to compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with partial application of the genetic algorithm or branch-and-bound method. The findings analysis shows that, unlike the genetic algorithm, the unique one is more stable in terms of uncertainty of the input parameters in comparison with the branch-and-bound method. It provides the solutions in the models with a great number of variables. The algorithm is shown to be universal enough for its further modification in solving more complicated problems of the same class, containing a significantly larger number of probabilistic parameters that describe other uncertainties in the supply of raw materials. Further research is seen to include the development of the proposed algorithm to increase the rate of convergence for its better efficiency.</jats:p>"

All the isolates were characterized by a polymerase chain reaction to determine the phylogenetic group (A, B1, B2, or D) and virulence gene profiles with APEC marker genes (iutA, hlyF, iss, iroN, and ompT).\n\nResults: Phylogenetic grouping revealed that the isolates belong to A group (34.48%), D group (34.48%), B1 group (17.24%), and B2 group (13.79%). The virulence gene prevalence was as follows: iutA (36%), hlyF (21%), ompT (21%), iroN (10%), and iss (9%). The B2 group presented with more virulence genes combinations. iroN, hlyF, and ompT genes were positively associated with the B2 group (p≤0.05).\n\nConclusion: Our results highlight the role of colistin-resistant E. coli originated from the broiler meat supply chain as a potential reservoir for human ExPEC virulence genes.</jats:p>"

A novel EPS with hybrid power supply (HP-EPS) is constructed in this paper, and a new optimized rule-based energy management strategy of hybrid power supply system is designed. The strategy determines the power distribution of the vehicle power supply (VPS) and super capacitor (SC), as well as the charging or discharging of SC. Furthermore, to minimize the output current fluctuation of the VPS, the optimization model of parameters in the strategy is established and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the rules in the energy management strategy. The verification for the designed energy management strategy is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and results show that the output current peak of VPS decreases by 33% and its fluctuation depresses significantly. In addition, the SC is charged timely and fast, which is beneficial to guarantee enough state of charge (SOC) of SC. In conclusion, the optimized rule-based energy management strategy used for the HP-EPS system can meet the current requirement of EPS and effectively reduce the peak and fluctuation of the VPS output current.</jats:p>"

A key question is whether this asymptote reflects a physiological constraint, or a maternal investment strategy (a ‘restraint’). We exposed lactating mice to periods of food restriction, hypothesizing that if the limit reflected restraint they would compensate by breaching the asymptote when refeeding. In contrast, if it was a constraint they would by definition be unable to increase their intake on refeeding days. Using isotope methods we found that during food restriction the females shut down milk production impacting offspring growth. During refeeding food intake and milk production rose again, but not significantly above unrestricted controls. Hypothalamic transcriptome profiling showed that following restriction lactating mice did not upregulate transcription of genes in the hunger signaling network, suggesting this may impose the constraint. These data provide strong evidence that asymptotic intake in lactation reflects a physiological/physical constraint, rather than restraint. Because hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (Npy) was upregulated under both states of restriction this suggests the constraint is not imposed by limits in the capacity to upregulate hunger signaling (the saturated neural capacity hypothesis). Understanding the genetic basis of the constraint will be a key future goal and will provide us additional information on the nature of the constraining factors on reproductive output, and their potential links to life history strategies.</jats:p>"

La ville de Paris a confié en 2009 la gestion de son réseau d’eau non potable (RENP) à l’entreprise publique Eau de Paris. Ce réseau, qui s’étend sur 1800 km, sert principalement pour le nettoyage des trottoirs, le curage des égouts, l’alimentation des lacs et l’arrosage des espaces verts, les volumes utilisés s’élevaient en 2014 à environ 200000 m3/j ou 20 L/j/m². Le RENP est alimenté aujourd’hui en moyenne à 80% par les eaux du canal d’Ourcq et 20 % par la Seine. Pour diminuer la pression sur ses ressources et optimiser la gestion de l’eau à Paris, le RENP pourrait être alimenté dans le futur avec d’autres ressources telles que l’eau de pluie, les rejets des piscines ou les eaux d’exhaure. Les eaux d’exhaure sont des eaux claires d’infiltration, évacuées pour garantir l’exploitation des infrastructures souterraines comme le métro et les parkings souterrains. Leur volume actuellement produit pourrait permettre de couvrir jusqu’à 12 % des besoins du RENP. Cependant, leurs teneurs en sulfate autour de 700 mg/L, la conductivité élevée de 1900 μS/cm et la variation de qualité d’un gisement à l’autre posent de nombreux défis aussi bien techniques, qu’organisationnels et institutionnels.

Consequently, there is limited research of their integrated effects on water supply systems, and even fewer studies that rigorously account for infrastructure investment and management interventions. We utilize ecohydrologic modeling to generate watershed outflows under scenarios of climate and land cover change, which in turn drive modeled water utility‐level decision making for the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. In the Triangle region, land cover and climate change are both likely to increase water supply availability (reservoir inflows) individually and in tandem. However, improvements from water supply increases are not uniform across management system performance indicators of reliability, conservation implementation frequency (i.e., water use restrictions), and infrastructure investment. Utility decisions influence the impact of hydrologic change through both short‐term (e.g., use restrictions and water transfers) and longer‐term infrastructure investment actions, in some cases offsetting the beneficial effects of additional water supply. Timing and sequencing of infrastructure development are strongly sensitive to climate and land use change as captured by their impacts on utility performance outcomes. This work underscores the need to consider adaptive management system responses and decision‐relevant performance measures when determining the impacts of hydrologic change on water availability.</jats:p>",

Besides, they may also supply disruption risk, under which a supplier could fail to deliver the quantity ordered at all. In this study, we discuss how to mitigate supply disruption and recall risks in the perspective of ( outbound) product distribution strategy in joint with ( inbound) sourcing decision. Specifically, we compare the dedicated and uniform distribution strategies as follows: in the dedicated strategy, the firm divides its market into several regions, and ships products from different suppliers based on the regions; whereas, in the uniform strategy, the firm serves the entire market by randomly shipping the products from several suppliers without distinguishing their sources. Through the comparison of both strategies, we show that the role of recall risk is different from that of supply disruption on the sourcing and distribution decision. In particular, single sourcing is optimal when both recall risk and disruption probability are low; dual sourcing with the dedicated strategy is optimal when the disruption probability is moderate and the recall risk is high; dual sourcing with the uniform strategy is optimal when the disruption probability is high. We also find that the positive correlation in recalls improves (undermines) the performance of the uniform (dedicated) strategy. In contrast, the positive correlation in supply disruptions only undermines the performance of the uniform strategy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the supply chains is broadly used to leverage the internationalisation of operations of the companies. SMEs in the Western Balkans make up for a vast majority of the companies and tend to be better integrated into the EU and global market. The supply chains enable SMEs to raise their innovativeness and performance. However, large corporations also find mutual benefits in the integration of SMEs into their supply chains. Large supply chains have recently introduced a new approach towards the inclusion of SMEs as a part of their CSR and sustainability strategy. In this paper, we observe the state of play in accessing the supply chains in three non-EU Western Balkan countries, namely Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as in Croatia as the only EU member state from the observed region. It seems that, regardless of the current status of the EU accession process, the observed SMEs are facing the same challenges in accessing the supply chains. Therefore, our research has two goals: 1) to determine whether and in what way the perception of the importance of different barriers affects inclusion in the supply chains, and 2) to determine whether the different-sized companies perceive differently the importance of individual barriers to inclusion in the supply chains. The results have shown that there are no significant differences in the perception of the importance of barriers to inclusion in the supply chains between companies of different sizes. Also, the length of receivables collection period and inadequate and incomplete information on the requirements for participation negatively affect the inclusion of SMEs in the supply chains.</jats:p>"

These processes are strongly threatening biodiversity maintenance and the ecosystem services provided by them. Among the ecosystem services under threat, pollination has been widely studied since this service is essential to promote food production and, therefore, human well-being. In a scenario of increasing LULCC it is crucial to understand the interplay between these changes, pollination demand by insect-dependent crops and pollinator availability to ensure these ecosystem services meet the increased demand for food production. In this study, we developed a conceptual model to disentangle the relationships between human-nature, especially LULCC, and its consequences, to the delivery of pollination service. We also presented a case study in the Brazilian São Paulo state, where we modeled the effects of predicted LULCC associated to agriculture expansion between the years 2012 and 2030 on pollinator demand by crops and pollinator supply, for fourteen economically important crops. Additionally, we systematized an expert-based Ecosystem Service matrix to estimate the influences of LULCC on the provision of pollination. Our results showed that by 2030, the demand for pollination will increase by 40% on average, while pollinator supply, estimated using suitability values for the different land-use/cover classes, will show, on average, a 3% decrease. Our results highlight the importance of considering the dialogue among stakeholders, governments, institutions, and scientists to find alternatives and strategies to promote pollinator-friendly practices and safeguard the provision of pollination services in a future under LULCC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using LED technologies to create a comfortable light environment for human life and work can help reduce electricity consumption while maintaining, and usually improving, the energy and spectral parameters of lighting systems. At the same time, LED lighting systems for residential and industrial buildings are usually powered by electricity generated mainly by thermal power plants. Such plants mostly use fossil fuels and their combustion leads to environmental pollution. The article proposes the concept of a lighting system, which allows improving the ecology by reducing the energy consumption of lighting systems through the use of renewable energy sources. The proposed operation algorithm of the system for power supply control of LED light sources allows selecting the most appropriate energy sources in real time, thus making it possible to increase the luminous efficiency of the lamp by at least 20% when using industrial element base. This design can help to move away from traditional energy storage systems (batteries), which significantly increases the service life of such systems, their reliability and environmental safety. Placing photovoltaic converters in close proximity to the consumer (on the roofs and facades of buildings) ensures a decrease in ohmic losses and creates favorable conditions for using solar energy to light residential and industrial premises with LED lamps, which can significantly increase the economic and energy efficiency of such systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, support vector machines, a supervised learning algorithm, have been widely used in the scope of credit risk management. However, noise may increase the complexity of the algorithm building and destroy the performance of classifier. In our work, we propose an ensemble support vector machine model to solve the risk assessment of supply chain finance, combined with reducing noises method. The main characteristics of this approach include that (1) a novel noise filtering scheme that avoids the noisy examples based on fuzzy clustering and principal component analysis algorithm is proposed to remove both attribute noise and class noise to achieve an optimal clean set, and (2) support vector machine classifiers, based on the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, are seen as component classifiers. Then, we obtained the final classification results by combining finally individual prediction through AdaBoosting algorithm on the new sample set. Some experiments are applied on supply chain financial analysis of China’s listed companies. Results indicate that the credit assessment accuracy can be increased by applying this approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy sector is moving towards renewable energy generation. Renewable energy generation is the key technology for a smart grid operation. These renewable producers’ electricity generation capacity varies significantly with change in weather conditions and causes system unreliability. To improve acceptability of this intermittency either renewable generation should be such that it meets the load demand round the corner or there should be a successful coordination between renewable power generation and the grid, so that consumer gets a reliable and cost efficient power. This paper presents a computer-based model of a multi-agent Smart Grid Controller (SGC). The design objective is to provide reliable and cost optimized electricity to the consumers. The Smart Grid Controller continuously monitors the power availability and demand on hourly basis and switches between price-based demand fulfilment and priority-based demand fulfilment algorithm accordingly. Two case studies – Renewable with Grid Power (RwGP) and Renewable without Grid Power (RwoGP) are taken into consideration. The design is validated on the data of a township. The impact of normal and extreme weather conditions on renewable producer agent’s operating capacity is simulated. System’s performance is analysed on daily and monthly data. Results show that the model not only is reliable but also provides cost optimized solution to consumers as compared to only Grid supplied system.</jats:p>"

They are not only suppliers (educational institutions) and consumers (employers), but also “designers” of institutions (legislators, regulators, and professional communities), labor market service structures, academic science, mass media. The authors aim to prepare a methodology for designing a self-regulating human resource supply system in oil and gas companies in the context of the formation of Industry 4.0. The authors used the following methods: analysis of scientific literature, analysis of Internet sources and materials provided by subjects of human resource supply activities, namely labor market monitoring, analytical reports of the Council for Professional Qualifications in the Oil and Gas Complex, reports on the sustainable development of companies, etc. The study result is the development of a theoretical and methodological approach to designing institutional relationships between the subjects of the oil and gas complex human resource supply system. The research materials may be of further use by federal and regional executive bodies that carry out the functions of developing and implementing state policy in the field of education and qualifications assessment.</jats:p>"

In this research, the authors have analyzed the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has made on business relationships between supply chain partners in the automotive industry and their suppliers, which are mostly from territories where the initial outbreak of the SARS COV 2 virus occurred. The analysis shows that in some cases, there is a strong dependency between the pandemic and production levels. Being dependent prevents supply chains from maintaining stability and causes system vulnerabilities. The authors conclude their work with a thesis on the pronounced impact of the current pandemic on automotive supply chain activities. For the analysis to be complete, it is necessary to monitor changes in production levels further, since data for the current year still does not provide a realistic insight into all the consequences at the supply chain level.</jats:p>"

The scientific and practical significance of the study consists in the fact that based on the results of a comparative analysis of the activities of a medical institution on the basis of various indicators, scientifically grounded proposals have been developed to improve the form of organizing the analysis of consultative and diagnostic medical care and proposals for improving the medical service. It has been substantiated that it is necessary to strictly implement all measures for working with financial and non-financial assets in accordance with the regulatory and legislative acts, for which the article presents the systematization of these measures and compiled a standard operating procedure.</jats:p>"

The analysis focused mainly on the evaluation of power supply reliability and power quality in the factory premises and at the distribution substation and thereby proposing recommendations to the supply authority and factory for better improvement. The methodologies followed for the investigation and analysis are direct measurement at the substation supply transformers and by using data gathered from the substation and factory loads. This particular analysis work indicated that the fifth and seventh spectral harmonic components have a major effect in the supply system of the factory with 25% and 20% harmonic distortion level respectively. The factory has been working with poor power factor of 0.75 which is below the minimum threshold standard of 0.85 which is set by the Ethiopian Electric Utility (EEU). Finally, MATLAB/SIMULINK model of shunt harmonic filters were designed. By this, the fifth and seventh harmonic components are reduced to less than 5% and average power factor upgraded to 0.93.</jats:p>"

In 2016 and 2017, a field experiment was conducted after plastic mulched maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) in northwestern China to assess how tillage, irrigation, and nitrogen levels affect soil evaporation (E), evapotranspiration (ET), grain yield (GY), and WUE of wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.). This study evaluated all combinations of two tillage practices (NT, no‐tillage with previous plastic mulching; CT, conventional tillage), two irrigation levels (high: local conventional irrigation amount, 240 mm; and low: local conventional irrigation amount reduced by 20%, 192 mm), and three nitrogen levels (high: local conventional nitrogen amount, 225 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; medium: local conventional nitrogen amount reduced by 20%, 180 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; and low: local conventional nitrogen amount reduced by 40%, 135 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Across the study years, NT reduced E and E/ET and increased GY and WUE at all irrigation and nitrogen levels compared with CT. No‐tillage with low irrigation and medium nitrogen reduced E, ET, and E/ET by 29%, 4%, and 26%, respectively, and improved GY and WUE by 19% and 24%, respectively, compared with CT with high supplies of irrigation and nitrogen. We concluded that NT into plastic mulched maize with a reduction in irrigation and a moderate level of nitrogen can improve WUE of wheat in arid regions, thereby enhancing the sustainability of cereal production.</jats:p>",

Technology includes checking the permissibility of states, calculating the throttling devices on the network and inputs of consumers’ buildings. It allows calculating large systems with intermediate stages of regulation, developing adjustment measures to improve the quality of heat supply and consumer provision, reducing circulation flow rates and pressure in networks. The development of modeling methods is carried out in the following directions: taking into account the new composition of equipment, including mixing pumping stations; development of nontraditional methods of calculation, such as object-oriented modeling; development of tasks of hierarchical optimization and identification of state parameters, as task of rising for model adequacy; development of task for finding of sectioning variants for multi-circuit heat network with several sources.

A gravity-driven free-end membrane (E-GDM) system was developed to mitigate the deposition of cake on the membrane more effectively than other commercialized GDM systems. The E-GDM system was manually operated with permeability of 12.94 and 1.75 L/m2/h/kPa for a kaolin suspension and a wastewater treatment plant influent sample, respectively, showing the highest average permeability and flow rate among all GDM systems. The GDM systems tested in this study met the daily minimum water requirement of a five-person family, except for a case in which wastewater treatment plant influent is filtered using a commercialized GDM system. According to permeability data from an accelerated cleaning test, the E-GDM system can be expected to guarantee 79,858 L of safe drinking water during its lifetime. The annual cost of the E-GDM system was assessed to be US$5.71 per household, which allows household water treatment in low- and middle-income countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An optimal restoration strategy for supply chain networks can efficiently schedule the repair activities under resource limits. However, a wide range of previous studies solve this problem from the perspective of cost-effectiveness instead of a resilient manner. This research formulates the problem as a network maximum-resilience decision. We develop two metrics to measure the resilience of the supply chain networks, i.e., the resilience of cumulative performance loss and the resilience of restoration rapidity. Then, we propose a bi-objective nonlinear programming model, which aims to maximize the network resilience under the budget and manpower constraints. A modified simulated annealing algorithm is employed to solve the model. Finally, a testing supply chain network is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method framework. The results show that the optimal restoration schedule generated by the proposed model is a tradeoff between the cumulative performance loss and the restoration rapidity. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of parameters indicates that decision-maker’s preference, tolerance factor of delivery time, number of work crews, and availability of budget all have significant impacts on the restoration schedule.</jats:p>"

The article systematically considers the problem of inadequate control over the payments for the consumed energy resources by non- household clients of domestic trading energy companies. The law aspects governing the contractual relations of the partners during the supply of energy resources are established. The typical conditions of payments for the consumed energy resources and ways of their adequate reflection in information subsystems of trading companies are defined. It is assumed that in order to solve the applied task, the information subsystems of accounting and control of trading companies must operate with the following information, which will be provided to the management system to make informed management decisions: a) general payment terms of each non- household counterparty; b) the current schedule of payment of each counterparty in connection with the terms of the signed contract; c) binding payment terms to the month of delivery (M); the month preceding the month of delivery (M - 1) and the month following the month of delivery (M + 1); d) dynamic change of the payment schedule according to additional agreements signed by the partners. As a result of research of the specified problem in all important aspects, practical recommendations on display in information subsystems of trading companies of the information on the schedule of payments for the consumed energy resources with a reference to a month of delivery are developed. Therefore, specific solutions are proposed for the algorithmization of procedures for controlling the timeliness of payments to counterparties and the formation on this basis of the necessary information for the management system of overdue debt. Further research in researched direction should focus on improving the final documents on the control of payment discipline of counterparties and management reporting on the timeliness of counterparties' payments for energy consumed.</jats:p>"

A serious malfunction of only one large oil producer can lead to a significant change in oil prices and the recession of the entire global economy. The aim of the article is to study the theoretical and empirical aspects of the mutual causality of oil prices and exchange rates, as well as to determine their influence on the development of the world economy. Methodology of the article. To complete this article, a comparative, economic and statistical analysis was used. Results. The article proves that the oil market is more inherent in a tendency towards regionalization rather than globalization. Factors affecting this process include macroeconomic conditions, the balance of supply and demand, the transformation of the regulatory component, changes in the cost structure and the significant influence of geopolitical components. The article justifies the fact that there is a certain strong direct connection between oil prices and exchange rates, but it is influenced by various geopolitical factors (for example, sanctions). Only 4% of the cost of oil is included in the price of gasoline, so when the price of oil falls, the price of gasoline does not decrease. Conclusions. A characteristic feature of the relationship between oil prices and exchange rates is the presence of bilateral mutual causality. Fluctuations in the dynamics of the oil industry are changing the roles of traditional and new suppliers. The oil market environment, which is a key commodity of our time, has a significant impact on world currencies.</jats:p>"

The small RNA fraction was extracted from muscle samples retrieved from the 36 gilts and sequenced, whereas lincRNA and mRNA expression data were already available. In terms of mean and variance, the expression profiles of miRNAs and lincRNAs in the porcine muscle were quite different than those of mRNAs. Food intake induced the differential expression of 149 (AL-T0/AL-T1) and 435 (AL-T0/AL-T2) mRNAs, 6 (AL-T0/AL-T1) and 28 (AL-T0/AL-T2) miRNAs and none lincRNAs, while the number of differentially dispersed genes was much lower. Among the set of differentially expressed miRNAs, we identified ssc-miR-148a-3p, ssc-miR-22-3p and ssc-miR-1, which play key roles in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.

The dilution effect was the main factor driving the reduction of all mineral elements, whereas Tr also had a great impact on the decrease of [N], [K], [Ca], and [Mg] except [P].

New relations are substantiated, and a new physical content is given for the instantaneous active current and the instantaneous apparent power, which take into account the dependence of the transmission line resistance ratio and correspond to similar integrated values of the periodic mode of a multiphase power supply system. It is shown that the instantaneous and integral values of the minimum possible losses are proportional to the square of the load power and inversely proportional to the short-circuit power. These values can be used to determine the power factors of a given load and gain coefficients for power losses. The calculated ratios for the gain coefficients for the instantaneous and integral power losses when using a shunt active filter with control strategies that form in the transmission line vectors of the active current according to the proposed formulas were obtained.

Angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry (VM) channels, migration, and invasion are the main ways for tumors to obtain nutrition. Herein, RPV‐modified epirubicin and dioscin co‐delivery liposomes were successfully prepared. These liposomes showed ideal physicochemical properties, enhanced tumor targeting and accumulation in tumor sites, and inhibited VM channel formation, tumor angiogenesis, migration and invasion. The liposomes also downregulated VM‐related and angiogenesis‐related proteins in vitro. Furthermore, when tested in vivo, the targeted co‐delivery liposomes increased selective accumulation of drugs in tumor sites and showed extended stability in blood circulation. In conclusion, RPV‐modified epirubicin and dioscin co‐delivery liposomes showed strong antitumor efficacy in vivo and could thus be considered a promising strategy for NSCLC treatment.</jats:p>",

We conducted a feasibility study in rural Bangladesh using an iterative design. We included pregnant women, their families, and local LPG stakeholders. We distributed LPG to households for 3 months (3 cylinders) and assessed process issues, acceptability, and cooking/food behaviours. We interviewed LPG stakeholders, and conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews with the users. The initial distribution and uptake of LPG were hampered by process issues, most of these were due to the non-established supply chain in the study area. LPG cooking was very acceptable and all users reported a preference for continued use, fuel-sparing was heavily practiced. Safety concerns were an initial issue. LPG stakeholders reported that LPG demand differed by season. This study demonstrated the feasibility of our planned trial and the need for safety messages. These results are relevant beyond our trial, including for programs of LPG fuel promotion.</jats:p>"

These energy storage devices are in many respects similar to fuel cells, and researchers translate some design features of the latter to the design of flow batteries. Two designs of vanadium flow batteries are compared: a battery with the electrolyte flowing through a porous body and a battery with the electrolyte flowing through a serpentine-patterned channel. Additionally, the geometry of the serpentine-patterned channels is optimized to obtain a design with the best characteristics. The performance efficiency of the vanadium flow battery used as part of an uninterruptible power supply system is estimated. The study results show that the design with a serpentine-patterned channel, when estimated without taking into account the losses for operation of the pumps and pumping through the entire circuit, and during operation at 99,5 % of its capacity, has the maximum efficiency at a level of 88,2 %, whereas the design with the flow through a porous body and operating at the same power has the efficiency at a level of 85,3 %. An approach using which the parameters of a cell with a serpentine-patterned channel can be determined has been developed.</jats:p>"

Based on pollution load theory and the concept of spatialization of social data, this study integrates land-use type, slope gradient, and spatial position, and uses the contribution of human activities to quantify the impact of farmland fertilizers, livestock and poultry wastes, and human domestic pollution on water quality in the study area. The results show that livestock manure is the largest source of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) discharges in the research area, and domestic pollution is the largest source of chemical oxygen demand (COD) discharges. The total equal standard pollution load (as well as the load of each pollution source and its pollutant amount) is the highest in the Nayong River Basin and the lowest in the Baishui River Basin. The contributions of human activities to TP and TN have similar spatial distributions. The impact of human activities on COD discharge is minimal. The quantitative results of this model are basically consistent with the actual conditions in the Pingzhai Reservoir Basin, which suggests that the model reasonably reflects the impact of human activities on the water environment of the basin.</jats:p>",

In the context of carbon tax policy, firms need to determine an optimal carbon reduction level and optimal product prices. To address firms’ decision-making challenges, this paper considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer under carbon tax policy; it establishes a Stackelberg game model with a risk-averse retailer and a risk-neutral manufacturer who is the leader of the game. The paper studies the influence of the government’s carbon tax policy and retailer’s risk-averse attitude on the optimal decision of the supply chain. The result shows that when the retailer is risk aversion, the degree of risk aversion of the retailer is positively correlated with the wholesale price of the manufacturer and unit carbon emission reduction, and within a certain range of carbon emission reduction cost coefficient, it is positively correlated with the price of products; with the increase of the carbon tax rate imposed by the government, the retail price of unit products, the wholesale price of the manufacturer, and the carbon emission reduction of unit products also increase.

This simulation model can be used for calculating the optimal parameters of such devices. The mechanical energy generated by pulsed liquid can be applied in the driving gear of mini-hydroelectric generators working without drops in water pressure, pumping stations and heat networks providing pressure reduction, as well as in heater fans operating in damp or explosion-hazardous facilities. Pulsed spiral hydro-mechanical energy converters can be used for converting the energy of a liquid flow into rotational motion, which can be further transferred to an electric generator or capacitor. In this study, using the example of a hydro-mechanical converter with a cone-shaped coil, the equations of torque depending on the change in the frequency of flow interruption, the moment of inertia and the resistance in the supports were obtained. Design charts were built for the torque of a hydro-mechanical converter with a cone-shaped coil for a number of coil turns equal to 4 pcs., square tube section 0.00011 m2, and the length of the initial round 0.176 m. The validity of the equations was confirmed by a physical experiment with sufficient accuracy. The conducted comparison of simulated and experimental values showed their agreement with an error of less than 5%. According to the simulation results, design parameters for different models have their own characteristics.</jats:p>"

The study employed the Ordinary Least Square regression analysis and utilized the National Household Education Survey Programs: After-School Programs and Activities (2005). The results showed that White and Hispanic mothers using relative care reported longer working hours than mothers of the same ethnic group who used other types of care. Hispanic mothers using parental (spousal) care also reported fewer working months than Hispanic mothers using relative care. Implications for policy, social work practice, and research are discussed along with limitations, including the cross-sectional design of the study.</jats:p>"

However, the molecular events that accompanied this emergence remain largely unknown. Here, we describe two MTBC strains isolated from patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, representing an as-yet-unknown lineage, named Lineage 8 (L8), seemingly restricted to the African Great Lakes region. Using genome-based phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that L8 is a sister clade to the known MTBC lineages. Comparison with other complete mycobacterial genomes indicate that the divergence of L8 preceded the loss of the<jats:italic>cobF</jats:italic>genome region - involved in the cobalamin/vitamin B12 synthesis - and gene interruptions in a subsequent common ancestor shared by all other known MTBC lineages. This discovery further supports an East African origin for the MTBC and provides additional molecular clues on the ancestral genome reduction associated with adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle.</jats:p>"

The designed system will not only try to save human lives, but will also store the data for later use by professionals working at this sector. India is a country with a high frequency of earthquakes. Since the country lies at the junction of three tectonic plates, the intensity of earthquakes felt in this region is moderate. But surprisingly, the number of deaths and financial loss in this region by earthquakes is not due to building crashes or being crushed under homes. Rather, major reasons of losses are due to indirect effects such as induction of fear, as well as fire induced from a cracked gas line or faulty electrical transmission line damaged by earthquakes. Hence, a low cost automatic microcontroller based system has been designed and implemented using low cost locally sourced electronic components, which senses earthquakes and gas leaks through accelerometer and gas sensor respectively. The microcontroller operates a relay and a motor that cuts off electricity and gas supplies respectively during the event of an earthquake, helping to prevent associated potential disasters.</jats:p>"

When calculating the coefficients of excess air at the upper and lower limits, the influence of the composition, temperature, and supply pressure of the components was taken into account.An analysis of the results showed that taking into account the parameters of air and oil gas at the outlet of the compressors expands the limits of combustion by the coefficient of excess air. An additional regenerative heating of the air between the compressor and the combustion chamber shifts the combustion stability region in terms of the excess air coefficient towards rich mixtures. Recuperative heating of fuel gas shifts the area of sustainable combustion towards lean mixtures. Simultaneous regenerative heating of fuel gas and air expands the area of sustainable combustion.</jats:p>"

In that Car wash waste water is the major producer of waste water which is let untreated in to water bodies. Transportation of people now uses mostly personal vehicle which leads to increase of more number of individual transport mode. In that particularly usage of car as well as its maintenance leading to create more waste wash water and also utilizing more volume of water for that purpose impact the environmental water balance in many ways as the conventional treatment of waste water costing more they are not think about treatment, So in this work the two samples was collected, and initial characterization was done and it was treated by Adsorption method with different Adsorbent which could be prepared from low cost and easily available material. For this work Prosopis juliflora leaves (AD1)and Casuarina equisetifolia (AD2) leaves were used as adsorbent and waste cotton cloth(AC1) which is cellulosic fiber rich in carbon content was used to prepare Activated carbon The treated water was found to be in excellent reduction level of various pollutant level as follows, the level of TSS showed 94.5% &amp;BOD 95.4% ,COD 96.6% was reduced for the sample 1 . The pollutant due to the usage of detergent, that is the Methylene blue Anionic substances level also reduced from 1.8 mg/lit to 0.2 mg/lit of about 88.89%by prepared activated carbon(AD1).and very good reduction level of Oil and Grease was resulted by AD1,AD2,AC2 99.5%, 98.7%, 99.1% It is evident from the result that the waste cloth material and the un wanted growth of Prosopis juliflora which has been insisted to cut down of save underground water could be used in another way for treating waste water and and to solve the problem of water management and supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Voltage unbalance in power systems feeding AC traction power systems is a worldwide known problem. One of the main aspects of this problem is the negative effect of voltage unbalance on motor loads causing operating problems and economic damage. It is necessary to perform unbalanced power flow studies and calculate voltage unbalance indexes to assess this negative effect of voltage unbalance and the develop of compensating measures during the design stage. Usually, calculations of the AC traction power supply system and the distribution network feeding it are carried out separately during the design of new lines of railways electrified by alternating current (AC) and reconstructing of existing ones. This approach is a source of deviations in the power flow studies because the lack of consideration of mutual influences between the traction power system and the distribution power system. In this paper, we compare a digital model in which the traction power supply system and the distribution network are modeled separately with a model that considers mutual influences between the traction and external power supply systems, including power flows through the traction network caused by the distribution network (transit currents). For digital modeling of these processes, authors used ETAPTM software with eTraXTM package. It allows to run unbalanced power flow studies when the generation and load are being changed over time, including train movement. During a separate simulation of the traction power system and distribution network, traction network was modelled using the equivalent sources connected to traction substation buses and the distribution network was modeled taking into account the fact that traction load was given from the simulation of the traction power system. The traction load was considered as lumped loads connected to the traction substation buses.At the same time, in both cases, the unbalanced power flow study was carried out by the phase domain method. Based on the results of two models comparison, it was concluded that the combined model containing a traction power supply system and distribution network, is more effective in terms of improving the accuracy of assessment voltage unbalance in accordance with current regulatory and technical documents on power quality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Sources of non-centralized water supply are the most important resource of drinking water for the population of rural areas. As a rule, water is taken from small depths, which makes it vulnerable to pollution. This type of water use is characterized by the absence of any preliminary water treatment. The constant use of groundwater for drinking can negatively affect the health of the local population since the indicators of its chemical and microbiological composition are not controlled in any way and do not always meet the quality standards. All this determines the relevance of the research conducted in the territory of the Tomsk District (Tomsk Region). Methods. Groundwater quality was assessed by comparing the concentrations of substances in the studied water samples with the background values established for the given territory in relation to Sanitary Norms and Regulations as well as microbiological indicators. Changes in the chemical and microbiological composition of the studied water, caused by economic activity, were taken as “pollution” as compared to the natural (background) state for this territory as well as sanitary and hygienic standards. Results. According to the results of studying the chemical composition of water, high levels of the following components were observed: total hardness, Na+, K+, SO42–, Cl–, NO3–, Fe, and Mn. As for NO3–, Fe, and Mn, their concentrations exceed manifold not only the background values but also the maximum allowable concentrations for drinking water. Microbiological analysis showed a large number of microorganisms from various physiological groups, which indicates a high degree of bacterial contamination of water. We present possible reasons for the input of pollutants into the water and review briefly the adverse health effects. Conclusion. In order to prevent the possible negative impact of excessive contents of various components in the chemical composition of water on the health of the local population, preliminary water treatment using available methods is recommended.</jats:p>"

The optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) utilizing a four-layer biogas supply chain. The model accounts for biogas plants based on two capacity levels of methane to produce on average 1 ± 0.1 MW and 5 ± 0.2 MW electricity. Three objectives are put forward: i) maximization of economic profit, ii) maximization of economic profit while considering cost/benefits from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (economic<jats:sup>+GHG</jats:sup> profit) and iii) maximization of sustainability profit. The results show that the economic profit accrued on hourly-based auction trading prices is negative (loss), hence, four additional scenarios are put forward: i) a scenario whereby carbon prices are steadily increased to the prevalent eco-costs/eco-benefits of global warming; ii) a scenario whereby all the electricity auction trading prices are multiplied by certain factors to find the profitability breakeven factor, iii) a scenario whereby shorter time periods are applied, and investment cost of biogas storage is reduced showing a relationship between cost, volume of biogas stored and the variations in electricity production and (iv) a scenario whereby the capacity of the biogas plant is varied from 1 MW and 5 MW as it affects economics of the process. The models are applied to an illustrative case study of agricultural biogas plants in Slovenia where a maximum of three biogas plants could be selected. The results hence present the effects of the simultaneous relationship of economic profit, economic<jats:sup>+GHG</jats:sup> profit and sustainability profit on the supply and its benefit to decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing paradigms, billions of IoT devices are being networked to support data‐driven and real‐time decision making across numerous application domains, including smart homes, smart transport, and smart buildings. These ubiquitously distributed IoT devices send the raw data to their respective edge device (eg, IoT gateways) or the cloud directly. The wide spectrum of possible application use cases make the design and networking of IoT and edge computing layers a very tedious process due to the: (i) complexity and heterogeneity of end‐point networks (eg, Wi‐Fi, 4G, and Bluetooth); (ii) heterogeneity of edge and IoT hardware resources and software stack; (iv) mobility of IoT devices; and (iii) the complex interplay between the IoT and edge layers. Unlike cloud computing, where researchers and developers seeking to test capacity planning, resource selection, network configuration, computation placement, and security management strategies had access to public cloud infrastructure (eg, Amazon and Azure), establishing an IoT and edge computing testbed that offers a high degree of verisimilitude is not only complex, costly, and resource‐intensive but also time‐intensive. Moreover, testing in real IoT and edge computing environments is not feasible due to the high cost and diverse domain knowledge required in order to reason about their diversity, scalability, and usability. To support performance testing and validation of IoT and edge computing configurations and algorithms at scale, simulation frameworks should be developed. Hence, this article proposes a novel simulator IoTSim‐Edge, which captures the behavior of heterogeneous IoT and edge computing infrastructure and allows users to test their infrastructure and framework in an easy and configurable manner. IoTSim‐Edge extends the capability of CloudSim to incorporate the different features of edge and IoT devices. The effectiveness of IoTSim‐Edge is described using three test cases. Results show the varying capability of IoTSim‐Edge in terms of application composition, battery‐oriented modeling, heterogeneous protocols modeling, and mobility modeling along with the resources provisioning for IoT applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Microsensors were applied to study the diffusion reaction and activity of a nitrogen species of deposit sediment from a drinking water supply system. Microprofiles of dissolved oxygen (DO), NH4+-N, NO3−-N, and NO2−N in the sediment indicated that the DO concentration decreased from the highest at the sediment surface to zero at the bottom of the sediment. Similarly, with the increase of depth, NH4+-N initially increased rapidly and then decreased slowly, while the concentration of NO3−-N reached a maximum at around 6000 μm and then decreased to about 0.1 mg·L−1 near the bottom of the sediment. Almost no change was observed for NO2−-N. The decrease of NH4+-N and DO corresponded well with the increase of NO3−-N. Furthermore, based on a consumption and production rate analysis, DO has always been consumed; the NH4+-N consumption rate increased rapidly within 0–1000 μm, reaching about 14 mg·L−1·S−1·10−9. A small amount of NH4+-N was produced in 2000–6000 μm, which could be attributed to denitrification activity. There was no change deeper than 6000 μm, while NO3−-N was produced at a depth between 0 and 6000 μm and was consumed in the deeper zone. At the depth of 9000 μm, the NO3−-N consumption reached a maximum of 5 mg·L−1·S−1·10−9. The consumption of DO and NH4+-N, which corresponded with the production of NO3−-N in a specific microscale range within the sediment, demonstrated nitrification and denitrification activities. In addition, the time required for the diffusion of only DO, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, and NO2−-N was estimated as 14 days; however, in the practical, even after 60 days of operation, there was still a continuous reaction, which provided further evidence towards microbial activities within the sediment.</jats:p>"

The model assumes that the market demand of fresh agricultural products is affected by freshness and sales prices, and the distribution center is responsible for not only storage, processing, and distribution but also coordinating the production and supply information of farmers’ professional cooperatives and the order sales information of supermarkets. An improved genetic algorithm is developed to solve the nonlinear optimization problem.

The global landscape of the industry is changing rapidly, and this has generated many issues which are worthy of in-depth research related to logistics especially those involving the use of English as a business language. This paper investigates the use of spoken English amongst workers in logistics companies in northern parts of Malaysia.

The number of water samples taken for this study was 15 from the paid water filtration machines studied. The physicochemical assessment such as determination of pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen was conducted, while the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the mineral content of the treated water. The microbiological quality was determined using the pour plate method for colony count (22°C incubation for 72 hours and 37°C for 24 hours), while for coliforms and <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>, the membrane filtration method was utilized. The samples of treated water from the paid water filters were based on triplicate sampling (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 3). The pH, turbidity, total dissolved solid values, and heavy metal concentration were within the safe level according to the Malaysian National Standard for Drinking Water Quality, Ministry of Health (MOH). The overall range for the pH values of the treated water samples was between 6.50 and 7.15, where this was within the recommended range. The total dissolved solids showed that all the treated water samples were in the range of the recommended standard (27 to 92 mg/L). The range of turbidity values for all the treated water samples was from 1.7 to 6 NTU, and the dissolved oxygen range was from 7.7 to 8.2 mg/L. The colony count results showed that most of the water samples complied with the standards of &lt;4 log cfu/mL at 37°C and &lt;3 log cfu/mL at 22°C of incubation temperatures. However, there was the presence of coliforms in four (4/15) of the treated water samples being at more than 4 cfu/100 mL, while <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> was absent in all of the treated water samples. The overall results showed that all samples were safe to drink according to the Industrial Guide to Good Hygiene Practice by Automatic Vending Association of Britain (2000) and Food Act (1983) except for the four treated water samples (C, D, H, and I). For that reason, the filtered waters require quality evaluation and management, while the filters need to be replaced according to their designated schedule in order to ascertain that the drinking water is safe to be consumed by the public.</jats:p>",

The phenomenon often comes with escalated traffic deterioration that raises the time and cost of emergency supply scheduling. Fortunately, repairing road network will shorten the time of in-transit distribution. In this paper, according to the characteristics of emergency supplies distribution, an emergency supply scheduling model based on multiple warehouses and stricken locations is constructed to deal with the failure of part of road networks in the early postdisaster phase. The detailed process is as follows. When part of the road networks fail, we firstly determine whether to repair the damaged road networks, and then a model of reliable emergency supply scheduling based on bi-level programming is proposed. Subsequently, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm is presented to solve the problem mentioned above. Finally, through a case study, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm are verified.</jats:p>",

The efficiency of phytoextraction depends on numerous soil-associated and plant-associated factors (e.g. concentrations of target elements in potentially plant available soil fractions, rhizosphere processes and uptake mechanisms of plants). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different soil properties (pH, compost amendment) on the mobility of selected target elements for phytoremediation (As, Pb, Cd, Zn) and phytomining (Ge, REEs) in soil and shoot concentrations in Phalaris arundinacea. Until today, only little is known about the influence of soil-associated factors on the availability of trace elements for Phalaris arundinacea, especially for the target elements Ge and REEs. In a field experiment we cultivated 10 different genotypes of Phalaris arundinacea on four different substrates with similar element concentrations but different pH-values (pH 6.6 – 7.8) and levels of compost amendment (5l /m2 compost or without compost). On each of the substrates we cultivated Phalaris arundinacea (genotypes) with two replicates on plots 4 m2 each and installed suction cups to collect soil solution. After harvest concentrations of Ge, REEs, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, As and Cd in shoots and soil solution were determined with ICP-MS. Compared to the slight alkaline soil, acidic soil conditions significantly increased shoot concentrations of Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Pb and REEs. Under acidic soil conditions addition of compost further increased the concentrations of all investigated target elements in shoots of P. arundinacea except of As. In soil solution only concentrations of Fe and Mn significantly increased due to the compost amendment, while concentrations of P, Ge, REEs, Cd and Pb decreased. Lower concentrations of elements in soil solution may result from increased adsorption of the elements onto soil particles (in case of P and Ge) or the uptake of the elements by plants (in case of Cd and Pb). We conclude that amendment of soil with compost seems to be a sustainable approach to enhance the uptake of plant nutrients such as Fe and Mn as well as REEs into shoots of Phalaris arundinacea and to reduce the mobility of potential toxic trace elements (Cd, Pb) in soil solution.
