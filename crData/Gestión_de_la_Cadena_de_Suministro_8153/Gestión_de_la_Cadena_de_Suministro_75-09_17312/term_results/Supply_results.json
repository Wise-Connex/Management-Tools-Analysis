It discusses the nature of the energy/natural gas shortage and its causes. The basic reason for the shortage is almost universally conceded to be the misapplication of federal regulation of the wellhead price of gas, but impeding solutions to the problem are misconceptions as to the feasibility of alternatives. Specifically, there has been unwarranted reliance on conservation, overly optimistic expectations with respect to \"exotics\", and apparent bias, on the part of some government decision makers, toward \"all electric\". Also discussed are factors that will affect future trends in fuel usage, the importance and availability of natural gas supplementals, the economic impact of an extended severe gas shortage, the need for increased new gas exploration, and the case for deregulation, including its economic impact on the consumer. This paper concludes that there must be a national imperative for a continuity of our gaseous fuel supply.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GAS INDUSTRY</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Natural gas remains the least understood of all of our energy sources. We became dependent upon it almost overnight after WW II because of its sudden abundance at low cost, and because of its premium qualities of cleanliness, versatility and efficiency.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Today people are frankly surprised when they finally come to understand the pervasive ross of its use. Natural gas and its related supplementals provide over 31 percent of the primary energy used in the United States; over primary energy used in the United States; over 41 percent of the nontransportation energy used; more primary energy than any other source produced domestically (41 percent gas, 30 produced domestically (41 percent gas, 30 percent oil, and 23 percent coal); 17 percent percent oil, and 23 percent coal); 17 percent of our national electric power generation; nearly 50 percent of all industrial energy; and 42 percent of the residential and commercial market. Natural gas heats 39.4 million homes and 56 percent of all dwellings. It is the largest single fuel source for the residential, commercial, and industrial markets.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The breakdown potential of a vacuum gap is measured using parallel planar electrodes made of sterling silver as a function of gap separations, number of sparkings, external resistance, and variation of hydrogen and air pressures using dc and ac (50 Hz) applied voltages. It is found that the dc and ac vacuum breakdown voltages become equal after full conditioning by repeated sparkings of both electrodes either with ac or with both polarities of the dc applied voltage. The vacuum breakdown voltage is found to be independent of supply frequency up to 250 Hz. The vacuum breakdown voltage decreases with decreasing the external circuit resistance in series with the gap in the range below 103 Ω. This decrease in the breakdown potential is attributed to the very short discharge time of the stray capacitive energy of the connecting leads into the gap compared to the time necessary for the current growth leading to breakdown. The minimum energy necessary to decondition (degrade) a vacuum gap is measured and the degree of deconditioning is determined as a function of energy discharged into the gap. The dc dielectric strength of the vacuum gap always recovers to its original value after a few sparkings.</jats:p>",
