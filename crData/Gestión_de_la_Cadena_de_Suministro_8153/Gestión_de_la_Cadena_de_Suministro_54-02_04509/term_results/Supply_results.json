      "abstract": "<jats:p>Physicists-in-training have been declining in number since 1950. This decrease has been relatively sharp for undergraduate physics majors. The numbers of graduate students in physics have decreased only slightly, but this reduction seems likely to continue until about 1958. The production of doctorates in physics reached a peak in the academic year 1952–53 just closed. It is to be expected that physics PhD's will continue to be graduated in slowly diminishing numbers until about 1962, after which there should be substantial increases.</jats:p>",

The distribution of blood vessels in the perfused skins has been studied.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Three plexuses of blood vessels have been observed in the skins. The first lies below the corium; the second is at a level between that of the ‘sweat glands’ and the sebaceous glands; and the third extends from beneath the epidermis to above the second plexus and is a deep network of many fine blood vessels.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The presence of venae comites in the skin is discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>5. The ‘sweat glands’ appear to have a very poor blood supply, while the hair follicles and papillae are richly supplied.</jats:p><jats:p>6. Both the ‘sweat glands’ and the hair follicles are supplied with blood from the second plexus.</jats:p><jats:p>7. The vessels of the third plexus appear to enmesh the individual hair follicles at different levels.</jats:p><jats:p>8. Blood vessels supplying the skin in the back and flanks of the animals originate from the intercostal arteries and so pass through the heat generating intercostal muscles.</jats:p>",
