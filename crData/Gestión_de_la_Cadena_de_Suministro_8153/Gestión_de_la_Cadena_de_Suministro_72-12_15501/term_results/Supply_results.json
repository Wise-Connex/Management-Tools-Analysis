Empirical estimates of the parameters of the supply function, using ordinary least squares, indicate that some concept of average prices for dairy products is a more important determinant of supply than ratios of prices of dairy products relative to prices of production substitutes such as beef cattle or sheep and lambs. The empirical results also indicate that the quota‐type effects of the various metropolitan fluid milk schemes are important in determining supply. Effects of new technology on supply could not be quantified due to intercorrelation of explanatory variables.</jats:p>",

When the prescription has been written, the medicine must be dispensed for the patient who must then use it as instructed. The doctor pays most attention to the first of these steps, which involves him directly. He may also consider what will happen subsequently, but often does so rather cursorily, and much treatment is less effective than it should be because something unforeseen happens after the patient has been given the prescription. The pharmacist’s role here, as in mediating and regulating self-medication, is usually taken for granted, but it should not be. This article discusses how pharmacists should help patients and doctors, the constraints that make this difficult, and possible ways of improving the present arrangements.</jats:p>",

The single ventral spinal artery was found to receive on an average 4.1 significant radicular contributions, of which one or two arteries at the fourth or third lumbar levels on the left were invariably of especially large size. Equal numbers, about six to eight, of contributions to the two dorsolateral arterial trunks were present. Anastomotic channels greater than 50 m̈ in diameter were rather poorly developed between dorsolateral and ventral arterial channels, especially across the middorsum. The dorsal radicular artery in 82 of 97 roots examined was seen to pierce the ventral root in order to reach a position along the ventral aspect of the dorsal root. In most cases this penetration occurred central to the ganglion. The bearing of this feature on reported differences in behavioral effects from rhizotomy by intradural section and by ganglionectomy is discussed, as well as other aspects of the effect of rhizotomy on cord criculation.</jats:p>",
