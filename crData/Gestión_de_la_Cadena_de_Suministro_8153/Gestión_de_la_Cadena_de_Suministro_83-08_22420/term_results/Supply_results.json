Caribo (1979) or Arminda and Okapi (1980) was provided with an additional N dressing at different stages between tillering and ear emergence after a basal N dose applied at the onset of tillering. The effect of N on ear formation depended greatly on the growth stage at the time of N application. Max. effects on tiller formation and spikelet initiation were achieved when additional N was supplied at the beginning of tillering; on ear number when N was supplied at the onset of stem elongation; on the numbers of fertile spikelets, grains/fertile spikelet and grains/ear when N was applied during stem elongation until flag leaf emergence and on single grain wt. when N was applied at ear emergence. Variations in 1000-grain wt. were small, therefore grain yield/ear as well as yield/unit area was largely determined by grain number. Main shoots outyielded ear-bearing tillers because of a higher grain number. In ear-bearing tillers, grain yield largely depended on grain number, being highest in the older tillers. Grain formation of ear-bearing tillers was more strongly affected by the time of additional N application than that of main shoots. Top-dressings of N applied during stem elongation increased the grain number of ear-bearing tillers considerably, because both the number of fertile spikelets and the grain number/fertile spikelet were higher. In the young late-appeared tillers, the opt. time to apply additional N for grain set shifted to later stages of development. (Abstract retrieved from CAB Abstracts by CABI’s permission)</jats:p>"

Division principles should be general enough to accommodate changes in what is to be divided as well as variations in the number of agents among whom the division is to take place.

Here, we explicitly allow it to vary. </jats:p><jats:p> Agents are assumed to have von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions and division problems are defined as subsets of the utility space. Our approach is axiomatic. Apart from the familiar axioms of Pareto-optimality, scale invariance, continuity and anonymity, we formulate and impose an axiom of monotonicity with respect to changes in the number of agents, stating that if sacrifices have to be made to support an additional agent, then everybody should contribute. There is a unique division principle that satisfies them all: it is the natural extension to the n-person case of the two-person solution proposed by Kalai and Smorodinsky. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the trade-offs among purchases, storage, and service reliability decisions faced by natural gas distribution utilities. The short-term demand for natural gas fluctuates because of the weather. To encourage load leveling, the pipeline transmission companies that supply the utilities use a demand contract that charges utilities based on their peak day needs and often charge for a minimum daily purchase requirement whether that purchase is made or not. The policy variables available to the utility include increasing its storage capacity and providing interruptible service to some customers thereby lowering reliability of service. There are also technological constraints on the maximum storage gas flows. </jats:p><jats:p> To explore these trade-offs, a chance-constrained cost minimization problem is formulated. Two decision rules for gas purchases and storage operation are examined. In these rules, an initial decision is made at the beginning of each month about either the level of purchases or the level of storage flow for that month. The two rules differ in that the supplier is assumed either to be able to adjust sales during the month up to the limit set by the demand contract or to be inflexible. In the latter case, storage must provide flexibility for meeting demand. </jats:p><jats:p> Solutions have been obtained under the conditions that apply to the East Ohio Gas Company. A large number of cases have been considered for several levels of increased storage capacity, decreased reliability of service, and conversion capability from gas to oil for commercial and industrial customers. The results show the breakeven points in storage costs under which various policies become feasible and the savings that can be achieved. </jats:p>",

One isolate from the anaerobic jar was cultivated in a chemostat (Bioflo model C 30; New Brunswick Scientific Co.) in a defined medium with added B vitamins, yeast extract, or formic acid, with or without gas flow (air or nitrogen). In all cases where spore germination occurred, aflatoxin was formed in the cultures with gas flow, and small quantities of aflatoxins B1 and B2 occurred even in an atmosphere of nitrogen. Addition of B vitamins and supply of traces of air gave an approximately 15-fold increase in the amount of aflatoxin in 2 days. Carbon dioxide enrichment hindered aflatoxin formation on the defined medium even in the presence of B vitamins, but when formic acid was added, small quantities (5 to 15 micrograms/liter) were formed, and this low level remained constant until the gas flow was started.</jats:p>",
