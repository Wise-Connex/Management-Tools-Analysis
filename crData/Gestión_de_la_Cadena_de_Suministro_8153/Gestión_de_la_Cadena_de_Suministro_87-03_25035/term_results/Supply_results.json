      "abstract": "<jats:p>The majority of the articles reviewed this time deal with ILL and public libraries in one way or another. The review begins by looking at school libraries and their ability to handle ILL requests satisfactorily amongst themselves and then examines several papers critical of networking in public libraries. There is an argument that public libraries hardly need ILL at all because of the nature of their users and their needs. ILL is an expensive operation and the issue of fees and charges is much debated; the discussion examined here includes the suggestion that users can travel to consult materials and public libraries might ration ILL requests per user including children. The idea of using ILL as a revenue earner, or at least paying for itself, is questioned and a study of commercial document supply services is examined which pays special attention to the performance of the many sources available. A paper on ILL costing almost nothing is criticized as not taking account of all factors. Time, as well as money, is important and a study of supply time to the user shows that more could be done by requesting libraries to speed supply to the end‐user. The impact of network membership on ILL is considered and shows that net borrowers can soon become net lenders and vice‐versa. The reorganization of document supply from the US National Library of Medicine had considerable impact on the use of NLM which is analysed. Finally a note on the political aspects of ILL in southern Africa is noticed as dealing with an issue of potential significance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This paper reviews oil and gas worldwide supply and demand and their effect on oil prices and consequently on related industries such as refining, drilling technology, enhanced oil recovery, natural gas liquefaction,..etc. The proved oil reserves in the world is about 7×1011 bbl with about 56% located in the Middle East. The worldwide natural gas reserves is estimated as 3.484×1015 ft3 with 43% located in U.S.S.R and 25% in the Middle-East. The heavy oil reserves is estimated as 5.8 – 5.9×1012 barrels with 72% located in Venezuela. The bitumen reserves is estimated as 200 billion barrels with 82% located in Canada.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In 1979, oil production reached it's peak of about 66×106 bbl/day out of which 21.91×106 bbl/day was produced from the Middle East. Then the demand for oil declined till 1985. An increase in the demand was reported in early 1986. About 25% of oil produced was consumed by U.S.A., 21% by Western Europe, 15% by U.S.S.R. and 7.5% by Japan. Oil tankers, especially supertanker, and refining industries were suffering in the last several years as they were operated at rates less than their capacities. Oil prices declined since 1982 and collapsed in 1986. Such reduction in oil price, if sustained, is expected to hurt drilling activities, enhanced oil recovery projects which may result in less supply and declining reserve and consequently a big hike in oil prices in the future. Among different sources of energy, oil has proved to be the main source of energy for worldwide consumption.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The demand for gas is increasing. The production in early 1986 reached a rate of 190×109ft3/day with about 35% produced from U.S.S.R and about 25% from U.S.A. The main consumers of natural gas are U.S.S.R., U.S.A., Japan and Western Europe. U.S.S.R. supplies Western and Eastern Europe with most of their needs of natural gases.</jats:p>",

Production forecasts are based on engineering analysis with considerations given to equipment capacity, well deliverability and demand. Current laws normally govern tax considerations, although legislation under consideration must also be recognized. Past expenses coupled with estimates relative to inflation provide the basis for estimates of future expenses. Price forecasts have been dependent upon current prices with estimates as to future inflation rates. Therefore, the appraiser of an oil and gas property must have not only a geotechnical background but also an understanding of economics and finance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Until the early 1970's, the oil industry had primarily focused economic analysis on domestic supply and demand. As this demand exceeded the supply, resulting in increased levels of imports, attention turned to supplies outside the United States. Today our evaluations require analysis of worldwide economic factors when projecting production rates, prices and expenses. Estimates of crude oil supply relative to the price for the various producing nations have been made, thereby providing supply schedules with the attendant supply curves. Estimates of world demand were made to obtain demand schedules and demand curves. The supply and demand curves have been brought together to provide the estimated equilibrium price for oil.</jats:p>",

An obstacle to resource sharing is the desire of many libraries to maintain the independence of their own collections. The resulting duplication can be seen as a waste of already‐scarce resources. The costs of interlending also militate against co‐operation, which is made even more difficult by physical problems such as distance and the scarcity of reprographic facilities. The demise of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute's co‐operative scheme is regretted, and the author suggests that consideration needs to be given to a new scheme to enable Kenyan libraries to maximize their coverage by sharing their resources.</jats:p>",

Major trends in interlibrary lending and private sector services are summarized. Commercial services are divided into two groups: collection‐specific and full‐service suppliers. The article explores the fit of commercial services in a resource‐sharing environment. Evidence is presented that corporate libraries are more likely to use commercial services than their academic counterparts. Speed of delivery is found to be the vital factor to librarians in both types of libraries, although economic issues are also important. The article concludes with a discussion of the private sector in developing and introducing new technology for document delivery.</jats:p>",

The typical characteristics of these deals differ somewhat on either side of the Atlantic in ways which are outlined below. However, in each environment the term “buy‐out” refers essentially to the transfer of ownership of the assets of an existing firm — which may itself be an independent entity or a wholly‐owned subsidiary or division — to a new and especially established group of equity holders which intends to keep at least some of those assets in their former use. In the US buy‐outs have often involved very large asset transfers, indeed multi‐billion dollar deals have been quite frequent. The transaction is typically financed by a limited subscription of equity from specialist venture capitalists and perhaps from the firm's management, together with a very large input of debt capital. The latter has often been in the form of high coupon (so called “junk”) bonds. The characteristically high ratio of debt to equity in buy‐out finance has given rise to their American description as<jats:italic>leveraged buy‐outs</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

This occurs in both the CNS and PNS. It has been suggested that one of the effects of 2,5‐HD is an impairment of glucose utilization arising from an inhibition of specific glycolytic enzymes. This hypothesis is based principally on evidence obtained in vitro. In the present study, glucose utilization, glucose transport across the blood‐brain barrier, and blood flow have been measured in vivo in brain regions of control rats and in three groups of rats treated with 2,5‐HD as (a) a single intragastric dose (500 mg/kg of body weight), (b) high chronic doses of 500 mg/kg of body weight for 15 days, or (c) low chronic doses of 250 mg/kg of body weight for 21 days. Group b showed overt signs of neuropathy, whereas groups a and c did not. The results indicate two independent effects of 2,5‐HD in the CNS: a dose‐dependent inhibition of glucose utilization and an effect on glucose supply and transport across the blood‐brain barrier, which is apparent only after chronic treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> A current explanation of the mechanism of flooding injury to roots suggests that oxygen deficiency depresses the supply of respirable carbohydrates sufficiently to inhibit fermentation. However, even though it has been shown that phloem transport of assimilate is sharply reduced to anaerobic roots, inhibition of assimilate metabolism has also been suggested to be an important factor. This study examines these hypotheses by relating assimilate supply and metabolic activity in anoxic roots of alfalfa (<jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic> L.), a flood‐intolerant species, and birdsfoot trefoil (<jats:italic>Lotus corniculatus</jats:italic> L.), a flood‐tolerant plant. Roots were made anoxic (severe O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> deficiency) for 2, 4 or 6 d and shoots were labelled with <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Assimilate transport to the roots and metabolism to structural components were significantly decreased in both species in response to anoxia. Trefoil exhibited significantly greater <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C incorporation into the residue fraction at 4 d anoxia than did alfalfa, and this was consistent with the greater flooding tolerance of trefoil. When assimilate supply to O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐deficient roots was decreased by shoot shading, shoot fresh weight was reduced by both anoxia and light treatments. Root‐soluble sugars were significantly decreased by shading but were greatly increased in response to anoxia. Root starch concentration also increased under anoxia. Root K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentration was reduced by anoxia only. The energy status (ATP/ADP) of roots was significantly decreased by shading; however, anoxia reduced the energy status only in unshaded plants. The data indicate that carbohydrate supply to anaerobic roots does not appear to be a limiting factor in the metabolic response of alfalfa roots. Alternatively, metabolism of assimilate in anoxic roots may be an important determinant of survival.</jats:p>",

Blockade of flow has been achieved mechanically by an inflatable occluder placed around the testicular artery at the level of the spermatic cord. The effect of the blockade on total testicular blood supply was investigated using Doppler flowmetry and a percutaneous Xenon‐133 injection method. With both approaches, the blood flow changes after inflation or deflation of the occluders could be estimated satisfactorily. A substantial decrease of testicular blood flow was achieved in eight of the 10 testes with inflated occluders. However, there were indications that in the remaining two testes blockade of the arterial flow was not complete. After deflation of the occluders, blood flow was restored rapidly and completely in all testes. Macro‐ and microscopic examinations revealed no long‐term damage to the testis after blood flow interruptions lasting 30 or 60 minutes.</jats:p>",
