The goal of the research is to explore current practices in terms of the commercial relationship between them. Specifically, the attention was focused on identifying whether there are relevant imbalances in terms of bargaining power so that the overall performance of the supply network as a whole is jeopardised. Some interesting conclusions could be drawn from this exploratory study. Perhaps the most important is the clear indication that the issue of supply network management is neglected among the analysed companies. The emphasis has almost exclusively been placed on the relationship with immediate customers and suppliers. This can run important risks for the competitiveness of the Brazilian automotive industry. Some causes of the negligence with the theme are discussed and some simple corrective measures are proposed, based on some more contemporary contributions found in the recent literature and in some practices identified in Brazil outside the automotive industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 1996, there have been several important developments which have had or may have an impact on the nuclear fuel market. These include electricity market restructuring in many countries, the economic turbulence in East Asia, and the increased interest in the environmental advantages of nuclear power in the context of limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases agreed to at the Kyoto climate conference. </jats:p><jats:p> Rapid growth in world demand for electricity has provided a strong market for the development of nuclear power over the past 30 years, and it now contributes 17% of world electricity supply. Today, electricity demand growth is relatively low in most of the countries where nuclear power is well established, but remains rapid in many developing countries. In both established and potential markets, nuclear power faces a tough competitive challenge from rival modes of generation, while continuing to face regulatory and political hurdles. </jats:p><jats:p> The forecasts of nuclear generating capacity in individual countries and areas have been fully revised. It is expected that the fortunes of nuclear power in a relatively small number of countries, notably the United States, China, Japan and Russia, will be particularly crucial in determining nuclear power's overall contribution to world electricity supplies. </jats:p><jats:p> The Uranium Institute has prepared three scenarios for world nuclear generating capacity up to 2020, referred to as the reference, upper and lower scenarios. These range from a modest revival of nuclear power to a substantial decline over the forecast period. At the end of 1997, world nuclear capacity was 346 GWe. In the reference scenario this is expected to be 349 GWe by 2000, and then to grow to 376 GWe by 2010 and to 405 GWe by 2020. The annual average rate of growth over the whole period is 0.7%. Given expected world electricity demand growth substantially in excess of this, the nuclear share of total generation is likely to decrease. In the upper scenario, the equivalent figures are 355 GWe in 2000, 422 GWe in 2010, and 483 GWe in 2020. The lower case has 346 GWe in 2000, 345 GWe in 2010, and 293 GWe by 2020. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Long-term exposure of plants to elevated partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) often depresses photosynthetic capacity. The mechanistic basis for this photosynthetic acclimation may involve accumulation of carbohydrate and may be promoted by nutrient limitation. However, our current knowledge is inadequate for making reliable predictions concerning the onset and extent of acclimation. Many studies have sought to investigate the effects of N supply but the methodologies used generally do not allow separation of the direct effects of limited N availability from those caused by a N dilution effect due to accelerated growth at elevated pCO2. To dissociate these interactions, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown hydroponically and N was added in direct proportion to plant growth. Photosynthesis did not acclimate to elevated pCO2 even when growth was restricted by a low-N relative addition rate. Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity and quantity were maintained, there was no evidence for triose phosphate limitation of photosynthesis, and tissue N content remained within the range recorded for healthy wheat plants. In contrast, wheat grown in sand culture with N supplied at a fixed concentration suffered photosynthetic acclimation at elevated pCO2 in a low-N treatment. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the quantity of active ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and leaf N content.</jats:p>",

This model has the advantage of expressing trend and seasonal elements as stochastic components, allowing a dynamic interpretation of the results and improving the forecast capabilities of the model. The results of the estimation indicate the continued importance of feed costs to poultry production and of technology as expressed by the stochastic trend variable. However, seasonal influences appear to have become less important, since the seasonal component was not statistically significant.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the system does not promote drug sales for cofinancing purposes but aims at supporting the prescribers to provide better medical care, and patients’ access to the most essential drugs at fair prices. Secondly, the project guarantees equal prices and services throughout the Province regardless of distance from the central warehouse and sales at a given location. Thirdly, along with the revolving fund‐financed drug supply system, a community‐based legal framework has been established. Built‐in management alert mechanisms helped the project resist common causes of collapse such as uneconomic behaviour and political interference. The drug supply system has gained full independence from subsidies and external authorities. Its strong community participation promotes good governance.</jats:p>",
