First, develop a formula for measuring size of research benefits which is generally applicable to all types of supply shift. Second, use this formula to assess the possible error involved in previous studies employing alternative equations. Third, initiate discussion on variables which might influence the type of supply shift. The article concludes that uncritical application of previously developed formulas without regard to the type of supply shift can result in substantial bias in estimates of research benefits. The implication is that calculation of rates of return on agricultural investment may also be severely biased.</jats:p>",

While consumer surplus might be capitalized in the value of sites with access to mains, empirical attempts to measure such capitalization have not proved inveriably successful. In this note an alternative technique based upon the direct estimation of the demand curve is applied. An analysis of Penang Island, Malaysia indicates that the consumer surplus benefits are one and one‐half times greater than the revenues recoupled through user fees. The applicability of this technique to cost‐benefit analysis of water supply investments is discussed.</jats:p>",

The interactive program guides the user through the input and optimization segments, totally eliminates the chore of manually structuring the model matrix aides in eliminating errors, and allows use by planners without skill in mathematical programming.</jats:p>",

Water resources available to support geothermal enerfy development are imprted Colorado River water, agricultural waste waters, Salton Sea water, and groundwater. In addtion, geothermal power plants can produce their own cooling water from steam condensate. Nevertheless, the relatively high water requirements of geothermal facilities along with a series of real and potential constraints may cause water supply dilemmas involving both the acquistion and use of cooling water. Important constraints are institutional policies, water supply costs, technical problems, and impacts upon the Salton Sea. These constranits and related dilemmas are examined in light of relevanty information on the valley's water resources, geothermal resources and energy technologies, cooling water requrements, and water supply options.</jats:p>",
