An apparent Michaelis constant of 43 muM for dihydrobiopterin was obtained, which is 430 times higher than the reported Km for dihydrofolate with this enzyme. The reduction of dihydrobiopterin is thus more susceptible to inhibition by trimethoprim lactate than is the reduction of dihydrofolate. However, intraperitoneal administration of trimethoprim had no significant effect on the hepatic supply of tetrahydrobiopterin in rats.</jats:p>",

Cerebral palsied children were found to have, on an average, retarded intrauterine growth when compared with a normal population. The incidence of bleeding during pregnancy, maternal toxaemia and multiple pregnancies were significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001). The incidence of the prenatal factors in question had remained unchanged through the years 1954‐70. An additive interplay between factors of FDS and asphyxia/cerebral haemorrhage was revealed. As a whole the findings support the conclusion that FDS plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cerebral palsy today, particularly among the multihandkapped.</jats:p>",
