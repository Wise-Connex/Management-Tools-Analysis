It seems somehow an appropriate topic since the theme of this conference is \"Energy Frontiers\".</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We in Canada are very optimistic about our future energy potential. We are one of the few industrialized countries which has benefited materially from the increase in real energy prices over the past 10 years. There is some truth in the comment that if OPEC had not existed Canada would have had to invent it. The fact of the matter is that Canada is a country which has a very large resource base and has a very exiciting energy future if energy prices are high but we are energy paupers if energy is cheap and abundant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our energy supplies are high cost compared to the costs of producing oil in the Middle East and if cheap energy prices, such as prevailed over the 1950's and 1960's, continued through the 1970's or 1980's much of our energy resource base would not be economic: this is true with a vengeance in terms of our future energy supplies which are typically at either a geographic or a cost or a technical frontier. So why are we optimistic? Why do we consider that we have an important role to play in the energy future of our continent? The answer, in large measure, lies in the fact that, as a country, we have barely begun to tap our frontier resource base; because recent trends in exploration in our conventional areas of exploration and production in Western Canada suggest a much larger potential than even the optimists would have suggested 3–5 years ago and because we know that the era of cheap energy is over.</jats:p>",

The only solution is to find underground waters unattractive for any other possible use. In the selection of water sources, oil exploration is a big chance for underground aquifer surveys and knowledge. This paper shows how it has been used in defining the best way to provide the oil industry water needs and in evaluating possible interferences with other uses such as regional agricultural development plans.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>First geological studies from oil exploration or development wells allowed to reach a good definition of aquifer extensions and thicknesses. Then water well tests first led to a good knowledge of hydrogeo-logical characteristics. Finally, mathematical models were specially built to define the aquifer delivera-bilities, the best water well schemes and the regional consequences on water levels.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Combined use of the two deep aquifers, confined turonian aquifer at an average of 850 meters below ground level with very salty water and artesian albian-barremian aquifer at an average depth of 1400 meters below ground level with fresh water, has been shown necessary to satisfy oil injection water needs and local industrial and domestrical water consumption that together will reach about 1 m /s during the next ten years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The uptake and distribution of copper was examined in perennial ryegrass and white clover when these were grown in flowing solution culture with a controlled supply of copper at 0.025 mg litre<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (0.4 μM). Although the concentration of copper in the shoots of white clover was greater than that in those of ryegrass, there was no difference between the two species in (i) absorption per unit of root or (ii) the transport of copper from roots to shoots. Differences in the growth patterns of the two plants may be responsible for differences in copper concentration in their dry matter. The proportion of the shoot's copper that was associated with cell walls fell, during growth over 33 days, from 23 to 12% in ryegrass and from 35 to 7% in white clover. There was some indication that terminating the supply of phosphate to the plants (which did not affect absorption by roots or transport to shoots) may have increased the degree of association of copper with the cell walls of the shoots.</jats:p>",
