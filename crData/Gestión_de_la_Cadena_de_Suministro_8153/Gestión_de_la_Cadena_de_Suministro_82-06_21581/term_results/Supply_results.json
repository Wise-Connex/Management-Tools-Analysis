Non settlement le Canada est-il devenu de plus en plus dépendant de ses importations de pétrole brut, mais sa dépendance vis-à-vis des pays du Moyen-Orient s'est accrue de manière significative. Cet article tend à prouver que la dépendance du Canada va s'amplifier, du moins à moyen terme et que les fournisseurs du Moyen-Orient (et plus spécifiquement les Etats du golfe persique comme l'Arabie Saoudite) vont continuer à fournir un part de plus en plus grande de notre pétrole brut, à moins que le Canada ne cherche à diversifier ses sources d'approvisionnement. L'alternative la plus probable d'importation de pétrole brut semble être le Mexique. C'est pourquoi cet article cherche à evaluer le potentiel des champs pétrolifères mexicains, au cours de cette décennie, et étudie lesfacteurs qui peuvent inftuencer la politique d'exportation pétrolière de ce pays. L'étude louche aussi la capacité de production et la politique d'exportation du Vénezuéla qui, croit-on, dans les prochaines années, ne sera pas en mesure d'exporter d'aussi grandes quantités de pétrole brut au Canada qu'il ne le fait présentement.</jats:p>",

After a certain period half of the plants were transferred from low to high or high to low nutrients, yielding the 100%/2% and the 2%/100% treatments. The kinetics of nitrate uptake in the range of system I of the five species grown under the different nutrient conditions were measured during a three week experimental period. The nitrate uptake of all the species showed the characteristic features of Michaelis‐Menten kinetics. Under low nutrient conditions the apparent V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> of <jats:italic>U. dioica</jats:italic> expressed per g dry root was lower than under high nutrient conditions. For <jats:italic>H. radicata</jats:italic> ssp. <jats:italic>radicata</jats:italic> and for <jats:italic>H. radicata</jats:italic> ssp. <jats:italic>ericetorum</jats:italic> the reverse was found. The V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> values of <jats:italic>P. major</jats:italic> ssp. <jats:italic>major</jats:italic> were almost the same for the two treatments. The apparent V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> in young plants of <jats:italic>P. lanceolata</jats:italic> was higher in the 100% treatment than in 2%; whereas the reverse was found in mature plants. The results are explained in relation to the relative growth rate, the shoot to root ratio and the natural environment of the species. The apparent K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> values were not influenced by the different treatments. Differences in K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> between the species, if any, were very small. It is suggested that the V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> is a more important parameter for the distribution of plant species in the field than the K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub>. The rate of nitrogen accumulation was calculated from growth data and the contents of nitrate and reduced nitrogen. It is concluded that the V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> of system I for nitrate uptake in most cases was sufficient to explain the observed growth rates.</jats:p>",

Young rats were made severely iron deficient by a diet containing 2 mg iron/kg. Control animals received the same diet but with 50 mg iron/kg. Blood hemoglobin was decreased to 3.6 +/- 0.5 g/dl compared to 13.7 +/- 0.6 in control animals. The combination of decreased mitochondrial enzyme specific activities and a 30% reduction in the mitochondrial content of muscle resulted in 60-85% decreases in muscle oxidative capacities. VO2 max and VO2 max work load were both 50% lower in deficient rats, whereas endurance capacity was 90% lower in deficient animals than controls. The iron sufficient control diet was then given to deficient rats and the course of dietary repletion followed. Hemoglobin increased substantially within 3 days in parallel with VO2 max and VO2 max work load. No significant improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, mitochondrial content of muscle, muscle oxidative capacity, or endurance capacity occurred until the 5th day. We conclude that VO2 max and VO2 max work load capacity were not limited by muscle oxidative capacity. Conversely, endurance capacity was not restricted by oxygen supply, but was primarily determined by the oxidative capacity of muscle.</jats:p>",
