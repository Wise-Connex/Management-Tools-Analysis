      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Trust is a critical factor fostering commitment among supply chain partners. The presence of trust improves measurably the chance of successful supply chain performance. A lack of trust among supply chain partners often results in inefficient and ineffective performance as the transaction costs (verification, inspections and certifications of their trading partners) mount. Although the literature often mentions a relationship between trust and commitment, there is a lack of empirical testing of such relationship in the supply context. This study attempts to fill the gap between the theoretical argument and empirical testing. Results using a comprehensive survey of supply chain practitioners indicate that a firm's trust in its supply chain partner is highly associated with both sides' specific asset investments (positively) and behavioral uncertainty (negatively). It is also found that information sharing reduces the level of behavioral uncertainty, which, in turn, improves the level of trust. A partner's reputation in the market has a strong positive impact on the trust‐building process, whereas a partner's perceived conflict creates a strong negative impact on trust. Finally, the level of commitment is strongly related to the level of trust. Policy implications are discussed.</jats:p>",

The current research was undertaken to determine the nature and direction of the predicted changes in energy sourcing behavior. Based on detailed interviews with managers, government officials, and lobbyists, the risks and rewards associated with recent events in deregulation are examined and analyzed. Next, a detailed process for developing and implementing an energy sourcing strategy for commercial businesses that considers these risks and rewards of alternative energy sourcing channels is developed. This is followed by a process that involves aggregating data, obtaining support, defining risk tolerance, and spending parameters that involved stake‐holders, evaluating proposals, executing the strategy and monitoring it overtime. Finally, insights into the future trends in deregulated energy markets are described. Results suggest that a focused approach to developing detailed supply market intelligence can assist sourcing managers in preparing for the deregulated era and achieve significant cost savings in energy spending.</jats:p>",

As with demand, there may seem to be a problem in maintaining that it is possible for people to supply esteem in this way. After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem. And I can do this without self-defeat so far as I can hide my motives or, more plausibly, can do so in a virtually but not actually strategic way: I give my attention, testimony or association quite spontaneously but will be led to think again if it fails to secure suitable reciprocation.</jats:p>",

It is suggested that taking a broad perspective of the demand chain as all those processes in the firm which interact with and translate customer requirements throws a new light on how a firm's value chain operates as a whole. Looking at some retail examples, including McDonald's in particular, it is argued that managing the interaction of a firm's supply chain and its demand chain is critical to the effectiveness of that entities business model. This interaction involves a fusion of processes in what is termed a Value Catalyst. This catalysis effect involves interaction costs and tension as processes continually bundle and unbundled. It is argued that while the deliberate creation and purposeful management of tension may seem odd, it in fact accords with day‐to‐day management reality and is a potential source of dynamism within the firm.</jats:p>",

These questions presume a demand for liquidity, where liquidity refers to the availability of instruments (market and nonmarket) that can be used to transfer wealth across periods.1 Part of this demand will, of course, come from consumers who want to implement their optimal intertemporal consumption plans. Indeed, papers that have addressed the sufficiency of liquidity have typically focused on the consumer sector (see Section V).</jats:p>",

They should.\nFood safety laws are an integral part of the domestic food supply and have been for most of this century. The attack on America on September 11, 2001 forced government officials, producers, and consumers to seek out and bolster any potential weak spots in national security. The domestic food supply is one such area of concern. The recent passage of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 validates the concern that the food supply is at risk for possible terrorist activity. While the terrorist aspect of food safety regulation is most prominent, another more pervasive area of concern gaining regulatory attention is biological, not necessarily terrorist, activity. This Comment explores current food safety laws and practices and suggests that more consistent safety protocol throughout every link in the \"farm-to-table\" chain could bolster the integrity of the domestic food supply in the post-September 11th environment against both intentional and negligent harm risks.</jats:p>",

Trends affecting both the supply and requirements of child health physicians call into question earlier assessments about the adequacy of the general pediatric workforce. To understand the effects of these trends over time, we developed a model that projects the national supply of practicing general pediatricians over a 20-year period (2000–2020).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Design. The model incorporates current data on the practicing pediatrician workforce in the United States, pediatric residency graduates entering general pediatrics, and gender- and age-specific measures of productivity and of retirement or death. In addition, it accounts for projected changes in the size and ethnicity of the child population and the proportion of children currently receiving outpatient care from family practitioners.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Main Outcome Measures. Time trend of the supply of general pediatricians and the number of children in the population per practicing pediatrician.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results. The baseline model projects that the number of general pediatricians will expand by nearly 25 000 by the year 2020, a 64% increase from the year 2000, whereas the child population is projected to expand by only 9%. The increase was robust to sensitivity analyses measuring the impact of each of the model’s variables on the future supply of pediatricians. In all probable scenarios, the general pediatrician workforce will expand significantly more rapidly than the child population. In addition, the trend in pediatrics is in marked contrast to the other primary care specialties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions. Despite a number of factors that might attenuate the growth of the general pediatrician workforce, none seems sufficient to slow its expansion in relation to the pediatric population. To maintain practice volumes comparable to today, pediatricians of the future may need to provide expanded services to the children currently under their care, expand their patient population to include young adults, and/or compete for a greater share of children currently cared for by nonpediatricians.</jats:p>",

Its competitiveness with foreign spice peppers is ensured by its high biological value deriving from the specially Hungarian production and processing technology. Besides the traditional and highly manual labour intensive processing technology, there are some modern industrial technologies as well, where high quality can be guaranteed only by producing excellent base material (raw pepper pods). This is the reason which necessitates the rational development of the elements of the production technology, such as nutrient supply. Our objective was to offer a contribution to this aim by our trials in plant nutrition.&#x0D;\nExperiments on the nutrient supply of spice pepper were set up in the 2003 growing season in order to decide whether yields and fruit composition parameters of pepper could be increased by means of increased K fertiliser doses with lower N:K ratios. Several forms of potassium were used, as well as applying microelement top dressings in the single treatments. It was found that the increase of N:K ratio from I:1 to 1:6 did not increase yields, but resulted in higher pigment and dry matter content. Microelement top dressing had a yield increasing effect at each N:K ratio. Higher potassium doses did not accelerate ripening.</jats:p>"

It adds that international interconnections — international gas pipelines and electricity lines — are vital. It explains that from the perspective of the continuity and regularity of electricity supply, some regulatory reforms are needed, and some are already being implemented by the government, in order to avoid further blackouts like those which took place on December 17, 2001.</jats:p>",

It focuses on the hydropower and gas sectors. It notes that these sectors have followed parallel developments as regards market liberalization. It adds that both sectors have been liberalized pursuant to the EC Directives on the internal energy market. It explains that these sectors have also been subject to national reforms which go further than the derivatives. It clarifies that the security of supply does not depend on one, but several, markets. It notes that an overall perspective of the different markets is required. It distinguishes between commodity markets, resource markets, and transportation markets.</jats:p>",

The biggest obstacle for a greater use of renewable energies and in particular biofuels is their high production costs as compared to conventional energies. Therefore the EU has established different specific measures to promote their use and to overcome the high production costs. This article gives an insight into today's main legislative instruments, namely the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection, the Directive on the promotion of biofuels and various taxation measures, among which is, most recently, the new Council Directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity.</jats:p>",

It explains that this concept includes not only physical and technical security in terms of access to resources, but also reliability, affordability, and continuity of supply. It argues that despite or even because of market integration, security of supply concerns remain paramount. It adds that as a result of legislative harmonisation, in particular following the entry into force of the new Electricity and Gas Directives, it may well be that member states will be required to pursue their energy policy objectives in relation to supply security and reliability through specific kinds of instrument. It examines the issue of the division of competences between the Community policy initiatives in the energy sector, which have a close bearing on security of supply, and discusses recent legislative measures.</jats:p>",

It adds that whereas the government traditionally focused on the security of oil supply, the energy liberalization process has led to an increasing interest in the security of gas and electricity supply, as well as the reliability of energy supply. It notes that one of the most important issues is the need to continue a reasonable level of investment in production facilities and energy networks. It explains that although the use of renewable resources is promoted, their inflexible nature means that wind and solar will never constitute a complete alternative for traditional primary sources like oil and gas. It examines the structure of the Dutch gas and electricity sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mechanisms supplying nitrogen (N) to phytoplankton, and thus constraining the levels of export production, over the oligotrophic subtropical Atlantic are assessed along a meridional transect. Stable nitrogen isotope signals reveal a localized region of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation over the northern subtropical gyre. Elsewhere, particulate organic nitrogen was isotopically enriched and there was no widespread evidence of a trophic bias. Thus phytoplankton are utilizing an enriched source of N along the transect through much of the oligotrophic Atlantic, which may reflect utilization of nitrate from the deep ocean or, possibly, a supply of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from a non‐N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixing source. While there is a significant supply of DON over the subtropical gyres, reaching 0.15 mol Nm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, less than 10% of the DON is semilabile and thus only implies a relatively small contribution to the nitrogen supply required for export production. Over the central part of the subtropical gyres, the supply of N to phytoplankton is probably from nitrate in the underlying thermocline, possibly from convection and diapycnic transfer, or more likely, from finescale upwelling by mesoscale eddies and frontal circulations. The lateral supply of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) appears to be a factor of 2–3 times more important than the lateral supply of semilabile DON, and thus might play a role in contributing to the phosphorus (P) supply for phytoplankton. The lateral supply of DON and DOP might also be important in closing the N and P budgets over the North Atlantic.</jats:p>",

DG facilities are now connected at sites that were originally not meant to connect a large number of power generation facilities. This can increase the burden on the distribution network in terms of stability and power quality. At the same time existing network regulation does not enable a proper valuation of costs and benefits. Two European research projects aim to tackle these issues from a both technical and socio-economic viewpoint. The conclusion is that to facilitate a major increase of the DG share in electricity supply systems, a proper allocation of costs and benefits between different functions in the electricity system (generation, trade, transmission / distribution, consumption) will be necessary. </jats:p>",

Die zweite Methode reduziert instationäre Fehler. Bei Lastsprüngen bildet sich im Ansaugtrakt ein flüssiger Treibstoffwandfilm, was zu einer Abmagerung des Gemisches führt. Um diesen Effekt zu korrigieren, wird eine Zusatzmasse eingespritzt, welche durch ein diskretes Filter berechnet wird. Das Hauptproblem war, einen praxisgerechten und robusten Weg zu finden, um die Filterparameter ausgehend von den verfügbaren λ-Messungen zu adaptieren. Die Leistungsfähigkeit der präsentierten Methoden, gemeinsam mit den entsprechenden Adaptionsalgorithmen, wird anhand von Simulationen mit einem physikalischen Modell eines Ottomotors gezeigt. Die Methoden erreichen in allen Arbeitspunkten des Motors λ-Abweichungen von weniger als einem Prozent.</jats:p>",

In addition, both economics students and teachers have failed to recognize the crucial importance of the reserves‐to production ratio, as well as the research of M. King Hubbert.

Food security now must be considered a priority issue. The food industry is adjusting its security and safety systems to add focus to the intentional, widespread contamination of the food supply. Food security and food safety share the common goal of “prevention to protect” regardless of whether the threat/risk is intentional or accidental. However, the disciplines and expertise required for security and safety are not one and the same—nor are the methods, procedures, or thought processes. The goal of the National Food Processors Association is to assist the industry in organizing and conducting appropriately tailored food security assessments. Information “primers” on security in general and food security in particular will be presented to assist in the clarification and understanding of these concepts. Actions taken to date as well as future activities to deal with food security will also be presented. In all of these activities, there must be a clear recognition that government, academia, public health, industry, media, and consumers need to continue to work together to enhance food security.</jats:p>",

Existing conceptual research relating to interorganizational relationships and networks is reviewed in terms of its relevance to understanding supply networks; this research is drawn from the fields of strategic management, channel management, industrial marketing and purchasing, organizational behaviour and supply‐chain management. The different perspectives each field has on networks are highlighted. Contributions made by each in assisting to understand supply networks are discussed and synthesized. Findings from an exploratory survey are used to structure the design of a conceptual model for analysing the processes involved in the creation and operation of supply networks. The authors identify nine different types of networking activities and discuss the nature of these activities in the context of supply. Four different types of contextual factors relating to supply networks are identified. The model is tested in eight in‐depth case studies and a validating survey of 58 focal firm networks. It is concluded that it provides a robust structure that enabled complex, cross‐case analysis of multi‐variable, multi‐disciplinary data from interorganization product/service supply networks, but that further testing by other researchers is required.</jats:p>",

Reforms within the sector will necessarily take account of the implications of this plague within national, provincial and local contexts. This article is based on several assumptions. The first is that HIV/AIDS is not only a medical problem: the spread of the disease has created a pandemic with social, economic, geopolitical and other consequences for all countries. Second, increasing numbers of countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, are now facing one of the great crises of human history. The third is that other countries in Eastern Europe and the Asia and Pacific regions will confront similar challenges as the pandemic spreads. The article focuses specifically on the relationship between HIV/AIDS and education in countries with different levels of HIV/AIDS prevalence. It concentrates on the impact of the disease on education at schools level, with some attention to teacher education. It outlines our current understanding of the pandemic, analyses current and anticipated impact of HIV/AIDS on education in order to clarify probable changes in demand for and supply of education services, and looks at education's current responses to HIV/AIDS, principally in high prevalence countries. </jats:p>",

C. Ag., a species whose recruitment has often been considered to be dispersal limited. Sparse colonization on SCAR by adult <jats:italic>Macrocystis</jats:italic> occurred within 6 months after reef construction via drifters (i.e. individuals from neighboring kelp beds that became dislodged and set adrift). The abundance of drifters on SCAR declined exponentially with distance from the nearest source population (San Mateo), suggesting that San Mateo was the likely source of drifters. Dense recruitment of small <jats:italic>Macrocystis</jats:italic> sporophytes was observed within 8 months of reef construction. The density of recruits on SCAR showed an initial increase with distance from San Mateo before declining exponentially. Nonetheless, substantial recruitment was observed at the most distant locations on SCAR located 3.5 km from San Mateo. In contrast to drifters, the density of recruits was positively correlated to the bottom cover of artificial reef substrate. Importantly, no correlation was found between the local density or fecundity of drifters and the local density of kelp recruits suggesting that recruitment on SCAR resulted from widespread spore dispersal rather than from the local dispersal of spores from drifters.</jats:p>",

One hundred and thirty seven cases and 388 controls were enrolled in the case-control study. In multivariate analysis, drinking unboiled water from the municipal supply was significantly associated with illness (odds ratio 11.1, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 90.2).<jats:italic>C jejuni</jats:italic>was isolated from one tap water sample. The water isolate and all but one of the patient isolates were indistinguishable by PFGE.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold>Combining epidemiological investigation with molecular subtyping methods provided strong evidence that water was the source of the outbreak. Non-chlorinated small ground water systems may be susceptible to waterborne outbreaks and constitute a risk to rural populations.</jats:p>",
