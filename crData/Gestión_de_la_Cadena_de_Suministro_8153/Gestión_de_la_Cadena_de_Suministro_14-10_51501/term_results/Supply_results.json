      "abstract": "<p>This exploratory qualitative study is aimed at depicting communication support to Supply Chain (SC) management, emphasizing how relationships and processes are affected by communication flows. It provides a preliminary comprehensive communication mapping, highlighting key stakeholders involved in SC management, communication roles enhancing logistics performances, and channels supporting information and physical flows among partners. It is based on a literature review, multidisciplinary academic meetings, interviews with SC directors of two global companies operating in a reputation-sensitive environment, and desk analysis of companies' documental flows. Findings reveal that communication accomplishes four basic functions: 1) it helps embedding and spreading cultural values along internal SC units; 2) it supports conflict resolution and compensation among different managerial logics; 3) it encourages development and maintenance of relationships with SC partners; 4) it enhances the fine-tuning among SC phases and activities, supporting alignment and integration of procedures and routines. Finally, the study points out that communication is typically face-to-face when it has to support the strategic SC phases, whereas it is typically computer-mediated when supporting SC operational phases.</p>",

As firms move toward global sourcing, supply chain risk increases dramatically, which is linked to lower financial performance and market value. One major type of supply chain risk is disruptions caused by natural or man-made disasters. In this paper, major factors causing supply chain disruptions are identified based on resource dependency theory and contingency theory. As a result of the study, a comprehensive supply chain risk index for natural disasters is proposed by including two major factors (i.e. location and single source). Actions are suggested for supply chain managers to lower disruption risks within a supply chain when they use the risk index as a measure.</p>",

The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology that quantifies the impact of a risk mitigation strategy widely employed in commercial SCs, namely emergency sourcing (ES), on the performance of humanitarian SCs taking into account backorders’ clearance time, unsatisfied demand, and cost. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Discrete event simulation is employed in order to evaluate alternative ES strategies based on a total cost criterion, which incorporates inventory-related costs, as well as premium contract costs paid for emergency replenishment. Backorders’ clearance time and time-to-recovery are also employed as a design parameters. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The results document the significant impact of disruptions on expected total cost, and the beneficial role of ES in hedging against disruptions. To that end, the proposed methodology determines the optimal emergency contracted capacity for a given premium, or alternatively the maximum premium cost value that ensures the feasibility of the implemented ES strategy in the long-run, along with the associated cost and time savings, and reduction of the unsatisfied demand. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The fundamental objective is to provide a decision-making support methodology for deciding on whether to implement an ES strategy or not in humanitarian SCs, and the level of the optimal contracted reserved capacity.

These suggest gloomy implications for sustainable disaster management, humanitarian services and supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the energetic evaluation of buildings, the solutions for optimal heat supply are a problem of current interest. The topicality of this problem is underlined by the European Union requirements for reducing the energetic demands of buildings by the year 2020.From the operational point of view, most of the heating systems seem to be optimal; however, with the use of the results of this detailed analysis it is possible to make even further improvement. The objective is not to supply more heat energy than necessary in order to achieve energy saving. This reduction of heat supply can be achieved by the use of the heat accumulation potential of the building by means of appropriately chosen heating mode. By operation modes are meant a mode with constant heating and a mode with interrupted heating.In this sample case of non-stationary simulation during the interrupted heating regime it is possible to demonstrate the potential saving achieved by the chosen interrupted heating mode. The case study is conducted on a secondary school building. In this project, supported by the specific investigation project on the Faculty of Civil Engineering, I carried out an experiment of an interrupted mode, which was also supported by a theoretical part, in which a non-stationary calculation was used.This contribution suggests the possibility to save energy by optimization of the heat supply. It also presents the difference between a stationary and non-stationary solution to this problem.</jats:p>"

However, few pedagogical exercises facilitate students’ use of a comprehensive set of lean six sigma principles within a supply chain context. We describe the Airplane Supply Chain Simulation that helps students understand how lean six sigma concepts may be leveraged to improve supply chain performance. The basis of this simulation is a four‐tier supply chain, consisting of suppliers (two tiers), a manufacturer, and a customer, that produces three models of paper airplanes to meet randomly distributed customer demand. In the first of three successive runs, a highly structured simulation is executed in which supply chain roles are well defined, material flows are convoluted, and a “push” production strategy is followed. The first simulation as the “current state” and, for the second and third simulation runs, challenge competing student teams to leverage lean six sigma concepts to develop a “future state” that enables the fulfillment of all customer orders at the lowest cost. Results based on statistical analyses of survey response data from 194 MBA students show that the Airplane Supply Chain Simulation is an effective participative, team‐based learning tool.</jats:p>",

First, a reference currents extraction method and an active negative sequence currents injection method for the dead‐beat control are presented to suppress the input harmonic currents and the second harmonic voltage of the DC‐link voltage in the rectifier. Then, active disturbance rejection control is presented to substitute for the PI control, which can improve the transient response and strengthen the antidisturbance ability of the rectifier. Finally, to improve the efficiency of the power supply, two auxiliary inductors are introduced to realise soft switching of the DC/DC converter, which is an idea of taking the rectifier and the DC/DC converter as a whole. The feasibility and superior performances of the presented control methods and topology have been validated by the experimental results.</jats:p>",

However, as this new field of water management – often denoted as ‘Smart Water Network’ (SWN) – is evolving, there are many different vendors, technologies and business models in the market. This diversity overwhelms utilities and leads to excessive piloting of smart solutions, rather than to a general adoption. In order to exploit the full potential of these SWN solutions, standardized components guaranteeing interoperability and clearly defined interfaces as well as proper guidelines for implementing such solutions are needed. We will give a general overview of a SWN, the involved technological components, its interactions, and missing elements that are needed for an interoperable solution. We finish our contribution with a brief description of a structured process for planning SWN architectures.</jats:p>",

To compete and survive in this ever-changing global marketplace, individual companies can hardly survive in isolation of their business partners, suppliers, and other service providers. However, the lack of a seamless interchange and efficient data analysis hinders the formation of an effective information infrastructure that serves as the platform for data interchange of the heterogeneous database systems in the supply chain network. This paper proposed an infrastructure of information system that encompasses data mining and workflow management capability by adopting the advanced technologies of Online Analysis Process (OLAP) and workflow management system to facilitate supply chain management.</jats:p>"

The investigation was not an academic or econometric study; but to identify areas where assistance was required by the foundries, and opportunities for growth. There are both Tier 1 and Tier 2 foundries that are qualified to, and do, supply the automotive sector. Castings, components and sub-assemblies are produced in South Africa for the majority of passenger vehicle manufactures. There has been an increase in volumes supplied by smaller, often Tier 2 &amp; 3 foundries, however, drive train castings are largely imported. Furthermore, there was little evidence of supply contracts for the next model ranges. Local castings were said to be 10% to 30% more expensive than imported parts. Typically, sourcing discussions are made outside of the country, and price and security of supply are main considerations. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s) have committed to local sourcing, but it was clear that a significant intervention was required to change the downward trend. This would be outside the scope of both the Aluminium Federation of South Africa (AFSA) and the NFTN. It was recommended that a Competitive Improvement Initiative (CII) be launched by the NFTN. This was subsequently approved by the NFTN/dti.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

Despite recent advancements made in the theory and practice of facility location decisions, a gap exists in understanding how these decisions are influenced by regional geographies and their respective supply chain capabilities. As economic development agencies recognize the value inherent in location-specific and geographically concentrated supply chain capabilities, this research explores how these affect regional prosperity and economic development. Through a combination of exploratory Delphi panels, web content analysis, and cluster mapping procedures, the research suggests a framework highlighting the potential role of regional supply chain capabilities and public sector strategies on economic development outcomes. Findings indicate that regional geographies are differentially and uniquely qualified to serve as supply chain hubs by capitalizing on these capabilities through actionable public- and private sector interventions. Regional differentiation lies in supply chain elements that are place-luck embedded and as such difficult to acquire, change, or modify.</jats:p>",

In particular, the paper emphasizes an interest in an integrated approach to considering customer service performance in an efficient way. Indeed, information systems as technical support play an essential role in the SCM of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The reasons for pursuing such research can be explained by the fact that the customers are the first concern of any firm that seeks to be competitive. Indeed, the author seeks to answer the following question: Which are the main explaining factors of the customers’ service performance within Alpha SCM? </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A qualitative research methodology is used based on 11 semi-structured interviews with professionals and direct observation as part of a telecommunications network SME in France. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This empirical case study is to delineate the concept dimensions.

These goals can be achieved through automation by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Zigbee wireless communication technologies, which is easily available in the market. Basically RFID technology is used for automatically tracking, locating or identifying the entities. It can easily integrate with low cost low power consumption Xbee (Zigbee) device, which is used to increase the communication range by large number of node deployment. RFID-Xbee network integrates with Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) Graphical User Interface (GUI), which gives real time information of supply chain at single control panel. The integrated communication model proves the near field inductive coupling and can be used in supermarket for item pricing, office automation, security system, and car parking. This system confirms the concept of real-time locating system (RTLS) in an indoor environment. The impact of RFID and Xbee network communication model enhance the read range of RFID reader, so that out of range items can be tracked easily without additional RFID readers. The benefit of this system is to maximize profit, reduce human intervention and minimize waste.</jats:p>"

However, the irrigation of green roofs heavily depends on using precious potable water and consequently generates negative environmental effects. Rainwater has been recommended to address this dilemma, but the design method has not been well developed. In this study, the major design factors of a rainwater harvesting system for green roof irrigation systems are examined, and a simulation-based mathematical model is established to elucidate the correlation between tank volume and system performance. The optimal system design and probability distribution of the potable water replacement rate are also discussed on the basis of a case study of a university building in Keelung, Northern Taiwan. The results show that the optimal tank volume, potable water replacement rate, and probability of exceedance are 9.41 m3, 92.72%, and 88.76% (±1SD), respectively. In addition, the economic performance is identified to be feasible. Hence, the design method has been verified to be a useful tool to ease the urban environmental issues.</jats:p>",

Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. Fast fashion products shorten the valid lifecycle and generate more waste than regular clothing products. Considering the features of fashion products, a system of a rent-based closed-loop supply chain is developed to improve the sustainability of fashion products. The supply chain processes (fashion design and manufacturing, laundry, logistics and disposal), the operations management issues (inventory management, closed-loop logistics, human-clothing matching, booking system and the rental pricing) and the sustainability promotion aspects (customization, responsive system, culture and policy aspects) are investigated by devising sustainable strategies. The rationalities of the developed system and strategies are reviewed and elucidated in detail. The results may contribute to building sustainable closed-loop fashion supply chains, the related information systems and operational and managerial mechanisms.</jats:p>"

With regard to the fact that the reliability is functionally dependent on faults, for the purpose of this study special attention has been given to possible faults on the heavy fuel oil supply pump of a two-stroke marine diesel engine MAN B&amp;W 5L90MC. A deductive approach to reliability analysis, i.e. fault tree analysis method (FTA), has been used. By the use of this method it is simpler to identify the system’s weak link and it is shown that the method gives the basis for the ship’s system reliability analysis. Based on FTA analysis this paper suggests system parameters that require continuous monitoring in order to achieve reliability. The results show the behavior of the components in case of faults and this approach can help to create a plan of action in order to enforce timely corrective and preventive action and, accordingly, increase the rate of reliability of the entire ship’s systems.</jats:p>"

In this investigation, data is collected from one system that permits extensible information sharing (i.e., information sharing beyond immediate, first-tier supply chain participants) to empirically investigate the determinants of extensible information sharing. The goal of this study is to identify specific actions that promote extensible information sharing. It uses hierarchical regression analysis to examine the contribution of these actions, after controlling for certain dyadic information sharing and industry practices. According to the results, companies that pursue real-time integration of the supply chain and are willing to change the roles and responsibilities of their employees engage in extensible information sharing. Surprisingly, it is found that companies that have a long-term relationship with immediate supply chain participants are less likely to expand their information sharing beyond dyadic information sharing, perhaps because of a perception that their information needs are adequately met.</p>",

The system is mainly composed of PROFINET network, monitor, controller, and integrated protector with PROFINET IO interface circuit. The system achieves protection and power monitoring network integration, completes the selectivity of short circuit protection, and can determine fault position quickly. Thus the troubleshooting time is cut and reliability of power supply network is improved.

To evaluate and improve the levels of supply chain agility, a model called Total Agile Design System (TADS) is proposed. TADS as a methodology identifies supply chain enablers and prioritize them in order to achieve supply chain agility. In this scoring model, agility index before and after implementation of TADS are measured and discussed. The results validate the proposed model and lend evidence to the current thinking of impinging on agile concepts in traditional supply chains for competitive advantage and survival.</jats:p>"

The study has been made on backward division of Uttar Pradesh named Jhansi division. Division comprises three districts: Jhansi, Lalitpur and Jalaun on the basis of secondary and primary information. The secondary information is collected for area, production, productivity, arrival and market prices of tomato, brinjal, potato, onion, okra, bottle gourd, torai and cauliflower in Jhansi, Lalitpur and Jalaun districts of Jhansi division. The primary information has been collected from Lalitpur district. There are six blocks in Lalitpur district of Uttar Pradesh (UP) viz. Bar, Birdha, Jakhoura, Madavra, Mahroni, and Talbehat. Two stage stratified random sampling method has been adopted to collect the information from vegetables growers of three blocks i.e., Mahroni, Birdha and Jakhoura. Total 114 vegetables growers categorized marginal (up to 2.5 acre land), small (&gt; 2.5 acre land to 5 acre land) and Large (&gt; 5 acre land) farmers, 22 middlemen (aadatiya) and 20 retailers have chosen to complete the present study.&#x0D;\nIn the selected study area vegetables growers were not grading their produce. They picked vegetables from field and make bora bandi to carry in mandi. On the other hand the middlemen and retailers were grading the purchased vegetables for earning maximum profit. Preferred transportation modes were tractors, buses and taxies. But for retail selling cycle and haththela were mostly used. Vegetables growers did not store vegetables in home and warehouse. In Lalitpur district tomato production was highest in 2009-10, it was 2821 metric ton (MT). It was due to rise in area. Lalitpur and Jhansi districts have potential to increase the productivity of tomato through better governmental support. Percent Growth Rates (PGR) informed regarding percentage change in present year compare to previous year. The total arrival indicated presence of vegetables in the different vegetable mandies and arrival index presented vegetables consistent presence in the mandies i.e., higher the index higher amount of quantity arrived in the mandies. Under the marketing chain management the channel II was found most favored channel in the study area as maximum (about 90%) quantity of produce was sold through this channel by small and large farmers. Though channel I was mostly liked by marginal farmers.&#x0D;\nMiddlemen purchased vegetables at 6 percent commission on per quintal basis from producers and sold to retailer by charging 3 percent mandishulk on per quintal basis. In Jakhoura block all the selected farm size categories and in Birdha block small and large farm size categories were sold their cent percent vegetables produce to middlemen. Middlemen also provide space to keep their produce and stay at night for farmers in mandi. At some occasions middlemen also provide credits to farmers for fulfilling their agricultural and family daily needs.</jats:p>"

The Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) approach was used to develop a structural framework for the SRMP. An extensive literature followed by discussion with managers in different Indian Automobile companies was completed to identify the strategic enablers for the SRMP. Thirteen strategic enablers were identified and classified into four categories. An Indian Automobile manufacturing company was selected as a case study participant to serve as an authentic practice-based example of the model. The SRMP enablers and the SS factors were applied to the case study organization and analyzed. The significance of this study was that the SRMP enablers and SS factors assist managers to set priorities for decision making purposes. This allows supply chain managers to take proactive steps in order to reduce risk and improve the performance of the organization in the early SRMP stages.</p>",

This paper focuses on the role of green roofs (GR), rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater reuse and their integration at the building level. A number of models were developed to simulate these systems, and provide design curves able to simultaneously minimise both total runoff volumes and the amount of potable water used in the building (for irrigation and toilet flushing). The models developed were applied to the design of stormwater infrastructure for the building of the National Gallery, in Athens, Greece. A sensitivity analysis of various model parameters was conducted, with results suggesting, inter alia: (i) a significant decrease of total runoff volumes for rainfalls of medium-to-small return periods; (ii) a significant influence of the plant factor on water requirements (with implications for selecting vegetation for GR in a Mediterranean climate); and (iii) a significant impact of latent heat peaking during the months of June and July. The trade-off, on runoff volumes, between percentage of green roof area and the dimensions of the water storage tank was also investigated. The results suggest that the most preferable solution for conserving potable water was RWH combined with greywater recycling, while for runoff minimisation the best option was the combination of green roof and greywater recycling.</jats:p>",

We sampled in places where water enters below ground and where water emerges back to the surface in springs and is used as drinking water by the local communities. Water samples were used to assess the degree of chemical and microbiological pollution. Although the water in the ten HKS was rather clean, a general decrease in the concentration of most chemical compounds was observed along the flow path, regardless of the number of tributaries the underground stream receives. Dilution caused by tributaries could not account for the decrease in the concentration of most compounds. The contribution of other chemical immobilization processes, such as retention of pollution in the subsurface or sorption to sediment particles was suggested, in combination with the activity of microorganisms. The bacteria diversity is complex and decreases from upstream to downstream locations due to dilution with water provided by tributaries or retention of bacteria in the subsurface by adhesion to substrates. We suggest that karst can have a significant potential for natural attenuation by retaining the pollution underground, in combination with biodegradation performed by microorganisms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growth as one of the key preconditions to survive in the market is forcing companies to compete on international markets and at the same time defend domestic market share from international competitors. The result of that is increased complexity of supply chains, pressure to decrease cost and improve service level. To cope with the complexity and increased customer requirements, active management of the supply chain is a prerequisite. As supply chain is a network of three or more entities directly involved in the upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finance and information from a source to a customer, management of it is a complex task.&#x0D;\nThere is significant evidence from literature that the effective implementation of integrated supply chain management (SCM) has the potential to generate significant improvements in the performance of firms. The higher levels of SCM practice can lead to enhanced competitive advantage and improved organizational performance. In order to achieve efficient supply chain integration for the processes or activities; the organizations should recognize and understand all the integration challenges of supply chain.&#x0D;\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate previous research studying the relationship between supply chain integration and performance and understand the importance of supply chain integration for competitive position of organization. Address the challenges encountered in integration of supply chain. Propose a conceptual frame work to reap the potential benefits of effective supply chain integration.</jats:p>"

The objective of the study is to empirically investigate the impact of supply chain management on corporate success in cement industry.  The study operational zed  SCM (i.e. independent variable into three dimension; SCM planning; coordination and control variability and corporate success (i.e. dependent variable) as customers’ satisfaction, employees’ satisfaction and profitability.  A sample size of one hundred and eighty (180) were drawn from nine (9) cement companies and thirty six (36) cement dealers across the six state in south-south zone, using a combination of stratified and simple random sampling technique.  Data were collected from the respondents with structured questionnaire and data collected were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and inferential statistic (i.e. multiple ordinary lest square regression) with the aid of SPSS 17 at 0.05 level of significance. The result showed that all the cement companies and the dealers in the industry are involved in SCM activities in one way or the other.  It was also found that, those with strong and effective SCM capability tend to achieve high rate of corporate success than their competitors. The customers wish to purchase new items or repurchase is an indication of customers’ satisfaction due to effective and efficient SCM.  Increase productivity, commitment, team work, reduce turnover rate, trust, lower absenteeism to achieve set objective is an indication of employees’ satisfaction due to the impact of SCM. The customers’ satisfaction results to high demand of their product and increase profitability of the firm. The study found that ,SC control variability outcome is as good as the data system due to the fact that the right information get to the right person at the right time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we address the problem of choosing an appropriate channel for the marketing channel structure of remanufactured fashion products. To be specific, we consider a remanufacturer who has two options for selling the products: (1) provide the remanufactured products to a manufacturer, then the manufacturer sells both new products and the remanufactured products to customers, and (2) sell the remanufactured products directly to customers. Because of the relatively low acceptance of remanufactured products and environment consciousness of customers in developing countries like China, we model the two scenarios as decentralized remanufacturing supply chains, with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and the government offering subsidy to the remanufacturer to incentivize remanufacturing activities. We find that the subsidy can incentivize remanufacturing activity regardless of the remanufacturer’s channel choice. A “too high” or “too low” subsidy makes the remanufacturer compete with the manufacturer, and an intermediate subsidy results in cooperation between the two members of the remanufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, if the customers’ acceptance for remanufactured products is higher, the remanufacturer will be more likely to compete with the manufacturer. However, the remanufacturer’s optimal channel choice may be inefficient in the sense of social welfare and environmental protection.</jats:p>"

The assembly line is multiproduct type (are assembled 2 types of products that resemble as configuration and technology) and it has 5 workstations with mainly manual activities, that are supplied with parts using a synchronous method. The performance indicators considered were: average work in process, cost per unit, systems reactivity to client demand and throughput, their values being obtained by simulating the functioning of the assembly line in different experimental conditions, determined by the variation of the above mentioned parameters, using ARENA software. The synthesis of the results and their interpretation allow the process managers to take adequate decisions depending on targeted objectives.</jats:p>"

Three cases and 10 scenarios are applied and reviewed to determine the most appropriate WQAM. The three cases are: (1) the area size allocation of sub-watersheds, (2) the watershed imperviousness ratio, and (3) the combination of the area size and imperviousness ratio. The 10 scenarios are: (1) impervious, (2) impervious + pervious, (3) impervious + rainfall, (4) impervious + slope, (5) impervious + rainfall + slope, (6) slope, (7) land usage, (8) land usage + rainfall, (9) land usage + slope, and (10) land usage + rainfall + slope. The best WQAMs are subsequently developed from the generated equations using statistics (R2, Adjusted R2, F-test, the Akaike information criterion and the Shapiro–Wilk test). In addition, the WQAM is verified using the Geum-Sum-Young River watershed. The percentage differences of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (T-N), and total phosphorus (T-P) are 31.66%, 8.08%, and 48.94%, respectively. The developed WQAM can be used in place of complex watershed modeling and to aid in the determination of the best restoration locations.</jats:p>",

Precast supply chain phases are classified as: planning, design, manufacturing, transportation, installation and construction. Achieving integrated construction requires the parties within the precast supply chain phases to have efficient communication and effective collaboration to deliver proper and up-to-date information. The aim of this research is to explore cloud computing technology as the construction collaboration tool and to propose the cloud system architecture for precast supply chain management. The findings in this research are based on a comprehensive review of supply chain management, cloud computing and the precast industry. Findings illustrate that the major obstacles to precast construction are: poor planning and scheduling, less flexibility in design, production lead time, heavy precast components and poor on-site coordination. These obstacles could contribute to the negative consequences for the efficiency and effectiveness of precast project delivery. Therefore, cloud computing technology has valuable potential to mitigate these obstacles and deliver an effective collaboration system within the precast construction industry. </jats:p>"

It includes a Global Input Output (IO) model derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project, a Worker Hours Model constructed using annual wage payments and wage rates by country and sector, and Social Theme Tables covering 22 themes within five Social Impact Categories—Labor Rights and Decent Work, Health and Safety, Human Rights, Governance and Community Impacts. The data tables identify social risks for over 100 indicators. Both the ranking of worker hour intensity and the risk levels across multiple social themes for the Country Specific Sectors (CSS) within a product category supply chain are used to calculate Social Hotspots Indexes (SHI) using an additive weighting method. The CSS with the highest SHI are highlighted as social hotspots within the supply chain of the product in question. This system was tested in seven case studies in 2011. In order to further limit the number of hotspots, a set of prioritization rules was applied. This paper will review the method implemented to study the social hotspots of the 100 product categories and provide one detailed example. Limitations of the approach and recommended research avenues will  be outlined.</jats:p>"

The quantitative evidence is strong for some components of trade costs, but less so for aggregate trade costs. In the second globalisation, international supply chains have become an important element of the global economy, and we have better data to examine the links between trade costs and supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization model needs to call the simulation model to calculate the response under different conditions for many times, and this is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To solve this problem, surrogate models can be used to yield insight into the functional relationship between the design variables and the responses, instead of simulation models in the optimization. In this paper, an integrated optimization method based on adaptive Kriging surrogate models was proposed and applied to the cost optimization of a surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation process for dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). First, the initial samples were created by Latin hypercube sampling, and then the responses corresponding to the initial samples were computed by a simulation model. The initial Kriging model was derived through these samples. Secondly, the adaptive Kriging surrogate model was proposed based on updating initial Kriging with new samples via infill sampling criteria. The results showed that it had improved the accuracy of the surrogate model, and the added samples had provided more information about the simulation model than the common samples. Even with the same number of samples, the adaptive Kriging surrogate model performed better than the common Kriging surrogate model, which was built only once. What's more, the integrated approach not only greatly reduced the computational burden, but also determined the actual optimal DNAPLs remediation strategy.</jats:p>",

Para tanto, foram realizadas entrevistas com especialistas do tema cadeia de suprimentos na área de Administração no Brasil. Os resultados indicam que as razões para o lento desenvolvimento do conceito podem relacionar-se com características do mercado nacional, foco empresarial em aspectos internos, falta de legislação rígida e baixa pressão dos consumidores. Especialistas percebem, entretanto, boas perspectivas para o futuro das discussões da temática no País, em virtude da Política Nacional dos Resíduos Sólidos, de pressões do mercado internacional e da busca por certificação ambiental.

We consider a common supplier that sells its uncertain supply to two downstream retail firms engaging in price competition in a horizontally differentiated product market. The focal firm has a dual‐sourcing option, while the rival firm can only source from the common supplier. We assess the system‐wide effects of supply uncertainty on the focal firm's incentive to pursue the dual‐sourcing strategy. We find that the focal firm's dual‐sourcing strategy can create a win–win situation that leads to increased retail prices and expected profits for both firms. Furthermore, under certain conditions, we show that it is beneficial for the focal firm to strategically source from the common supplier, even if its alternative supplier offers a lower wholesale price. Overall, we identify two types of incentives for adopting the dual‐sourcing strategy: the incentive of mitigating supply risk through supplier diversification and the incentive of strategic sourcing for more effective retail competition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Though early research in supply chain management focused mostly on transactional exchange, recent studies have shown a shift in focus from transactional to relational exchange. The research studies in traditional agricultural supply chains also followed a similar pattern. As a result, very little empirical information is available on the factors that affect the quality of the relationship between the supply chain players (partners) in the traditional agriculture supply chains. The focus of early research was mainly on the economics of channels and the structure of social relations within the chain members was somewhat ignored. This research study aims at studying the relationship dynamics in supply chain of pineapple in Garo hills of Meghalaya (India) from a smallholder’s perspective. Although the study began with 270 small growers to identify pineapple supply chains of the study area, the final study (relationship analysis) was limited to 167 small growers who sell to wholesalers. Factor analysis followed by regression analysis was conducted to identify and analyze the principal factors expressing relationships in pineapple supply chain. The study finds that cooperation, trust and a caring attitude from wholesaler influence the satisfaction of smallholder pineapple growers in a positive way. However, power dependence and the opportunistic behaviour of the wholesaler affects the satisfaction of smallholder pineapple farmers in a negative way. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Whether and how trust and trustworthiness differ between a collectivist society, e.g., China, and an individualistic one, e.g., the United States, generates much ongoing scientific debate and bears significant practical values for managing cross-country transactions. We experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of origin—China versus the United States—affect trust, trustworthiness, and strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain. We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and trustworthiness than their U.S. counterparts do. We quantify the differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U.S. partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in general. This positive perception toward U.S. people is indeed consistent with the U.S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U.S. one does, as the prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to encourage trust by Chinese partners. Finally, we also observe that both populations exhibit similar pull-to-center bias when solving a decision problem under uncertainty (i.e., the newsvendor problem).</jats:p><jats:p>Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1905 .</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</jats:p>",

This collaboration has led to fundamental changes in how Yedioth distributes print magazines and newspapers. In our work, we developed and implemented decision support tools that are based on new models and algorithms, which were enabled through an electronic data interchange system, and in the future will be enabled with a specialized radio-frequency identification technological solution. The underlying concept is to use real-time information about the sales at the retail outlets to enable pooling of inventory in the network. In particular, we leverage this information to implement an additional redistribution period during the week, delaying the distribution of some magazines until after we receive partial sales data. We model the system as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. Moreover, we show that the resulting cost is jointly convex in the decision variables. This approach gives rise to a multidimensional dynamic program. By formulating the second-stage subproblem as a linear program, we develop an innovative stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithm that finds the optimal solution in a matter of seconds. The changes resulting from this collaboration generated substantial cost savings at Yedioth—from both a reduction in magazine production levels and a reduction in the return levels. These savings were achieved while maintaining the same sales levels. </jats:p>",

To create 4 mA constant current for IEPE transducers commercial solutions are available and labs also have created such solutions, e.g., ITA at RWTH Aachen University. Unfortunately, commercially available circuits are still to expensive for large scale classroom use in Brazil and circuits created elsewhere contain parts subject to US export restrictions or require machines for creation of circuits. Thus, based on a previous project, a new low-cost prototype was mounted on phenolic board. The circuit was tested with an IEPE microphone connected to a commercial soundcard and ITA-Toolbox software and compared to a commercial hardware/software package. The results were very similar in the frequency range between 20 Hz and 10 kHz. The difference below 20 Hz probably occurs due the different high pass filters in the AD-cards. The differences in the high frequency range are very likely due to differences in the electrical background noise. The results suggest the device works well and is a good alternative to make measurements with IEPE sensors.</jats:p>",

However, the literature still lacks a clear conceptualization of a network‐level understanding of supply disruptions. Not having a network level understanding of supply disruptions prevents firms from fully mitigating the negative effects of a supply disruption. Graph theory helps to conceptualize a supply network and differentiate between disruptions at the node/arc level vs. network level. The structure of a supply network consists of a collection of nodes (facilities) and the connecting arcs (transportation). From this perspective, small events that disrupt a node or arc in the network can have major consequences for the network. A failure in a node or arc can potentially stop the flow of material across network. This study conceptualizes supply network disruption and resilience by examining the structural relationships among entities in the network. We compare four fundamental supply network structures to help understand supply network disruption and resilience. The analysis shows that node/arc‐level disruptions do not necessarily lead to network‐level disruptions, and demonstrates the importance of differentiating a node/arc disruption vs. a network disruption. The results also indicate that network structure significantly determines the likelihood of disruption. In general, different structural relationships among network entities have different levels of resilience. More specifically, resilience improves when the structural relationships in a network follow the<jats:italic>power‐law</jats:italic>. This paper not only offers a new perspective of supply network disruption, but also suggests a useful analytical approach to assessing supply network structures for resilience.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

These challenges arise from multi‐layered regulation and the context and time dependence of component functions. However, when viewed as a system that functions according to the principles of supply and demand, a simplifying theoretical framework can be applied to study its regulation logic and to assess the coherence of experimental interpretations. These principles are universally applicable, as they emphasize the common metabolic tasks of glycolysis: the provision of free‐energy carriers, and precursors for biosynthesis and stress‐related compounds. Here we will review the regulation of multi‐tasking by glycolysis and consider how an understanding of this central metabolic pathway can be pursued using general principles, rather than focusing on the biochemical details of constituent components.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This did not differ much from the product ratio for each efficiency registered on [Efficiency Comparison], an energy efficiency management system. Increasing ratio of consumers are expected to purchase high efficiency boiler as development and supply of high efficiency products are institutionally reinforced.Also, general replacement cycle of boilers was investigated as 9 years based on living conditions, environment and marketing survey on the market. Energy conservation from sequential replacement of boilers other than grade 1 into grade 1 boilers during this life cycle of 9 years was calculated to be 6%.</jats:p>"

This suggests that rainwater potential should be maximized and quantified. In this article, we assess the potential of DRWH at a national level. To consider the climatic, building characteristic, economic, and ecological aspects of DRWH, we propose three categories: (1) theoretical; (2) available; and  (3) environmental bearable rainwater potential. Four main steps were followed to develop the proposed framework: (1) Fifteen rainfall zones across Taiwan were generated through cluster analysis based on the average annual 10-day rainfall distributions of rainfall stations and administrative districts; (2) The roof area in each rainfall zone was estimated using a geographic information system (GIS) and land use classification database; (3) The weighted percentage of rainwater use in each rainfall zone was determined by the optimal point on the storage capacity and rainwater supply reliability curve for an equivalent building from each building type; (4) The percentage of the total roof area used to harvest rainwater in each region depends on the downstream impact of the stream flow. The procedures developed  in this study constitute an effective tool for preliminarily estimation of the national  DRWH potential.     </jats:p>"

The tour product is composed of predesigned tours and optional tours. Consumers are sensitive to the price and the availability of optional tours, represented as the ratio of optional tours. The authors analyse how the ratio of optional tours to predesigned tours affects each player's equilibrium decisions given three different consumer attitudes towards optional tours. They find that when the channel is coordinated and the ratio of optional tours is sufficiently large, the local operator may reduce commissions. To curb the impacts of lowering commissions, the authors introduce a tax mechanism aimed at optional tours. Numeral examples are provided to illustrate the pricing impacts of optional tours. </jats:p>",

To control the uncertainty in demand, the retailer can purchase futures or options from the supplier. Futures or options can be exercised by the retailer to replenish inventory in the season. Moreover, redundant futures or options might be traded in the e-business market. The retailer's equilibrium ordering decision and the supplier's equilibrium pricing decision are analyzed under each kind of contracts. In addition, a comparison of futures and options is also presented and the conditions under which futures (or options) are superior are also identified. Our research shows that both the supplier and the retailer can be better off comparing with the newsvendor cases by using the two contracts. Furthermore, due to superior flexibility of the options, channel coordination can be achieved by using options. However, more cost needs to be paid to replenish by options, which may hurt the retailer. Hence, if the cost of replenishing by options is not overly high, the options are recommended to use; otherwise, the futures are recommended to choose. </jats:p>",

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) strong enough to create electromagnetic effects at latitudes below the auroral oval are frequent events that could soon have substantial impacts on electrical grids. Modern society's heavy reliance on these domestic and international networks increases our susceptibility to such a severe space-weather event. Using a new high-resolution model of the global economy, we simulate the economic impact of strong CMEs for three different planetary orientations. We account for the economic impacts within the countries directly affected, as well as the post-disaster economic shock in partner economies linked by international trade. For a 1989 Quebec-like event, the global economic impacts would range from USD 2.4 to 3.4 trillion over a year. Of this total economic shock, about 50% would be felt in countries outside the zone of direct impact, leading to a loss in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 3.9 to 5.6%. The global economic damage is of the same order as wars, extreme financial crisis and estimated for future climate change.\n                    </jats:p>"

Multi-stakeholder collaborations are a popular hybrid governance approach to development, including NGOs’ work to integrate smallholder farmers into supermarket supply chains. As a result, NGOs’ service provision role has expanded to include market facilitation, often necessitating NGOs act as market intermediaries. This paper explores how this new role may jeopardize NGOs’ organizational legitimacy in the eyes of their constituents, other development organizations, and supermarket partners, and therefore ultimately affect their ability to represent civil society in hybrid governance arrangements. Drawing on qualitative data collected in the Central American country of Honduras, this paper focuses on NGOs’ role organizing producer associations to facilitate access to Wal-Mart supermarkets. Findings suggest that a lack of supply chain transparency, NGOs’ negotiation between commercial and aid-oriented goals, and the potential to exclude producers from development projects threaten NGOs’ legitimacy. These findings illustrate the difficulties of embedding philanthropic activities in market-based systems, and demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaborations may be influenced more by commercial priorities than the elements of a partnership. Ultimately, development NGOs are products of neoliberal, hybrid governance, even as their activities are expected to ease the transition of small-scale producers into this system.</jats:p>"

The use of environmentally preferable purchasing criteria is one strategy organizations use to address this goal. However, evaluating the environmental performance of these criteria (e.g., recycled content, biodegradable, renewable, and so on) has remained elusive. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can measure the impact reduction potential of sourcing strategies. However, full process‐based LCAs are time‐consuming and costly across multiple criteria of thousands of products and inputs purchased in an organizational setting. A streamlined “hotspot” methodology is presented using a combination of environmentally extended economic input‐output (EEIO) approaches and extant literature to identify hotspots in which to constrain a parameterized process‐based LCA. A case study of breakfast cereal manufacturing is developed to (1) assess the efficiencies associated with the hotspotting approach and (2) demonstrate its applicability in generating comparable decision signals of environmentally preferable sourcing criteria for procurement and supply‐chain managers along the dimensions of global warming potential and water use.</jats:p>",

In a collective household model, spouses’ optimal on‐farm labor supply is such that the marginal rate of technical substitution between male and female labor is equated over different crops. Using the Uganda National Household Survey 2005/06, we test whether this condition holds by estimating production functions and controlling for endogeneity using a method proposed by Gandhi, Navarro, and Rivers (2009). We find that women are less productive than men, that there is more female labor input on low productivity parcels, and that men are relatively more productive on female‐controlled plots compared with male‐controlled plots. Total farm output could be higher and Pareto improvements could be possible if male labor was reallocated to female‐controlled plots and/or female labor was reallocated to male‐controlled plots.</jats:p>",

We suggest that a multinational corporation (MNC) entering these markets must resolve the institutional voids in product, labor, and capital markets, as well as address issues of regulatory ambiguities and the lack of contracting mechanisms that exist at the raw material, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing stages of the supply chain. We analyze the nature of these voids and their challenges, map them onto the value chain, discuss their interconnections, and suggest that they do not impact all firms equally. We provide examples from the food, beverage, and textile industries of how four firms have addressed institutional voids in constructing their supply chains. We conclude by providing implications, both across the value chain and regarding the trade‐offs of partnering with non‐profit agencies. Our analysis highlights the importance of going beyond the broad impact of the institutional environment to understanding its more nuanced and multi‐faceted effect on supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Existence of zero data in supply chains can be a new assumption in performance evaluation. The main objective of this paper is to propose a new network DEA (NDEA) model in the presence of zero data. In addition, to rank supply chains, this paper proposes a novel super‐efficiency formulation of NDEA using input saving and output surplus concepts. To demonstrate applicability of the proposed model, a case study is presented.</jats:p>",

The problem of allocating fuel and financial costs at the combined production in accordance with the criterion of equal profitability of supplied energy products is solved. The methods allow determining specific indicators of supplied energy products. The technology of introducing RES-based power plants to the energy supply systems by means of using unstabilized RES-based power for direct fuel substitution in thermal cycles of gas-turbine (combined cycle) and steam-turbine plants (the wind is viewed as the most promising type of RES). Connection of wind power plants to an electric grid through thermal power plants allows us to avoid solving the problems of maintaining power quality and operating reserve of the wind power plants capacity in the power system and also to use wind energy at the plants of combined heat and high-quality electric power production, small ones included. The technology can promote smooth transition to hydrogen energy. It is shown that the cogeneration saves more than 20% of fuel, and its combination with wind power station – more than 50%.</p>",

While prior research in laboratory and field locations has documented the effectiveness of BSF to remove agents of diarrhea, experience in field sites suggests that multiple local factors greatly influence the occurrence of diarrhea. In addition to the BSF, this study evaluated household education level, socioeconomic status, water source and handling, and sanitation as factors impacting the occurrence of diarrhea for households in the village of Enseado do Aritapera in Para, Brazil. Of the 18 correlations examined, 16 were negatively correlated, and the strongest correlation was between the utilization of an ‘improved’ water source and the reduction of the occurrence of diarrhea within the household. While proper operation and maintenance of the BSF was found to have a negative correlation with the occurrence of diarrhea, it was not the most influential factor. This result supports the prior findings from our earlier work suggesting that more research is needed to evaluate which intervention should be prioritized for maximum return on investment with aid distribution.</jats:p>",

Data for this study were obtained through a survey of 126 automobile manufacturers in China. Results suggest that customer pressure has a positive effect on the implementation of customer‐centric GSCM, which, in turn, leads to multiple operational performance improvements (i.e. flexibility, delivery, quality and cost). While production flexibility and cost appear to have no significant impact on customer satisfaction, product quality and delivery are significantly and positively associated with customer satisfaction. On the practical front, this paper provides guidelines for managers in implementing customer‐centric GSCM to respond to customer pressures and improve firm performance, and for policy‐makers to encourage partner‐focused GSCM efforts in environmental policy.

Leisure spending is particularly salient to intra‐household resource allocation, as it constitutes one of the most highly prioritized areas of individualized expenditure, especially for young, single people. Using a database compiled from surviving returns to the Ministry of Labour's national 1937/8 working‐class expenditure survey, we examine leisure participation rates for over 600 households, using a detailed set of commercial leisure activities together with other relevant variables. We find that the employment status of family members other than the male breadwinner was a key factor influencing their access to commercial leisure. Our analysis thus supports the view that the breadwinner–homemaker household was characterized by strong power imbalances that concentrated resources—especially for individualized expenditures—in the hands of those family members who engaged in paid labour.</jats:p>",

Also, the influences of concentration, contact time, and pH on the adsorption capacity of arsenic (As) on a dacitic tuff doped with MgO by batch technique were assessed. The results show that the treated material can increase adsorption capacity by 95% compared to natural, untreated material. The pH range for better As adsorption is 3–7 at ambient temperature. The data were evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich models; these were better suited to the Langmuir model with a capacity of adsorption of 1,897.1 μg g−1. Finally, the mechanism proposed between adsorbent and As compounds is an anion exchange, according to the Kaganer–Dubinin–Radushkevich model, which is provided by functional groups MgOH2+ that were fixed on the material.</jats:p>",

The supply chain integration within processes and between organizations has enhanced value creation. However, the fragmented nature of the business in developing country demonstrates a noticeable difficulty in terms of competitiveness and efficiency. Lack of a relevant literature on practical experience in supply chain integration in developing countries is one of the challenges. The purpose of this research is to identify the level of interorganizational and intraorganizational supply chain integration practices. It also analyzes the challenges faced in the manufacturing firms in developing countries. The methodology followed a thorough review of literature and semistructured interviews amongst the Ethiopian manufacturing industries. The preliminary findings of the study highlight that prevailing approach to supply chain integration is limited to ad hoc functional based boundaries within the firm. The SC integration enablers are also restricted to the traditional way of communications such as telephone, fax, and letters. Firms need to focus on those issues that require attention in pursuance of greater SC integration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The spot price for tantalum, a metal used in high‐performance consumer electronics, spiked in 2000, triggering a boom in artisanal mining of surface deposits in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The profit from columbite‐tantalite ore, or coltan, is alleged to have funded militants during that country's civil war. One warlord famously claimed that in 2000, coltan delivered a million dollars per month. While coltan mining was neither a necessary nor sufficient cause for the civil war, there is nevertheless a clear association between mining and conflict. In order to trace global flows of coltan out of the DRC, we used a high‐resolution multiregion input‐output (MRIO) table and a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to trace exports through international supply chains in order to estimate a “coltan footprint” for various products. In this case study, our aim is to highlight the power and utility of hybrid LCA analysis using high‐resolution global MRIO accounts. We estimate which supply chains, nations, and consumer goods carry the largest loads of embodied coltan. This hybrid LCA case study provides estimates on illicit flows of coltan, estimates a coltan footprint of consumption, and highlights the advantages and challenges of using hybrid monetary‐physical input‐output/LCA approaches to study and quantify a negative social impact as an input to production. If successful, the hybrid LCA approach could be a useful and expedient measurement tool for understanding flows of conflict minerals embodied in supply chains.</jats:p>",

Especially, an optimization scheme for scheduling the water-pumping operation has attracted the interest of water engineers. In this paper, a binary integer program was applied to optimize pumping schedule of a WSS in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka based on the hourly water demands for the next day. The water demands were forecasted by a combined model consisting of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and an error compensation routine based on exponential smoothing technique. The result showed that the optimization system could reduce the operation cost of the WSS by minimizing electricity for water pumping; electricity cost for pump operation could be reduced by 55%.</jats:p>",

However, because of the phenomenon of false-positive reads, RFID data streams resemble noisy analog measurements rather than the desired recordings of activities within a business process. The present study investigates the use of data mining techniques for filtering and aggregating raw RFID data. We consider classifiers based on logistic regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks using attributes derived from low-level reader data. In addition, we present a custom-made algorithm for generating decision rules using artificial attributes and an iterative training procedure. We evaluate the classifiers using a massive set of data on pallet movements collected under real-world conditions at one of the largest retailers worldwide. The results clearly indicate high classification performance of the classification models, with the rule-based classifier outperforming all others. Moreover, we show that utilizing the full spectrum of data generated by the reader hardware leads to superior performance compared with the approaches based on timestamp and antenna information proposed in prior research.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, was determined the relation between the operation of the relief valve and the behavior of supply pressure.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water supply sources for irrigation (e.g. rivers and reservoirs) are critically important for agricultural productivity. The current rapid increase in irrigation water use is considered unsustainable and threatens food production. In this study, we estimated the time-varying dependence of irrigation water requirements from water supply sources, with a particular focus on variations in irrigation area during past (1960–2001) and future (2002–2050) periods using the global water resources model, H08. The H08 model can simulate water requirements on a daily basis at a resolution of 1.0° × 1.0° latitude and longitude. The sources of irrigation water requirements in the past simulations were specified using four categories: rivers (RIV), large reservoirs (LR) with a storage capacity greater than 1.0 × 109 m3, medium-size reservoirs (MSR) with storage capacities ranging from 1.0 × 109 m3 to 3.0 × 106 m3, and non-local non-renewable blue water (NNBW). The simulated results from 1960 to 2001 showed that RIV, MSR and NNBW increased significantly from the 1960s to the early 1990s globally, but LR increased at a relatively low rate. After the early 1990s, the increase in RIV declined as it approached a critical limit, due to the continued expansion of irrigation area. MSR and NNBW increased significantly, during the same time period, following the expansion of the irrigation area and the increased storage capacity of the medium-size reservoirs. We also estimated future irrigation water requirements from the above four water supply sources and an additional water supply source (ADD) in three future simulation designs; irrigation area change, climate change, and changes in both irrigation area and climate. ADD was defined as a future increase in NNBW. After the 2020s, MSR was predicted to approach the critical limit, and ADD would account for 11–23% of the total requirements in the 2040s.\n                    </jats:p>"

This mismatch suggests that maximal R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>is limited by tissue capacity to metabolize lactate. This study uses exogenous lactate to investigate what constrains maximal R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>and minimal R<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>. Our goals were to determine how exogenous lactate affects: 1) R<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>and R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>of lactate under baseline conditions or during graded swimming, and 2) exercise performance (critical swimming speed, U<jats:sub>crit</jats:sub>) and energetics (cost of transport, COT). Results show that exogenous lactate allows swimming trout to boost maximal R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>lactate by 40% and reach impressive rates of 56 μmol·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. This shows that the metabolic capacity of tissues for lactate disposal is not responsible for setting the highest R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>normally observed after intense swimming. Baseline endogenous R<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>(resting in normoxic water) is not significantly reduced by exogenous lactate supply. Therefore, trout have an obligatory need to produce lactate, either as a fuel for oxidative tissues and/or from organs relying on glycolysis. Exogenous lactate does not affect U<jats:sub>crit</jats:sub>or COT, probably because it acts as a substitute for glucose and lipids rather than extra fuel. We conclude that the observed 40% increase in R<jats:sub>d</jats:sub>lactate is made possible by accelerating lactate entry into oxidative tissues via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). This observation together with the weak expression of MCTs and the phenomenon of white muscle lactate retention show that lactate metabolism of rainbow trout is significantly constrained by transmembrane transport.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In ecosystems driven by water availability, plant community dynamics depend on complex interactions between vegetation, hydrology, and human water resources use. Along ephemeral rivers—where water availability is erratic—vegetation and people are particularly vulnerable to changes in each other's water use. Sensible management requires that water supply be maintained for people, while preserving ecosystem health. Meeting such requirements is challenging because of the unpredictable water availability. We applied information gap decision theory to an ecohydrological system model of the Kuiseb River environment in Namibia. Our aim was to identify the robustness of ecosystem and water management strategies to uncertainties in future flood regimes along ephemeral rivers. We evaluated the trade‐offs between alternative performance criteria and their robustness to uncertainty to account for both (i) human demands for water supply and (ii) reducing the risk of species extinction caused by water mining. Increasing uncertainty of flood regime parameters reduced the performance under both objectives. Remarkably, the ecological objective (species coexistence) was more sensitive to uncertainty than the water supply objective. However, within each objective, the relative performance of different management strategies was insensitive to uncertainty. The ‘best’ management strategy was one that is tuned to the competitive species interactions in the Kuiseb environment. It regulates the biomass of the strongest competitor and, thus, at the same time decreases transpiration, thereby increasing groundwater storage and reducing pressure on less dominant species. This robust mutually acceptable strategy enables species persistence without markedly reducing the water supply for humans. This study emphasises the utility of ecohydrological models for resource management of water‐controlled ecosystems. Although trade‐offs were identified between alternative performance criteria and their robustness to uncertain future flood regimes, management strategies were identified that help to secure an ecologically sustainable water supply.

The period of supply analysis was from 1999 to 2009, and of utilization was from 2008 to October 2012.Results: Since 1999 there is a growth of hemodynamic equipment purchase. The private sector concentrates most of the supply, but it has been reducing its availability to SUS. The rate between population and equipment in Brazil exceeds the ones of some rich countries. In the sense of supply, there are in 2009, a supply rate of 1,4 equipments for 1 million inhabitants in RJ state, larger than brazilian rate, of 3,4 but the rates are similar for public customers.Conclusion: Interventional cardiology procedures have improved in the state, but in a different way. And this is because the public hospitals at Rio de Janeiro have mostly reduced their production, while the private ones have increased their production. The observed result is the SUS users performing their procedures at great distances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A critical factor in the biotechnological production of succinic acid with <jats:italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</jats:italic> is the sufficient supply of NADH. It is conceivable that cofactor availability and the proportion of cofactor in the active form may play an important role in dictating the succinic acid yield. PntAB genes from Escherichia coli can directly catalyze the reversible hydride transfer and adjust the dynamic balance between NADP(H) and NAD(H). Hence, we studied the physiological effect of coenzyme systems by expressing the membrane‐bound transhydrogenase pntAB genes. We have shown experimentally that the pntAB genes could function as an alternative source of NADH. In an anaerobic fermentation with C. glutamicum NC‐3‐pntAB, a 16% higher succinic acid yield and a 57% higher production from glucose were obtained by pntAB expression. Moreover, the formation of by‐products was significantly decreased. The concomitant increase in the consumption of intracellular NADPH from 0.6 to 1.2 mmol/g CDW and the increased NADH/NAD<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratio resulted from introduction of pntAB, suggesting that the membrane‐bound transhydrogenase converted excess NADPH to NADH for succinic acid production. Finally, we explored whether the transhydrogenase had different effects on the succinic acid formation on different carbon sources. The succinic acid yield was increased in the presence of pntAB by 16% on glucose, 7% on sucrose, and without large influence on fructose and xylose. The results of this study demonstrated that the effectiveness of cofactor manipulation could be a promising strategy applied in metabolic engineering. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>Biotechnol.

A soil column and a split‐root experiment were conducted to quantify the effect of localized water and P supply on shoot growth, root morphology, specific P uptake (SPU), P‐use efficiency (PUE), and water‐use efficiency (WUE) of maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.). Our results indicate that roots preferentially grow in the layer or compartment with both adequate water and P supply, subsequently stimulating SPU, PUE, and WUE, and enhancing shoot growth. Compared with the treatments in which both layers and compartments were supplied with adequate P and/or water, the growth of maize was maintained or minimally affected. SPU, PUE, and WUE were increased when both P and water were supplied in one layer or one compartment only. These findings show that normal plant growth with an adequate P uptake was achieved even if part of the roots were supplied with 2/3 (soil column experiment) and 1/2 (split‐root experiment) of the phosphorus and water supplied in the full‐phosphorus and full‐water treatment. Changes in root morphology under water stress conditions induced by the application of phosphorus and water in deeper soil layers or to a part of the roots may have substantial practical implications for agricultural production and environmental protection.</jats:p>",

However, embolization of the LGA would prevent the performance of bariatric procedures because the high-risk leakage area (gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]) would be devascularized. Aim. To assess an alternative vascular approach to the modulation of ghrelin levels and generate a blood flow manipulation, consequently increasing the vascular supply to the GEJ. Materials and methods. A total of 6 pigs underwent a laparoscopic clipping of the left gastroepiploic artery. Preoperative and postoperative CT angiographies were performed. Ghrelin levels were assessed perioperatively and then once per week for 3 weeks. Reactive oxygen species (ROS; expressed as ROS/mg of dry weight [DW]), mitochondria respiratory rate, and capillary lactates were assessed before and 1 hour after clipping (T0 and T1) and after 3 weeks of survival (T2), on seromuscular biopsies. A celiac trunk angiography was performed at 3 weeks. Results. Mean (±standard deviation) ghrelin levels were significantly reduced 1 hour after clipping (1902 ± 307.8 pg/mL vs 1084 ± 680.0; P = .04) and at 3 weeks (954.5 ± 473.2 pg/mL; P = .01). Mean ROS levels were statistically significantly decreased at the cardia at T2 when compared with T0 (0.018 ± 0.006 mg/DW vs 0.02957 ± 0.0096 mg/DW; P = .01) and T1 (0.0376 ± 0.008mg/DW; P = .007). Capillary lactates were significantly decreased after 3 weeks, and the mitochondria respiratory rate remained constant over time at the cardia and pylorus, showing significant regional differences. Conclusions. Manipulation of the gastric flow targeting the gastroepiploic arcade induces ghrelin reduction. An endovascular approach is currently under evaluation. </jats:p>",

Moreover, we show that this ATP-independent mechanism for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis can entirely replace the ATP-costly native yeast pathway. This work provides metabolic engineers with a new option to optimize the performance of baker’s yeast as a “cell factory” for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research studies the p‐robust supply chain network design with uncertain demand and cost scenarios. The optimal design integrates the supplier selection together with the facility location and capacity problem. We provide a new framework to obtain the relative regret limit, which is critical in the robust supply chain design but is assumed to be a known value in the existing literature. We obtain lower and upper bounds for relative regret limit and obtain a sequence of optimal solutions for series relative regret limits between the upper and lower bounds. An algorithm for p‐robust supply chain network design is provided. A series of numerical examples are designed to find the properties of the bottleneck scenarios. A scenario with low probability and a low optimal objective function value for the scenario has a greater chance of being a bottleneck. To focus only on the influence from the relative regret, we also introduce three separate new objective functions in p‐robust design. The proposed new theories and approaches provide a sequence of options for decision makers to reduce the marketing risks effectively in supply chain network design. </jats:p>",
