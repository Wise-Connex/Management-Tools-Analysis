The management of MRO supplies has been little discussed in the literature, and in many organizations is undertaken in a devolved, decentralized, and uncoordinated fashion. Consequently, MRO procurement is often a poorly managed and non‐value‐added activity, yet MRO purchases may account for many millions of dollars of expenditure for organizations across most, if not all, industries. To explore the impact of Web‐based procurement systems on MRO purchasing, a Delphi study was conducted providing access and analysis of commercially sensitive data.<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#fn1\"><jats:sup>1</jats:sup></jats:ext-link></jats:p><jats:p>In this article, it is contended that greater information processing capability achieved through the use of electronic commerce, specifically Web‐based procurement, will enable significant cost improvements and strategic leverage to be obtained through a more strategic approach to management of the typically low‐value, high‐variety goods and services that constitute the main category of MRO items. E‐procurement of MRO items may be a so‐called “killer application” on the basis of potential efficiency gains.</jats:p><jats:p>Further, an important consequence of the reengineering of the MRO procurement process will be to raise the professional profile of the purchasing function through enhanced internal customer service and significant total cost improvements.</jats:p>",

This has increased the pressure on purchasers to develop innovative approaches to managing residual disposition. Good management requires not only a clearer understanding of the origins of these items and the options available, but an understanding of how costs are incurred and how they may be reduced across the supply chain. Based on several in‐depth case studies at firms in the furniture, commercial printing, electronics, and pharmaceutical industries, this research discovered that firms generate residuals at multiple functional points preceding manufacturing and that their disposition decisionmaking is affected by one or a combination of three drivers: intrinsic value, overwhelming volume of material, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, most organizations neither consider nor track disposal costs, thereby obscuring both the issue as well as potential solutions.</jats:p>",

For purposes of consultation, it is most convenient for users to have wanted items that are not available locally in one large collection, though this runs into political and other difficulties. Co‐operative acquisition systems rarely work. Remote consultation of digitised material would change this situation. It is now usually as fast to obtain “copiable” items from foreign countries as from one’s own, even when they have to be supplied by paper copies; and more and more items are accessible on the Internet. For books, the time taken to supply and the cost still vary considerably between domestic and other sources; there is no easy solution unless and until large amounts of material are digitised, and then remote supply and remote consultation begin to merge. As a result of the various factors, there is now no need for national acquisition and supply policies.</jats:p>",

Among several initiatives in the US textiles industry to deal with the problem, one in particular aims to achieve quick response (QR) in the supply chain through accurate response (AR). AR is an approach to forecasting, planning, and production that builds on QR capabilities within the supply chain organisation. In order to achieve this, a total systems perspective is necessary requiring analysis of activities. This paper describes a formal system analysis methodology utilising design principles that builds on activities, and utilises models that achieve synchronisation through waste management in inventory for a textile garment supply chain. The generic features of this activity‐based problem representation methodology hold promise for its common application across supplier/consumer class of system problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As businesses worked towards Y2000 compliancy and checked their sources of supply, the mechanisms and nature of relationships in the supply chain were exposed. A multi‐case study methodology of four UK‐based SMEs and one large multinational company was undertaken to exploit this time‐window. Although the Y2000 problem was to some extent unique, it is only one of many potential environmental changes that organisations, particularly businesses, have to respond to in the rapidly changing future. Thus any lessons that can be learned from studying this event could provide useful information for future significant environmental changes; changes to trading and market environments; changes to employment law. Whilst the terms “supply chain” and “supply chain management” are universally adopted, their meaning and actual application is less certain. This paper explores the limited but diverse multidisciplinary literature and the “theory/practice” gap in the area of supply chain management and the impact on the supply chain of preparing for the Year 2000.</jats:p>",

The first concerns the skills of maritime labourers; the second addresses the alleged shortages of seamen; and the third is the contemporary perception of and responses to these concerns. Williams examines public concerns over perceived lack of maritime employment in relation to nostalgia, and a pervasive, romanticised view of sailing and sailing culture. Williams finds, and concludes, that nostalgia for traditional sailing, yearning for a glorified British Empire, and an emotional public mindset, made little impression on the economic progress made during the age of steam, expansion, and technological development.</p>",

The major desalination processes, using membranes or distillation, are described. These are multistage flash evaporation (MSF), multi‐effect distillation (ME), vapor compression distillation (VC), freeze–desalination, reverse osmosis (RO), and electrodialysis (ED). The use of renewable energy for water desalination by solar stills, ocean–thermal energy conversion plants, wind, and photovoltaic cells is presented. Two of the key technical problems in desalination, scale deposition and prevention, and corrosion and the proper choice of materials to resist it, are discussed. Basic equations are provided for the evaluation and preliminary design of MSF and RO, which are currently the leading water desalination processes. The leading professional and governmental organizations involved with desalination, and their activities, are described.</jats:p>"

Special attention is given to its effect on youth drinking. Surveys of young people show that alcopops and sweet ciders are perceived to be easy to drink and to have a sweet and pleasant taste, which tends to conceal the taste of alcohol. These results suggest that alcopops and sweet ciders should be regarded as one category of drinks. Alcopops and sweet ciders have penetrated the youth market rapidly. The introduction of these beverages accounted for approximately half of the increase in alcohol consumption by 15‐16‐year‐old boys from 1996 to 1999, and two‐thirds of the increase among girls, according to the surveys. A large proportion of the youth answered that alcopops and ciders did not replace any other alcoholic beverage. The paper also describes the public debate on alcopops and cider. The introduction of alcopops was criticized by the media and the responsible minister. Prominent spokesmen of the alcohol industry put themselves at a distance from these, primarily imported, products. The sales of alcopops have been declining since 1997. Sweet ciders, on the other hand, which in reality are synonymous with alcopops, have continued to increase during the whole period since 1996, and have not been subject to the same public criticism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Both practitioners and research scientists have noted a number of problems regarding measurement activities during the past decade. The problems reported suggest that measurement activities are fragmented both within and across organizations. Expands on a systems perspective on supply chain measurements and describes how problems can be communicated, understood and managed by developing methods and tools for describing interrelationships within supply chains. Empirical evidence from a case study of a Swedish home furnishing business supply chain provides data suggesting that firms within a supply chain cannot simply be categorized as either having adopted systems thinking or not. Rather, both structured models indicating a high degree of systems thinking, and problems showing fragmentation, are present. A performance model, which is used to reflect the systemic structure of an underlying supply chain and a potential integrator, is introduced and suggested as the focus of future research initiatives within supply chain measurements.</jats:p>",

While the hexose content of the liquid endosperm decreased during development the sucrose content increased. It is important to understand the relative rates of use of the endosperm sugars for two reasons. Firstly we need to know which sugars are used, and at what stages in development, in order to understand the roles of enzymes involved in their metabolism. Secondly, changes in sugar concentration have been implicated in the regulation of expression of genes determining storage-product synthesis [see Weber, Borisjuk and Wobus (1997) Trends Plant Sci. 2, 169–174, for review]. The rate of consumption of sugar is one factor governing its concentration. We present data showing both the concentration-dependence of conversion of sugar to oil, and the in vivo concentrations of sugars; we relate these data sets to each other and discuss the effects of the intracellular pool of sucrose. Glucose, fructose and sucrose are all substrates for oil synthesis, but the rates of their use (particularly sucrose) are underestimated because of dilution by sucrose from the intracellular pool.</jats:p>",

A number of such conceptualisations of transformation under the banner of “agility” attempt to provide guidance about “managing” physical and social relationships within and between companies in response to growing market complexity. The theoretical argument in this paper is that inter‐firm agility cannot be objectively understood in all cases using simple unidirectional cause and effect as such theories do not take into account more subjective aspects of interaction. Specifically, we argue that to have a vision of agility in action there must be an evaluation of complexity in and between organisational boundaries with a theoretical approach that gives a more robust appreciation of inter‐firm ties. Conceptualising agility in this way captures the essence of tacit knowledge between firms along with the physical dynamics of network functioning.</jats:p>",

Five institutional conditions for diversified quality production are identified, each of which was tackled to some extent in Australia. The article finds the strategy did not yield the benefits promised. Economic performance was average, union density fell steeply, and institutional supports for union membership and bargaining are threatened. Union misjudgments and an unfavorable historical and institutional legacy, in particular the weakness of workplace bargaining structures, explain much of the Australian situation. Furthermore, the union supply-side reform agenda needs to be placed in its proper context. Without complementary policies affecting aggregate demand, innovation and industry policies, and finance reform, supply-side intervention can have only a limited impact. Unions in a neoliberal political economy are not strong enough to force through industrial restructuring alone. </jats:p>",

I apply aspects of the post-Keynesian investment theory developed by Hyman Minsky to understand the causes of hyperextended building cycles, with particular attention paid to the 1980s boom. Periods of rampant overbuilding are found to be rooted in the distressed conditions of the commercial banking sector, which drove the banks to annex the commercial property markets as outlets for surplus credit capacity and to offset declining rates of profit. I explore how the existence of commercial property at the intersection of markets for space and markets for capital assets introduces distortions into the capital supply process and exacerbates tendencies towards overproduction and crisis. Conditions prevailing in the 1980s are contrasted to the current economic expansion, and the performance of the commercial property markets through 1999 is analyzed, to distinguish further the key control functions exercised by the commercial banks over market outcomes. </jats:p>",

The deterministic model is also investigated, formulating the problem as a mixed‐integer linear program and as a network flow problem.

As demonstrated through an \nempirical analysis of two employment zones, theories of institutional design that underscore the necessity of\nsanctioning cannot explain the successful emergence of cooperation, because new sanctioning regimes lack credibility \nunder the uncertain conditions of economic reform. The primary obstacle to successful implementation of these reforms \nis uncertainty about the consequences of reciprocal cooperation, and the article highlights the mutual roles of states \nand employers' associations in overcoming this uncertainty. Active collaboration between policymakers and employers' \nassociations, which have uniquely good access to private information about firms, is necessary to enable state policies \nto target those firms which are the most likely potential cooperators.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As contemporary globalization of the world economy continues, each nation enjoys the benefits of greater exploitation of scale economies and of specialization and exchange. But equally true, globalization causes greater dependence among regions, nations, and localities, and this necessarily implies greater vulnerability to disruption of supply to and from each other. Alternative actions that countries might take or actually have taken to manage this vulnerability include (1) stockpiling of goods that might be lost due to political, economic, or natural causes; (2) protection of domestic industries that otherwise could not compete in world markets (the classical “national security” argument for protectionism); (3) maintenance of standby production capabilities, itself closely related to stockpiling; and (4) formation of special economic unions or contingency agreements to guarantee stable supply and exchange. This article develops a unified analysis of the first two of these alternative policies. The analysis examines and summarizes how all these factors combine to determine the optimal level and mix of policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Development sociology has used global commodity chains as one way of analyzing the dynamics of power and profit‐taking in globalized production networks made up of multiple firms and occurring in multiple national settings. A substantial portion of the alcohol supply in developing countries is now produced through such production networks. Particularly in the beer and spirits trade, a small number of transnational firms control networks of local producers, importers, advertisers and distributors. These networks serve to embed transnational or transnationally backed brands in the local culture, using the tools of market research, product design and marketing to influence local drinking practices. Case materials from Malaysia's beer industry help to illustrate how the transnational firms dominate in those links of the commodity chain in which monopoly or oligopoly control is most likely to be found: the design/recipe and marketing/advertising nodes. Their control of the commodity chains and extraction of monopoly or oligopoly profits from them places substantial resources and influence over drinking settings and practices in foreign hands. The impact of this influence on state efficacy and autonomy in setting alcohol policy is an important subject for future research on the creation and implementation of effective alcohol policies in developing societies.</jats:p>",

The implications of two recently proposed international agreements ‐ the Multilateral Agreement on Investments and the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control ‐ are then discussed. The paper concludes by summarizing the theoretical and empirical evidence that shows clearly that trade liberalization has significantly increased tobacco use, particularly in low and middle‐income countries, and follows this with a discussion of the lessons learned from tobacco for controlling alcohol supply.</jats:p>",

It is argued that characteristics of local supply directly affect the economic and social behaviors of consumers when purchasing and using alcohol. For example, although taxes may be raised in order to lower alcohol use, the manner in which tax increases are translated into price increases, and the way consumers respond to price increases through alterations in purchase patterns, may strongly mitigate price effects. Similarly, although overall alcohol availability may be reduced in order to lower alcohol use, the tendency for greater numbers of outlets to be focused in low‐income areas and the manner in which consumers bundle alcohol purchases with other routine activities (e.g. shopping) may also strongly mitigate such effects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three periods are distinguished and applied to describe the dynamics of changes in the system of supply of alcoholic beverages in Central and Eastern Europe since 1980. The distinction of these three periods is based on changes in the regulation of the supply. The period of the old regulation ended in most countries around the 1990s. A deregulation took place in the early 1990s. The first steps toward a reregulation were visible in attempts to create a new order in the alcohol market in the last years of the 1990s. The analysis builds mainly on developments in Poland and Russia, with more scattered information from other countries. In each period the role of different actors (the state, the enterprises, organized crime, civil organizations and individuals), different interests (economic development, state finances, political order, public order, public health and various symbolic interests) and different public measures to regulate the supply (licensing, taxation and preventive actions and treatment) are considered. The analysis shows how the state lost its dominant position to private firms and is slowly regaining it again, how interest in state finances, overall economic development and later in profit‐making dominate all three periods, and how the old system of regulations was ruined, to become rebuilt in very small steps with many conflicts and complications. Public health interests and also civil society interests were weak in comparison with economic interests. From the public health perspective, changes in the supply system have had significant consequences, but a more comprehensive regulation of supply does not necessarily lead to diminished alcohol‐related harm.</jats:p>",

The first programme, called “LEAP” (lean processing programme), involves Corus (formerly British Steel Strip Products), two steel service centres and six major UK‐based automotive component manufacturers, all linked within a common supply chain. The second programme, called “3DayCar”, involves 20 European industrial sponsors including six automotive manufacturers. Both programmes are supported by the UK Government Innovative Manufacturing Initiative (IMI). Conclusions based on the waves analogy will be applied to a real‐life setting in order to suggest appropriate business strategies to achieving a lean value stream.</jats:p>",

We assess trends in China’s wheat output and develop a framework to measure the relationship between output and key determinants of China’s wheat sector growth. Elasticity estimates and factor growth trends help decompose the growth of reform‐era wheat supply into its component parts. The results show that growth in the early reform period was due to institutional change and technology. In the late reform period, however, with the returns to institutional change exhausted, all of China’s growth in wheat supply was due to technology, a result that implies China’s government should invest heavily in agricultural research and development.</jats:p>",

The inhibition of either of these processes significantly reduces the flux of carbon from Glc-6-P or from acetate into longchain fatty acids. The effect is dependent on the acyl chain length, e.g. lauryl-CoA is less inhibitory than oleoyl-CoA, causing 34 and 68% inhibition respectively of Glc-6-P uptake after 30 s. The inhibition of Glc-6-P and ATP transport is alleviated by addition of an equivalent concentration of acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) or BSA. Acyl-CoAs do not inhibit pyruvate or glucose transporters. The endogenous concentrations of acyl-CoAs and ACBP are similar during embryo maturation.</jats:p>",

We describe a manual backup system (MBS) developed to maintain the delivery of blood products to patients in a hospital transfusion service in case of a computer network breakdown.</jats:p><jats:p>All data are kept on a central SQL database connected to peripheral workstations in a local area network (LAN). Request entry from wards is performed via machine‐readable request forms containing self‐adhesive specimen labels with barcodes for test tubes. Data entry occurs on‐line by bidirectional automated systems or off‐line manually. One of the workstations in the laboratory contains a second SQL database which is frequently and incrementally updated. This workstation is run as a stand‐alone, read‐only database if the central SQL database is not available. In case of a network breakdown, the time‐graded MBS is launched. Patient data, requesting ward and ordered tests/requests, are photocopied through a template from the request forms on special MBS worksheets serving as laboratory journal for manual processing and result report (a copy is left in the laboratory). As soon as the network is running again the data from the off‐line period are entered into the primary SQL server.</jats:p><jats:p>The MBS was successfully used at several occasions. The documentation of a 90‐min breakdown period is presented in detail. Additional work resulted from the copy work and the belated manual data entry after restoration of the system.

This dynamical supply of nitrate to the euphotic zone is estimated over the North Atlantic from 1968 to 1993. First, a matrix of one‐dimensional mixed‐layer models are integrated over the North Atlantic forced by surface and Ekman fluxes of heat and freshwater. Second, nitrate fluxes to the euphotic zone are estimated by combining the mixed‐layer thickness cycle and wind stress data with climatological nitrate profiles. The model suggests that the convective supply of nitrate ranges from 0.1 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the subtropics to 1.4 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> over the subpolar gyre. The interannual variability in convective supply reaches ±0.2 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. This variability in nitrate supply is significantly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index over parts of the central and western Atlantic but not over the eastern Atlantic. This convectively induced variability should modulate the levels of export production wherever the nitrate supply is limiting. The Ekman transfer is relatively small, reaching 0.1 mol N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> over the subpolar gyre, but is important in maintaining nitrate concentrations within the seasonal boundary layer.</jats:p>",

The power supply of a metal vacuum arc plasma source is usually based on the artificial transformation line design, but it has several drawbacks. For instance, the pulse width cannot be adjusted conveniently and the pulsing frequency cannot exceed a predefined value. These restrictions make process optimization and synchronization with the sample high voltage modulator complicated in pulsed-mode PIII operation. In this work, we experimentally investigate the voltage–current characteristics of our metal vacuum arc plasma source. Our results suggest two different power supply designs. By adopting the design incorporating a gradual voltage–current decline, we successfully construct a simple and reliable power supply that works in a stable manner for a prolonged period of time.</jats:p>",

The PDH kinases (PDHKs) regulate glucose oxidation through inhibitory phosphorylation of PDHC. The adult rat heart contains three PDHK isoforms PDHK1, PDHK2 and PDHK4. Using Western-blot analysis, with specific antibodies raised against individual recombinant PDHK1, PDHK2 and PDHK4, the present study investigated PDHK isoform expression in the developing rat heart and adulthood. We identified clear differences in the patterns of protein expression of each of these PDHK isoforms during the first 3 weeks of post-natal development, with most marked up-regulation of isoforms PDHK1 and PDHK4. Distinctions between the three cardiac PDHK isoforms were also demonstrated with respect to post-neonatal maturational up-regulation; with greatest up-regulation of PDHK1 and least up-regulation of PDHK4 from the post-neonatal period until maturity. The study also examined the role of thyroid hormone status and lipid supply on PDHK isoform expression. We observed marked selective increases in the amount of PDHK4 protein present relative to total cardiac protein in both hyperthyroidism and high-fat feeding. Overall, our data identify PDHK isoform PDHK1 as being of more potential regulatory importance for glucose oxidation in the adult compared with the neonatal heart, and cardiac PDHK4 as a PDHK isoform whose expression is specifically responsive to changes in lipid supply, suggesting that its up-regulation during early post-natal life may be the perinatal switch to use fatty acids as the energy source. We also identify regulation of pyruvate sensitivity of cardiac PDHK as a physiological variable, a change in which requires factors in addition to a change in lipid supply.</jats:p>",

Prior to treatment, a blue dye was injected directly to tumors through the catheter. Well‐stained areas were considered as profusely perfused areas whereas poorly stained areas were considered as poorly perfused areas.

Moreover, there were significant differences (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) in the overall responses: 21/25 (84%) in the profusely perfused areas versus 7/25 (28%) in the poorly perfused areas; and in grade III responses (4/25, 16% vs. 18/25, 72%). To determine a possible correlation between the histopathological responses obtained in profusely perfused and in poorly perfused areas of each tumor, we then calculated the Kendall's tau‐b statistics, obtaining a τ value of 0.279 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.145). This data indicated that histopathological responses to chemotherapy of profusely perfused and poorly perfused areas were independent in each tumor.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Heterogeneity in the distribution of tumor blood supply affects the response to chemotherapy by influencing the intratumoral delivery of therapeutic agents. After the administration of effective doses of anticancer drugs to a tumor, cells in profusely perfused areas receive enough to destroy them while cells in the poorly perfused areas are exposed to lower drug concentrations and, therefore, survive. This phenomenon could explain in part the difficulty in the treatment of human solid tumors.</jats:p>",

Two metabolites, 2‐methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin, have been identified as compounds responsible for the earthy‐musty tastes and odors in water supplies. Both were detected in the water supply system, including source rivers, reservoirs, canal delivery system and water treatment plants. Higher concentrations of MIB and geosmin occurred in distribution canals than in the upstream reservoirs indicating that significant production of the T &amp; O compounds occurs within the canal system. A baseline‐monitoring program has been established for the complex water supply system, with special emphasis on the canal system. Efforts are underway to investigate possible correlations between physical/chemical parameters, algal composition and biomass, with the occurrence of MIB and geosmin. In addition, several physical and chemical treatments are planned for the canal system to reduce algal growth and related MIB and geosmin concentrations.</jats:p>",
