      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main epigraphic evidence for the water-supply of Aphrodisias in Roman times is to be found in the fragmentary inscriptions published by Doublet and Deschamps in <jats:italic>BCH</jats:italic> XIV (1890), 611–13, nos. 7–10, and <jats:italic>CIG</jats:italic> 2782, ll. 40–2. From the former group of texts it has been assumed that two water-systems were installed, one in the time of Vespasian and the other in the time of Domitian; I hope to show that these texts refer to one water-system only, that built in the time of Domitian. From the latter passage it has sometimes been thought that M. Ulpius Carminius Claudianus paid for the laying-on of the waters of the river Timeles to the city in the age of the Antonines. This assumption rested on the false reading ὲλ[ειο]δ[ι]ὰκτο[υ]ς introduced by Boeckh. The word ὲλειοδὶὰκτος  is taken to mean a ‘conduit for draining marshes’ (<jats:italic>LS</jats:italic><jats:sup>9</jats:sup>, <jats:italic>s.v.</jats:italic>). Sherard's copy preserves the true reading ἒλ &lt;α&gt; ια δρακτοῖς πολλὰκις τεθεικὸτα. All that can be proved by the inscription is that Carminius Claudianus made several distributions of oil ὲν τῶ̣ καιρῶ̣ τῆς τοῦ Τε&lt;ι&gt;μὲλου ποταμοῦ εἰσαγωγῆς (l. 41); there is no proof that he paid for the construction of the aqueduct.</jats:p><jats:p>The epigraphic evidence for the earlier water-system rests on the reconstruction of the text of which <jats:italic>BCH</jats:italic> XIV (1890), 611–13, nos. 7 (cf. <jats:italic>REG</jats:italic> XIX (1906), 223–4, no. 126), 8 and 9 are fragments; no. 10 seems to be part of another copy of this, or a similar, inscription. Of these fragments the only one found by the expedition led by Professor Calder in 1934 was no. 7; the improved readings in this inscription are from a photograph.</jats:p>",
