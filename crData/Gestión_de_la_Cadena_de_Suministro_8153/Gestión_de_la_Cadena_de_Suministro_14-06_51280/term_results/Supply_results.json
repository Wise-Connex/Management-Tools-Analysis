The concept of resources has become so important that it is now foundational to a large and growing body of supply chain research. In this introduction to the Special Topic Forum on Resources and Supply Chain Management, we provide some background on the concept of resources and recent theoretical advancements on why resources are important in the context of supply chains. We also offer some ways to advance theory related to resources in the supply chain management research. A key implication is that future supply chain management research must examine more granular issues regarding the management and allocation of supply chain resources.</jats:p>",

Taking this approach has the potential to change the focus of resource‐based thinking from competition between industry rivals to the tension between buyers and suppliers that structures supply chains. Value creation, which is the function of product market strategy, determines which supplier resources are critical and thus determines which suppliers should be in a position to capture value. When supplier capabilities are critical, buyers have incentives to maintain value creation while structuring the supply chain to reduce supplier power. I test the resulting hypotheses by applying multivariate analysis of variance techniques to data from the worldwide motion picture industry. Because the production companies that make movies enact a variety of product market strategies to create value for consumers, suppliers of visual and special effects have a range of opportunities for value capture. I find support for the hypotheses, suggesting that some buyers structure supply chains in counter‐intuitive ways when suppliers have high levels of resource‐based bargaining power.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding supply chain resilience and robustness is increasingly important for supply chain managers. This is due to the growing complexity of contemporary supply chains and the subsequent increased probability of experiencing a disruption. Few studies within the risk management literature have empirically disentangled the concepts of resilience and robustness or explored their antecedents. This study utilizes a contingent resource‐based view perspective to understand the relationship between specific resources (information sharing and connectivity), capabilities (visibility), and performance in terms of supply chain resilience and robustness. In addition, it utilizes supply base complexity as a moderating factor. Survey data collected from 264 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">UK</jats:styled-content> manufacturing plants suggest that supply chain connectivity and information sharing resources lead to a supply chain visibility capability which enhances resilience and robustness. Of the four dimensions of complexity, only scale is found to have a strong moderating effect on this relationship, while geographic dispersion, differentiation, and delivery complexity do not have contingent effects. This study highlights theoretical and managerial implications for approaches to resilience and robustness.</jats:p>",

However, the survey findings suggest that researchers who invoke theories of resources need to be more precise in their theoretical exposition and that future research needs to focus more heavily on the role of resources not just within, but also beyond a firm's boundaries (i.e., interfirm), and how those resources aid supply chains. The survey findings also suggest that future supply chain studies should focus more on investigating contingency relationships, and “fitting” research designs to address the specific research question of interest. Broadly speaking, we conclude that resources within and across firm boundaries are vital to supply chain functioning and management, but that as research evolves, new insights might be best characterized by studies that take stock of critical contingencies.</jats:p>",

As water flows through the pipe network, its quality undergoes various transformations due to many factors such as the properties of the finished water, pipe materials, water temperature, water age and low level of disinfectant residuals. Sampling and monitoring of water quality is, therefore, important to ensure that clean and safe water is transported to the consumers. In this paper, a model based on genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic was developed to identify locations of water quality monitoring stations in a water distribution system. While identifying the monitoring locations, multiple sources of water supply, water age and constituent concentration were considered. The developed model was applied on a hypothetical network and results indicate that monitoring stations are proposed at locations with maximum coverage of water supply within the network and maximum violation for average water age and constituent concentrations.</jats:p>",

The increasing disaggregation and dispersal of supply chains is profoundly affecting the geographical distribution of value added, input costs and profits of multinational firms. This suggests that understanding supply chains and where the activities and accounting for these activities take place is crucial for understanding the causes and consequences of contemporary globalization.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– By using a case study of a single product and invoice-level data, it was possible to capture the actual costs incurred by a firm using a relatively simple global supply chain. The authors show how corporate intra-firm transfer pricing determines which business unit and location captures profits. A single firm provided the core data in this paper, including product- and firm-level information on intermediate product prices and input costs for all internal transfers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– This paper advances interesting insights into trade in value added and shows that, though not often considered significant, transfer pricing is a critical issue for understanding the geographical distribution of value added. The authors conclude with some observations about the nature of global supply chains, the value of international trade statistics and a hidden advantage of an integrated firm operating on a global scale the ability to somewhat arbitrarily select the activities to which profits should be allocated. For nation states, as supply chains become more international and complex, critical measures, such as gross domestic product, worker productivity, etc., are becoming ever more imprecise. The economic geography of cost of inputs and profits continue to separate as multinational enterprises drive the disaggregation of value creation and value capture.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The case study facilitates an understanding of complex supply chain issues, thereby extending and deepening findings from previous research. This case study of transfer pricing in supply chains will assist other scholars in better formulating testable propositions for their studies and sensitize them to the internal complexities corporate managers face when making operationalizing decisions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The case study suggests that understanding the configuration of and accounting in supply chains is vital for accurately measuring any national economic statistics. This case study provides some bottom-up evidence that national accounts and international trade economics undertaken without a deep understanding of supply chain organization is likely to generate misleading results. The methodology of using invoice-level data can provide a more granular understanding of how supply chains are organized and where the value is added and captured. For practitioners, the data suggest that firms should think very carefully about which of their activities generate the most value, and value those accordingly.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We studied hydraulic data and customer contact records of 44 real bursts for a better understanding of the phenomena. We found that most bursts were reported to the water company shortly after the beginning, and the negative consequences of the bursts were limited. However, smaller bursts that stayed unnoticed for a longer time period or larger bursts that began in the late evening or in the night were problematic to the water company that had no burst detection method installed. Detection of those bursts was critical to minimise the negative consequences, and a burst detection method could perform this task. We studied the relation between the size of supply area and the size of the bursts that can be detected. Therefore, we applied a heuristic burst detection method on historic datasets of eight areas varying in size between 1,500 and 48,300 connections. We found a correlation between the size of the area and the minimum detectable burst size and quickly detectable burst size. To reduce the risk of substantial water losses or damage to the urban environment, the burst detection method can effectively be applied to areas with an average demand of 150 m3/h or less.</jats:p>",

Drawing on social exchange theory, this study examines <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCM</jats:styled-content> practices that help firms to acquire better supplier resources than rival firms that source from the same supplier. We provide a clearer picture of coercive and competence power, and goodwill and competence trust as key mechanisms to improve supplier resource allocation of physical and innovation resources. We analyze survey data of 185 supplying firms using structural equation modeling. Our analyses yield several interesting findings. First, contrary to other studies, we find that coercive tactics do not necessarily affect supplier resource allocation negatively and goodwill trust does not inherently affect supplier resource allocation positively. Second, the results of a multigroup analysis indicate that the dependence of a supplier on the buying firm—in terms of share in turnover—affects the relationship between the trust dimensions and supplier resource allocation more than it does the power dimensions. Third, goodwill trust only affects supplier resource allocation when the buyer has a large share in the supplier's turnover, while competence trust is more effective if buyers account for a small share in the supplier's turnover. The contributions of our study for the supply chain management and social exchange theory literature are discussed.</jats:p>",

Coordination among supply chain stages is widely considered important for competitiveness in all sectors. Recently, SCO of the actors has been discussed as a precondition for successful implementation of SCM. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – SCO is operationalized as a two-dimensional attitudinal construct. In all, 279 German dairy farmers participated in an online-survey. By means of factor and cluster analysis and one-way analysis of variance, the relation between the two SCO dimensions and their link with willingness to implement several currently discussed SCM measures is analysed. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The SCO dimensions are not purely linearly related, as shown by three clusters with different patterns of vertical cooperation orientation and common goal orientation. No differences occur in terms of socio-economic characteristics, but the share of cooperative members varies. SCO is related to the intention to implement SCM. However, the greater the (monetary) efforts required by farmers, the lower their acceptance of an SCM measure. Trust and perception of the power relation play an important role, revealing patterns of coopetitive behaviour. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – SCO is a relatively new and little investigated construct.

The case of cellulosic bioethanol supply chains is specifically considered and the game‐theory Nash bargaining solution approach is employed to achieve fair allocation of profit among the collection facilities, biorefineries, and distribution centers. The structural advantages of certain supply chain participants can be taken into account by specifying different values of the negotiation‐power indicators in the generalized Nash‐type objective function. A solution strategy based on a logarithm transformation and a branch‐and‐refine algorithm for efficient global optimization of the resulting nonconvex MINLP problem is proposed.

This research takes a step forward to better understand the relationship between supply chain management factors and supply chain performance by incorporating these variables into the industrial landscape of electronics manufacturing in Malaysia. Specifically by using a combination model of a unified framework combining SCOR Model (Supply Chain Council, 1997) and system approach model (Min &amp;Mentzer, 2004). As such, the analysis in this study contributes to the empirical literature of supply chain management, policy progress, as well as managerial implications. The outcome of this study also signifies the contribution it has given towards a new shift in upgrading the manufacturing best practices in developing countries through effective supply chain management practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent advances in the science and technology of global supply chain management offer near–real-time demand-response systems for decision-makers across production networks. Technology is helping propel “fast fashion” and “lean manufacturing,” so that companies are better able to deliver products consumers want most. Yet companies know much less about the environmental and social impacts of their production networks. The failure to measure and manage these impacts can be explained in part by limitations in the science of sustainability measurement, as well as by weaknesses in systems to translate data into information that can be used by decision-makers inside corporations and government agencies. There also remain continued disincentives for firms to measure and pay the full costs of their supply chain impacts. I discuss the current state of monitoring, measuring, and analyzing information related to supply chain sustainability, as well as progress that has been made in translating this information into systems to advance more sustainable practices by corporations and consumers. Better data, decision-support tools, and incentives will be needed to move from simply managing supply chains for costs, compliance, and risk reduction to predicting and preventing unsustainable practices.</jats:p>",

In order to consider such situation, a two-stage DEA model is going to be extended and proposed. Frozen seafood supply chains of Thailand are presented as an application to show an efficacy and applicability of the proposed model. As a result, eleven inefficient chains have been found by using the proposed model while only six and seven inefficient chains have been found by using traditional models. We can ague that the proposed model can identify an efficiency of the realistic supply chain more sensitively than traditional models.</jats:p>"

The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the theory of the Austrian school. The first part of the article presents an influence of the supply of money on changes of categories in economy according to mainstream theories of economics. The second part discusses the essence of the strategy of monetary policy using money supply as an intermediate target from the point of view of the main trend in economics. It is demonstrated that in order to use it, two elementary conditions must be met: the function of demand for money must be at least relatively stable and the central bank must practically shape changes in the money supply at the planned level. The third part is of key importance for the purpose of this article. It involves the criticism of Friedman’s principle, i.e. a constant increase in money supply as a monetary strategy. According to the Austrian theory, an increase in the quantity of money which is not financed by voluntary savings separates the time structure of production and consumption. Thus, after the period of prosperity there a collapse in production must take place. It is also pointed out that the crisis can be postponed only when the quantity of money increases at an ever faster rate.</jats:p>",

A simplified case study based on the city of Perth, Australia was used to estimate the savings that could be achieved by water banking. Scenarios for investment in seawater desalination plants and groundwater replenishment were considered over a 20 year period of growing demand, using a Monte Carlo analysis that embedded the Markov model. An optimisation algorithm identified the minimum cost solutions that met specified criteria for supply reliability. The impact of depreciation of recharge credits was explored. The results revealed savings of more than A$1B (~US$1B) or 37% to 33% of supply augmentation costs by including water banking in aquifers for 95% and 99.5% reliability of supply respectively. When the hypothetically assumed recharge credit depreciation rate was increased from 1% p.a. to 10% p.a. savings were still 33% to 31% for the same reliabilities. These preliminary results show that water banking in aquifers has potential to offer a highly attractive solution for efficiently increasing the security of urban water supplies where aquifers are suitable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sustainable governance of water resources requires that policy makers adapt to changing environmental and socioeconomic context. The efficient management of water resources is vital for its sustainable access and use. Therefore, adequate management practices are needed. Institutional reforms governing the water sector are undergoing remarkable changes and several efforts have been made in this direction for a long time to enhance the water service level. Currently, Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani limited (KUKL) is responsible for managing urban water and sanitation service to the Kathamndu Valley. It is the public company registered under the Nepal Government’s company Act 2006 and operates under public private partnership (PPP) modality, which is a part of urban water supply sector reforms of Kathamndu Valley. However, the basic requirement of water and sanitation service level has not changed sustainably. This paper focused to understand the institutional structure of the reforms and to examine the roles of institutions involved and stakeholders. This paper attempted to find out the real problem of water supply and why inadequate water service in Kathmandu valley though many institutional changes occurred. Literatures were reviewed and a descriptive, qualitative design was adopted to generate empirical data. This study finds that urban water supply sector reform of Kathmandu Valley is much closer to the Scott’s theory which consists of cognitive, normative and regulative structure and activities that work together provide stability and meaning to social behavior. However, findings are incongruent with this view point. Findings also show that focal problem of water supply is depleting water sources and widening the gap between demand and supply. Additionally, findings show that lack of coordination among stakeholders, weak institutional structure, unstable political scenario, and unplanned urbanization give rise to the problem, leading wider implications to the health of people and national economy. This paper discusses the results of the study and recommends improving the situation.

This paper also discusses when and how the government implements the policy of carbon subsidy to encourage an enterprises’ behavior of cutting carbon emission from the view of RCLSC. We provide the close form of the conditions under which the government should implement the carbon subsidy strategy and the carbon subsidy of government could increase the profits of agents of the supply chain and deduce the carbon emission of the whole supply chain simultaneously. It is found that the government should implement the carbon subsidy strategy only when the recycling price is within a certain range, and the carbon subsidy of government should be within a reasonable range.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Potassium uptake is the result of numerous simultaneous processes influencing the potassium dynamics in the rhizosphere.The presented research has focused on plant-soil interactions in the potassium supply of soil in the root environment of maize. It was assumed that: 1. roots promote the mobilization of K by the acidification of the rhizosphere soil, 2. roots increase wetting-drying cycles in their environment, and 3. soil total K content affects K release and fixation in the bulk of soil and the root environment.The promoting effect of root activity was detected on K release from soil when feldspar was added as K source to the root environment. A 2-unit reduction of soil pH multiplied K concentration in the soil solution, depending on the feldspar rate. Feldspar application significantly increased the solubility and release of potassium into the soil solution.The effect of pH reduction on the K concentration of soil solution was several magnitudes higher than that of the wetting-drying cycles both in the untreated and feldspar treated soils.Potassium uptake by maize over two generations greatly exceeded the exchangeable pool in the growing media. As a consequence of the exhaustive K uptake K release slowed down to the soil solution, as reflected in the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O extractable K and ExK contents.Significant K fixation was detected after the K removal of maize in feldspar treated soils. On the contrary, in the treatments without plants increasing feldspar rates increased both H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O extractable K and ExK contents.One-term Langmuir equation, corrected with the originally sorbed amount of K, was fitted to measured data. The maximum amount of potassium adsorption (K<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>, mg∙kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and the equilibrium constant (k) were calculated. The potassium buffering capacity was estimated at zero equilibrium concentration. Both K buffering capacity and the energy of K fixation were high for the rhizosphere soil. In rhizosphere soil samples the energy of K fixation was one magnitude higher as compared to the bulk soil and decreased substantially with feldspar addition. In soils without plants the k equilibrium constant did not change as the result of drying-wetting process only in the case of the 50% soil/feldspar mixture.In the liquid phase of the soil without feldspar application potassium concentration decreased in the one-year drying-wetting cycle, presumably it got into more strongly bounded forms in the low K status soil. In 50% feldspar enriched soil samples potassium concentration in the soil solution increased, likely as a consequence of a slow dissolution of the K content of feldspar.</jats:p>",

If VO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> rate differs between muscle’s motor units, then blood flow through capillaries supplying muscle cells must be regulated according to their metabolic activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate muscle blood flow and compare it with active muscle cell metabolic activity during muscle prolonged static voluntary contraction with different contraction forces. In this study participated 37 healthy untrained people in age 24 – 36. Investigations were performed on the forearm muscles using hand grip exercises with 10% and 15% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) Volume blood flow in the forearm segment (I) and capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) were measured using venous occlusion plethysmographic device “KPOBOTOK-4”. VO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and lactate delivery (La) were calculated from pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and lactate concentration arterio-venous differences and I in every controlled moment. pH and pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was measured using bioanaliser ABC-1”RADIOMETER”. Lactate concentration was measured using BIOSEN C-line “EKF diagnostic” device. During 10% MVC it was shown that I, VO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, La and CFC till the cessation of exercise caused by exhaustion which takes 42±1,1min stabilize on appropriate level not reaching maximal possible values. Increasing contraction force only for 5% it is to 15% MVC all examined parameters during exercise till exhaustion which takes 12±0,8 min, increases and at moment of cessation of exercise reaches their maximal values. Increasing of blood supply and VO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> during 15% MVC did not provide prolonged forearm contraction and exhaustion occurs more than 3 times quicker neither during 10% MVC.</jats:p>",

However, for organizing and improving suppliers, they should cover different groups of consumers which have different levels of environmental concerns. Despite, customers have environmentally conscious toward product and care about protecting the environment. Thus, with customer’s environmental concern, significant positive influence have been emerging from suppliers in parallel response toward environment. Although with the time passing, consumer attitude will be changed and suppliers should able to follow and respond to consumer needs. Therefore for responding these needs and decreasing the environmental impacts, supply chains are using Green Customers’ Attitude Orientation which is powerful philosophy. In this paper, have been attempted to show what consumers’ attitudes are and how they behave and act towards green products and how can improve the suppliers’ performance can be improved.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to study the possibility of optimizing the work relationships within the supply chain by defining and evaluating the core management skills and competencies, especially soft and social competencies in the logistics operational level. The method used was the interview. The results of the qualitative method used come with new information on the subject of the paper, but only from a particular perspective - the interviewed manager has more than 10 years experience in eight different Romanian companies in logistics. The paper argues, on the one hand, that the work relationships within the supply chain are influenced by the employee’ attitude towards work and, on the other hand, that the work relationships within the supply chain can be optimized by defining and evaluating job competencies.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we described the configuration of semiconductor global chain, identifying the main activities of Brazilian companies, the infrastructures involved and the influence of the industrial policies that are fostering the chain configuration. We carried out a qualitative exploratory study in order to obtain the empirical insights of the current Brazilian operations and strategies to leverage its participation in the semiconductor supply chain. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Brazilian companies already operate in some value chain activities of the semiconductor chain, especially back-end and Design, but some elements that are constraints to move up in this market were identified: the lack of a national infrastructure, experienced labor, and a proper industrial policy to leverage this economic sector, motivating new ventures, developing national production and attracting foreign companiesDOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n1p68-84URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n1p68-84</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Australia has seen an unprecedented proliferation in large scale water recycling schemes since the late 1990s. This has been driven by a recent decade of drought, policies to encourage water efficiency in new homes and buildings in urban areas, and to reduce pressure on rain-fed water supplies by replacement with alternate water sources in rural areas. Underpinning these drivers are principles of economic and environmental sustainability and protection of public health. National guidelines for recycling of treated sewage, released in 2006, replaced an approach using prescriptive end point water quality targets, with a 12-step risk-based framework for the planning and operation of Australian water recycling schemes. Essential to this risk-based approach is an understanding of the sewage treatment system and assessing the risks in the catchment, the treatment process, distribution system and end use environment. Inherent also in this process is the identification of critical control points with tangible operational targets for pre-empting, preventing and correcting off-spec conditions before they derail a scheme. Validation of systems through microbial log reduction targets for indicator viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths, differentiated according to end use and expected exposures, may be obtained through treatment, site controls or a combination of both. Drawing on case studies from the Australian states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld), this paper gives insight to preventative risk management of water recycling schemes with typical risk profiles. Some advantages and disadvantages of the guideline approach are considered. The information paints a picture of the industry's risk management obligations in the planning phase and may be of use to practitioners in other regions where planning for safe and sustainable water recycling is developing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper proposes a AC and DC mixed output VPS(vehicle power supply). It is composed of a two-stage circuit with the input stage and the output stage. The input stage contains a single-phase PWM inverter, a HFT (high-frequency transformer) and an uncontrolled rectifier. The single-phase PWM inverter adopts the open-loop control strategy to convert the low DC voltage into a high-frequency one with square wave. The HFT enhances the voltage and insulates the low-voltage side from the high-voltage side. The uncontrolled rectifier transforms the square voltage into DC voltage. In the output stage, one output uses single-phase PWM inverter and the other uses a DC chopper, both of which adopt the double-loop PWM control mode. The mode consists of an outer voltage loop and an inner current loop to produce desirable voltage and power. With the two-stage control strategy, ideal output currents and the output voltages are obtained, and the input power factor is controllable. The VPS model is established on MATLAB/SIMULINK, and this system is also implemented in laboratory based on DSP TMS320F28335. The results of simulation and experiment verify the proposed VPS system.</jats:p>"

Many inmates report having injected drugs and using cannabis. Prison authorities employed a range of strategies to detect drugs and drug use in prison. However, it was unclear which supply reduction strategies operated, and the prevalence and types of drugs detected in Australian prisons. The purpose of this paper is to examine supply reduction strategies in Australian prisons. Information on searches for drugs, and from inmate urinalysis was collected. The study focussed on adults in fulltime custody in Australia in 2009. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A representative of all corrective services departments and justice health services was asked to complete a questionnaire on supply reduction strategies, including searches for drugs and drug testing of inmates. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The two main supply reduction strategies identified in all Australian prisons were the use of drug detection dogs and urinalysis programs. Despite an extensive use of drug searches and urinalysis, the detection of drugs was modest for both strategies. The most commonly used drug was cannabis with the detection of drugs such as amphetamines and heroin being very low. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Prison inmates have a history of high levels of drug use prior to imprisonment.

Both measures were employed extensively across the country and finds of drugs and drug use were relatively low. Two possible conclusions can be drawn; that either drug use was very low in prison or that it was well concealed from the authorities. A comparison of random testing with targeted testing of inmates, where the former yields fewer positive results shows drug use was likely to be low rather than well concealed.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

A prototype of a novel wireless energy transmission system aimed at the use with wireless aircraft structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor nodes is described. The system uses ultrasonic guided plate waves (Lamb waves) to transmit energy along an aluminium plate, similar to those used in aircraft structures. Three types of piezoelectric transducers generating and receiving the ultrasonic vibration were compared. The Smart Material MFC M8528-P1 was found to achieve the best performance, allowing the transmission of 17 mW across a 54 cm distance, while being driven with a 20 V signal. Laser vibrometer imaging and LISA software simulation of the Lamb wave propagation in the experimental plate were also performed. Based on these, ideas for a further development of the system were proposed.</jats:p>",

The need to sustain the rapid growth of China’s economy has made coal the natural choice due to its mass production and low cost of coal mines. This article uses GM (1, 1) model to predict China’s coal supply from 2013 to 2020. The results showed that the coal supply will increase smoothly during this time. However, the demand will increase even at a faster pace. The predicted gap between the supply and demand of year 2015 will be 720 million tons. Coal is a non-renewable energy resource. It generates tremendous amount of hazardous emission during the course of combustion. Increasing coal supply alone will produce significant pollution and deplete coal mines reserve. Therefore, it has become urgent to establish a reasonably balanced energy consumption structure that can meet the needs of social and economic development in China. The policy implications and possible measures are proposed in this article.</jats:p>"

Previous efforts to do so have started from the assumption that each conflict was a priori the same or similar. In addition, both wars have been placed into a separate category of analysis from other wars, leading to analyses that have characterised the wars together as disorganized guerrilla campaigns or examples of ancient marronage. In this paper I argue, by contrast, that we must consider the two conflicts as separate entities, and that we must approach their study as we would any other wars. By studying the rebel strategies of each war in terms of their relationships with the geography of Sicily and the logistics of warfare I contend that the two wars were fought in contrasting manners, with the method used in the first being highly strategic, and in the second confused and ineffectual.</jats:p>",

Measurements showed that the oil inflow rate, the shaft speed and the nozzle diameter have a strong influence on the collected oil quantity, which is expressed as catch efficiency, i.e. the ratio of collected and supplied oil. The impingement angle was also identified to have a strong influence on the catch efficiency. The ratio of the momentum fluxes of supplied oil and chamber air flow is proposed as a parameter to correlate the catch efficiency to the operating conditions.</jats:p>",

The main goal of this work was to investigate the effects of irrigation on the content and composition of carotenoids and tocopherols in an orange-colored carrot cultivar (Bangor) compared with a rain-fed control. The experiment was conducted for 2 years with a considerably different amount of precipitation during the growing season (576 mm in 2010 and 190 mm in 2011). Six carotenoids and four tocopherols were detected and quantitatively determined. Significant negative correlations were found between water supply and content of total carotenoids and total tocopherols. Irrigation significantly decreased the concentrations of these phytonutrients during the arid year of 2011. Water supply did not affect the carotenoid and the tocopherol composition, which can be an important factor for functional food manufacturers. A significant positive correlation was found between total carotenoid and total tocopherol concentrations, which is very favorable from a nutritional point of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Sediments are fundamental for the function of oligotrophic coral reef ecosystems because they are major places for organic matter recycling. The Tayrona National Natural Park (TNNP, Colombian Caribbean) is located between the population center Santa Marta (&gt;455 000 inhabitants) in the southwest and several river mouths in the east. Here, coral reef sediments experience pronounced changes in environmental conditions due to seasonal coastal upwelling, but knowledge of relevant spatiotemporal effects on organic matter supply to the sediments and recycling processes is not available. Therefore, sediment traps were deployed monthly over 14 months complemented by assessment of sedimentary properties (e.g., porosity, grain size, content of particulate organic matter and pigments) and sedimentary O2 demand (SOD) at water-current-exposed and sheltered sites along distance gradients (12–20 km) to Santa Marta and the eastern river mouths (17–27 km). Findings revealed that seasonal upwelling delivered strong (75–79% of annual supply) pulses of labile organic matter mainly composed of fresh phytoplankton detritus (C : N ratio 6–8) to the seafloor. Sedimentary chlorophyll a contents and SOD increased significantly with decreasing distance to the eastern rivers, but only during upwelling. This suggests sedimentary organic matter supply controlled by nutrient-enriched upwelling waters and riverine runoff rather than by the countercurrent-located city of Santa Marta. Organic matter pulses led to significantly higher SOD (more than 30%) at the water-current-sheltered sites as compared to the exposed sites, ensuing a rapid recycling of the supplied labile organic matter in the permeable silicate reef sands.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Financial market participants are adjusting to a raft of new requirements that form part of the G20’s agreement to initiate substantial reform of the derivatives market following the global financial crisis. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the Pittsburg summit, the industry is transitioning from a period of rule writing and lobbying to one of implementation. The scope of the derivatives reform programme is unprecedented in the financial markets, both in scale and detail. Its effect will be far reaching and its requirements will force all market participants — on the buy and sell side — to review their overall use of derivatives, margin requirements and use of collateral, and consider the potential impact of new regulations to their trading and operations. Improving oversight, rather than banning the use of derivatives, is the most sensible way of addressing the failings of the market and the build-up of systemic risk. However, firms now attempting to comply with this changed regulatory environment are concerned about their ability to meet new demands. The key to doing so is to understand the holistic impact of the reform — which is no mean feat — and to prepare by leveraging sophisticated technology offerings as well as community based and infrastructure solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>South Africa (RSA) is a water scarce country challenged with transforming its unsustainably resource-intensive economy whilst also addressing the legacy of Apartheid. The adequate provision of water to RSA's citizens is one of the most significant challenges facing the country – and if a water crisis is to be averted, existing systems will need to be managed effectively. This will include ensuring that the plans and strategies within each sector related to water management – e.g. the National Development Plan (NDP) and the National Water Resource Strategy 2 (NWRS-2) – are aimed towards a common goal. This paper introduces a framework for achieving water sensitive settlements in RSA; defines what ‘water sensitivity’ means within the SA context; and discusses the relevance of this framework in relation to the NWRS-2 and the NDP, both of which could be seen as providing a complementary vision for the management of specific aspects of water resources management in RSA. The paper concludes by motivating for the adoption of the framework as a means of meeting the challenges facing the urban water management sector in SA and the goals embedded in the NDP and NWRS-2.</jats:p>",

This is because the fields and reservoirs that would be considered for EOR projects are generally in an advanced state of delineation and there has been experience derived from production data for some time. Considering the scope/applicability of carbon dioxide EOR (CO2-EOR), the revitalization of such projects in T&amp;T would aid in extending the use of CO2 to another purpose, given its useful properties and behaviour, before being emitted to the atmosphere.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Five CO2 EOR pilot projects were implemented in South Trinidad, starting in the early 1970's. At that time, as it is now, Trinidad had abundant CO2 available as a waste product from the ammonia manufacturing operations at the Point Lisas Industrial Estate (PLIE), Central Trinidad. At present, consideration is being made for the reintroduction of CO2 pipeline transport, directed to suitable EOR candidate sites mainly in South Trinidad, focusing once more on CO2 sourced from the PLIE.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Det Norske Veritas (DNV) has introduced a Recommended Practice (RP) on the Design and Operation of CO2 Pipelines (RP-J202), incorporating lessons learned from existing CO2 pipelines around the world. This RP provides guidance for managing risks and uncertainties during the lifecycle of a CO2 pipeline, including design, testing, inspection, operation, maintenance, and de-commissioning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will use DNV-RP-J202 to present a guiding framework for the possible re-qualification of sections of the existing CO2 pipeline network in Trinidad for the reintroduction of safe and efficient CO2 pipeline operations. The re-qualification process entails the following steps: Initiation, Integrity Assessment, Hydraulic Analysis, Safety Evaluation, Premises, Re-assessment, Modification Alternative(s), Documentation and Implementation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>On completion of the re-qualification process, the majority of the pipeline system may not be acceptable for reintroduction of CO2.

According to optimization theory, it establishes the target functions of retailer and strategic customers and investigates the interactions between retailer and strategic customers in accordance with Stackelberg’s game theory, so as to confirm the optimal discount level for green products. In addition, it discusses the regulatory effect of government intervention, including the guiding price and fiscal subsides, on the sales of green products. The research shows that the retailer can make the profit maximization by adjusting the discount level; the governments can regulate the sales of products by implementing the guiding price and fiscal subsides to the retailer.</jats:p>",

An adoption model with profitability and risk considerations distinguishes between the two margins, where the intensive margin results from direct ‘gene’ impacts and higher complimentary input use, and the extensive margin reflects the growing range of lands that become profitable with the GE technology. We identify yield increases from cross-country time series variation in GE adoption share within the main GE crops – cotton, corn and soybeans. We find that GE increased yields 34 per cent for cotton, 12 per cent for corn and 3 per cent for soybeans. We then estimate the quantity of extensive margin lands from year-to-year changes in traditional and GE planted area. If all production on the extensive margin is attributed to GE technology, the supply effect of GE increases from 5 per cent to 12 per cent for corn, 15 per cent to 20 per cent for cotton, and 2 per cent to 40 per cent for soybeans, generating significant downward pressure on prices. Finally, we compute ‘saved’ lands and greenhouse gases as the difference between observed hectarage per crop and counterfactual hectarage needed to generate the same output without the yield boost from GE. We find that altogether, GE saved 13 million hectares of land from conversion to agriculture in 2010, and averted emissions are equivalent to roughly one-eighth of the annual emissions from automobiles in the US.</jats:p>",

Using solar power meter can detect changes curve of light intensity so as to obtain parameters for the simulation, and then we can establish the photovoltaic array simulation model to gain the three actual tracking power curves of the combined algorithm, the perturbation method and the incremental conductance method and stabilize the best output voltage of solar cells while using Buck Circuit to reduce voltage to charge for nickel-cadmium accumulator pack. As a result, the system can achieve the uttermost steady operation with the reliability improved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain is a network of different business units which focuses on integration among all units in order to produce and distribute end products to the customer. Nowadays, due to increased uncertainty in customer demand, it is necessary to be sure that the supply chain networks operate as efficient as possible in order to satisfy the customer demand at the lowest cost. Enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain necessitates the interaction between different members of the supply chain which can be achieved through supply chain management. Hence, the development of modeling approach in order to understand and analyze the dynamic behavior of supply chains is brought into consideration. This paper proposes a system dynamic simulation model for manufacturing supply chain. System dynamic is used as suitable method to understand and analyze the interactions of various components via feedback structure. The objective of this paper is to simulate the manufacturing supply chain of an electronic manufacturing company in Malaysia. The simulation model is used to study the system’s behavior (in terms of production rate, inventory levels, and backlog orders) under two different operational conditions (named as fixed and varied capacity policies) and compare their efficiency in terms of total cost. The analysis shows that the proposed operational condition, which is varied capacity policy, improves the system efficiency in terms of cost.</jats:p>"

Currently there is no theoretical method for estimating the duration of the concrete pouring process. Normally, the maximum capacity of pumping facilities on construction sites is not used, and concrete pumps are idle for a considerable time as a result of the arrival of concrete trucks being delayed. In the light of this issue, this paper considers the supply chain parameters of Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC) as a means of solving this problem. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is hired for modelling/predicting the productivity of a concrete operation. The proposed model is tested with a real database of an RMC in the Sydney metropolitan area that has 17 depots and around 200 trucks. Results show that there is an improvement in the achieved results when these are compared to the results of relevant studies that only considered the construction parameters for predicting the productivity of concrete operations</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil supply pockets are essential parts for the functionality of journal bearings, because mixing and oil carry-over issues are substantially dominated by these design features. In recent years, the great potential of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been recognized. An extensive analysis of the turbulent multiphase flow phenomena including cavitation has been reported for a whole gas and steam turbine journal bearing (GT2012). Furthermore, the complex structure of the turbulent flow in an oil supply pocket has been investigated numerically and validated by Laser-Doppler-Anemometry (LDA) measurements (GT2013). The interaction between oil supply jets with the main flow and the effective mixing behavior remained as challenging tasks. Therefore this study focused on this interaction by means of an up-scaled geometry and a full scale journal bearing. Due to the upscaled geometry, it was possible to assess the flow phenomena experimentally. An extensive CFD analysis including large eddy simulation (LES) was conducted and validated by flow visualizations. The influence of geometric features and performance parameters was investigated. It was found, that even minor changes of the inflow conditions could lead to measurable effects with regard to mixing and oil carry-over behavior.</jats:p>",

We show that price distortions decrease as consumers' travel cost between retailers increases, due to less intense competition. However, price distortions do not change monotonically in consumers' switching cost between products within stores. To fix decentralized retailers' price distortions, we construct a two‐part pricing contract that coordinates the supply chain. We show that the coordinating contract is Pareto‐improving and analyze increase in the supply chain profit under coordination.</jats:p>",

To assess the differences between conventional and advanced control, we examined operational data of water treatment plantGruszczyn that supplies drinking water to a part of the city of Poznań, Poland. We compared two periods of three weeks of conventional and advanced control. The comparison showed that with advanced control the variation in the production flow was 83% lower, and the pump pressure of the clear water pumps was 29% lower.

In order to provide a detailed insight into the contribution of pork production, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of average German pork production was performed. In this way, the global warming potential was estimated at 3·22 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-eq/kg pork, eutrophication at 23·3 g PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-eq and acidification at 57·1 g SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-eq. The functional unit was 1 kg pork as a slaughter weight. The analysis aimed at identifying those farm parameters which had most impact on the LCA results. For that purpose, a deterministic pig farm model was developed which reflected all the processes of a pig farm, while focusing on five distinct areas: general farm information, biological performance, basic feed data, manure management and resource use and emissions. In this way, it was possible to vary the level of performance parameters from farrowing (piglet losses and number of piglets born alive per litter) and finishing stage (lean-meat content, daily weight gain, animal losses and feed conversion ratio). The number of piglets born alive, the lean-meat content and the feed conversion ratio were identified as having the greatest influence on the results. In comparison with average pork production, the values of the impact categories increased and decreased by up to 4·7%. The results show that the fertility of sows and the feed management of finishers should be optimized to mitigate environmental impacts at pig farm level.</jats:p>",

This article demonstrates, with location quotient and hot‐spot analyses, the unevenness of general dentist and dental specialist resources throughout the Canadian province of Ontario and the presence of “dental clusters” within the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Windsor. While many municipalities in the province have no or relatively few dental offices, municipalities that are comparatively rich in both general and specialized dentists are rare and tend to be part of larger urban environments (typically census metropolitan areas), characterized by higher growth rates, higher median incomes, and lower median ages. Dentist office hot‐spots within metropolitan areas occur in or near the downtown and in more peripheral/suburban locales. “High sales” dentist offices in suburban hot‐spots appear to benefit from prosperous locations and supply deficits nearby, whereas inner‐city “dentist districts” may form in part because of localization economies. Understanding where relative dentist under‐supply occurs within a jurisdiction and why other locations are dentist‐rich is important from a policy perspective so that geographic inequities, and associated spatial accessibility issues, can be more comprehensively appraised.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Operations managers are faced with many barriers in implementing SCM, particularly in developing economies such as South Africa. It is essential for managers of SMEs to know the key barriers and attempt to minimize them and improve competitive strength. This article presents the SCM implementation barriers and suggests significant variations between these barriers as well as their impact on the business performance of SMEs. Researchers and trained fieldworkers gathered the needed data through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires, obtaining a total of 249 usable questionnaires. The data analysis included frequencies, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in Amos 5, and structural equation modelling (SEM) run LISREL 8.8. The results revealed that the lack of economies of scale, poor organisation structures, and technological challenges are the major limitations to implementing SCM. The findings of this research provide invaluable information to scholars and researchers investigating the barriers of SCM implementation, and to SMEs managers who desire to implement SCM. The findings can assist the development of effective strategic and operational plans as well as to programs and projects designed to enhance SCM within SMEs in South Africa. The research paper concludes by discussing both academic and managerial implications of the results, providing future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Minerals are vital to support economic growth and the functioning of modern society. Demand for minerals is increasing as global population expands and minerals are used in a greater range of applications, particularly associated with the deployment of new technologies. While concerns about future mineral scarcity have been expressed, these are generally unfounded and based on over-simplistic analysis. This paper considers recent debate around security of mineral supply and technical, geosciences-based options to improve utilization of the resource base and contribute to replenishing reserves. History suggests that increasing demand for minerals and higher prices will generally lead to technological and scientific innovation that results in new or alternative sources of supply. Recent assessments of global mineral endowment suggest that society should be optimistic about its ability to meet future demand for minerals, provided that there is continued innovation and investment in science and technology. Reducing energy consumption and breaking the current link between metal production and greenhouse gas emissions are among the greatest challenges to secure a sustainable mineral supply. However, widespread adoption of low-carbon mineral extraction technologies, underpinned by multidisciplinary research, and increased global utilization of low-carbon energy sources will allow these challenges to be met.</jats:p>",

This characteristic affects the service life of the electron gun and the quality of the smelting. To solve the above problems, a high frequency resonant converter has been used in high voltage power supply, reduced the volume of power supply and the switching loss, and achieved rapid protection and restart.

Based of 174 Brazilian companies and a total of 312 respondents, the analysis use CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) to validate the measurement of constructs and multiple regressions to analyze the relationship between practices of buyer-supplier dyad and financial performance. Our results showed a positive relationship dimension--strategic sourcing and buyer-supplier relationships--with the company's financial performance. However, the supplier evaluation system showed no statistically significant relationship. The findings reinforce the lack of formalization in the buyer-supplier relationship, a situation that often hinders the development of a long-term relationship. The lack of systematic evaluations of supplier performance can generate insecurity in the relationship, since historical actions taken by suppliers could serve as a criterion of choice in a future negotiation. As practical contributed to this study, it is expected that managers understand the importance of buyer-supplier relationship to the company's financial performance.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n1p30-46URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n1p30-46</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research focuses on the problem of powering a remote and mobile satellite ground station, where utility power is unavailable. It focuses on the use of photovoltaic energy, which is now widely accepted as an alternative source of energy. However, PV suffers from low conversion efficiency, non-linear I-V characteristics, which depend on temperature changes and the earth rotation. The research focuses on accurate determination of the ground station power budget whose total power demand involves an azimuth and rotator function and a current which varies depending on the stages of communication with the satellite. The power budget is used to determine the size, the ratings of solar generators, batteries and the system components. With the aid of a power logger, the PV voltage, the battery voltage, the AC voltage and PV power output is analysed for varying satellite loads. The data is analysed by taking into account the solar irradiation level on the day of measurement and the percentage cloud cover. This method is found to improve the reliability and can be adopted to improve reliability of standalone PV systems. The results are vital in PV power management and design.</jats:p>"

Although the manufacturer decides the product quality with an associated cost, the retailer decides the retail price. We aim to study and compare different contract formats for this decentralized supply chain. There is a trade‐off in the choice of contracts: simpler format contract (with a few parameters) is less complicated, but the contract efficiency is low. We start with the simplest one‐parameter contract: a wholesale price contract that serves as the benchmark. We then study how contract efficiency can be improved by adding one more parameter. Specifically, we consider three two‐parameter contracts that are commonly used in reality: two‐part tariff contract, revenue‐sharing contract, and effort cost sharing contract. We find that the contract efficiency is improved under all the three contracts, but in different ways: the improvement in contract efficiency under each of them dominates the other two when manufacturer's quality improvement effectiveness is relatively low, moderate, and high, respectively. Furthermore, through numerical examples, we find that under some cases, a choice from these three two‐parameter contracts can achieve a close‐to‐perfect efficiency (&gt;85%). Finally, we investigate whether a combination of the three two‐parameter contracts can achieve coordination. Interestingly, we find that only the combination of effort cost sharing contract and revenue‐sharing contract can achieve coordination, whereas combinations of either of them and two‐part tariff contract cannot.</jats:p>",

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) strong enough to create electromagnetic effects at latitudes below the auroral oval are frequent events that could soon have substantial impacts on electrical grids. Modern society's heavy reliance on these domestic and international networks increases our susceptibility to such a severe space weather event. Using a new high-resolution model of the global economy we simulate the economic impact of strong CMEs for 3 different planetary orientations. We account for the economic impacts within the countries directly affected as well as the post-disaster economic shock in partner economies linked by international trade. For a 1989 Quebec-like event the global economic impacts would range from USD 2.4 to 3.4 trillion over a year. Of this total economic shock about 50% would be felt in countries outside the zone of direct impact, leading to a loss in global GDP of 3.9 to 5.6%. The global economic damages are of the same order as wars, extreme financial crisis and estimated for future climate change.\n                        </jats:p>"

In order to detect P. aeruginosa in bottled water in Sri Lanka, 36 bottled water brands were collected randomly from retail and supermarkets island wide. P. aeruginosa was detected by the membrane filtration technique, using cetrimide agar supplemented with nalidixic acid. The isolates were subjected to confirmatory tests, viz: ISO 16266:2006 methods and growth at 4 and 42°C, and API 20NE followed by DNA sequencing. Presumptive isolates of P. aeruginosa were observed on cetrimide agar in 50% of brands. Among these isolates, ISO procedures confirmed 58% as P. aeruginosa. Thirty-nine randomly selected isolates were identified as P. aeruginosa by the API 20NE, three of which were further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The presence of P. aeruginosa in bottled water raises health concerns since P. aeruginosa is an indicator of inferior water quality. Therefore, strict regulations and regular monitoring of bottling plants are recommended in order to supply safe and acceptable bottled drinking water to the Sri Lankan market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Making concurrent decisions on assembly plans and supply chain configurations is a desirable strategy in today’s competitive global market. Such concurrent decisions help reduce decision iterations for shortened lead time, and lower the total cost for manufacturers and their supply chains. However, there lacks deep understanding of the interaction of assembly plans and supply chain configurations, as well as methodologies for integrating them. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously decomposing an assembly product to modules and assigning the modules to suppliers. The joint decision is formulated as an optimization problem of finding the assembly decomposition and the corresponding supply chain network with the lowest total supply chain cost. We develop a coordinated decision making method by integrating assembly AND/OR graphs with supply chain cost information. A Dynamic Programming (DP) based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the combined optimization problem. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can find optimal solutions to the integrated decision making problem efficiently and provide a tool to plan assemblies from the perspective of the total supply chain cost in the early stages of product development.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the supply chain risk management (SCRM) has been a prominent field because it suggests strategies and action plans to mitigate these risks. On the other hand, it is observed that the coopetition concept advocates that two competing organizations can work together in some activities in the form of a strategic alliance, contributing to achieve maximum efficiency. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose the extension of this concept into the activities of SCRM, treating coopetition as an action that can be added to the risk management efforts in order to make supply chains more resilient. Thus, through an exploratory literature search that uses secondary data, we drawn two propositions that deal with the possibility of adding a coopetitor to reduce risks in supply chains and on the feasibility of balanced coopetition changes the profile of a supply chain to a resilient model. Although these propositions require further empirical verification, it is believed that this is a good start for discussions about the benefits and competitive advantages that the adoption of coopetition in risk management activities in supply chains can bring to organizations.</jats:p>"

The factors that contributed to the uncertainty have to be understood in order to manage it in the best and practical ways. Uncertainty in an Oil &amp; Gas firm propagates through the supply chain network including vessel sourcing activities that involved offshore transportation and installation activities. It is important to have a sustainable and reliable vessel supply in supporting offshore activities. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of uncertainty in supply chain management process of vessels in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry. This research is conducted by analysing quantitative data from vessel sourcing database focuses on uncertainty recorded from January to August 2012. It has been found that, the major causes of uncertainty is due to the unavailability of vessel with 51% of causes of uncertainty recorded. This is due to the increment of vessel utilization from year 2011 to 2012. However the uncertainty can be appropriately managed by implementing product departmentalization instead of customer departmentalization which is currently practiced by the firm under study. It can be concluded that, there are four factors that contributed to uncertainty which are vessels availability, project management plan, project requirement, and vendor reliability.</jats:p>"

A PSA is a prenegotiated percentage of a multisourced part’s total demand, which should be provided by a supplier. For parts within Dell’s supply chain for which these practices are applicable, we provide a framework to implement pull-based replenishments, verify its feasibility, and demonstrate the potential benefits via simulation. Specifically, we investigate two decisions to meet customer demand and PSAs with minimal inventory: (1) how to allocate actual customer demand among multiple suppliers, and (2) what guidelines Dell should specify to suppliers for VMI hub replenishments. For demand allocations, we propose a consumption cycle based on the PSAs. We consider a heuristic replenishment policy and develop an algorithm to compute the policy parameters, which can be used as supplier guidelines. The proposed approach presents a significant opportunity for cost savings. Dell used the results of this project (1) to address skepticism toward a pull-based approach in managing VMI replenishments, (2) to gain stakeholder support to implement a pull-based approach, and (3) to emphasize the need for a change in Dell’s philosophy on managing demand allocations to suppliers and VMI hub replenishments. </jats:p>",

At the same time the adequacy of results that can be obtained, depends largely on the similarity degree of the physical model to real system. From the standpoint of the traction asynchronous electric drive (TAED) research together with the traction power supply system research, the similarity can not be determined by the direct proportion of the parameters, because the processes nature accompanying the operation of these systems is non-linear. These features should be taken into account in the experimental setup, the basis for constructing of which is establishing of the system similarity that defines the purpose of this paper. Methodology. At the heart of the experimental setup creation laid reproduction of processes of energy transformation in the system of the DC traction power supply. Determination of the similarity degree of the proposed facility to the real system was carried out using the basic theorems of the similarity theory, their additional provisions on the complexity and nonlinear systems, as well as elements of mathematical analysis. Findings. According to the results of work: 1) The block diagram, the energy conversion mechanism of which is similar to the real system was received. This scheme is the basis of experimental setup, built in the future for the study of electromagnetic compatibility of TAED in the structure of DC traction electric power supply system. 2) Similarity of obtained structural scheme with the real system with the mechanism definition of calculating the scaling relations was established. Originality. In the process of establishing the similarity a simplified method for determining the scaling relations for nonlinear systems was suggested. They are identical in their structure components, but have different capacities. Practical value. Experimental research of electromagnetic compatibility of TAED in the structure of traction power DC system using the elements of similarity theory will provide more adequate results and, as a consequence, create preconditions for further improvement process of the aggregate related systems functioning of electrified railways.</jats:p>"

Significant trends for the period 2011–2030 were simulated and the water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) of the LRB and its trends over the next 30 years were analyzed. The results indicate a decreasing trend of WRCC in the basin and that current economic growth is not sustainable. The study investigated possible optimized allocation projects. The most apt project would involve a combination of strategies that could considerably increase the WRCC, reduce demand, and improve water quality.</jats:p>",

This was attributed to demand weakness, profitability challenges, and supply chain inefficiencies. The focus of our study was on hardwood sawmills in New York State. A supply chain assessment tool was created to evaluate the supply chain processes of 15 sawmills that had the capability to produce from 3 to 20 million board feet of lumber per year and accounted for 31 percent of the hardwood lumber produced in New York. We collected data that allowed us to rate each sawmill's supply chain and computed their relative efficiency using a mathematical modeling technique called Data Envelopment Analysis. We then used a Pearson correlation analysis to compare our sawmill assessment scores and the relative efficiency score from each sawmill and found a significant correlation of 0.716. The assessment tool we developed can help hardwood sawmills find opportunities to improve their supply chains, allowing their business to save money and improve profit margins.</jats:p>",

In this part, a grey prediction method was used to predict missing values and then, on the basis of an entropy-weighting method, to build a dynamic weight model which continually changes with time; finally, a fuzzy evaluation method was used to evaluate groundwater quality. MATLAB was used to integrate these mathematical models. The second part describes the construction of a dynamic simulation platform which integrated mathematical models, a property database, and a spatial database, with secondary developments in geographic information system (GIS) and cloud-based simulation technology. All calculation steps and simulation programs were carried out on the simulation platform. The results indicated the grade of groundwater quality between II and IV. Groundwater quality gradually rose in the first and fourth quarters, but continually decreased in the second and third quarters. The lowest groundwater-quality value for the entire year appeared in October. This result also illustrates that turning points in groundwater quality appear when groundwater levels increase or decrease along rivers.</jats:p>",

This study aims to identify if and how the institutional environment affects the FF R&amp;D initiatives in Brazil. Data were collected through personal in-depth interviews with FF chain members (experts; industries; regulatory agency) and analyzed through content analysis. Three main agents were identified in the FF R&amp;D initiatives: food manufacturer, functional component suppliers and universities. Results show a negative impact of resolutions proposed by the regulatory agency in these initiatives, but also highlight the importance of institutional factors as drivers to the innovation process. A clearer legislation is needed in order to facilitate innovations in the food sector. Moreover, the selection of the most promising partnerships can help to minimize uncertainties involved in those initiatives. Further researches on measuring the regulation impact on the innovation initiatives are suggested.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n1p1-14URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n1p1-14</jats:p>"

While there are several ongoing humanitarian efforts and initiatives, we believe there is a new opportunity to coordinate “last mile” humanitarian efforts in the event of a flood using micro‐retailers. Because micro‐retailers are the “last mile” nodes in traditional retail supply chains in many Asian countries, we propose the use of social enterprise to buttress these supply chains for distribution of essential goods by coordinating with micro‐retailers before and after floods. We also present a stylized model to quantify the benefits of doing so. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> School feeding is an established development aid intervention with multiple objectives including education, nutrition, and value transfer. Traditionally run by international organizations in low‐income settings, school feeding programs have had a substantial impact in many less‐developed countries. However, recent rethinking by the World Bank and the World Food Programme has prompted a shift toward long‐term, sustainable solutions that rely more upon local resources, local capacity, and community participation. Supply chain management, which is critical to program delivery, is vital to developing a sustainable approach to school feeding. We propose a theoretical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that shape the supply chain and connects them to the objectives and performance measures of sustainable programs. Drawing upon supply chain management theory, current school feeding practices, and expert feedback, this article contributes to development aid logistics and program transitioning with a focus on sustainable program design. It aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to school feeding and relevant supply chain issues, a framework to identify sustainability problems in school feeding supply chains, and a starting point for further research on program design. </jats:p>",

The possibility of effective operation of a fuel cell module on hydrogen-containing fuel (received from biogas) with the residual content of methane and the possibility of reach modes of effective use of fuel were confirmed. The consumption mixture with residual methane (2% vol.) is comparable (within 5%) with the required amount of hydrogen produced by electrolysis to generate the identical power at a predetermined time interval.

The findings show that the main determinant of beef cattle growth and Brazilian beef exports is increased animal stock. Furthermore, productivity has a positive, albeit more modest, effect on beef production and exports. The results show that the increase of the number of cattle reduces costs to the farmer and retail beef prices.</jats:p>",

Ice loads on the ship hull and propulsion system were measured concurrently with ice-thickness and whole-body vibration comfort for controlled maneuvers in a level ice field. These measurements were aimed at establishing the links between ice-properties, hull- and shaft loads and the vibration feedback received by the operator of the vessel. Results indicate that maneuvers significantly increase the frequency and magnitude of ice loads at the stern shoulder area as well as the ice impacts on the propellers. The number of ice impacts on the instrumented port side shaft line increased for turning maneuvers in a starboard direction. Occupants on the Bridge did not receive feedback through vibration transmission from ice impacts on the hull as a time-history of discrete events. Instead, ice passage excites the global bending modes of the vessel. Blade impacts between ice debris and the propellers are however perceivably transmitted to vessel operators. Although vibration exposure on the bridge is increased by operations in ice subjective experiences of vibration did not reach levels that caused discomfort.</jats:p>",

Confronted with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content> emission reductions targets of 80–95% by 2050 and with some <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content> emitting sectors confronted with great difficulties to reach such targets, such as agriculture, the power sector will need to reduce its <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content> emissions virtually to zero. As nuclear energy involves very substantial accident risks and the unsolved problem of safe long‐term deposit of nuclear waste and as carbon dioxide capture and storage (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CCS</jats:styled-content>) has rather limited safe storage potentials at least in Europe, the question arises, whether it will be possible to supply 100% of all necessary electricity from renewable energy sources? We show that a fast expanding volume of analyses underlines the feasibility and reliability of 100% renewable electricity supply systems. This fast mounting evidence appears to mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in energy politics, as highly regarded national and international advisory bodies such as the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IPCC</jats:styled-content> or the German Council of Environmental Advisors start to adopt this perspective. The example of the highly publicized study of the German Council of Environmental Advisors shows how a 100% renewable electricity system for Germany, Europe, and North Africa could look in 2050 and how the transition toward such a system could be achieved. This study, conducted with major input from the authors, is used to show the major aspects of a 100% renewable electricity supply system, such as the security of supply in every hour of the year, the compensation of intermittent sources such as wind and solar <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PV</jats:styled-content> energy by other renewables and expanded storage, and the necessary extension of national and international grid infrastructures. <jats:italic>WIREs Energy Environ</jats:italic> 2015, 4:74–97. doi: 10.1002/wene.128</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy and Development &gt; Economics and Policy</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

In order to solve this problem, this experiment, regarding lettuce waste and pumpkin straw as researching objects, by adding corn straw as auxiliary materials, chicken manure and cattle dung as regulators, conducts research on the process of aerobic fermentation and the ammonia volatilization in this process. The experiment sets up six treatments in total, they are respectively: A1 (lettuce + corn straw), A2 (lettuce + corn straw + chicken manure), A3 (lettuce + corn straw + cattle dung), B1 (pumpkin straw + corn straw), B2 (pumpkin straw + corn straw + chicken manure) and B3 (pumpkin straw + corn straw + cattle dung). After all treatments being mixed, the aerobic compost is conducted through aeration oxygen-supply and the physicochemical properties and material changes in the composting process have been monitored. The results show that: adding cattle dung has a greater impact on the process of vegetable waste composting than adding chicken manure, where, the germination indexes (GI) A3 and B3 adding cattle dung are respectively 7.10% and 3.44% higher than those of A2 and B2 in adding chicken manure; after the composting the C/N of all treatments are lower than their initial values and reach a significant level (P&lt;0.0001), among them, C/Ns of A3 and B3 decrease to the greatest extent, which are 52.84% and 53% respectively; in the whole composting process, the quantity of ammonia volatilization in treatments adding chicken manure (A2 and B2) is significantly higher than that of adding cattle dung (A3 and B3). On the whole, adding cattle dung can better promote the decomposing process in vegetable waste composting and reduce nitrogen loss than adding chicken manure under conditions in this experiment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study is to identify geographical clusters of logistics service provider companies in Brazil. The main contribution is a vision of these clusters based on the articulation of the various activities which make up the the logistic chain. Indicators of spatial concentration (Herfindahl index) and regional specialisations (Location Quotient) were used in order to identify geographic clustering. Information about the number of companies, their size and people working in every location in the country, were obtained through the Annual Register of Social Information (RAIS) from the Employment &amp; Salaries Ministry and the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MTE). Due to changes in the classification of these activities in 2007, it isn't possible to carry out a broader time based analysis, which would allow us to identify the advantages of geographic clustering in a more consistent manner. We concluded that there are 922 spatial concentration of logistics service providers in Brazil. Around 41% of spatial concentration are located in the Southeast of Brazil and 33% in the South. In these regions the logistics infra-structure (roads, access to docks and airports) is more developed and also there are other logistics service chain providers.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n1p47-67URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n1p47-67</jats:p>"

A linear and high performance push amplifier is designed and analyzed to extract design equations for an optimum performance. The proposed push amplifier has two sections; an analog section and a switching section. The analog section provides the required linearity and the switching section guarantees the satisfaction of the total efficiency level. Double power supply scheme is used in push amplifiers to enhance its performance. Two separate power supplies are employed for linear and switching sections of push amplifiers which have different voltage levels. The implemented circuit is simulated using HSPICERF with TSMC models for active and passive elements. The proposed power amplifier (PA) provides a maximum output power of 25 dBm and power added efficiency (PAE) as high as 51% at 2.5 GHz operation frequency. At 1-dB compression point, this PA exhibits output power of 25 dBm with 48% PAE and 4.5% error vector magnitude (EVM) which is appropriate for 64QAM OFDM signals. </jats:p>",

The findings indicate that POs are capable of linking farmers effectively to markets in cases in which high value is added to farm products and/or farmers are highly specialized.

To explain what determines whether an intrastate conflict receives a deployment of peacekeepers, we note that peacekeeping operations are costly endeavors requiring significant material investments. Focusing on the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations, we argue that because a relatively small group of states decides about (and funds) possible deployments, the supply of United Nations peacekeeping operations likely reflects the interests of these states. Specifically, we hypothesize that trade ties between the five permanent members of the Security Council and civil war states are among the factors that influence the decision to authorize United Nations peacekeeping operations. Testing the argument over the post-World War II and post-Cold War periods reveals that the economic interests of the permanent five members of the Security Council play a key role in explaining which civil wars receive United Nations peacekeepers. </jats:p>",

However, there is a significant problem that the structure of the segmented cores leads to an increase in the leakage flux and voltage differences between rectifier disks. A high level of consistency in the output of the disks helps to achieve a compact structure by improving the utilization of both the rectifier components and the insulation distances, and consequently increase the output voltage of the power supply. The output voltages of the disks which are far away from the primary coils need to be improved to reduce their inhomogeneity. In this study, by investigating and comparing the existing compensation methods, a new combined compensation method is proposed, which increases the turns on the secondary coils and employs parallel capacitors to improve the consistency of the disks, while covering the entire operating range of the power supply. This method turns out to be both feasible and effective during the development of an ICT power supply.

Results showed that under a limited amount of H, the growth of He-plates resulting from a subcritical stress-corrosion mechanism can be fully described by the kinetic model of Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov with effective activation energy of 0.9 eV. Elastic calculations showed that the sudden and non-isotropic coalescence of close He-plates occurs when the out-of-plane tensile stress between them is close to the yield strength of silicon.

Based on the development of relevant sensory parameters, the predictive model was developed by combining a linear primary model and the Arrhenius model as the secondary model. Then a process analysis was conducted to define general requirements for the implementation of the temperature-based model into a meat supply chain. The required hardware and software for continuous temperature monitoring were developed in order to use the model under practical conditions. Further on a decision support tool was elaborated in order to use the model as an effective tool in combination with the temperature monitoring equipment for the improvement of quality and storage management within the meat logistics network. Over the long term, this overall procedure will support the reduction of food waste and will improve the resources efficiency of food production.</jats:p>",

The growth in the number of paper mills was from 17 units in 1950 to 759 units in 2010 with the production of 10.11 MT per annum. In Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu News prints and Papers Limited (TNPL) and Seshasayee Paper and Board Limited (SPB) are the major pulpwood based paper industries, which require 0.8 to 0.9 MT of pulpwood per year, whereas the availability of pulpwood is nearly 0.6 to 0.65 MT per year. This short supply will affect their performance in the market. Hence, this paper is to assess the factual demand and supply gap of industrial raw materials with different forecasting methods viz., trend analysis, moving average, single exponential smoothing model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Based on forecast accuracy, ANN is observed as a reliable method which measures that the demand-supply gap of raw materials will be 0.01 MT and 0.24 MT in 2015 and 2020 respectively. In order to bridge the gap, industries must additionally produce raw materials by promoting resourceful captive plantation and the farm forestry area with profitable business model.</jats:p>"

This configuration draws significantly unbalanced currents even with smaller percentage of unbalance in supply voltages and more unbalance in supply voltages leads to an extreme unbalanced situation like single phasing. This study highlights the unbalance line current problem observed in three‐phase diode rectifier and proposes its compensation using series hybrid active power filter (SHAPF) working with appropriate control strategy. Four distinct modes of operation under unbalanced supply are identified. A new control algorithm which simultaneously compensates for supply voltage unbalance and source current harmonics is applied to compensate the configuration. An experimental model of three‐phase diode rectifier with capacitive filter working under different supply situation is developed to establish identified modes of operation. This configuration is compensated with SHAPF, manufactured using ARM Cortex M4‐based microcontroller and the results of compensation are described in this study.</jats:p>",

Moreover, high humidity inside controlled atmosphere stores or containers complicates the realization of gas sensing systems that are sufficiently sensitive, reliable, robust and cost efficient. In particular, three measurement principles have shown promising potential for fruit supply chains and were used to develop independent mobile devices: non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy, miniaturized gas chromatography and electrochemical measurement. In this paper, the measurement systems for ethylene are compared with regard to the needs in fruit logistics; i.e. sensitivity, selectivity, long-term stability, facilitation of automated measurement and suitability for mobile application. Resolutions of 20–10 ppb can be achieved in mobile applications with state-of-the-art equipment, operating with the three methods described in the following. The prices of these systems are in a range below €10 000.</jats:p>",

Qualitative field investigations, including interviews and focus group discussions, are conducted with stakeholders and key informants to collect data on the scenarios before the SSS and to develop a conceptual framework after the SSS implementation. The before-implementation scenario has one strength, that is, the interest of communities and NGOs toward the SWS–SSS integration, which facilitates the acceptance and up-scaling of sustainable technologies. The after-implementation scenario shows additional strengths, such as community acceptance and satisfaction with SSS. The identified weaknesses are attributed to the lack of community-based organizations, community participation, and inter-sector coordination. The marketing of SSS, the involvement of banks and micro-credit systems, and the reuse of treated greywater have been identified as opportunities. The before-implementation scenario identifies the use of pit latrines and the lack of political will as the primary threats, whereas the after-implementation scenario identifies technology innovations for the extreme cold as a primary threat. The application of the SWS–SSS integration in other cases must be investigated further.</jats:p>",

The theoretical basis used organizational approaches that define the concept of cooperation network as a coordination strategy of inter-organizational resources oriented around shared goals. The research comprises two studies: documentary analysis and interviews. The conclusions indicated that achieving economies of scale and enhanced competitiveness were the main conditioning factors in this network consolidation process. Further studies are recommended analyzing the evolution of cooperation networks in others Brazilian industries as well as the study of conditioning factors present in different analysis levels such personal and organizational.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n1p15-29URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n1p15-29</jats:p>"

The precious metals used in the devices perform catalytic functions. They are suspended in a ceramic or metal carrier. This paper deals with the recovery of precious metals from automotive converters using a metal-collector method. In order to speed up the washout of the precious metals from the capillary structure of the converter, the movement of the liquid metal-collector was forced by the electromagnetic field. The research was aimed at improving the effective velocity of the liquid metal flow through the carrier by means of a device with a double windings. Various ways of power supply were considered. The calculation experiment was performed as a weakly coupled analysis of the electromagnetic field and flow field.</jats:p>",

The ZnO seeds were deposited on the FTO substrate heated at 350 °C by spray pyrolysis of a zinc acetate solution in a water ethanol mixture. The structure of seeds was tuned by the ethanol water ratio, Γ, which controls the solvent evaporation rate of drops impinging the substrate. The relationship between the microstructure and optical properties of the ZnO NR films and the photocatalytic antibacterial activity for Escherichia coli abatement, was determined through a detailed characterization of the material. The higher photocatalytic antibacterial activity was performed by ZnO NR films grown on seeds deposited from solutions with Γ in the 0.0–0.03 range. With these films, the population of viable E. coli dropped more than six orders, from 8 × 108 to 4 × 102 CFU. These results show the potential of these materials in water disinfection.</jats:p>",

As well as land (and sea) transport suitable biofuels, we also consider electricity and aviation biofuels. One feedstock (crop residues from grains) and five bioenergy pathways illustrate this approach for Australia. The methods are, however, applicable to any feedstock, bioenergy technology, region, or scale. Biofuel production costs, dependent on the spatial concentration of available feedstock, are derived in a companion paper by selecting a cost minimizing production scale. Lower concentrations imply smaller processing plants and greater collection areas and costs. Any candidate production plant location can have a collection area that approximates the least cost for its average spatial concentration, because feedstock concentration varies only modestly within cost minimizing area scales. A set of plant locations, scales, and near to least‐cost collection areas, is found that collectively service all the available residue feedstock using Australian data. This generates upper and lower bounds on nationally aggregated supply cost curves. The sizing of biofuel facilities will be also affected by investment scale commercial considerations, including the reliability of feedstock and investor appetite for risk: these are discussed qualitatively. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the presence of free chlorine is a prerequisite for the Trihalomethane's (THM) formation. From this point of view the water quality request for minimum chlorinated and safe potable water is understandable. In numerable modeling and experimental research the spatial diversity of chlorine residual was found to correlate with the daily consumption schedule, the water temperature, the initial dose of chlorine and organic matter content in the water. This paper presents some of the possibilities in predicting the content of residual chlorine and THM in water distribution networks. Special attention is paid to the spatial variability of residual chlorine and THM's to a change in the initial concentration of chlorine.

We aimed to understand how fine root structure enables sustained ecosystem metabolism through a summer of limited moisture and high heat and facilitates resource acquisition during the short period of high resource supply. An additional goal was to provide a basis for upscaling root biomass and soil carbon to the landscape scale. We sampled trees of different size and tree clusters via a stratified sampling scheme that accounted for spatial heterogeneity in root biomass and soil carbon with lateral distance from the tree bole, or cluster centre, and soil depth. We upscaled these estimates using site‐specific information from a lidar survey. We found that fine roots and soil carbon are spatially heterogeneous in their landscape distribution and greatly increase with tree size. We also found that <jats:italic>Q. douglasii</jats:italic> possesses a dimorphic fine root architecture, uniquely suited to the region's climatic constraints and exhibits morphological plasticity among trees of different size and physical setting.

Two torsional dampers based on different design approaches were designed and assessed: the first employs a conventional band‐pass filter technique, whereas the second involves an alternative model‐based approach. Frequency domain analyses were carried out on the system with the two dampers for the cases with and without model uncertainty. The system using the band‐pass filter‐based damper showed deterioration in stability and performance when subjected to uncertainty in the model and had to be re‐tuned to recover a good damping performance. Conversely, the system employing the model‐based damper maintained good stability and superior damping performance in the presence of model uncertainties. These attributes can ensure that the damper exhibits a good performance even if the wind turbine parameters vary during operation, such as when ice forms on the blades. Time domain simulations were carried out to verify the frequency domain analyses. © 2014 The Authors. <jats:italic>Wind Energy</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rising development costs and growing concerns over environmental impacts have led many communities to explore more diversified water management strategies. These “portfolio”‐style approaches integrate existing supply infrastructure with other options such as conservation measures or water transfers. Diversified water supply portfolios have been shown to reduce the capacity and costs required to meet demand, while also providing greater adaptability to changing hydrologic conditions. However, this additional flexibility can also cause unexpected reductions in revenue (from conservation) or increased costs (from transfers). The resulting financial instability can act as a substantial disincentive to utilities seeking to implement more innovative water management techniques. This study seeks to design portfolios that employ financial tools (e.g., contingency funds and index insurance) to reduce fluctuations in revenues and costs, allowing these strategies to achieve improved performance without sacrificing financial stability. This analysis is applied to the development of coordinated regional supply portfolios in the “Research Triangle” region of North Carolina, an area comprising four rapidly growing municipalities. The actions of each independent utility become interconnected when shared infrastructure is utilized to enable interutility transfers, requiring the evaluation of regional tradeoffs in up to five performance and financial objectives. Diversified strategies introduce significant tradeoffs between achieving reliability goals and introducing burdensome variability in annual revenues and/or costs. Financial mitigation tools can mitigate the impacts of this variability, allowing for an alternative suite of improved solutions. This analysis provides a general template for utilities seeking to navigate the tradeoffs associated with more flexible, portfolio‐style management approaches.</jats:p>",

Enforcement of laws, interventions in soy and beef supply chains, restrictions on access to credit, and expansion of protected areas appear to have contributed to this decline, as did a decline in the demand for new deforestation. The supply chain interventions that fed into this deceleration are precariously dependent on corporate risk management, and public policies have relied excessively on punitive measures. Systems for delivering positive incentives for farmers to forgo deforestation have been designed but not fully implemented. Territorial approaches to deforestation have been effective and could consolidate progress in slowing deforestation while providing a framework for addressing other important dimensions of sustainable development.</jats:p>",

This effect decreases the amount of glucose required for NADPH regeneration in reductive biotransformations, such as the conversion of methyl acetoacetate (MAA) to (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>)‐methyl 3‐hydroxybutyrate (MHB) by an alcohol dehydrogenase from <jats:italic>Lactobacillus brevis</jats:italic>. Here, global transcriptional analyses were performed to study regulatory responses during reductive biotransformation. DNA microarray analysis revealed amongst other things increased expression of <jats:italic>soxS</jats:italic>, supporting previous results indicating that a high NADPH demand contributes to the activation of SoxR, the transcriptional activator of <jats:italic>soxS</jats:italic>. Furthermore, several target genes of the ArcAB two‐component system showed a lower mRNA level in the reference strain than in the Δ<jats:italic>pfkA</jats:italic> mutant, pointing to an increased QH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Q ratio in the reference strain. This prompted us to analyze yields and productivities of MAA reduction to MHB under different oxygen regimes in a bioreactor. Under anaerobic conditions, the specific MHB production rates of both strains were comparable (7.4 ± 0.2 mmol<jats:sub>MHB</jats:sub> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> g<jats:sub>cdw</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and lower than under conditions of 15% dissolved oxygen, where those of the reference strain (12.8 mmol h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> g<jats:sub>cdw</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and of the Δ<jats:italic>pfkA</jats:italic> mutant (11.0 mmol h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> g<jats:sub>cdw</jats:sub><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) were 73% and 49% higher. While the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) of the reference strain increased after the addition of MAA, presumably due to the oxidation of the acetate accumulated before MAA addition, the OTR of the Δ<jats:italic>pfkA</jats:italic> strain strongly decreased, indicating a very low respiration rate despite sufficient oxygen supply. The latter effect can likely be attributed to a restricted conversion of NADPH into NADH via the soluble transhydrogenase SthA, as the enzyme is outcompeted in the presence of MAA by the recombinant NADPH‐dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. The differences in respiration rates can explain the suggested higher ArcAB activity in the reference strain. Biotechnol.

With Americans getting &gt;75% of their sodium from processed and restaurant food, this evidence creates mounting pressure for less sodium in the food supply. The reduction of sodium in the food supply is a complex issue that involves multiple stakeholders. The success of new technological approaches for reducing sodium will depend on product availability, health effects (both intended and unintended), research and development investments, quality and taste of reformulated foods, supply chain management, operational modifications, consumer acceptance, and cost. The conference facilitated an exchange of ideas and set the stage for potential collaboration opportunities among stakeholders with mutual interest in reducing sodium in the food supply and in Americans’ diets. Population-wide sodium reduction remains a critically important component of public health efforts to promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular disease and will remain a priority for the American Heart Association.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

A multi-regional polygeneration supply chain consists of various array of processing plants in producing multiple bioenergy products given spatial constraints of each plant found in different regions. The inherent complexity of the polygeneration compounds the difficulty of designing the composite network of processing plants in multi-regions. Optimizing the design flow of the polygeneration supply chain considers multiple objectives, such as satisfying product demand, maximizing economic performance, and minimizing environmental footprint. In addition, the optimal strategic capacity design of the supply and distribution of biodiesel across multi-regions are considered. This study uses a fuzzy mathematical programming model to generate an optimized design of the polygeneration supply chain while satisfying all objectives. The developed model is demonstrated using a modified industrial case study comparing two cultivation alternatives. Results showed that all fuzzy multi-objective goals are satisfied and the flat-plate photobioreactor is the preferred cultivation system in terms of environmental footprints and economic performance.</jats:p>",
