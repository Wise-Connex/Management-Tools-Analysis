      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We analyzed two sets of farm policy options, representing different ideological approaches to government involvement in agriculture, to estimate their effects on the relative economic attractiveness of “sustainable” and “conventional” farming systems. The mandatory supply control approach, through strict acreage limitations on program crops, represents a strong government role in commodity supply management. The Normal Crop Acreage approach, on the other hand, allows farmers greater flexibility in deciding what crops to grow. We used economic models of five pairs of case study farms in different agroclimatic areas of South Dakota, covering corn-soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat growing regions. Mandatory restrictions on the planted acreage of “program” crops, including soybeans, were found to favor the conventional systems, because they induced high prices for crops that predominate in conventional systems, especially com, soybeans, and wheat. In principle, however, mandatory acreage controls could require compliance with certain sustainable agriculture practices. Normal Crop Acreage (NCA) proposals can encourage greater use of sustainable farming systems. Where conventional corn and soybean production is relatively profitable, as in parts of eastern South Dakota, NCA options by themselves appear insufficient to induce changeovers to sustainable cropping systems. In wheat growing areas of northern and western South Dakota, however, where the two systems oflen are about equally profitable, NCA policies could promote sustainable systems, particularly if deficiency payments are not reduced for harvesting legumes and other non-program crops on NCA base. To have this positive effect, NCA policies must be introduced gradually and structured to limit adverse effects on the markets for legumes and other non-program crops that are important in sustainable rotations.</jats:p>",

The relative growth rate (RGR) of the plants varied significantly with the nutrition treatment and decreased during development in all treatments. The concentration of reduced nitrogen in the plants grown at full nitrate availability did not change significantly during the experimental growth period and nitrate accumulation was substantial. After an adaptation period, the concentration of reduced nitrogen in the plants at the suboptimum nitrate addition rates increased during growth and was lowest at the lowest relative nitrate addition rate. Nitrate uptake was almost complete in the suboptimum treatments and nitrate accumulation was negligible as long as the concentration of reduced nitrogen was below 2·0 mmol (g dry weight)<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>. The RGR of all plants was proportional to the concentration of reduced nitrogen in the plant minus a minimal tissue concentration required for growth. However, the proportionality factor was inversely related to the plant mass. This relationship was summarized in an empirical model which explained 98·7% of the variance of the dry weight (log scale) data of all treatments at all harvests. The model was compared with other growth models found in the literature. The shoot/root weight ratio increased from 2 to 4 if nitrate provision was not limiting, and initially, this ratio decreased at suboptimum nitrate provision but increased at higher growth stages. Possible explanations of the dynamics of dry matter partitioning are discussed in relation to models.</jats:p>",

The N‐supply environment had contrasting effects on the HI and NHI. Greater early‐season N supply increased both grain and vegetative yields in approximately the same proportion so that the HI was relatively constant or increased slightly over most of the response to N. Greater postanthesis N supply resulted in a small grain yield increase and a small increase in HI. In contrast, the NHI decreased linearly for all cultivars with increasing early‐season N supply. The slope and y intercepts for these regressions differed between cultivars in Year 1 due to a significant cultivar × preplant N interaction. Late‐season N addition increased or decreased the NHI depending on whether the early‐season N supply limited grain yield. Additional plant N derived from supplemental N supplied at anthesis was partitioned between grain and straw in a ratio that was predetermined by the early‐season N environment. Of the individual grain, straw, or whole‐plant parameters from which the NHI is calculated, the straw N concentration seems most useful for referencing the NHI in relation to grain N demand and plant N supply across diverse Nregime and site environments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For many purposes, the five Great Lakes can be classified as an open access resource since there is no well‐defined system of property rights governing these water uses in the lakes. Yet the Great Lakes Charter and the Water Resources Act of 1966 establish regulations concerning the diversion of water out of the basin. Thus, for interbasin water diversions the Great Lakes is more like a common property resource with rules governing such transfers. Moreover, water diversion decisions are interconnected since withdrawing water from one point may affect water levels in the entire lake system. This, in turn, can adversely affect hydropower production and commercial navigation. Contributing to the complexity of the problem are the eight U.S. states, two Canadian provinces and two federal governments which are involved in Great Lakes management. Game theory is used to describe this situation. Several games are constructed to describe different market structures. Of particular interest is the number of players who participate in the game, as well as the expectations they hold. Open‐loop (where players commit themselves to future actions) and closed‐loop (where players do not commit themselves to future actions) are compared for the ten players game (eight states and two provinces), two players game (U.S. and Canada) and one player game (a social planner's solution). The open‐loop game is shown to ignore part of the externalities involved, and thus can underestimate the social loss caused by diversions from the lakes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Haemophilus parasuis, grown under conditions of high aeration, was found to lack a tricarboxylic acid cycle but to possess phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and a reductive pathway leading to the production of succinate. Such organisms contained approximately equal quantities of b-, c-, and d-type cytochromes and excreted acetate. When the oxygen supply for growth was either reduced or eliminated, the specific activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, and NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase were increased substantially, and the acid products were succinate, acetate, and formate. Organisms grown under the latter conditions also contained increased quantities of b- and c-type cytochromes, some of which were low-potential cytochromes. These low-potential cytochromes were reduced by NADH and oxidized by fumarate, and hence, appeared to be components of NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase. Our results indicate that in H. parasuis, growing aerobically in medium containing glucose, the sole function of the reductive pathway is to provide intermediates for biosynthetic processes, and oxygen is the preferred electron acceptor. As the supply of oxygen is reduced or eliminated, the reductive pathway becomes more involved in NAD<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> recycling and fumarate becomes the acceptor. In effect, irrespective of the oxygen supply, the growth of H. parasuis is absolutely dependent upon the presence of an electron transport system.

The Ca‐sink size was adjusted by adding different amounts of a cation‐exchange resin (CER) to the soils. In the presence of a large proton supply (pH<jats:sub>w</jats:sub> 3.8–4.8, pH‐buffer capacity 52.5–36.5 mmol OH<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> pH unit<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), the dissolution of GPR, JPR and NFPR in the Nercwys and Davidstow soil‐CER mixtures was strongly influenced by the size of the Ca sink. A twofold increase in Ca‐sink size in these two soils caused an increase in PR dissolution of 44–120%. Except for TPR, the increase in PR dissolution per unit increase in Ca‐sink size was the same for the three PR materials. In the Withnell soil‐CER mixtures, where the initial proton supply was relatively small (pH<jats:sub>w</jats:sub> 4.8–6.1, pH‐buffer capacity 23.7–21.4 mmol OH<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> pH unit<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), the increase in PR dissolution with increasing Ca‐sink size was less (24–68%) than in the other two soils (44–120%). Also, for the Withnell soil, the increase in PR dissolution with increasing Ca‐sink size decreased in the order GPR (68%) &gt; JPR (49%) &gt; NFPR (24%), a trend consistent with the decrease in PR reactivity. The maximum dissolution of TPR was only 8–22% under favourable conditions of proton supply and Ca sink, and was little affected by Ca‐sink size.</jats:p>",

Pond pine (<jats:italic>Pinus serotina</jats:italic> Michx.) seedlings were grown in continuously flowing solution culture at 5 or 100 μ<jats:italic>M</jats:italic> P, under aerobic or hypoxic solution conditions. Staggered harvests were used to ascertain changes in biomass allocation and relative growth over time. Carbon dioxide exchange rates (CER) were determined by infrared gas analysis, and needles were analyzed for inorganic P (Pi), sucrose, reducing sugars and starch. Although aeration treatment had no significant effect on shoot dry weight or shoot ontogeny, root dry weight of hypoxic seedlings was significantly lower than that of aerobic seedliings after 8 weeks, regardless of the P treatment. Mean relative growth rates (RGR) of roots in the high P treatment initially decreased under hypoxia, but recovered by the sixth week with the production of adventitious roots. Two weeks of hypoxic growth conditions decreased CER and stomatal conductances of seedlings in the high P treatment by more than 30% relative to their aerobic counterparts. Stomatal closure was not accompanied by a decrease in intracellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, but was accompanied by an increase in starch accumulation. Recoveries of CER, stomatal conductance and carbohydrate metabolism coincided with the recovery of root growth. Low P growth conditions did not significantly affect shoot or root dry weight until the sixth week of treatment. However, differences in seedling RGR, particularly needle RGR, were discernable during the first 2 weeks. Low P treatment effects on CER paralleled changes in needle RGR, with needle RGR more affected than CER. After 6 weeks, CER of aerobically grown seedlings in the low P treatment were only 15% lower than CER of seedlings in the high P treatment, despite a 31% and 75% reduction in needle RGR and Pi concentrations, respectively. Increased starch concentrations of recently expanded needles at this time were probably a result of diminished growth. The inhibitory effect of a low P supply on shoot growth, more specifically on needle expansion and emergence of new fascicular needles, probably limited net carbon fixed per plant more than any direct effect of low P on CER per se.</jats:p>",

These variables were analyzed according to reduction of arthropod density in canopy trees after treatments and results were compared with a control plot (plot A) without application. The plot sprayed in 1988, with a dust formulation of cypermethrin at 75 g active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (plot B), showed a nearly 100% mortality of lepidopteran larvae, the most important food resource for breeding blue tits, as well as for other arthropods. The drop in food supply in this plot coincided with the hatching or early nestling stage of the blue tit population. There were statistically significant differences between the control plot and plot B in nestling mortality, daily survival rate, nest success, and nestling weight. In the treated plot, nestling mortality was 81%, 65% of nests were unsuccessful, and mean nestling weight was 1 g less than that in the control plot. In the control plot, nestling mortality was 6% and all nests were successful. A second plot was sprayed in 1989 with an ultra-low-volume formulation of cypermethrin at 3.75 g a.i. per hectare, reducing 90% of the caterpillars but not affecting the availability of other arthropods. Blue tit nestlings were older than one week at the moment of the spraying. In this plot, nestlings from late nests showed a higher mortality and a lower daily survival rate than those in the control plot, the only statistically significant differences in breeding parameters between the plots. We suggest that the negative effects of cypermethrin spraying on breeding success of the blue tit in both treated plots are due to indirect effects (shortage in prey availability) rather than to direct effects (toxicity).</jats:p>",

Nursing supply is analyzed in terms of the ratio of registered nurses per 100,000 people for three standard nonmetropolitan census county size classifications and nine regional groupings of states. Seven dimensions relating to the educational background and current professional characteristics of registered nurses are studied. Findings indicate a notable difference in the ratio of nurses per population across county size and regions of the country. In terms of characteristics selected for this study, the educational background, salary gap, and time spent in various activities differentiate nurses in rural areas from those working in urban counties. Results of this study should be particularly relevant because a variety of educational, financial, and other incentives are being considered to address what is perceived to be a crisis in rural nursing availability.</jats:p>",
