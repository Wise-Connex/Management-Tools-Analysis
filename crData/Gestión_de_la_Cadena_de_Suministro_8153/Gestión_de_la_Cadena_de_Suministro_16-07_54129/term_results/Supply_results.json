      "abstract": "<p>Not only healthcare financing but also its provision was nationalised when the NHS was founded. Besides guaranteeing access to healthcare, Bevan and the other founders also intended to – and eventually largely did – ‘level up’ a supply side comprised of diversely-owned providers which provided correspondingly diverse levels of service access, quality and responsiveness to healthcare needs. Since 1979 neo-liberal ‘reforms’ of the NHS have had a supply side component, that of introducing ‘provider plurality’ under which a range of differently-owned organisations provide NHS-funded services. In the circumstances that most NHS services have hitherto been provided by public organisations and professional partnerships, proposals for greater provider diversity mean shifting the proportion towards providers such as shareholder-owned, dividend-maximising firms, social enterprises, and co-operatives and mutuals. Whatever the effect on healthcare supply, such a contentions policy has already greatly increased the supply of euphemism, confusion and obfuscation in health policy debates. This chapter attempts to give an overview of the empirical patterns of development, and unpick some of the conceptual confusions.</p>",

Although empirical research suggests that strengthening RQ improves supply chain performance (SCP), most studies have focused on dyadic business relationships.

The model’s objective is to identify and assess real chains of companies and products. An application in the agribusiness sector, starting with a specific sugarcane processing plant and the biofuel ethanol is performed. The SCMap establishes a structured and integrated manner of linking products and companies, considering three different categories of relationships: (1) between companies – supply chain approach; (2) between products – production chain approach, and; (3) between companies and products – regarding commercial practices in the corporate environment. Grounded on Graph Theory and Social Network Analysis – SNA, the software UCINET and NetDraw application are used to draw the maps and quantitatively assess the centrality of each company and product relative to the whole chain.</jats:p>"

A case study and qualitative methods are employed to examine a well-established supply network in Karawang District in Indonesia. Farmers and traders used their existing network in selling rice crops to traders and adopted a payment scheme for cash-and-carry transactions. Information on the market situation was obtained through personal interviews and observations including text messaging with farmer and trader informants. Evidence reveals that social relationships are vital in transmitting price information among networked actors to maintain the flow of rice, mitigate risk, and avoid losses due to poor quality of the rice product. Findings show that social interaction enables actors in an end-to-end rice supply chain to deal with the assurance of supply rationing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent disasters around the globe illustrate the unpredictability of their timing and the severity of their impact, making aid operations highly uncertain and complex. The aftermath of sudden-impact disasters, such as civil conflicts, wars, and natural disasters, are typically characterized by chaos and the urgent need for medical care for a massive number of casualties; however, damage to local healthcare infrastructures usually render them unable to deliver needed services. Foreign field hospitals, innovative self-sufficient emergency healthcare logistics systems deployed outside the hospitals’ country, constitute a temporary solution until the local facilities are repaired or rebuilt. These types of healthcare logistics system have been deployed with great success. However, not much is known about factors that may account for their success in the supply chain literature. In this study, we investigate military foreign field hospitals and explore general factors that may account for their effectiveness. Specifically, we look into military healthcare logistics systems, specifically foreign field hospitals (FFHs), to explore factors that may account for their responsiveness. We examine ten successful deployments of an experienced and effective military FFH through an exploratory case analysis to shed light into factors that may account for its success. Various propositions and avenues for future research are developed.</jats:p>"

Supply chain risk management implementation is a difficult task because it requires involvement of various firms across the SC. For effective SCRM implementation, managers need to know the enabling factors and their relative importance. In this research, an empirical study on SC risk mitigation enablers was carried out in Indian automotive industry to examine the relationship between SCRM enablers and SCRM implementation. This relationship was tested using discriminant analysis. The research shows that the most important enabler is information visibility and it is followed by incentives alignment. Contingency planning is the third-most important enabler and last is risk management governance (RMG). Success of the SCRM implementation in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness can be assured by following the sequence of SCRM enablers suggested in this research. </jats:p>",

Under a decentralized decision, we find that the commonly-used wholesale price contracts cannot coordinate the system. Then, we propose a buy-back contract and prove that this contract can more efficiently coordinate the system than the former.

It is assumed that each arrival lot received by the buyer contains a percentage of imperfect quality items which follows a uniform distribution. A 100% screening process for detecting the defective items is conducted. Lead time crashing cost and investment for ordering cost reduction follow power function distribution. The shortage during the lead time is permitted and backordered partially for the buyer. However, the level of shortage is limited by service level constraint policy. The optimal order quantity, reorder point, lead time, ordering cost, and the number of delivery are determined by the Lagrange method such that joint total cost of the system is minimized and the service level constraint is satisfied. An iterative procedure is developed to determine the optimal solution and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the result of the proposed model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies how transfer pricing schemes interact with sub suppliers' opportunistic behaviors to affect supply chain performance. Effective supply chain management requires careful consideration of sub-suppliers', especially with respect to transfer pricing issues. Firms increasingly approach their sub-suppliers to drive compliance with firms' defined transfer pricing schemes. The paper models the supply chain incorporating asymmetric information among all the parties, supplier's innovation activities, sub suppliers' corruption possibility, and transfer pricing schemes. It examines the impact of various transfer pricing schemes on supply chain efficiency. Specifically, it conducts a performance comparison between the variable-cost transfer pricing scheme and the full-cost transfer pricing scheme. The paper finds that the sub supplier's choice of a transfer pricing scheme affects the supplier's sourcing decisions and the supply chain performance, and the variable-cost transfer pricing scheme performs better in achieving supply chain coordination. Therefore, the present research seeks to explore and increase one's understanding of critical factors that contribute to overcome aforementioned complexities and unique challenges of managing sub-suppliers for transfer pricing schemes. The present research expands on the theory of transfer pricing schemes and sub-supplier management context.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Variable mortgage contracts dominate the UK mortgage market. The dominance of the variable rate mortgage contracts has important consequences for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy decisions and systemic risks. This raises an obvious concern that a mortgage market such as that in the UK, where the major proportion of mortgage debt is either at a variable or fixed for less than two years rate, is vulnerable to alterations in the interest rate regime. Theoretically, mortgage choice is determined by demand and supply factors. So far, most of the existing literature has focused on the demand side perspective, and what is limited is consideration of supply side factors in empirical investigation on mortgage choice decisions. This paper uniquely explores whether supply side factors may partially explain observed/ex-post mortgage type decisions. Empirical results detect that lenders’ profit motives and mortgage funding/pricing issues may have assisted in preferences toward variable rate contracts. Securitisation is found to positively impact upon gross mortgage lending volumes while negatively impacting upon the share of variable lending flows. This shows that an increase in securitisation not only improves liquidity in the supply of mortgage funds, but also has the potential to shift mortgage choices toward fixed mortgage debt. The policy implications may involve a number of measures, including reconsideration of the capital requirements for the fixed, as opposed to the variable rate mortgage debt, growing securitisation and optimisation of the mortgage pricing policies. </jats:p>",

However, factors inherent within the supply chain of supplier-buyer exchanges such as culture, politics, dependence and trust may influence supplier relationship quality (SRQ). This research therefore  seeks  to  identify  the  influence  that  these  factors  have  upon  SRQ  in  the  Ghanaian construction industry and develop a conceptual framework that explains the interconnectivity between them. A literature review is used to develop a conceptual framework of the antecedents influencing  supplier  relationship  quality.  Primary  ‘perception’  data  obtained  from  152 building  material  suppliers  is  used  to  test  the  proposed  model  using  Partial  Least  Squares (PLS). Findings reveal that culture, politics, dependence and trust have a significant influence on  relationship  quality  in  supply  chain  collaborations  amongst  purchasers  and  suppliers  of building  materials.  While  politics  has  a  strong  influence  on  dependence,  it  also  generates  a negative  influence  on  SRQ  and  trust.  The  research  confirms  the  positive  effect  of  trust  and dependence  in  SRQ  management  and  extends  understanding  of  the  influence  of  culture  and politics.  Practical  implications  suggest  that  managers  of  building  material  suppliers  should focus upon building trust and dependence and be discouraged from over-reliance upon politics and political affiliations as a basis for long-term relationship building.</jats:p>"

The dominant theory, which was first proposed by Redfield and later formalized by Tyrrell[1, 2], states that despite the scarcity of fixed nitrogen (N) in the surface ocean, phosphorus (P) availability ultimately determines primary productivity. Two recent findings directly challenge the assumptions of the Redfield-Tyrrell paradigm: the discovery of systematic variations of phytoplankton cellular N:P:Fe and widespread iron-limitation of phytoplankton. Here we use a simple model of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron (Fe) cycling to show how the resource demand ratios and biogeography of phytoplankton interact with external resource supply ratios to govern nutrient cycling and primary productivity. We find that all three nutrients can limit global primary productivity, and that the ratio of geochemical supply to biological demand of each nutrient in each ocean region determines the limiting nutrients, with nitrogen N fixation providing a mechanism for the cycles to interact. These results have important consequences for our understanding of biogeochemical cycles, ocean-atmosphere interactions, marine ecology, and the response of ocean ecosystems to climate change. Our work demonstrates the importance of resource ratios and suggests that future studies of the physiological and geochemical regulation of these ratios are indispensable to building accurate theories and future predictions of nutrient cycling and primary productivity.</jats:p>"

It highlights the growth of this research area and reinforces the importance of a full consideration of all three key dimensions of sustainability when managing sustainable supply chains, i.e., the financial, environmental and social dimensions. Therefore, supply chain decision makers need to unequivocally assess the impact of their decisions on the financial, environmental and social performances of their supply chains. This paper also argues that risks and opportunities are the key drivers for supply chain decision makers to adopt sustainability within their operations, and that barriers to sustainability adoption exist. This research highlights that, depending on the focus adopted, supply chains can evolve and shift from more traditional to more sustainable approaches over time. The paper concludes with some promising avenues for future investigation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measuring and analyzing product labeling policies in supply chain processes is a largely unexplored topic. This paper analyzes the reasons why suppliers may pursue different product labeling policies in asymmetric information and how this affects buyers' product utility in the context of supply chain collaboration. In an asymmetric information environment, where suppliers know the quality of the goods they are selling and buyers are not able to distinguish between them, the quality buyers select to protect by a label depends on buyer's preferences for and production costs of different qualities. Suppliers with different distributions of tastes and/or different production functions will thus decide to label differently. When they collaborate, product utility effects will be different on the buyer as a whole and on different types of buyers within each buyer depending on whether buyers select to mutually recognize each other's labeling policy or to harmonize their policies. In particular, it will be the case that a buyer with weak preferences for high quality will oppose the introduction of an international, harmonized label as it is better off under a regime of mutual recognition. When suppliers only differ in their costs of producing quality instead, none of the suppliers or buyers will lose from a move towards supply chain collaboration under an international, harmonized label.</jats:p>",

Routine culture-based methods of identifying bacterial pathogens in water sources are laborious and time-consuming. Recently, the use of molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided rapid and highly promising detection methods. In this study, we developed two multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous detection of six water-borne bacteria. Two triplex PCR protocols were developed to detect six target genes. The first protocol targets uidA (Escherichia coli), int (Shigella spp.), and gyrB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) genes, while invA (Salmonella spp.), ompW (Vibrio cholera), and lacZ (coliforms) were amplified by the second protocol. Specificity testing was carried out for 12 reference strains. Furthermore, the applicability of the multiplex PCR assays for detection of these bacteria was investigated for 52 surface water samples. The results indicated that all primer pairs showed specificities only for their corresponding target organisms. The detection sensitivity of both multiplex PCR assays was 3 × 102 − 3 × 103 colony forming units. The developed assays represent simple and efficient diagnostic procedures for co-detection of water-borne bacteria and have the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of these organisms.</jats:p>",

The government taxes the carbon footprint of each item caused by producing, transporting, and consuming the products. Both the supplier and retailer can exert efforts to reduce the carbon footprint. In a non-cooperative setting, the government only taxes the supplier, so that the retailer has no incentive to exert any effort to reduce the carbon footprint and the supplier merely decides on the selling price to maximize its own profit. We develop a centralized supply chain and show that there is an optimal solution to maximize the channel profit. Since the centralized policy may not be always not practical, we propose a tax-sharing contract, where both parties profit from the carbon footprint reduction. This problem is modeled as the Stackelberg game and Nash game. The results show that the leader has more power than the follower, which results in more profit. The Stackelberg game provides boundaries for both parties’ profits in the Nash game. Although the tax-sharing contract does not result in full cooperation, its efficiency is still much higher than that of the non-cooperative case. The results are illustrated with some numerical experiments.</jats:p>"

This paper is based on desk research. Public data such as (annual) reports and databases are used to determine the features of the location in empirical terms. We find that a significant proportion of our sample co-locates their products at UNHRD premises. This suggests that organizations prefer to cluster their warehouse activities, particularly when there is no fee involved for using the warehouse (as is the case in the UNHRD network). The geographic map of the current warehouses, together with the quantified location factors, provides an overview of the current warehouse locations. We found that the characteristics of the current warehouse locations are aligned with literature on location selection factors. Current location can be characterized by infrastructure characteristics (in particular closeness to airport and safety concerns) and by the low occurrence of disasters. Other factors that were considered by us but were not supported by empirical evidence were labor quality and availability as well as the political environment. In our study we were only able to use a limited sample of warehouses. We also focused our research on countries where two or more organizations have their warehouses located.

Portable electronic devices can be powered when hydrogen is supplied to fuel cells. In order to avoid massive equipment for hydrogen storage, direct hydrogen production can be achieved on-site during the reaction between metals/metal alloys/metal hydrides and water. Magnesium hydride offers great perspective for widespread applications as its weight yield of hydrogen reaches 6.4% according to the reaction with water and it can even increase to 15.2% if water produced in the fuel cell is used in the reaction again. In the  present work, Mg powder with the  content of Ni was synthesized under low temperature hydrogen plasma conditions changing the DC magnetron current from 0.5 to 1 A. As pure Mg powder was immersed into hydrogen plasma, the simultaneous hydrogenation process was ensured. Nickel was chosen as a catalyst capable to influence the growth of hydride. The process of electric power generation was investigated when reaction between modified Mg powder and water was applied to laboratory-built equipment consisting of a reactor for hydrogen production, gas dryer before H2 introduction to the  fuel cell, fuel cell, load and energy meter. Solutions of acetic acid and sodium chloride were used as promoters during powder-water reactions. The characterisation of predicted magnesium hydride powder was done using scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. XRD analysis showed only Mg, MgO and Ni peaks indicating that hydrogen generation during powder-water reaction was evoked because of microgalvanic corrosion at Mg-Ni intersections.</jats:p>"

In order to embrace sustainability, companies should change their management practices towards more efficient resource use. Food waste being a misuse of resources, we identify its causes and possible ways of minimising it. To achieve this goal, we conducted explorative research with qualitative and quantitative data through in-depth semi-structured interviews and an open questionnaire with top Spanish food service companies. Results show that most businesses mainly tend to minimise food waste according to economic criteria, without taking into account the social, ethical or environmental factors. As a consequence, just “visible” food waste that has an economic impact on the results is minimised. Nevertheless, visibility of real waste is often low. At the same time, awareness of (and therefore initiatives to reduce) food waste that does not directly affect a firm’s profit can be increased through multi-stakeholder collaboration. Opportunities for reducing food waste therefore arise from increasing the visibility of food that is discarded as well as addressing plate waste. We identify best practices that could lead to a reduction of the amount of food waste generated in the out of home channel in Spain.</jats:p>"

Construction industry is among the industries which highly effect the environment adversely not only through its outputs but also through the construction process and its inputs. The main focus in dealing with the reduction of its footprint has been on sustainable building certificates which mainly analyse the output of the construction activies. There is need to analyse the construction supply chain as a whole and to embed sustainability dynamics in construction supply chain management. Lean construction project management contributes to the reduction of the environmental footprint of the construction industry, enabling reduction in waste, and increasing value added activities. For this reason, based on an in depth literature review, this paper analyses and establishes the principles of the integration of the sustainability dynamics into lean construction supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The inactivation rate of FE was higher than that of PAE and the reactivation ratio of PAE was higher than that of FE, indicating the threat of particle-associated bacteria. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the factors influencing the disinfection efficiency of ClO2 in inactivating PAE. The experimental results indicated that particle concentration was a principal factor influencing the PAE inactivation efficiency, presenting a negative correlation, while exposure time and ClO2 dosage revealed a positive correlation. The inactivation kinetics of PAE using ClO2 was also investigated and the results demonstrated that PAE inactivation with ClO2 fitted the Chick–Watson kinetic model. The inactivation rate constants of PAE were found to follow the Arrhenius expression with an activation energy of 107.5 kJ/mol, indicating a relatively strong temperature dependence. However, there are minor effects of pH and initial ClO2 dosage on PAE inactivation rate constant.</jats:p>",

Due to lack of efficient infrastructure, supply chain mechanism and food processing, around 30–35 per cent of all foods produced in India are wasted. This article examines the critical issues at subsystem of agriculture supply chain, with a view to integrating them in efficient and effective manner. This article broadly covers some important aspects of agriculture supply chain in India—identification of issues at different levels in the supply chain; transformation in the agriculture due to various supply chain interventions; and the role of information technology in supply chain management. As this article is based on both primary and secondary research methodology, it has led us to finding that there is not much research in this field in India and importance of integration in agricultural development. The article concludes that efficient supply chain plays a very important role for development and is a contemporary issue for agriculture, therefore, the government and the corporates must address the issue of integration, infrastructure development and information management to achieve the objective of a feasible agricultural sector which will lead to food security for all. </jats:p>",

One way that the Global Supply Chain Management Program in the Mike Ilitch School of Business at Wayne State University has collaborated with General Motors and several major suppliers, and potential employers of students, is through an automotive industry supply chain management (SCM) case competition. In 2016, the Global Supply Chain Management Program, along with General Motors, will host the 6th annual General Motors/Wayne State University Supply Chain Case Competition. Supply Chain Management students from universities around the world travel to Detroit, MI to participate in the competition and learn about the global automotive industry. In addition to the competition, students tour an automotive assembly plant and network with industry executives and young managers. General Motors and other sponsoring companies utilize the competition to recruit top talent for entry level supply chain management positions, and to help with the education of students. Wayne State and its students benefit from increased exposure to companies with benefits relating to research, faculty recruiting, placement of students, and general development of the Wayne State SCM brand name. This article discusses the nature of the competition and the competitors, issues involved in producing such an event, the costs, and other benefits and challenges related to hosting such a competition.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Use of fertilizers has enabled a massive increase in crop production yields. However, this has come with severe negative externalities (e.g., greenhouse gas emission; eutrophication of non-agricultural ecosystems). Eco-innovations are one option to reduce the environmental impact of fertilizers without compromising fertilizer productivity. Although numerous eco-innovations in the domain of fertilizers are available, they have not yet seen a sufficient adoption rate. In this paper we explore main drivers for adoption of eco-innovations in the German fertilizer supply chain based on empirical investigations at three levels of the fertilizer supply chain: producers, traders, and farmers. We strive to take a “chain perspective” on environmental concerns and knowledge of fertilizer specific eco-innovations. The study was carried out in two steps: initially we conducted exploratory expert interviews with eight actors of the fertilizer supply chain. The statements generated thereby fed into a questionnaire answered by 57 participants stemming from fertilizer production (n = 12), traders (n = 34) and farmers (n = 11) level. Findings suggest that drivers for eco-innovations are perceived differently by the various actors in the fertilizer supply chain. Overall knowledge on eco-innovations decreases downstream the chain. By taking a chain perspective on the adoption of eco-innovation, our paper contributes to the emerging body of literature on drivers for eco-innovation, and also maps out managerial implications of fostering the implementation of eco-innovations in the fertilizer supply chain.</jats:p>"

Then, we confirm the energy resource attractor with a necessary condition about the existence of chaotic behaviors. By employing an improved version of Adams Bashforth Moulton algorithm, we use three cases with different fractional values to verify the necessary condition. Finally, chaos control of fractional-order energy demand–supply system is investigated by two different control strategies: a linear feedback control and an adaptive switching control strategy via a single control input. Numerical simulations show that the energy demand and import in Eastern China and energy supply in Western China are self-feedback controlled around the system’s equilibrium point.</jats:p>",

Opportunities to promote conservation and water-use efficiencies remain attractive in directly reducing water demand. Smart water metering and the provision of detailed water-use feedback to consumers present exciting new opportunities for improved urban water management. This paper explores two smart water metering trials in New South Wales, Australia, which provided household water consumption feedback via (i) paper end-use reports and (ii) an online portal. This combination enabled a deeper exploration of the various impacts of detailed feedback enabled via smart water metering. The positive effects uncovered by the research present an important opportunity for smart water metering feedback to contribute towards more sustainable urban water management. Their summary contributes empirical evidence on the impacts for water utilities considering embarking on the smart water metering journey with their customers. The identification of future research and policy needs sets an agenda for smart water metering to promote a sustainable digital urban water future. Larger-scale trials are now required and utilities should integrate the design and plans for scalable advanced feedback programs at the outset of smart meter implementations.</jats:p>",

Up to now, there are many studies investigating this role, but they seldom consider from the perspective of consumer utility. Consumers view remanufactured products as being of lower quality and are less willing to pay for them. It is important to incorporate the manufacturer's service and consumer heterogeneity in the model. Those employed in the remanufacturing industry are advised to increase the level of warranty associated with their remanufacturing products in order to command higher prices for their products in the marketplace. This paper firstly considers consumer utility, then develops three marketing settings to examine the impact of warranty services, and finally compares the optimal prices and profits among them. The results show that the manufacturer's warranty policy can enhance profit, and the profit is highest when both new and remanufactured products provided differentiated warranty.</p>",

This research employed qualitative (supply aspect) and quantitative (demand aspect) research methods. The surveys concerning the visitors (demand) were conducted at six musical events representing diverse genres: classical, R&amp;B,\n rock, blues, pop, and Afrikaans, where a total of 4,110 questionnaires were administered for all six genres. To determine the critical success factors in terms of what the visitors regarded as being important for a memorable visitor experience, a factor analysis was employed. The qualitative\n research method was applied by means of interviews to obtain the relevant information from the selected participants. All the data collected in the process were transcribed into text and presented in a narrative form. Creswell's six steps for data analysis and interpretation were utilized\n to analyze the data. Two themes were identified from the analysis; each of these was differentiated in terms of various categories and subcategories. The results from both the demand and the supply sides were compared with one another and significant differences were identified. The results\n of this research contribute greatly to existing literature and to the music industry as a whole, as this was the first time that research has been conducted on both the demand and the supply side. Moreover, this was also the first occasion on which both a qualitative and a quantitative research\n method was employed in research conducted at live music performances and where these were subsequently compared to one another.</jats:p>",

Supply chain performance is represented by profits and service levels. The simulation results indicate that farmers should pay attention to customer requirements and plan their agricultural activities in order to fulfill these requirements. Contract farming helps farmers deal with demand and price uncertainties. We also find that farmer commitment is crucial to fulfilling contract requirements. This study contributes to this field from a conceptual as well as a practical point of view. From the conceptual point of view, our simulation results show that different levels of farmer commitment have an impact on farmer performance when implementing contract farming. From a practical point of view, the uncertainty faced by farmers and the market can be managed by implementing cultivation and harvesting scheduling, information sharing, and collective learning as ways of committing to contract farming.</jats:p>"

Increasing number of companies initiates and implements practices considered as CSR activities. Concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been first introduced by Bowen (1952) and states that while implementing strategies and making their decisions, organizations should act taking into consideration societyâ€™s values. In this respect, Carroll (1979) defined CSR as sensitivity of an organization about the stakeholdersâ€™ expectations on the management of social, environmental, economic, ethic and legal issues. Towards the end of 1980s, concept of sustainable development has been introduced and has focused on economic, social and environmental factors that organizations should consider. Sustainable development emphasizes how today organizations can fulfill their needs without Jeopardizing the needs of the future generations. Therefore, MNCs interested in a green supply chain should be attempting to cut their transportation carbon emissions and those of their suppliers. This can be accomplished by using biofuel, choosing the type of transportation with the least carbon foot print (trains and ships), utilizing smaller trucks when possible, and encouraging fuel efficient driving behavior by employees.</jats:p>"

Dengan adanya penerapan konsep supply chain management diharapkan aktivitas supply chain perusahaan dapat berjalan dengan baik mulai dari produksi hingga sampai pada penjualan. Namun, pada kenyataannya ada saja permasalahan yang terjadi dalam aktivitas supply chain. Pada penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan metode SCOR, Model Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) adalah salah satu metode yang dapat digunakan untuk mengukur performansi supply chain. Model SCOR membagi prosesnya menjadi 5 proses inti yaitu Plan (perencanaan), Source (pengadaan), Make (pembuatan), Deliver (penyampaian), dan Return (pengembalian). Kelima proses inti ini saling terintegrasi mulai dari supplier sampai ke konsumen akhir. Dengan menggunakan SCOR, maka akan diketahui kinerja keseluruhan fase dalam supply chain perusahaan secara terintegrasi.

The study also provides an assessment of aggregate sustainability, which is less investigated with reference to cattle milk both globally and in Italy, through the analysis of the relationship between economic and environmental performance. Primary data were collected through a direct survey carried out in 2014. The environmental assessment was conducted with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) “cradle to farm gate” approach, while the economic dimension was evaluated by determining the direct and indirect costs related to the factors involved in the production process. A correlation analysis and a linear regression were performed in order to study the relationship between the carbon footprint (CF) and operating income. The average operating income amounted to 0.03 Euro/L of milk. The CF values of the five companies are contained within a variation range comprised between 0.90 and 1.76 kg CO2 eq/L of milk. The existence of an inverse relationship between the CF of milk and operating income confirms the hypothesis regarding the possibility of implementing strategies aimed at improving performance in both investigated dimensions at the same time, thus increasing the aggregate sustainability.</jats:p>"

This paper examines a key historical moment in the politics of housing supply and planning in New Zealand. Drawing upon a discourse analysis of a range of housing policy documents and urban plans, this paper traces the dynamic of local and central government negotiations and conflict arising from the development of Auckland’s spatial plan, the development of the Auckland Housing Accord (a central and local government agreement to fast-track planning permission for new housing) and the implementation of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act. The paper focuses on the manner in which certain policy knowledge is prioritised and applied in the construction of affordable housing policies and how this process, which is presented as objective evidence-based policy formation, is inherently political. It is argued that the legislation supporting housing accords alters central/local government power relations and represents a challenge to the existing planning system. </jats:p>",

Disasters and humanitarian operations literature acknowledges the importance of private sector in disaster lifecycle; however, it lacks an analysis of the risks and benefits of each different form of their engagement in such operations (contractual relationships, one-off relationships and CSR - Corporate Social Responsibility partnerships). To address this research gap, a literature review was conducted on papers covering the perspective of private stakeholders when engaging in disaster and humanitarian operations with stakeholders from public and social groups. The results revealed that some challenges are specific from one approach and others are common for all of them. Moreover, despite the increasing of reputation capital and organizational learning being used to motivate CSR approach, they are mentioned as benefits in approaches with lower engagement - contractual and one-off relationship approaches. Thus, the benefits and risks of each approach need to be carefully addressed by scholars and field professionals in order to seek better results from the engagement of private organizations.</jats:p>"

Therefore, extracting oocyst DNA is not a trivial undertaking. Standard procedures used to extract DNA from oocysts, such as freeze–thaw (F/T) methods and DNA purification kits, are time-consuming and expensive and are difficult to implement in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we developed a surfactant extraction treatment (SET) that efficiently extracts DNA from the oocyst. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) combined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detects pathogenic microorganisms with high sensitivity. The objective of the present study was to evaluate SET for its ability to simplify qPCR detection of 18S rDNA directly from immunomagnetic bead–oocyst conjugates. DNA extracted directly from the conjugates using SET did not affect DNA amplification in the qPCR assay. Further, the rate of DNA amplification using IMS–SET was greater than that using F/T combined with the DNA purification kit. The rate of recovery of oocysts from surface water samples spiked with oocysts did not differ significantly from previously published values. These data demonstrate that the new IMS–SET protocol using qPCR can simplify the recovery and detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts.</jats:p>",

The work presented here was undertaken to develop an efficient strategy that addresses the unknown multiple contaminant sources problem, and that could identify the number, location and magnitude of the groundwater contaminant sources and select optimal sampling locations. A Monte Carlo approach was used first to obtain the statistical characteristics of groundwater flow and transport model. Then the linear Kalman filter and a modified comparison method were utilized to update the estimation of concentration values and source weights, which represent the similarity between the estimated composite plume and each individual plume. Moreover, an optimization method was employed to identify the magnitude of contamination and the optimal sampling location. All of these steps were repeated until the weights stabilized and converged. A synthetic example was used to test the strategy and a further uncertainty analysis was conducted. The evaluation demonstrated that the strategy effectively addresses unknown multiple-source problems, under the condition that the error of concentration measurement value was controlled to less than 10%, and the time error was controlled to less than 6%.</jats:p>",

The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers’ signals are available to all parties. Under this circumstance, the supplier will profit from information flow and the retailers can earn profit gains as well, whereas the consumers will be worse off. </jats:p>",

We also discuss how one might measure the attributes of the framework and describe the application of the presented framework to a case study of near real-time data collection in the days following the landfall of Typhoon Haiyan. We detail our first-hand experience of capturing data as the post-disaster response unfolds starting on November 10, 2013 until March 31, 2014 and assess the characteristics and evolution of data pertaining to humanitarian logistics modeling using the proposed framework. The presented logistical content analysis examines the availability of data and informs modelers about the current state of near real-time data. This analysis illustrates what data is available, how early it is available, and how data changes after the disaster. The study describes how our humanitarian logistics team approached the emergence of dynamic online data after the disaster and the challenges faced during the collection process, as well as recommendations to address these challenges in the future (when possible) from an academic humanitarian logistics perspective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The environmental problems we're facing today, with their growing severity and increasingly global nature, are often referred to as humanity's greatest challenge. This paper develops a model that identifies the antecedents and outcomes associated with sustainable supply chain management linkage. The model starts by identifying two antecedents (internal and external orientation) that firms may adopt in order to cope with their sustainability goals. The hypotheses are tested based on the major survey data from 342 Taiwanese and Chinese public corporations. This study not only demonstrates that both the internal supply chain and external environmental orientation exert a positive on green SCM, sustainability orientation, and alliance performance, but also, more importantly, they delineate how green SCM is practiced. This study also sheds light on the role of a sustainable orientation in strategic supply chain alliance's performance, and builds a comprehensive conceptual framework that fills some key gaps in previous research.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decades, the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the conventional agri-food system has and continues to be contested within both academic and public institutions. For small farms, the unsustainability of the food system is even more serious; farms’ declining share of profit and the cost-price squeeze of commodity production has increased barriers to market access with the inevitable effect of agricultural abandonment. One way forward to respond to the existing conventional agri-food systems and to create a competitive or survival strategy for small family farms is the re-construction of regional and local agri-food systems, aligning with Kramer and Porter’s concept of shared value strategy. Through a critical literature review, this paper presents “regional and local food hubs” as innovative organizational arrangements capable of bridging structural holes in the agri-food markets between small producers and the consumers—individuals and families as well as big buyers. Food hubs respond to a supply chain (or supply network) organizational strategy aiming at re-territorialising the agri-food systems through the construction of what in the economic literature are defined as values-based food supply chains.</jats:p>"

Based on the SPI and SRI time series, two different models, a weighted Markov chain model and a Volterra adaptive filter model for chaotic time series, were established to predict drought classes and achieve both short- and long-term drought forecasting. These approaches were compared with a three-dimensional (3D) loglinear model, reported in our previous work. It was observed that all the three models have pros and cons when applied to drought prediction in Panjiakou Reservoir catchment. The 3D loglinear model is able to forecast drought class within 1 month. However, its predicting accuracy declines with the increase of prediction time scale, and this confines its application. The weighted Markov chain model is a useful tool for drought early warning. Its precision, which is significantly related to the stable condition of drought classes, is highest for Non-drought, followed by Moderate and Severe/Extreme drought, and lowest for Near-normal. The Volterra adaptive filter model for chaotic time series combined the phase space reconstruction technique, Volterra series expansion technique and adaptive filter optimization technique, and was for the first time used in a drought class transition study. This model is effective and highly precise in long-term drought prediction (for example, 12 months). It is able to provide reliable information for the medium- and long-term decisions and plans for water resources systems.</jats:p>",

The key feature of today's market economy is that protein production by conventional agriculture based food supply chains is becoming a major issue in terms of global environmental pollution such as diffuse nutrient and greenhouse gas emissions, land use and water footprint. Time has come to re‐assess the current potentials of producing protein‐rich feed or food additives in the form of algae, yeasts, fungi and plain bacterial cellular biomass, producible with a lower environmental footprint compared with other plant or animal‐based alternatives. A major driver is the need to no longer disintegrate but rather upgrade a variety of low‐value organic and inorganic side streams in our current non‐cyclic economy. In this context, microbial bioconversions of such valuable matters to nutritive microbial cells and cell components are a powerful asset. The worldwide market of animal protein is of the order of several hundred million tons per year, that of plant protein several billion tons of protein per year; hence, the expansion of the production of microbial protein does not pose disruptive challenges towards the process of the latter. Besides protein as nutritive compounds, also other cellular components such as lipids (single cell oil), polyhydroxybuthyrate, exopolymeric saccharides, carotenoids, ectorines, (pro)vitamins and essential amino acids can be of value for the growing domain of novel nutrition. In order for microbial protein as feed or food to become a major and sustainable alternative, addressing the challenges of creating awareness and achieving public and broader regulatory acceptance are real and need to be addressed with care and expedience.</jats:p>",

The vagueness, impreciseness as well as inconsistency associated in measures and their metrics (sub-measures) is considered in the presented work and the assessment of the experts panel is acquired ‘described subjectively' in linguistic terms and transformed into Generalized Trapezoidal Fuzzy Number set (GTFNs). Thus, a fuzzy performance index model has been introduced in purpose to evaluate an Overall Fuzzy Performance Index (OFPI) and also to identify the barriers/ill-strong measures. The novelty of exposed research exists in evaluation period of OFPI. In preview researches, it was indeed imperative to assign the appropriateness ratings as well as priority weights for second level metrics (sub-measures) and priority weights individual 1st level measures for evaluating the OFPI under 2nd level hierarchy of SC. The present research compensates this research gap and the authors developed a model pertaining to MCDM, which answered towards said dilemma. The OFPI has been evaluated by availing same data excluding priority weights of individual 1st level measures. Furthermore, a revised ranking approach accompanied with fuzzy performance important index has fruitfully been implemented to identify the barriers/ill-strong measures.</p>",

For dry coating, powdered manganese oxide ore was fixed on the media surface. Wet coating was achieved by depositing synthetic manganese oxides onto the bead surface. The media were characterized by electron microscopy as well as by testing the removal of Mn2+ in a continuous stirred tank reactor. Image analysis of microscopic pictures illustrated that the surface area could partly be coated by powdered material using dry coating methods, whereas complete coverage was achieved using wet coating approaches. With regard to dry coating techniques, Mn sorption uptake was higher for the adhesively dry coated glass beads than for beads where a binding agent was used. The wet coating column approach proved to be more successful than the coating of beads in a stirred tank reactor. Mn removal capability of the beads increased with higher reactant concentrations during coating. Oxide-coated glass beads applied in filter systems have the potential to improve conventional demanganization processes.</jats:p>",

We first examine the guaranteed-service model for a capacitated single-stage system with bounded demand. We characterize the optimal inventory policy, which depends on the entire demand history. Due to this complexity, we develop a heuristic, namely a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering. This is an order-up-to policy but with its replenishment orders censored by the capacity constraint. We refer to this heuristic as the modified constant base-stock policy (MCBS). We use a numerical experiment to compare the performance of the heuristic policy to the optimal policy. We find that the performance of the heuristic relative to the optimal policy improves with a tighter capacity constraint. We also observe that the performance of the heuristic itself can sometimes be improved by tightening the capacity constraint. We then use the results for a single-stage system to model a multistage serial system that operates with a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering, i.e., an MCBS policy. We show how to adapt the existing dynamic programming algorithm for the unconstrained case to solve for the safety-stock locations and base-stock levels in a capacitated serial system. We describe how to extend this model to other supply chain topologies. We report on numerical tests for serial systems and find that the best MCBS policy in a capacitated system can outperform the best constant base-stock policy in an identical but uncapacitated system. </jats:p>",

The objectives of this study are to impregnate aluminum (Al) and cerium (Ce) within the pore spaces of activated carbon (AC) for removal of fluoride from water and to evaluate the partitioning behavior of fluoride by the double-metal-AC composite. To achieve the objectives, combined oxides/hydroxides of Al and Ce were impregnated within the pore spaces of AC under varying pH, metal concentration, and synthesis temperature. The fluoride removal by different composite was evaluated, and the best performing composite was selected for equilibrium sorption experiments and kinetic tests. The effect of pH on fluoride removal was assessed. Overall it was observed that impregnation of a small amount of metal (0.05 mol/L Al-Ce) can enhance the fluoride removal efficiency, compared to unmodified AC. Sorption of the best performing composite follows the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum fluoride sorption capacity was estimated as 3.05 mg F−/g of composite. The rate of sorption by the selected composite is reasonably fast (3.6/h). Furthermore, within a wide range of pH (5–10), removal of fluoride was observed to be consistent.</jats:p>",

The results obtained reveal that price transmission has very small magnitude. Indeed, just 10 to 12% of price shocks at one level are corrected in the long-run by prices at another level both downstream and upstream of the food supply chain. The results also show that prices are transmitted mutually in both directions downstream and upstream the food supply chain in the two European groups. Furthermore, they indicate that in the long-run prices are transmitted symmetrically both downstream and upstream of the food supply chains in Northern as well as in Southern Europe.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain sustainability has emerged as an indispensable research agenda for the government, industry as well as non-profit orientation bodies. As a developing country, cold supply chain management in India is still in infancy. The demand pattern of food products has been dramatically changing since last few years. Nowadays, the customers are more conscious to use products for better health and highly expecting for food safety, toxic free and eco-friendly delivery of food products.  However, sustainable cold supply chain has not yet received good heed throughout the world. Hence, in this paper an attempt has been made to address these important issues. A conceptual model was proposed in the consultation of practitioners and literature support to address the important issues in cold supply chain management for food companies.  Therefore, in order to identify the key success factors for sustainable cold chain management, in this study a conceptual model developed. The proposed framework is then validated by an empirical research in the Indian food industry. This research has several alarming findings. Explicitly, in India i) environmental issues and social responsibility are not as important as other ‎economical supplier selection criteria, ii) among 19 food supplier selection criteria, the rank of social responsibility is 18‎, iii) low carbon emission is less important value addition trait as compare to ‎other sustainable cold chain value addition (which means in India the buyers focus more on their individual and prompt received ‎benefits rather than long ‎lasting advantages), iv) the use of life cycle analysis, renewable energy sources and passive cold chain are the least important ‎implemented sustainable cold chain practices (although this might be because of utilization complexities), v) the joint development of product is implemented at the lowest extent judging against other dynamic capacity ‎factors, vii) government usually backed the firms to adopt and implementing sustainability in their operations, but ‎training courses that will guide how to achieve sustainability are less as their requirement, and viii) business sustainability builds the trust among the government, suppliers, firm and all ‎stakeholders that build strong cold chain relationships.‎ </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regions of scarce fresh water resources, such as the Middle East and North Africa, are facing great challenges already today, and even more in the future, due to climatic and socioeconomic changes. The Middle Drâa valley in Morocco is one of many semi-arid to arid mountainous areas struggling with increasing water scarcity threatening self-sufficient husbandry. In order to maintain people’s livelihoods water management needs to be adapted. The Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) software has been widely used to examine complex water systems in the water resource planning sector all around the world and proved to be a helpful asset to show the various interactions of water supply and demand. This paper presents the application of WEAP on the Middle Draâ valley’s water demand and supply, including several socioeconomic and land use scenarios under one basic climate change scenario. The climate scenario shows a significant decrease in available water resources up to 2029 while all socioeconomic scenarios show an increase in water demand. In years of droughts groundwater is used for irrigation, leading to increasingly depleted aquifers. The aquifers are recharged by percolation losses from irrigation and by river bed infiltration the latter of which is stronger in the northern oases than in the southern oases due to water withdrawal rules. A drastic reduction of irrigated agricultural area is the only solution to guarantee sustainable water use.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Salt iodisation is considered a key public health measure for assuring adequate iodine intake in iodine-deficient countries. In Slovenia, the iodisation of all salt was made mandatory in 1953. A considerable regulatory change came in 2003 with the mandatory iodisation of rock and evaporated salt only. In addition, joining the European Union’s free single market in 2004 enabled the import of non-iodised salt. The objective of this study was to investigate the extent of salt iodising in the food supply. We examined both the availability and sale of (non-)iodised salt. Average sales-weighted iodine levels in salt were calculated using the results of a national monitoring of salt quality. Data on the availability and sales of salts were collected in major food retailers in 2014. Iodised salt represented 59.2% of the salt samples, and 95.9% of salt sales, with an average (sales-weighted) level of 24.2 mg KI/kg of salt. The average sales-weighted KI level in non-iodised salts was 3.5 mg KI/kg. We may conclude that the sales-weighted average iodine levels in iodised salt are in line with the regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory changes and the EU single market have considerably affected the availability of non-iodised salt. While sales of non-iodised salt are still low, non-iodised salt represented 33.7% of the salts in our sample. This indicates the existence of a niche market which could pose a risk of inadequate iodine intake in those who deliberately decide to consume non-iodised salt only. Policymakers need to provide efficient salt iodisation intervention to assure sufficient iodine supply in the future. The reported sales-weighting approach enables cost-efficient monitoring of the iodisation of salt in the food supply.</jats:p>"

Information processing capabilities are measured by the degree of two types of external involvement in the NPD process and information processing needs are assessed based on three dimensions of business environment. Cluster analysis was used to develop the taxonomies of fit between external involvement and business environment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the impacts of fitting patterns between external involvement and business environment on performance. The results reveal six fitting patterns between external involvement and business environment. ANOVA results show that the fitting patterns between external involvement and business environment are related to both operational performance and business performance, supporting our fit theory.</p>",

The higher handling rates will enable ships to have more time sailing at sea, leading to less fuel consumption. The reduction in fuel costs for shipping lines may be more significant than the additional costs incurred by port operators. We therefore propose a practical and easy‐to‐implement collaborative mechanism between shipping lines and port operators, where the shipping lines compensate the port operators for their additional costs.

The objective is to find empirical evidence for the theory that operational excellence in inventory management improves profitability in the long run. To this end, the authors examine industry level longitudinal data (14 manufacturing industries at the SIC two-digit level) over the 1958-1999 period by employing a series of hierarchical regression analyses. The statistical results confirm that a lower inventory level measured as the industry inventory-to-sales ratio has a positive effect on industry profitability measured as the profit-to-sales ratio. This evidence is found significant in 9 out of the 14 U.S. manufacturing industries. This study also reveals that not all the inventories, categorized by stage of fabrication, equally contribute to improving industry profitability. For instance, the profitability of the primary and fabricated metal industries has benefited from reductions in finished goods inventories, whereas that of the petroleum and coal products industry has been affected mainly by declines in work-in-process inventories.</p>",

Redd numbers declined abruptly in 2003, the year after a dry summer caused the dewatering of Irely Lake; therefore, we continued the redd counts during 2004–2012 to determine whether pond dewatering was a factor in the decline and whether redd counts would track Irely Lake surface area. The estimated number of redds varied from a high of 51 (in 2002) to a low of 2 (in 2006, 2007, and 2010); increases in estimated redd number occurred after wetter summers, and decreases were observed after drier summers. This pattern was significant in chi-square tests for redd number and the change in redd number with Irely Lake condition in the preceding year (dry, semi-dry, or wet). Rather than indicating juvenile mortality, the lack of a lag in response suggests the mortality of adults that would otherwise have spawned during the subsequent spring. The clear impact of dry summers in one of the wettest regions of North America underscores the important influence of hydrology on fish, even in the absence of other disturbances.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Received September 16, 2015; accepted March 15, 2016 Published online July 20, 2016</jats:p>",

However, factors inherent within the supply chain of supplier-buyer exchanges such as culture, politics, dependence and trust may influence supplier relationship quality (SRQ). This research therefore  seeks  to  identify  the  influence  that  these  factors  have  upon  SRQ  in  the  Ghanaian construction industry and develop a conceptual framework that explains the interconnectivity between them. A literature review isused to develop a conceptual framework of the antecedents influencing  supplier  relationship  quality.  Primary  ‘perception’  data  obtained  from  152 building  material  suppliers  is  used  to  test  the  proposed  model  using  Partial  Least  Squares (PLS). Findings reveal that culture, politics, dependence and trust have a significant influence on  relationship  quality  in  supply  chain  collaborations  amongst  purchasers  and  suppliers  of building  materials.  While  politics  has  a  strong  influence  on  dependence,  it  also  generates  a negative  influence  on  SRQ  and  trust.  The  research  confirms  the  positive  effect  of  trust  and dependence  in  SRQ  management  and  extends  understanding  of  the  influence  of  culture  and politics.  Practical  implications  suggest  that  managers  of  building  material  suppliers  should focus upon building trust and dependence and be discouraged from over-reliance upon politics and political affiliations as a basis for long-term relationship building</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In present manufacturing environment, the reentrant scheduling problem is one of the most important issues in the planning and operation of production systems. It has a large scope such as capacity distribution and inventory control. On the other hand, the markets are very competitive; it is a critical requirement of operational management to have effective management of resources (consumable and renewable) so as to achieve optimal production plan. This study considers a reentrant parallel machines scheduling problem with consumable resources. Each job consumes several components and must be processed more than once in a stage composed of identical parallel machines. The resources availability, jobs assignment and sequencing at each cycle and are considered and optimized simultaneously. On the basis of this representation, a MILP model is developed. Thus, that MILP model can be used for the problem in order to find the exact solution. Since, this problem is clearly NP-hard, and optimal solutions for large instances are highly intractable, a genetic algorithm is developed to obtain near-optimal solution. Then, an improvement phase based on different local search procedures are performed and examined to generate better solutions. The system performances are assessed in terms of measures such as the solution quality and the execution time. The effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic is examined based on comparative study. The simulation results demonstrate that the presented algorithm is able to find an optimal solution for small-sized problems and can effectively find a near optimal solution for large-sized problems to minimize the makespan of the considered problem.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To face global challenges, most of the manufacturing organizations are trying to integrate their supply chain (SC). To make a SC sustainable under a dynamic scenario is a major challenge for organizations nowadays. The selection of appropriate SC practices plays a very important role in sustainable improvement of organizations’ performance. Major SC practices are information sharing, buyer– supplier relationships, distribution and logistics, long-term partnerships, etc. The intensity of these practices may vary from sector to sector. To analyze these supply chain management (SCM) practices and their impact on performance, a case study on an auto component manufacturing organization has been conducted. A situation–actor–process (SAP)–learning–action–performance (LAP) approach has been used in order to perform the case study. On the basis of SAP model, different learning issues have been analyzed in order to determine their impact on the performance of the SC of the organization. It is observed that major challenges faced by this organization are lack of advanced information technology (IT) and manufacturing systems, unreliable suppliers in terms of raw material quality and delivery time and inaccurate forecasting systems. The main SC practices being followed by this firm are collaborative planning and forecasting replenishment (CPFR), customer relationship management (CRM) and integrated inventory management to improve effectiveness of SC for facing global competition. By taking different initiatives, the firm has observed improvement in the overall performance in terms of cost and delivery on time. An important finding is that now Indian firms form their strategies taking sustainability into consideration, which is very important to sustain in global competition. </jats:p>",

With the background in low carbon economy, reasonable adjustment and optimization of the power supply structure is the trend of future development in the power industry. It is also a reliable guarantee of a fast, healthy and stable development of national economy. In this paper, the sustainable development of renewable energy sources is analyzed from the perspective of power supply. Through the research on the development of power supply structure, we find that regional power supply structure development mode conforms to dynamic characteristics and there must exist a Markov chain in the final equilibrium state. Combined with the characteristics of no aftereffect and small samples, this paper applies a Markov model to the power supply structure prediction. The optimization model is established to ensure that the model can fit the historical data as much as possible. Taking actual data of a certain area of Ningxia Province as an example, the models proposed in this paper are applied to the practice and results verify the validity and robustness of the model, which can provide decision basis for enterprise managers.</jats:p>"

Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although influenza vaccine shortage is often attributed to low supply, it has been observed that even with abundant supply, a major shortage can still occur because of late delivery. In this paper, motivated by the influenza vaccine industry, we study a supply chain contracting problem in the presence of uncertainties surrounding design, delivery, and demand of the influenza vaccine. In this supply chain, a manufacturer has insufficient incentive to initiate at-risk early production prior to the design freeze because it is a retailer who reaps the most benefits from selling more vaccines delivered on time. Anticipating that late delivery will lead to potential loss in demand, the retailer tends to reduce the order size, which further discourages the manufacturer from making an effort to improve its delivery performance. To break this negative feedback loop, a supply contract needs to achieve two objectives: incentivize at-risk early production and eliminate double marginalization. We find that two commonly observed supply contracts in practice, the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility (D-QF) contract and the late-rebate (LR) contract, may fail to coordinate the supply chain because of the tension between these two objectives. To resolve such a tension, we construct a buyback-and-late-rebate (BLR) contract and show that a properly designed BLR contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also can provide full flexibility of profit division between members of the supply chain. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that the BLR contract significantly improves supply chain efficiency compared to the contracts used in the industry. </jats:p>",

The correlation between the coronary sinus fow and the infusion volume in different coronary artery was analyzed, and the performance of coronary sinus fow in predicting different coronary artery occlusion was deducted. Results: There were no statistically signifcant differences between the coronary sinus fow and the infusion volume in different coronary artery (p&gt;0.05). The correlations between the coronary sinus fow and the infusion volume in left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), left circumfex coronary artery (LCX), LAD and LCX, and LAD, LCX and right coronary artery (RCA) were all higher than 0.85 (p&lt;0.01), and those of RCA, LAD and RCA, and LCX and RCA were between 0.6 and 0.8 (p&lt;0.05).

Barley production has a profound impact on the success of animal husbandry in Hungary. Relevant foreign and Hungarian publications on fertilisation and investigating contexts between yield components of winter barley can only be found in few recent periodicals. The aim of this investigation was to gain data about the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus supplies on the plant height, length of ear and grain yield per ear as well as the yield of winter barley. The long-term fertilisation experiment was set up in 1989 on a chernozem meadow soil, calcareous in the deeper layers, with four levels of N, P and K supplies respectively. The present paper discusses the N and P fertilisation results obtained in the 2011 year of the experiment. We measured the highest values - height (78.88 cm), length of ear (7.25 cm) and grain yield per ear (18.9 pieces per ear) - in the case of AL-P2O5 level of 194 mg kg-1and N 240 kg N ha -1supplies. Maximum grain yields were recorded at AL-P2O5 level of 194 mg kg -1 as well, but in the case of N, the 160 kg N ha -1 supply was proved to be adequate.</jats:p>"

In this paper we link the dynamics of raw material markets and commodity price fluctuations to a delayed adjustment of supply. Drawing on the classical cobweb theorem we show how the implementation of this theorem using system dynamics may yield a valuable explanation, not only for the recent price decline, but also for possible future price movements. Starting from a simple cobweb model of general industrial markets, we couple the price‐adjusting mechanics to the global copper market and demonstrate how a simple market model can be merged with a physical material flow model. This model captures both market dynamics and technical aspects of raw material processing, recycling and substitution and adds an explanation for the widely accepted fact that the cost structure of the copper industry cannot explain current price levels. Finally, we compare the system dynamics forecasting model with a traditional econometric forecasting method and found the system dynamics model to be more intuitive and better suited to capture and convey the structural market fundamentals.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Floods are an important geomorphic agent that accelerate sediment supply from bank failures. The quantitative proportions supplied by lateral inputs and the transport conditions of the channel can create local or extended accumulation zones within the channel reaches. These accumulation zones play an important role in the geomorphic regime of the stream. Knowledge of long‐term history of sediment supply is necessary to determine how these input and deposition forms developed. This study introduces a new approach for the quantification of past sediment supply via lateral erosion (incised banks and individual bank failures), using a case study of the confluence of three partial tributaries in the accumulation zone in the Outer Western Carpathians. For each tributary, as well as the channel reach downstream of the confluence zone, we calculated the mean of the largest bed particles and the unit stream power as indicators of transport capacity. We found that two of the tributaries supply significant amounts of sediment to the accumulation zone because of their higher unit stream power related to their higher transport potential, and observed coarser bed sediment. Seventy‐three bank failures with a total volume 395.5 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> were mapped, and the sediment supply volume was dated using dendrogeomorphic analysis of 114 scarred tree roots (246 samples). The total volume of the dated sediment supply in the individual tributaries was 193.9 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, whereas the volume of erosion in the accumulation zone was only 4.9 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> for a period of approximately 30 years. The period represented by the dated tree roots included 12 years in which erosion events occurred and impacted the total sediment budget in the study area. Although sediment supply was greater than erosion in the accumulation zone, there are no present‐day signs of accretion. The rupture of a dam in an old pond (which is situated approximately 50 m below the accumulation zone) probably increased the transport conditions in the accumulation zone so that it balanced the high sediment supply from individual tributaries.

The study was undertaken in the Elidar district of the Afar region of Northern Ethiopia. Due to the water availability and vegetation in this district, the majority of the population (total population of 79,000 people and 647,000 head of cattle) are dependent on pastoralist livelihoods. The current ratio of available water supply facilities to number of beneficiaries is 1:2,323 people and 1:19,029 head of cattle. A joint UNICEF-UNESCO groundwater investigation pilot project with the objective of improving drilling success rates in the Elidar district considered a three-phase approach. In phase 1 and 2, an overlay method was developed that combined data from radar, optical remote sensing and ground measurement (geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, hydro-meteorology, and geophysics). The overlay model identified the most promising site to undertake well drilling, considering a probability of drilling wells with sufficient amount of water and permissible water quality (defined as Q = &amp;gt;2 L/s and EC &amp;lt; 2,000 μms/cm²). In phase 3, three production boreholes were drilled and the results showed a 92% accuracy against the overlay model.</jats:p>",

To that end, Free Trade Zones (FTZs) may help supply chains improve their bottom line while generating economic development to their geographical regions. The shift of manufacturing to overseas and recent changes in global trends, regulations and procedures call for a renewed understanding of FTZs from the perspective of the extended enterprise. Although having significant potential impact on the efficiencies of global supply chains, FTZs in such a context have not been studied in depth in academic literature. With this paper, we aim to modestly draw attention to that gap while providing an overview of the contemporary state of FTZs with a special focus on the USA and the application process therein. We propose a practical decision framework that considers the cost of imported goods and the level of business maturity to help companies make better decisions when they want to integrate with a FTZ. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Concerns about climate change and food productivity have spurred interest in biochar, a form of charred organic material typically used in agriculture to improve soil productivity and as a means of carbon sequestration. An innovative approach in agriculture is the use of agro-forestry waste for the production of soil fertilisers for agricultural purposes and as a source of energy. A common agricultural practice is to burn crop residues in the field to produce ashes that can be used as soil fertilisers. This approach is able to supply plants with certain nutrients, such as Ca, K, Mg, Na, B, S, and Mo. However, the low concentration of N and P in the ashes, together with the occasional presence of heavy metals (Ni, Pb, Cd, Se, Al, etc.), has a negative effect on soil and, therefore, crop productivity. This work describes the opportunity to create an innovative supply chain from agricultural waste biomass. Olive (Olea europaea) and hazelnut (Corylus avellana) pruning residues represent a major component of biomass waste in the area of Viterbo (Italy). In this study, we evaluated the production of biochar from these residues. Furthermore, a physicochemical characterisation of the produced biochar was performed to assess the quality of the two biochars according to the standards of the European Biochar Certificate (EBC). The results of this study indicate the cost-effective production of high-quality biochar from olive and hazelnut biomass residues.</jats:p>"

Economies of scale in the production of liquid fuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks favor large centralized biorefineries. Increasing transportation efficiency through torrefaction and pelletization at distributed satellite facilities may serve as a means to expand the utilization of forestry residuals in biofuel production. To investigate this potential, a mixed‐integer linear program was developed to optimize the feedstock supply chain design with and without distributed pretreatment. The model uses techno‐economic assessment of scale‐dependent biomass pretreatment processes from existing literature and multimodal biomass transportation cost evaluations derived from a spatially explicit network analysis as input. In addition, the sensitivity of the optimal system configuration was determined for variations of key input parameters including the production scale of pretreatment facilities, road and rail transportation costs, and feedstock procurement costs. Torrefaction and densification were found to reduce transportation costs by $0.84 per <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content> and overall delivered costs by $0.24 per <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content>, representing 14.5% and 5.2% cost reductions compared to feedstock collection without pretreatment. Significant uncertainties remain in terms of the costs associated with deploying torrefaction equipment at the scales modeled, but the level of potential cost savings suggests further analysis and development of these alternatives.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon the power‐dependency, and to some extent, social exchange theory, the study posits that mutual dependence between single supplier–multiple buyer relationships where major retailers are the weaker partners, may require a revisitation of risk management practices in that sector. In addition to the fraudulent and unethical practices established from media reporting on the horsemeat scandal, the study argues that the power asymmetry/imbalance may have contributed to a supplier culture that tolerated the unethical decision making leading to the horsemeat scandal. Based on an extensive review of secondary data sources comprising media reports on the scandal and a review of the academic literature on power dependency and social exchange theories, the study attempts to map out the root of the crisis, how to forestall future recurrence, and the managerial and policy implications of these. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

The power supply is based upon the principle of rapid sourcing of energy from the capacitor bank (2.8 F/200 V) by using a static switch, comprising of ten Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). A suitable mechanism is developed to ensure equal sharing of current and uniform power distribution during the operation of these IGBTs. Safe commutation of power to the EEF is ensured by the proper optimization of its components and by the introduction of over voltage protection (&amp;gt;6 kV) using an indigenously designed snubber circuit. Various time sequences relevant to different actions of power supply, viz., pulse width control and repetition rate, are realized through optically isolated computer controlled interface.</jats:p>",

Co-precipitated magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles were immobilized onto CA nanofibers at different weight ratios (0.2–2.5% wt/v) with a CA concentration of 15% (wt %), applied electric voltage of 20 kV, feeding rate of 1.5 ml/h and 7 cm distance between needle tip and collector. The prepared iron oxide nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction, a transmission electron microscope, a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR, thermogravimetric analysis and VSM. The fabricated composite nanofibers were evaluated as a sorbent matrix for lead decontamination from aqueous solution using a batch technique. The influence of solution pH, contact time and adsorbent concentration on the removal efficiency was investigated. Adsorption kinetics models and isotherms were applied to the lead decontamination process onto the fabricated composite nanofibers. The kinetics of the sorption process revealed that the pseudo-second-order model fitted relatively better than the pseudo-first-order model. On the other hand, both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms gave a comparable fit to the adsorption data, with a high coefficient of regression of 0.999.</jats:p>",

Many HOs run separate supply chains for emergency response and ongoing operations. Based on reviews of humanitarian network design literature combined with an in‐depth case study of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), this paper presents a warehouse location model for joint prepositioning that incorporates political and security situation factors. Although accessibility, co‐location, security, and human resources are crucial to the practice of humanitarian operations management, such contextual factors have not been included in existing network optimization models before. We found that when quantified, and modeled, such factors are important determinants of network configuration. In addition, our results suggest that joint prepositioning for emergency response and ongoing operations allows for expansion of the global warehouse network, and reducing cost and response time.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Contaminants in groundwater are known to be able to affect the disinfection process, resulting in the formation of substances that are cytotoxic and/or genotoxic. Though the European directive (98/83/EC, which establishes maximum levels for contaminants in raw water (RW)) provides threshold levels for acute exposure to toxic compounds, the law does not take into account chronic exposure at low doses of pollutants present in complex mixture. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cyto- and genotoxic load in the groundwater of two water treatment plants in Northern Italy. Water samples induced cytotoxic effects, mainly observed when human cells were treated with RW. Moreover, results indicated that the disinfection process reduced cell toxicity, independent of the biocidal used. The induction of genotoxic effects was found, in particular, when the micronucleus assay was carried out on raw groundwater. These results suggest that it is important to include bio-toxicological assays as additional parameters in water quality monitoring programs, as their use would allow the evaluation of the potential risk of groundwater for humans.</jats:p>",

The evaluation based on N rate experiments (0–320 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) from three subsequent seasons (2003/4 to 2005/6), with five modern bread wheat cultivars, carried out near Kiel (northern Germany). A previously published model was adapted for describing the influence of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content> on dry matter partitioning. Starting from the allometric leaf: stem relationship of situations with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content> ≥1, a correction term was used, to describe the partitioning under varying N supply. The correction term assumes a linear increase of the stem fraction, proportional to the difference between a <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content> threshold and actual <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content>. The allometric partitioning was found to shift towards stem fraction, if the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content> falls below 1.38. The slope of the relative increase was determined with 0.6. Both dimensionless parameters of the correction term were found to be highly significant. The second aim was to quantify how N status impacts the N allocation between shoot organs. Dry matter‐based N dilution curves were fitted for stem (plateau power) and leaf (plateau linear), for situations with sufficient N supply (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NNI</jats:styled-content> ≥1). The ‘expected’ shoot N demand was calculated as a function of observed dry matter and N dilution for both organs. The N deficit was defined as difference between expected and observed shoot N. Plotting stem against shoot N deficit reveals that 63 % of the shoot deficit was allocated to the stem (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.98). Implications for crop modelling are discussed.</jats:p>",

Applying the Stated Preference technique, shippers ranked constructs in the following order: reliability, time period, customer relations, cost, and flexibility. The results indicate that constructs associated with quality of service are more highly valued.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban land and housing market is a political arena where the government is usually expected by the general public to intervene for the benefit of the society. With the government owning all land in Hong Kong, public land auctions have been an important channel for developers to acquire land for property development, apart from private-led urban regeneration. For a long time before 1997, the government of Hong Kong supplied land to the market via a supply-oriented model which was entirely dependent on the willingness of government to sell. The situation changed in 1997 when the administration found that they were being unresponsive, and switched to a demand-oriented supply model, the Application List System. In any case, there is a general expectation in the society that government urban land policy in supplying land should have a major bearing on the housing market, especially in making housing more affordable by the general working class. By applying a Granger causality framework, we find this expectation unrealistic as there is no evidence supporting the claim that changing land supply via government land sale programme would impact on housing prices. However, it is found that housing prices do Granger-cause land supply under the Application List System which implies that private sector is more responsive to market changes than the government, which is ironic as the government decided to abandon this model and revert back to the old supply-oriented model in 2013. We conclude that the political economy of the urban land market has made the land supply model too subjective and dependent on government agenda, which is not a health development towards a more optimal urban land policy. </jats:p>",

We consider a multi‐period setting where two firms process a common commodity to meet stochastic demands. They can buy and sell the commodity through both the spot and forward markets. They can also share the commodity if one has leftover inventory while the other has excess demand. We first characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Our analysis reveals that in such a context, the value of inventory sharing is low when the forward price is directly used to value the sharing transactions. We then develop a structured trans‐shipment price scheme that uses a linear combination of the spot and forward prices. We show that this method can substantially increase the value of inventory sharing. Our analysis also reveals that in the presence of liquid spot and forward markets, the value of inventory sharing mainly results from the difference of the transaction costs, and it increases if the market in which firms operate becomes more competitive. </jats:p>",

Our research results proved that oilseed rape has high fertilizer (N+PK) demand. In the experiments, N = 210 kg ha-1 +PK proved to be the optimal fertilizer dose. The yield increasing effect of fertilization was 800 to 1300 kg ha-1, depending on the cropyear. The maximum yield (5000 kg ha-1) was obtained in the cropyear of the less infection. The excellent natural nutrient providing ability of chernozem soil was confirmed by the high yield level (3000-4200 kg ha-1) of the control treatment (N = 0 kg ha-1 +PK). According to our studies, as an effect of the increasing N doses, the specific fertilization yield surplus of oilseed rape declined (from 19-27 kg/1 kg NPK to 11-12 kg/1 kg NPK). On the other hand, fertilization improved the water utilization efficiency (WUE) of oilseed rape in the experimental years (from 4-8 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water to 11-14 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water). The results of our studies confirmed that the hybrid rape had of excellent adaptation to the sowing time; due to this fact, the yield decrease was minimal (0-270 kg ha-1) in the middle September sowing time compared to the late August one. According to the results of the Pearson’s correlation analysis, strong correlation (0.6*-0.9**) was found between the spring precipitation and temperature and the most important diseases (Sclerotinia, Alternaria, Peronospora, Phoma) of oilseed rape.</jats:p>"

Similarly, theeffectiveness of supply chain management in the order fulfillment process is criticalfor the organization to stay in business. Inventory determines the service level of anyorganization as the adequate and timely flow of inventory across the supply chainand manufacturing processes is imperative for the success of the organization. Thisensures high rating on order fulfillment and ensures profitability. In the supply chain,inventory management is a critical part of the process as inventory is an asset andany shortage of inventory impact performance negatively. To keep the right level ofinventory is a challenge for all companies and the challenge is becoming more complexwith the drastic and frequent changes in demand. This also makes the forecastingprocess more tedious and difficult. The constant changes in customer preferenceswith the increases in demand have affected order fulfillment as most manufacturingfacilities do not have the additional capacity to cope with sudden increase in orders.They require huge investment and with the shortening of product life cycle, the periodto apportion return on investment has to be relatively short compared to the pastexperience. This affects working capital and increasing working capital is not aneasy task unless the organization is wealthy. As Malaysia embarks on the aerospaceindustry, the dilemma for the manufacturers are similar. The high cost of raw materialsin inventory and inventory holding significantly affects order fulfillment. The findingsof this study differs from the normal business inventory management practices, thusoffering new knowledge and learning curve in the inventory management context ofthe high technology industry, in particular, the aerospace.

Traditional platform diesel generators cannot support so much power, so the required system must be supplied by the onshore AC grid. In general, when there is a long distance between the offshore platform and the shore, a DC transmission system is more efficient. This paper proposes a power supply approach for these motors using a voltage source converter (VSC) and derives the mathematical model for it. This method combines motor drive theory and studies in DC transmission field. Compared with the traditional motor control, this method, which makes full use of the advantages of VSC, can simplify the control strategy. And by using the <jats:italic>Q–U</jats:italic> droop characteristic, the strategy improves the system stability and fault ride‐through capability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sourcing from multiple suppliers with different characteristics is common in practice for various reasons. This paper studies a dynamic procurement planning problem in which the firm can replenish inventory from a fast and a slow supplier, both with uncertain capacities. The optimal policy is characterized by two reorder points, one for each supplier. Whenever the pre‐order inventory level is below the reorder point, a replenishment order is issued to the corresponding supplier. Interestingly, the reorder point for the slow supplier can be higher than that of the fast even if the former has a higher cost, lower reliability, and smaller capacity than the latter, suggesting the possibility of ordering exclusively from an inferior slow supplier in the short term. Moreover, the firm may allocate a larger portion of the long‐term total order quantity to the slow supplier than to the fast, even if the former does not possess any cost or reliability advantage over the latter. Such phenomena, different from the observations made in previous studies, happen when the demand is uncertain and the supply is limited or unreliable. Our observations highlight the importance of incorporating both demand uncertainty and supplier characteristics (i.e., cost, lead time, capacity and uncertainty) in a unified framework when formulating supplier selection and order allocation strategies. </jats:p>",

We study contract design for a buyer–supplier supply chain, with each party maximizing expected profit subject to a chance constraint on meeting his respective profit target. We derive the optimal contract form (across all contract types) with randomized and deterministic payments. The best contract has the property that, if the chance constraints are binding, at most one party fails to satisfy his profit target for any given demand realization. This implies that “least risk sharing,”that is, minimizing the probability of outcomes for which both parties fail to achieve their profit targets, is optimal, contrary to the usual expectations of “risk sharing.” We show that an optimal contract can possess only two of the following three properties simultaneously: (i) supply chain coordination, (ii) truth‐telling, and (iii) non‐randomized payments. We discuss methods to mitigate the consequent implementation challenges. We also derive the optimal contract form when chance constraints are incorporated into several simpler and easier‐to‐implement contracts. From a numerical study, we find that an incremental returns contract (in which the marginal rebate rate depends on the return quantity) performs quite well across a relatively broad range of conditions. </jats:p>",

This  paper  set  out  to  examine  the  reality  of conflict management in engineering project management in New Zealand. This was achieved through  a  review  of  credible  literature  sources  and  the  completion  of  a  pilot  study  to  gain subject  matter  expert  perspectives.  The  research  suggests  that  conflicts  can  be  destructive, resulting  in  anxiety  and  strong  emotional  responses  leading  to  reflexive  reactions  including avoidance, aggression, fight, hostility and a breakdown in communications and relationships. Findings indicate that managing a project structure is synonymous with handling conflict and these disagreements can be detrimental to the success of a project. The initial results suggest that  a  number  of  factors  act  as  drivers  of  conflict  in  engineering  projects in  New  Zealand. These drivers are: power, personality, group dynamics and organisationculture. The conflict resolution  tools  cited  as being  widely  used for engineering  projects are  collaboration  and negotiation. The paper also offers recommendations for future research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Canada, cannabis control has long been controversially debated, yet recreational cannabis use and supply remain criminally prohibited. Recently, there has been an increased “normalization” of cannabis use as well as debates about how cannabis should best be controlled under public health approaches; increasing proportions of Canadians have indicated support for liberalizing cannabis control. The present study is based on the 2014 CAMH Monitor, an annual representative, cross-sectional, telephone interview–based survey of Ontario adults aged 18 years and over. In 2014, the CAMH Monitor assessed public opinion on several items related to the control of recreational cannabis use, production, and distribution among a sample of 2,004 respondents. Results indicate that the majority of Ontario adults support reforming the – currently criminal – control of recreational cannabis use. However, preferences for how this control should be reformed are split between decriminalization with a fine, legalization with mandatory education and/or treatment, and categorical legalization. Further, the strongest support was expressed for production and distribution regimes that are tightly regulated by the state. More liberal preferences regarding control were observed, in some instances, among male and younger respondents. Current public opinion among Ontario adults overall supports liberalizing cannabis control, yet concrete reforms would require choosing among options that are not universally supported by the population. </jats:p>",

To explore this influence, an agent-based model was designed, and experiments were conducted under different subsidy levels. Our model focused on the ordinary business entities and their activities in the supply chain. By investigating the real world and other researchers’ studies, agent simulation class library (e.g., control agents, cooperation/collaboration agents, and fractal simulation agents) and their decision knowledge bases were designed to simulate the supply chain members’ behaviors, decision processes, and operation and production activities and behaviors. Price model, demand model and profit model under the subsidy were built to evaluate the supply chain members’ profits under different subsidy scenarios. Finally, a multi-echelon appliance supply chain model was constructed, and experiments were performed with different levels of subsidy limit. Results showed that the supply chain members’ profits increased under the government subsidy policy. The agent-based modeling and simulation method provides a novel approach to explore the impact on profit distribution.</jats:p>",
