Market demand for fish in China is highly income­-led and price-inelastic. With economic development, demand will expand further. However, there are limitations for increasing production from capture fisheries. Aquaculture has to de­velop substantially and play an increasingly dominant role in order to supply the market with sufficient aquatic products. A tentative prediction suggests that demand will reach 25.04 million tons by the year 2000. The maximum production from capture fisheries is only 8.4 million tons. If market demand is not depressed by high prices, 22.7 million laborers and 7.2·104 km2 of cul­ture area may need to be committed to aquaculture by the tum of the century.</jats:p>",

Oddly, this quota restricts neither production nor marketing. In aggregate, the quota program leads to more milk production than a typical marketing quota, but less milk than blend pricing without the quota. The California program generates more producer surplus and smaller welfare losses than a federal‐style program without quota. When class 1 milk sales expand, production expands less under the quota program than with blend pricing without a quota. Finally, increases in aggregate quota lower production because they lower the marginal price of milk facing producers.</jats:p>",

Treatments imposed included flower and cane removal in conjunction with partial or whole canopy shading. Raspberry plants were remarkably resistant to a reduction in carbon supply. Yields and primocane production were maintained even when canopies were shaded. Furthermore, if raspberry plants were prevented from producing a full crop in one year, yields the following year tended to be higher than normal. These data, and other studies demonstrating that raspberry roots are strong carbon sinks, suggest that raspberry plants may rely on stored carbohydrate to mature the current crop of fruits when current photosynthate is inadequate. This trait is characteristic of some perennial species adapted to progressively changing environments, but may not be optimal for horticultural situations where growing conditions are relatively constant from year to year. A large root storage capacity and excessive primocane production likely contribute to the relatively low yields that are typical of this species.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The equilibrium brain/plasma distribution ratio for 3- O-methyl-D-glucose (methylglucose) varies with plasma and tissue glucose contents and can be used to determine local glucose levels in brain. This ratio was previously found to rise as brain glucose concentration fell in response to lowered plasma glucose content. The ratios, however, differed with the same tissue glucose levels in conscious and pentobarbital-sedated rats, suggesting that changes in metabolic demand might alter the quantitative relationship between the methylglucose distribution ratio and brain glucose concentration. To examine this possibility, metabolic rate was varied by focal drug application, and hexose concentrations measured in treated and surrounding tissue. When tissue glucose levels were reduced by raised metabolic demand, methylglucose distribution ratios also fell. When brain glucose levels rose due to reduced consumption, the methylglucose distribution ratio also rose. Thus, in contrast to the inverse relationship between brain/plasma methylglucose ratio and brain glucose concentration when brain glucose content is altered secondarily to changes in plasma glucose level, changes in brain glucose content induced by altered glucose utilization cause the brain glucose level and methylglucose distribution ratio to rise and fall in a direct relationship. Determination of brain glucose content from methylglucose distribution ratios must take into account rates of glucose delivery and consumption. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is supplied only with arterial blood and has capillaries instead of sinusoids, unlike the normal hepatic tissue. In order to reveal the sequential changes of sinusoidal structure and blood supply during hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined hyperplastic nodules (HPN), atypical hyperplastic nodules (AHPN) and HCC in F344 rats fed with 2‐acetylaminofluorene for 25–35 weeks. The extent of arterial blood supply and the degree of sinusoidal capillarization were assessed by the staining of hepatic nodules with arterially infused ink and by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses of the sinusoids, respectively. The proportion of arterialized nodules was 47% in HPN, 57% in AHPN and 85% in HCC, which indicates that arterialization begins at the stage of HPN and a few HCC still receive portal venous blood. The proportion of Factor‐VIII‐related antigen (F‐VIII)‐positive nodules was 25% in HPN, 40% in AHPN and 100% in HCC. Non‐arterialized nodules did not express F‐VIII, while some F‐VIII‐negative nodules were already arterialized. Electron microscopically, non‐arterialized HPN exhibited normal features of sinusoids, while arterialized HPN showed disappearance of Kupffer cells and partial defenestration of sinusoidal endothelial cells. In non‐arterialized and arterialized AHPN, basement membrane became continuous and lipid droplet‐containing stellate cells were no longer seen. In HCC, endothelial fenestrae were diminished and basement membrane became thick. The present study has demonstrated that sinusoids are altered in the following order as hepatocarcinogenesis advances from HPN to HCC; onset of arterialization and decrease of endothelial fenestrae, expression of F‐VIII by endothelial cells, disappearance of Kupffer cells, diminution of lipid droplets in stellate cells and thickening of basement membrane.</jats:p>",

The effects of varying photon flux density (PFD) and nitrogen growth regimes on rates of isoprene emission and net photosynthesis in potted aspen and white oak trees are reported. In both aspen and oak trees, whether rates were expressed on a leaf area or dry mass basis, (1) growth at higher PFD resulted in significantly higher rates of isoprene emission, than growth at lower PFD, (2) there is a significant positive relationship between isoprene emission rate and leaf nitrogen concentration in both sun and shade trees, and (3) there is a significant positive correlation between isoprene emission rate and photosynthetic rate in both sun and shade trees. The greater capacity for isoprene emission in sun leaves was due to both higher leaf mass per unit area and differences in the biochemical and/or physiological properties that influence isoprene emission. Positive correlations between isoprene emission rate and leaf nitrogen concentration support the existence of mechanisms that link leaf nitrogen status to isoprene synthase activity. Positive correlations between isoprene emission rate and photosynthesis rate support previous hypotheses that isoprene emission plays a role in protecting photosynthetic mechanisms during stress.</jats:p>",
