In one case, exploratory drilling was continued at current levels and production fell significantly. In a second case, exploration was expanded until constrained by equipment availability. Production still fell, but eventually leveled off. Production still fell, but eventually leveled off. Production costs calculated for these projections suggest that anticipated future wellhead prices probably provide sufficient incentive to increase onshore probably provide sufficient incentive to increase onshore exploration to the limit allowed by available equipment But anticipated prices are not high enough to make offshore gas exploration commercially attractive.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The present natural gas supply-demand imbalance in the United States has aroused Federal interest in gas production from unconventional sources such as tight production from unconventional sources such as tight sands, shale, coal beds and geopressured aquifers. To provide a rational basis for supporting research and development in these areas, the Department of Energy ordered an analysis of gas production potential from conventional sources. That investigation, which was completed late in 1978, is summarized in this paper.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Forcon, a forecasting model which projects natural gas production potential from conventional sources, was developed to assist in the analysis. Forcon simulates the dynamics of natural gas supply systems by modeling exploration, discovery, development of new reserves, and production from existing reserves and new discoveries.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>FORECASTING NEW DISCOVERIES</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The model postulates that as exploratory drilling increases within a producing region, cumulative gas discoveries approach the ultimate recoverable resources of the region in an inverse exponential manner. That is, reserves found are related to exploratory footage drilled through the expression:</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>(1)</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>where Gi = cumulative recoverable gas-in-place discovered from some initial year through year i</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>R = present undiscovered recoverable resources</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Di = cumulative exploratory gas footage drilled from initial year through year i</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>b = scaling constant, in units of reciprocal footage.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Such a formulation is compatible with the finite nature of fossil fuel resources, with studies that show that there is a rapid drop-off in size in the world's sedimentary basins from the largest field to the smaller ones, and with the common observation that in general the larger reservoirs in a basin are discovered first.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>We propose that for mature producing regions, the best indicator of future behavior is a comprehensive analysis of the past. Therefore, we determine the equation of the discovery curve for each region by regressing on historical data of cumulative reserves discovered versus cumulative exploratory footage drilled.

Experiments were conducted on fourteen hearts, seven in control pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs and seven in dogs paced at 225 beats/min. Regional O2 extraction was determined by a microspectrophotometric method, and coronary blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. There was an 89% increase in coronary blood flow, a small but significant decrease in O2 extraction, and an increase in O2 consumption with atrial pacing. With pacing the increase in blood flow and the decrease in O2 extraction were uniform throughout the heart. In control hearts, right ventricular blood flow and O2 consumption were lower than the mean in the septal or left ventricular free wall. In the left ventricular free wall in control, the subepicardial region had a lower O2 consumption and O2 extraction than the subendocardial region. These differences were also preserved during pacing. Due to the large increase in coronary blood flow, the relationship of oxygen supply to demand was improved by atrial pacing. </jats:p>",

To test whether there is a causal relation between retinal blood supply and retinal cell production, surgical inversion of the eye, transplantations and excisions of retina were done to change the pattern of retinal vasculature. The growth pattern of inverted eyes was normal with respect to the internal axes of the eyes. After excision of part of the retina or after fusion of retinal fragments to form compound eyes, the pattern of retinal cell proliferation was not correlated with the distribution of retinal blood vessels, but was correlated with the position(s) of the choroidal fissure(s).</jats:p>",

For the application of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> labelled gas a special box was used. Both low light intensity and a low potassium supply resulted in a substantial growth depression. In particular the protein content of tops, roots and nodules was lower in the plants of the low light intensity treatment as compared with the control plants. Decreasing potassium supply had a similar but less‐pronounced effect on protein content. The low protein content was not a consequence of a lack of soluble amino nitrogen or NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, since these fractions were influenced to a lesser degree by the reduced light intensity and by the low potassium supply. This observation is supported by the data obtained with <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N. N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation and NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> assimilation were affected by both low light intensity and low K application to the same degree as the overall metabolism, thus showing no particular response to the treatments applied.</jats:p>",

Using the findings from task 2 above, a proposed plan for overall Lake Michigan water use through the year 2010 was also developed. The effects of the proposed regional water supply system on future water levels in the deep aquifer were also discussed.</jats:p>",
