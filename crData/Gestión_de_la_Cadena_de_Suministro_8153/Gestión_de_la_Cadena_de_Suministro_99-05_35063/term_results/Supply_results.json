      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the rapid rates of technological improvements possible, using modern biotechnology, the product life cycle of new genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is likely to be short and, hence, those investing in their development will desire access to the widest international market possible. There is, however, considerable consumer scepticism regarding GMOs, which is being translated into both government policy responses and actions by firms who are near the consumer end of the supply chain. As the licensing of GMOs is likely to vary from country to country and regulatory regimes will differ, firms involved in international supply chains for food products will be affected by the interplay of trade policy and consumer scepticism. All firms, even those not handling GMO products, will be affected because costly new monitoring procedures will be required. These additional monitoring costs suggest that competitive advantage is likely to be conferred on those supply chains which exhibit superior vertical co‐ordination.</jats:p>",

Conjoint analysis is used to assess the attitudes of the major commercial buyers of lambs ‐ abbatoirs and producer marketing groups ‐ towards key attributes of the lamb supply chain.

The Subsurface Development plan for the Project called for an extensive drilling program, from two drill sites, using extended reach drilling technology, due to the areal extent of the reservoir. A robust alliance strategy was adopted in the selection and development of a small integrated Subsurface &amp; Well Operations Team, to execute the 17 well pre-drill program. The team was highly focused and intent on producing industry \"best-in-class\" performance, safely and within strict environmental &amp; well quality targets. An interdependent risk/reward \"gainshare\" scheme linked delivery of specific environmental, safety, well construction quality and business objectives directly to enhanced profit and underpinned the integrated team ethos of success through cooperation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Although Britannia Field was discovered over 20 years ago, it was not until 1987 the full commercial potential of the field was identified.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The field is situated 210 kilometres (130 miles) north-east of Aberdeen in the UK North Sea and covers approximately 112 square miles kilometres (70 square miles). It underlies a separate oil field, Alba, which was discovered by Chevron in 1984 and has been onstream since 1994. Britannia's reserves of gas and condensate are held in cretaceous sandstone at a depth of around 4,000 metres (13,000ft). Once Britannia reaches full production it has the potential (at 740 million standard cubic feet per day of gas and 70MBPD condensate) to supply around 8 percent of the total UK gas demand at plateau period in the early years of production. Britannia's reserves of 3.1 TCF gas and 145 MMBBL condensate are being developed through a single drilling, production and accommodation platform at the east-end of the reservoir. The platform has 36 well slots and is supported on an eight-legged jacket in 140 metre deep water. There is also a subsea well centre with 14 well slots, located 15 kilometres (9 miles) west of the platform.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>When the Britannia field was discovered in the mid-1970's it was given different names by two of the oil companies which held interests in the five seperate licensing blocks it straddled. To Conoco it was Lapworth; to Chevron it was Kilda. Their agreement on the name \"Britannia\" was to become the symbol of the spirit of co-operation which has underlain the entire development philosophy and which embraces not only the interests of the co-venturers in the field but also the many service providers involved in bringing the project to successful completion. This paper compares the Project Subsurface Division challenges and goals originally envisaged in early 1994 and the results delivered over the subsequent two years pre-drill program leading to first production.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Subsurface Development Plan</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>One of the key challenges in the early conceptual development studies, was to formulate a viable subsurface plan to economically recover the reserves over the immense field area, whilst minimising facilities and drilling capital costs. Much of the early work done in the subsurface arena revolved around optimum well count and well design, to generate maximum production rates, to support the overall field development economics. Early in 1994 a Field Development Budget of Â£1.85 billion was generated, but failed to meet a revised aggressive economic criteria set out by Co-venturer's as a prerequisite to project sanction. Consequently, each project division conducted a rigorous technical and budget review to identify more cost-effective s</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Incentive problems may arise in this system when decisions are delegated to corresponding site managers, each maximizing his/her own performance metric. From the overall system's point of view, the decentralized supply chain may not be as efficient as the centralized one. In practice, alternative performance mechanisms are often used to align the incentives of the different managers in a supply chain. This paper discusses the cost conservation, incentive compatibility, and informational decentralizability properties of these mechanisms. In particular, for a special type of supply chain, we show that a performance measurement scheme involving transfer pricing, consignment, shortage reimbursement, and an additional backlog penalty at the last downstream site satisfies all these properties. </jats:p>",

The results of a recent survey assessing current levels of involvement in cross‐organizational collaboration among firms utilizing automatic inventory replenishment are presented. The results provide strong support for positive associations between high levels of CPFR and implementation of operating process change and information system capabilities. Results supported only a very weak association between CPFR and effectiveness in achieving operational performance goals.</jats:p>",

Given its dependence on UK multiple retailers, their supply chain management practices have considerable implications for the whole of the Irish economy. Retailers’ attempts at improving efficiency at their regional distribution centres have resulted in the growing use of consolidation centres whereby food products from several manufacturers are consolidated into full loads for delivery into RDCs. Results of three case studies suggest that the use of a particular form of consolidation (i.e. coupled‐consolidation where in‐bound logistics are coupled with consolidation services) results in the imposition of costs, especially in terms of lost flexibility, to food manufacturers. The distribution of these costs is asymmetric, with smaller firms bearing the greater costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) on megakaryopoiesis remains controversial. Treatment with rHuEpo in renal failure patients has been associated with a slight elevation of platelet counts. In animal studies, high doses of rHuEpo produced an increase of platelet counts followed by a gradual return to normal after 7 to 15 days or even a substantial degree of thrombocytopenia. However, because iron deficiency is also known to be associated with thrombocytosis, (functional) iron deficiency during rHuEpo could be contributing to these observations. We investigated the impact of iron supply on changes in platelet counts induced by rHuEpo. Rats were either fed normal food (normal rats) or received 1% carbonyl iron for 2 weeks or 3 months, as well as during the experiment, to achieve iron supplementation or overload, respectively. Rats of all three categories then received daily intravenous injections of rHuEpo (10, 50, or 150 U) or normal saline (0 U) for 20 days. With 0 to 10 U rHuEpo, platelets remained stable. In normal rats receiving 50 to 150 U rHuEpo, platelets increased to 120% to 140% of baseline at 4 to 12 days to level off at 120% at 16 to 20 days. This response was less sustained in splenectomized animals. Iron-supplemented rats receiving 50 to 150 U rHuEpo also increased platelets initially, but the peak was at day 4, followed by a gradual return to baseline and even a moderate thrombocytopenia later on. Iron-overloaded rats receiving 50 to 150 U rHuEpo also had increased platelets at day 4, but the duration of platelet increase was shorter, and they experienced a more pronounced degree of thrombocytopenia in proportion to the dose of rHuEpo. Because the early elevation of platelets was of larger magnitude than hematocrit changes, it is unlikely that it could be accounted for by shrinkage of plasma volume. Because it was observed in all three iron conditions, there appears to be some direct positive effect of rHuEpo on platelet production. However, after this transient effect, expanded erythropoiesis appears to exert a negative impact upon platelet production. Secondary thrombocytopenia was not related to splenic pooling, and its very slow correction after cessation of rHuEpo therapy is not compatible with changes in platelet survival. Rather, it is consistent with stem cell competition between erythroid and megakaryocytic development. However, this secondary thrombocytopenia is masked by (functional) iron deficiency in rats not receiving an adequate iron supply from food or stores.</jats:p>",

These multipliers are more appropriate for use in impact analysis of policies which influence farm outputs, than the traditional final demand multipliers. The paper estimates also such “supply‐driven” multipliers for 16 farm commodities of US agriculture. The empirical analysis shows that despite the variability in the multipliers' values, two rather solid groups of commodities which feel the strongest impacts of different crop and livestock output changes respectively, can be found. Several commodities are common to both groups, verifying also the significance of some indirect linkages between farm and non‐farm commodities. However, the final demand sectors absorb the largest part of the initial exogenous change itself.</jats:p>",

The model was established in a workshop with a panel of content matter experts. The results point at a disturbingly gloomy picture of vicious cycles frustrating the implementation of effective ISCM strategies. Fortunately, it appears that it is possible to apply the same generic mechanisms to create a virtuous cycle, for instance by promoting cross‐functional careers and by actively responding to demanding customer needs.

A series of tests were carried out for variable applied load and rotational speed. The experimental evidence shows that some bearing characteristics are significantly sensitive to changes in groove location and supply pressure. One groove located at 30 degrees in relation to the load line, in the direction of shaft rotation, can conduct to reductions in maximum temperature, maximum hydrodynamic pressure and bush torque, with a moderate increase in oil flow rate.

The laboratory‐reared fish (trained and untrained) as well as the fish from the wild showed species‐dependent differences of intracellular lipid content in their slow muscle, with values being higher in Danube bleak than in nase and chub. This suggests that accumulation of intracellular lipid within slow muscle fibres is partly under the influence of factors other than environmental ones, for example, capillary density. To test whether intracellular lipid facilitates oxygen transport from capillaries to mitochondria within the muscle fibres in those fish with a relatively low capillary density but high lipid content, this work also quantified slow muscle capillary supply. Under each life regime, the capillary densities for chub and nase were higher than those for Danube bleak. The negative correlation of intracellular lipid and capillary density is in favour of this supposition.</jats:p>",

In a 2×2×2 factorial design, we \ninvestigated the effects of sward (clover <jats:italic>v</jats:italic>. rye-grass) and supplementary feed with a \nhigh or low level of rumen-soluble N or of rumen undegradable protein on milk \nprotein composition during the grazing season.

Milk protein and casein contents and the ratios \ncasein N[ratio   ]total N and casein[ratio   ]true protein were at a minimum in late summer, \nwhereas the contents of urea, non-protein N and whey protein were higher during \nthis period. These seasonal effects were unrelated to either the type of supplementary \nfeed or the type of sward; neither were they clearly related to proteolysis, although \ncasein[ratio   ]true protein was related to the proteose peptone content. The results \nindicated that whey proteins other than α-lactalbumin or β-lactoglobulin accounted \nfor the higher proportion or concentration of whey protein in late summer. Based on \na principal component analysis including variables such as citric acid, lactose and \nnon-protein N, we suggest that the cows' energy supply during this period may be \na critical factor in determining the milk protein composition, although our results \nwere not conclusive. There was an interaction between the supplement of rumen \nundegradable protein and type of sward. When clover was grazed, a high supplement \nincreased the concentrations of protein and casein in milk and the κ-casein[ratio   ]total \ncasein ratio. When rye-grass was grazed, the opposite response was found, and \noverall milk protein yield was not affected. The very low N content of clover in early \nsummer reduced milk protein and casein protein during this period.</jats:p>",

Summer drought had the greatest effect, decreasing photosynthesis, growth and reproductive output in both species, and opening the bracken canopy. The timing of the drought relative to plant development was critical to which species was worst affected; bracken was worst affected by an early drought, heather by a later drought. Both species showed physiological damage during drought but, as predicted on the basis of their functional types, heather showed greater acclimation of water‐use efficiency to drought stress. Contrary to expectations based on functional types, heather responded more rapidly than bracken to increased nitrogen supply (50 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Added nitrogen caused both species to start above‐ground growth earlier in the spring. For bracken this stimulation was short‐ lived; added nitrogen might be preferentially allocated to the rhizome and the longer‐term consequences of this are unknown. For heather, nitrogen promoted growth and flowering throughout the season. There was no positive effect on the photosynthetic physiology of either species; changes in resource partitioning, and thus photosynthate production at the canopy level, are the most likely mechanism for the increase in heather shoot growth. Warmer temperatures increased heather shoot growth from early spring onwards but did not advance bracken crozier emergence, although frond height and the proportion of fertile fronds were subsequently increased. No significant effects of warming on the photosynthetic physiology of either species were found. Predictions of responses of heather and bracken to environmental change are complicated by the strong interactive effects of unpredictable climatic events such as drought and extreme winter temperatures. When drought was imposed, damage to heather was much greater in plants receiving increased nitrogen supply. Stimulation of growth by nitrogen resulted in a water demand that was unsustainable in drought conditions, leading to wilting, reduced shoot growth and some acclimation of water‐use efficiency. Additionally, a very cold winter spell proved most damaging to heather that had been droughted in the previous summer. For bracken, winter damage occurred in plants that had been warmed, with significantly fewer fronds emerging in the next spring and thus canopy photosynthetic potential being reduced. We predict that positively managed heather has the potential to limit the bracken problem in conditions of environmental change, provided that high levels of nitrogen deposition do not coincide with increased drought frequency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two experiments were carried out on cattle nourished entirely by intragastric infusion, to determine the extent to which glucose or a glucose precursor determines the response to protein infusion in energy-undernourished animals. In order to determine the requirement for glucose in 1-year-old fasting cattle, glucose was infused at increments to supply 0, 1·5, 2·5, 3·5, 4·5, 5·5 and 6·5 g/kg metabolic body weight (W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>) and the effects on plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and N excretion were measured. At 5·5 g glucose/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>plasma β-hydroxybutyrate was reduced to a basal level of 1·65 mmol/l and fasting N excretion reduced from 529 to 280 mg N/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>. No further reduction was observed with the higher level of 6·5 g glucose/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>. In the second trial, three steers were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square design and infused with a volatile fatty acid mixture of 65, 27 and 8 mol acetic, propionic and butyric acids respectively/100 mol, either at an estimated maintenance energy level of 450 kJ/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>and supplying a calculated glucose equivalent level of 13·0 g/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>(M1A), or at 1·5 × maintenance supplying a glucose equivalent of 20 g/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>(M1·5A). Another mixture infused at the maintenance energy level contained 49, 43 and 8 mol acetic, propionic and butyric acids respectively/100 mol but with a glucose equivalent of 20 g/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>(M1P). Casein was infused at each of these energy treatments to supply 0, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 2500 mg N/kg W<jats:sup>0·75</jats:sup>daily, and N balance and blood metabolites were measured. N retention increased linearly (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>0·98) with casein infusion. The coefficients for N retention were 0·55, 0·57 and 0·64 for M1A, M1·5A and M1P respectively. The mean efficiency of N utilization was 0·58. The results suggest that provided the glucose need is met there is no relationship between energy supply and efficiency and level of protein retention. However, the results also indicate that glucose requirement in cattle may be higher than that previously observed in sheep.</jats:p>",

        "The importance of thyroglobulin structure for thyroid hormone biosynthesis**We shared with our friend and colleague, the late Gaetano Salvatore, a long–standing interest in thyroglobulin structure, as well as a broader interest in the optimal production of thyroid hormone and its dependence on adequate iodine supply. Over the years, we frequently discussed progress in this field with him and his many co–workers. We now welcome the opportunity to review some of our investigative work in one of his favorite fields, in his honor."
