The model is supported by experimental evidence reported here as well as in the literature. Polarographic assays of the culture medium demonstrated an iron “complex” involving oxygen. The initial “complex” would be oxygenated, but not oxidized because no electron transport has taken place. The “complex” is formed in solution or on the cell surface and is somehow reacted with iron oxidase (or oxygenase), resulting in the release of an electron. Either sulfate or a flavoprotein is suggested as involved in the initial electron-transfer link between iron and the cell. The electron is transported in the cell through a typical electron-transport system involving coenzyme Q\n            <jats:sub>6</jats:sub>\n            , cytochrome\n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>\n            , and cytochrome\n            <jats:italic>a;</jats:italic>\n            oxygen is the final electron acceptor.

Superimposed on drawings of the models are reconstructions of the arteries and veins. The spray begins with a pre‐terminal bronchiole and ends in a trifurcation of alveolar ducts, each giving rise to two clusters of saccules. The third duct and its clusters are markedly under‐developed. So far there is no evidence that new acini are being formed and the possibility of this seems less and less likely.</jats:p><jats:p>Terminal arteries do not follow the rigid pattern of Miller (1937), namely, that an artery accompanying an alveolar duct breaks up into as many branches as there are “atria” and each of these into as many branches as there are sacculi. Instead, the six clusters are partially supplied by two rami which branch irregularly and also supply adjacent clusters. Parts of a cluster may be supplied by arteries from distant and alien sources. A long arterial ramus frequently takes a short cut through saccules of other clusters. Conspicuous are numerous small adventitious branches arising from the main artery. Often a peripheral vein is continuous with a pleural vein.</jats:p>",

Beauv.) was investigated by growing plants in sand culture at nitrogen levels of 210, 10–5, 5.25 and 2.6 ppm in addition to constant levels of other basic nutrients.</jats:p><jats:p>When these nutrient regimes were first applied the rate of leaf emergence showed a positive correlation with the nitrogen level. This effect, however, did not persist and the rate subsequently attained was similar at all levels of nutrition. Tiller emergence, on the other hand, was markedly dependent on the nitrogen supply and at 2.6 ppm N was almost completely suppressed. As a result of this effect the production of secondary rhizomes, i.e. those arising from tillers, was correspondingly reduced. There was, however, a slight increase in the number of rhizomes produced from buds on the parent shoot.</jats:p><jats:p>At 2.6 ppm N the dry weight of the shoots was reduced by approximately 75% as compared with the highest nitrogen level but there was no significant reduction in the weight of the roots or rhizomes. The shoot/root ratio was thus considerably decreased at the lower ni trogen levels.</jats:p><jats:p>By varying the nitrogen supply it was also possible to control quite precisely the behaviour of the rhizome buds. At 2.6 ppm and 10.5 ppm the buds ceased to grow when 2–6 mm in length, the size attained being determined by the nitrogen level. At 210 ppm, however, the onset of dormancy was eliminated and all of the buds grew out as lateral branches. Bud growth could also be induced at a low nitrogen level (5.25 ppm) by removing the rhizome apex.</jats:p><jats:p>The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the ecology of the plant and to the problem of apical dominance.</jats:p><jats:p>Influence de diverses dases d'azote sur la croissarce et le développent d'Agropyron repens <jats:italic>L.
