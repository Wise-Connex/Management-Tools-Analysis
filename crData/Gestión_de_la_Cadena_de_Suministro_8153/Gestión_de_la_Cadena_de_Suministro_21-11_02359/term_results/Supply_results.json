In response, we explain how more examination of configurations—meaningful sets of observations within a sample—can enhance theory development and, in particular, fuel the construction of supply chain‐specific theory. First, we describe the value of configurational theorizing while contrasting it with two more popular approaches: one that centers on linear relationships and one that spotlights the unique features of individual observations. Second, we explain the main configurational approaches available to scholars. Here, we pay special attention to qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)—an approach to configurational theorizing that is relatively new to organizational research. Third, we offer examples of how configurational theorizing via the use of QCA can be used to develop supply chain management theory. Although QCA is employed regularly in neighboring fields, QCA remains something of a conceptual curiosity within supply chain management research. This state of affairs represents an important opportunity because QCA's emphasis on causal complexity fits well with the fact that supply chain outcomes usually arise from an array of variables—often at different levels of analysis—and the interplay among them. Thus, better leveraging configurational theory development can facilitate the creation of novel conceptualizations and useful advice for practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While firms understand that implementing green supply chain management (GSCM) is important, they seem uncertain about how to manage their green initiatives by looking beyond their own facilities. Building a green supply chain requires the participation of all partner firms across the supply chain. However, partner firms are different in size, situation, capabilities, and even industries. Thus, encouraging them to participate in green initiatives is difficult. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hesitate to comply with green initiatives as they require a substantial amount of investment. This study empirically examines the causal relationship between the partnership governance mechanism and the success of GSCM. Based on transaction-cost economics theory (i.e., opportunism) and relational perspectives (i.e., trust) as the theoretical background, this study found that governance mechanisms between suppliers and manufacturers are positively related to GSCM performance. It showed that formal governance is important in the process-management side, while relational governance is critical for sharing knowledge in GSCM. The implications of the study results provide strategic insights on how the choice of governance mechanism affects GSCM performance and thus a firm’s competitiveness.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the author thinks of BOPS as an effective strategy for encouraging some online customers to switch to offline stores with high online return losses. The author first studies an omni-channel supply chain with centralized and decentralized decision making and explains why online returns hurt the supply chain with respect to the matching rate and the unit return loss. Although different channels can be operated by the same firm or different firms, the author studies how to coordinate the entire chain using a revenue-sharing contract. When online return losses are high, it is effective to adopt BOPS to reduce online return losses; otherwise there is no need to do so. Finally, the author presents numerical experiments, including a special case, and shows that in many cases, using an appropriate revenue-sharing contract under the proposed mechanism can increase the profits of the entire supply chain and its members.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Green Deal aims to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. According to this ambitious plan, 50% of greenhouse gas emissions are to be saved through a wide implementation of a circular economy. With supply chains responsible for four-fifths of greenhouse gas emissions, their role in the transition from linearity to a circular economy, and thus in the successful implementation of circular systems, is critical and requires the attention of academia, policymakers, and practitioners. Maturity models are suitable for monitoring, assessing, and evaluating the transformation process and determining the status quo of a supply chain. However, as the implementation of circular supply chains is still in its infancy, circular maturity frameworks at the supply chain level are not available yet. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conceptualize a framework for analyzing the maturity level of circular economy adoption in the supply chain context. From an extensive and systematic literature review of overall 1,372 articles on supply chains, circular economy and maturity the following findings can be drawn: (i) circular economy and circular supply chains are massively growing research streams; (ii) the link between circular economy, supply chains and maturity assessment is so far missing; (iii) three constructs (organization, products, processes) characterize and influence circular supply chain maturity; (iv) a 3-layered maturity grid covering six archetypal elements of the circular economy enables the assessment of a circular supply chain maturity. The developed circular supply chain maturity framework paves the way for circular economy adoption at supply chain level by understanding current level of circular maturity and thus supporting the circular economy implementation process at supply chain level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Supply chain network in the automotive industry has complex, interconnected, multiple-depth relationships. Recently, the volume of supply chain data increases significantly with Industry 4.0. The complex relationships and massive volume of supply chain data can cause visibility and scalability issues in big data analysis and result in less responsive and fragile inventory management. The authors develop a graph data modeling framework to address the computational problem of big supply chain data analysis. In addition, this paper introduces Time-to-Stockout analysis for supply chain resilience and shows how to compute it through a labeled property graph model. The computational result shows that the proposed graph data model is efficient for recursive and variable-length data in supply chain, and relationship-centric graph query language has capable of handling a wide range of business questions with impressive query time.</p>",

The food sector has been criticized for its sustainability and circularity due to the high levels of food and packaging waste and at the same time the increasing costs. Although food supply chain entities have started to implement circular economy and lean practices, the current efforts do not seem to be sufficient to achieve a circular and lean food system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Institutions within the medical supply sector have consistently faced substandard supply chain results because of failure of timely deliveries on the part of suppliers failing to quickly respond to deliver medical shipments. This indicates the procurement role having inadequacies as a key component of an organization since it does not deliver on maximized effectiveness and a reduction of costs based on poor supply chain management plans. A critical purpose of the study was the intention to identify influence of supply chain management strategies on performance of medical supply chain organisations in Kenya. More so, the analysis deals with the degree information integration impacts on Organization performance; to evaluate the impact of warehousing on performance; to examine the impact of outsourcing on performance; and to evaluate the influence of lean supply chain on performance of medical supply entities across Kenya. Direction will through be relying on the resource-based theory as well as the supply chain constraints principle. The analysis will adopt a descriptive study approach; with the targeted size comprising of 30 medical supply entities. The study participants included 2,529 staff of pharmaceutical supply chain entities within Kenya. Determination of the sample group was by Yamane’s concept that led to to a group of 345 participants. Accessing the participants was by stratified and simple random sampling approaches. Towards indicating dispersion and central tendency, standard deviation and respectively, with the inferential statistics being analysed by multiple regression and correlation analysis. The study findings reveal that performance of medical supply organizations in Kenya was significantly related with supply chain information integration (p &lt; 0.05), warehousing (p &lt; 0.05) and outsourcing. Despite this, the association among differentiation strategy and performance was insignificant at p &gt; 0.05 but only significant at p &lt;0.1). It was also found that while lean supply chain had a negative influence on performance (t = -.528, p &gt;0.5) information integration, warehousing and outsourcing had positive influence on performance (information integration: t = 16.461, p &lt;0.05; warehousing: t = 19.671, p &lt;0.05; outsourcing: t = 15.528, p &lt;0.05). The result of these outcomes is that the leadership across medical supply organizations in Kenya need to adopt information integration, warehousing, and outsourcing, which would   positively contribute to performance. Medical supply organizations in Kenya should continue emphasizing on supply chain strategies. The outcomes of the study may assist organisations in drawing plans or improving existing strategies governing supply chain management across institutions.</jats:p>"

The oil and gas industry in Nigeria is a part of the global oil and gas market which depends on effective and efficient supply-chain management system for the seamless procurement of goods and services (domestic and international), logistics, operations and production management, warehousing, storage of goods from organisations supplier’s suppliers to the customer’s customers with the help of adequate use of modern information and communication technology. The purpose of this study was to examine supply chain management: a game changer in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. The paper is largely a literature review, hence a desk research methodology was adopted. The paper revealed that the industry offers a classic model for changing the competition game in the sector through a lean, innovative and environmentally sustainable integrated supply chain management system, as today’s competition is no longer between organizations, but among supply chains that compete to reduce their cost of acquisition, production, logistics and warehousing along the chain while delivering customers products and services of quality at the right time, quantity and quality, at the right place and total cost, and creating value throughout the chain.</jats:p>"

A mathematical and simulation-based optimizations are two common disciplines in which this study integrates both of them together to consolidate their advantages. A mathematical model is formulated to find an optimal production-distribution plan. Then, the result is fed into a simulation model operating under uncertainty to verify the feasibility of the plan. Our integrated approach tries to find a feasible plan that satisfies both required customer service level and makespan limitation where safety stock is used to hedge against uncertainties, and lateral transshipment is used for emergency measures against excessive fluctuation of customer demand. A case study that optimizes the profit of an entire chain is used to demonstrate the algorithm. The outcomes of the study show that our proposed approach can yield feasible results (with near or even optimal solution) with much faster computational time as compared to the traditional simulation-based optimization.</p>",

The ultimate objective of this study is to facilitate the transferability and application of this sustainable technique in Egypt. In this work, a numerical model was constructed using Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) to study the effect of four design parameters on the RBF performance parameters (i.e., river filtrate portion and travel time) with the aid of MODPATH and ZONEBUDGET. The design parameters were: (1) the pumping rates of the RBF wells, (2) number of operating wells, (3) distance between wells and the river, and (4) the spacing between wells. This study was focused on the hydraulic aspects of the technique. The results demonstrated that: (1) the river filtrate portion exceeds 75% regardless of the design conditions, and (2) the hydraulic performance of the RBF technique is highly controlled by the production capacity of the wells and their positions relative to the surface water systems; the spacing between wells has a minimum effect. Two equations were developed to estimate the river filtrate portion and minimum travel time as functions of pumping rate and distance between the pumping well and the river.</jats:p>",

The analysis using partial least squares structural equation modelling obtained that the integration of suppliers has a positive significance on efficiency, responsiveness, flexibility, quality, and economic satisfaction, but it does not affect social satisfaction. Internal integration only significantly influences to quality. The integration of customer has a positive importance on efficiency, responsiveness, flexibility, and social satisfaction, but it does not affect the quality and economic satisfaction. Meanwhile, information sharing has a positive effect on economic and social satisfaction, but it does not affect efficiency, responsiveness, flexibility, and quality. Supplier integration was found to be a significant factor in supply chain management practices in influencing supply chains performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resilience is a particularly important quality for supply chains in this turbulent environment. Resilience in supply chain is the ability to retain, resume, and recover operations after an intense destructive incident. One of the strategic solutions for managing supply chain disruptions is to establish collaboration and strategic alliances in order to achieve competitive advantage. Therefore, given the increasing publication of articles in areas of strategic alliances and supply chain resilience, it is a good opportunity to review these articles, identify gaps in the current literature, demonstrate links between the two areas, and provide suggestions for future research. For these purposes, a bibliometric analysis has been performed on literature available on the Web of Science database. The distribution of articles based on year and country, influential journals, research areas, authors, affiliations, keywords, citations, and reference co-citation analysis are discussed. Results indicate that studies about strategic alliances, meant to increase resilience, are growing in areas such as &amp;ldquo;Management&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Operations research&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Management science&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Business&amp;rdquo;. Furthermore, the sources could be categorized in five clusters; namely &amp;ldquo;From knowledge concept to value creation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Internal and external relationships&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Logistics and supply chain performance&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Intellectual capital and strategic management&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Critical success factors and alliances&amp;rdquo;. This article can be useful for both practitioners and academics who explore the topic of strategic alliances and resilience in supply chain and also offers managers the opportunity to overcome supply chain disruptions and negative consequences of risks by becoming familiar with the key concepts of resilience. The persistence of businesses and supply chains is guaranteed through communicating with partners and even competitors in the light of alliance according to the findings of this research. Managers can pay attention to the integration of the supply chain to improve resilience and increase collaboration between suppliers and customers. Given the research results, strategic alliances can be noted in expanding organizational entrepreneurship, and shaping strategic collaboration networks in light of strategic alliances.</jats:p>"

On these days, the average worker experiences a reduction of around 7.5% of working hours. Workers partially compensate for lost hours by increasing their labor supply on days that follow high pollution days.

To meet this challenge, they need to be efficient by adopting new lean manufacturing approaches and new analysis and management tools leading to more flexible and agile production and distribution processes. For the textile and apparel industry, where products’ life cycle is short due to fashion changes, a new integrated approach of production and distribution planning is needed. Based on linear programming techniques and integrating subcontracting activities, our approach takes into account the characteristics of demand, including its short life cycle, seasonality and fashion effect. For these reasons, a sequential approach is adopted, combining tactical and operational decision levels for production and distribution activities, in order to satisfy customer needs at lower cost by reacting quickly to changes and delivering on time. The deployed approach is structured according to the DMAIC lean tool. Validated on real instances, this approach proves its efficiency by achieving cost reduction when internal production capacity is adequately and efficiently planned.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Annotation – The issues of maintaining the drilling fluid density during its transportation from shore to the oil drilling platform by the Platform Supply Vessels were considered. The research was carried out on the vessel of 5650 deadweight tons, which made 2 ... 2.5 day voyages from port to drilling platform with possible waiting for direct approach to the platform for 1 ... 1.5 days. The drilling fluid was transported in four tanks of equal-size, arranged in pairs on each side of the vessel. It was found that during this period of time there is a latent stratification of drilling fluid along the depth of cargo tank, causing stratification of its density. The density of the drilling fluid was measured at depths corresponding to 10, 50 and 90 % of the total tank depth. The drilling fluid density stratification is defined as the relative density change in the upper (at 10 % depth) and lower (at 90 % depth) parts of the cargo tank. The hydrometer was used to measure density, allowing measurements in the range of 650 ... 1630 kg/m3 with an accuracy of 1 kg/m3 while controlling the temperature. Density measurements were taken at 6-hour intervals. It has been experimentally proved that during the 48-hour transportation of the drilling fluid with the density of 1295 kg/m3, the density value at the indicated depths is 1163 and 1524 kg/m3 respectively, while the density stratification reaches 31 %. It is offered to prevent the density stratification by creating a forced X-shaped circulation of the drilling fluid between cargo tanks which stand side by side. It is offered to regulate and maintain automatically the drilling fluid density in the range of 2 ... 7 % by using programmable controllers. When the density stratification reaches 7 %, the controller switches on the circulation pumps and circulates the drilling fluid between tanks which stand side by side. This increases the drilling fluid uniformity and helps to reduce the density stratification along the depth of the cargo tank. The process of additional circulation of the drilling fluid is rationally ensured until the density stratification reaches a value of 2 %. Fulfilment of the above-mentioned conditions will ensure that the drilling fluid maintains its operational properties and the energy consumption associated with the additional operation of the circulation pumps is minimised.</jats:p>",

In the present study, an eight-echelon network is designed for a closed-loop agricultural supply chain. These eight echelons are consist of suppliers, farms, distribution centers (DCs), customers, recycling depots, biogas centers, compost production centers, and biogas applicants. To design the agricultural logistics network, a bi-level programming mathematical model is presented that optimizes the network costs and profits. Also, some meta-heuristics and hybrid meta-heuristics are applied for solving the formulated problem. It should be noted that bi-level programming problems are part of the NP-hard class and due to the computational complexity of the problems, the meta-heuristic algorithms are utilized. Finally, various comparisons and analyses are performed to evaluate the model's performance and the capabilities of the solution methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, Blockchain has been favorably adopted in the Supply Chain industry as it provides guaranteed transparency and traceability. The flexibility of Blockchain allows different applications to enable to exchange information; a significant middleweight layer is responsible for information transfer in the Agricultural Sector. The products that are manufactured at a global level in the agriculture industry are improved in safety, validation of some criteria, and quality. In the agriculture industry, the increasing number of complications associated with food safety and impurity risks needs high-level effective traceability solutions that act as necessary quality management tools to make sure satisfactory safety of crops. The agricultural supply chain today has complex ecosystems, consisting of several stockholders to authenticate criteria which are important like crop development stages, monitoring and validation, and compliance with the quality standard. In this proposed research, a systematic literature review will be done that includes smart contracts, Blockchain, and business transactions exclusively for crop production traceability across the agricultural and food supply chain. By using Blockchain in the agriculture sector, productivity, consistency, safety, reliability, and advanced security are increased. All transactions are kept and recorded on the immutable record of Blockchain associates with a decentralized system. Thus, it provides more traceability and clarity in the agriculture system in asafe, trustworthy, and effective way. A systematic literature review is thus enforced to classify the papers which are selected by the following classification: crop traceability, contribution type, research type, and their approach. For this systematic review, the papers which extracted are classified according to defined criteria. The purpose of this study is to fill the gap by collecting and analyzing studies available within the literature aiming to firstly, gain complete insight on the integration of Blockchain in the agriculture sector. Secondly, provide a summary of the present state of research on this area and identify gaps in existing studies. To achieve this aim an SLR was conducted. The findings of this SLR are discussed and researchers were provided with suggestions on possible directions for future research.</jats:p>"

However, using the blockchain-based ACTS needs chain members’ additional expenditure. They want to know investment conditions about the blockchain-based ACTS and how to coordinate the supply chain. To solve these problems, we chosen a supply chain with one fresh producer and one retailer as the study object. Afterwards, considering the changes of the repeat purchase rate and the product circulation rate, we revised the demand function. Then, we constructed the profit functions before and after adopting the blockchain-based ACTS, and then a price discount and revenue-sharing contract was put forward to coordinate the supply chain. Findings: with the growth of the repurchase rate, benefits of chain members in the proposed three situations will increase. Thus, we can know that after using the blockchain-based ACTS.</jats:p>"

Food production is also included in the breadth of applications of this expanding technology. Increasing consumer awareness about sustainability, including the problem of food waste, as well as growing interest in customised nutrition have led to the emergence of food industry research focused on aspects, such as packaging, portion size, and healthy sustainable ingredients, to satisfy consumer demands. The growing market for personalised food options in particular, requires increased flexibility and agility to tailor ingredients to an individual’s specific requirements. Such specificity is not easily fulfilled using traditional mass production methods; however, the emerging technology of 3D food printing (3DFP) may be one solution. This paper evaluates the opportunities, risks, and challenges associated with 3DFP, with a focus on developing sustainable supply chains for future growth. Drawing on 12 semi-structured interviews with 3DFP industry managers and current literature in the domain, we propose three supply chain models for 3DFP services, as well as an overview of the key business drivers.</jats:p>"

In this context, dimensions such as; comprehensiveness, regularity, timeliness, content, scope, and user-friendliness are the pillars of the proposed framework. Selected criteria have been used as inputs to develop the information transparency level. The Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP) is used to obtain weights of these inputs, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used for the determination of the efficiency ranking for transparency. Results demonstrated that Content, Scope and Comprehensiveness dimensions have 75% impact on the transparency of data.

Beyond the maximum payload range, fuel requirements reduce payload capability. Varying environmental conditions further impact payload capability noticeably. An airline’s commercial department requires prior knowledge of any payload restrictions, to restrict booking levels accordingly. Current forecasting approaches use monthly average performance, at, typically, the 85% probability level, to determine such payload capability. Such an approach can be overly restrictive in an industry where yields are marginal, resulting in sellable seats remaining empty. Monte Carlo simulation principles were applied to model the variance in environmental conditions, as well as in the expected payload demand. The resulting forecasting model allows the risk of demand exceeding supply to be assessed continually. Payload restrictions can then be imposed accordingly, to reduce the risk of demand exceeding supply to a required risk level.</jats:p>"

We have selected four different proxies of financial inclusion, two from the perspective of the supply side and two from the perspective of the demand side. For empirical analysis, we have applied 2SLS and GMM methods. In the economic growth model, among the variables of financial inclusion, only the variable of ATMS is positively significant when we apply the 2SLS approach and all others are insignificant, however, when we apply the GMM approach two variables i.e. ATMS and branches are positively significant implying that supply-side financial inclusion is vital for economic growth in OBOR countries. On the other side, the variables of financial inclusion, whether supply-side or demand-side, exerted a positive impact on the CO2 emissions irrespective of the estimation techniques i.e. 2SLS and GMM. These findings imply that financial inclusion, in general, causes CO2 emissions to rise.</jats:p>"

This system’s major components are purchasing, distribution, and integration. Purchasing is linked to the relationship between the buyer and the supplier. The term “distribution” refers to the process of moving something from one location to another. This relates to different types of organisation that considers functions like Purchasing, Operation and work coordination. Functions such as Vertical Integration, Horizontal Integration, Forward Integration and Backward Integration, etc and Integration can all be viewed as parts of standard organisation.The  main  aim  of  this  present  research  paper  is  to  reduce  the  cost  of dehydrated potato in the branded product Bikaneri mixture. This Involved redesign of the supply chain to reduce the cost of uncovered dehydrated potato. Change of organisation methods to achieve this by reconsideration of contract cultivating strategy. Agreement development is a notion of Purchasing that is employed by agribusiness leaders on an ongoing basis. As a result the cost of producing dehydrated potato has been reduced from Rs. 4880000 to Rs. 4573423 per annum, resulting in an improvement of 6.5 percent profit margin for the firm.</jats:p>"

The supplier conducts production and determines the green level and wholesale price as a game leader, the retailer sells green products to consumers and determines the retail price as a follower. Equilibrium solutions are derived, and the influence of risk aversion on the GSC is examined. Our results show that, for the centralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the green level and the retail price; while for the decentralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the wholesale price and the retail price, but it may induce the supplier to increase the green level given a large risk tolerance of the supplier. Meanwhile, the risk-averse decentralized GSC may obtain more expected profit than the risk-neutral decentralized GSC. Furthermore, this paper designs a revenue-and-cost-sharing joint contract to coordinate the risk-neutral GSC, and such a contract can improve the risk-averse GSC under specific conditions.</jats:p>"

Entry into global value chains (GVCs) has led to vast transfers of knowledge, creating human resource capabilities that continuously facilitate the upgrading of Chinese firms. China’s most advanced industries were all those characterized by active participation in GVCs. China’s entry into GVCs has differed significantly from the experiences of other emerging economies, arguably affording China greater innovation benefits. This is directly related to China’s institutional environment of “structured uncertainty.” Structured uncertainty shaped the pattern and impact of entry into GVCs, dictating which regions entered GVCs, when, and how, with long-term knowledge transfer effects.</jats:p>"

Resilience in the supply chain is the ability to retain, resume, and recover operations after an intense destructive incident. One of the strategic solutions for managing supply chain disruptions is to establish collaboration and strategic alliances in order to achieve competitive advantage. Therefore, given the increasing publication of articles in areas of strategic alliances and supply chain resilience, it is a good opportunity to review these articles, identify gaps in the current literature, demonstrate links between the two areas, and provide suggestions for future research. For these purposes, a bibliometric analysis has been performed on literature available on the Web of Science database. The distribution of articles based on year and country, influential journals, research areas, authors, affiliations, keywords, citations, and reference co-citation analysis are discussed. Results indicate that studies about strategic alliances, meant to increase resilience, are growing in areas such as “Management”, “Operations research”, “Management science”, and “Business”. Furthermore, the sources could be categorized into five clusters; namely “From knowledge concept to value creation”, “Internal and external relationships”, “Logistics and supply chain performance”, “Intellectual capital and strategic management”, and “Critical success factors and alliances”. This article can be useful for both practitioners and academics who explore the topic of strategic alliances and resilience in the supply chain, and also offers managers the opportunity to overcome supply chain disruptions and negative consequences of risks by becoming familiar with the key concepts of resilience. The persistence of businesses and supply chains is guaranteed through communicating with partners and even competitors in the light of alliance according to the findings of this research. Managers can pay attention to the integration of the supply chain to improve resilience and increase collaboration between suppliers and customers. Given the research results, strategic alliances can be noted in expanding organizational entrepreneurship and shaping strategic collaboration networks in light of strategic alliances.</jats:p>"

In this mechanism, water users are asked to submit bid packages via a web-based platform. A bid package represents the real values that a user puts on different quantities of withdrawn groundwater considering its quality. Then, the most reliable water trading policy as well as the price of water are calculated by taking the market endogenous and exogenous uncertainties into account using the regret theory. The results show that by applying the proposed uncertainty-based smart groundwater market mechanisms to the Nough Plain in Iran, the average productivity of water users increases about 18% compared to the status quo condition. Furthermore, based on the outputs of the proposed market model, groundwater is finally distributed to agricultural users almost proportional to their farm's area.</jats:p>",

Thus, this article focuses on female workers’ issues in emerging and developing economies where the ongoing pandemic continues to devastate and create multidimensional social and economic challenges for the wellbeing and social sustainability of female workers. Our analysis suggests that female workers are facing serious socioeconomic challenges that continue to affect their wellbeing, mental health, and livelihoods. Accordingly, it is imperative that international development organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade associations, governments, and most importantly the corporate sector not only consider individual responsibility for promoting female workforce social sustainability in global supply chains but also actively collaborate to address pressing social sustainability issues vis à vis female workers.

Additionally, a methodology to develop supply chain resilience roadmaps is conceptualised by analysing existing literature to help plan for unexpected events. Results: The methodology is introduced to create roadmaps comprises several stages, including supply chain exploration, scenario planning, system analysis, definition of strategies, and signal monitoring. Each roadmap contains the description of a plausible future in terms of supply chain disruptions and the strategies to implement to help mitigate negative impacts. Conclusions: The creation of roadmaps calls for an anticipatory mindset from all members along the supply chain. The roadmaps development establishes the foundations for a holistic supply chain disruption preparation and analysis.</jats:p>"

Recent findings suggest that the dauer larva of<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>.<jats:italic>elegans</jats:italic>may utilize external ethanol as an energy source to extend their lifespan. It was shown that while ethanol may serve as an effectively infinite source of energy, some toxic compounds accumulating as byproducts of its metabolism may lead to the damage of mitochondria and thus limit the lifespan of larvae. A minimal mathematical model was proposed to explain the connection between the lifespan of dauer larva and its ethanol metabolism. To explore theoretically if it is possible to extend even further the lifespan of dauer larvae, we incorporated two natural mechanisms describing the recovery of damaged mitochondria and elimination of toxic compounds, which were previously omitted in the model. Numerical simulations of the revised model suggest that while the ethanol concentration is constant, the lifespan still stays limited. However, if ethanol is supplied periodically, with a suitable frequency and amplitude, the dauer could survive as long as we observe the system. Analytical methods further help to explain how the feeding frequency and amplitude affect the lifespan extension. Based on comparison of the model with experimental data for fixed ethanol concentration, we propose the range of feeding protocols that could lead to even longer dauer survival and can be tested experimentally.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to explore how blockchain technology adoption solves the SCF problem using a multi-case method based on the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM). With purposive sampling, 30 cases were selected on the criteria of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in solving SCF problems. The results show that trust, validity and distributed ledger transaction data as perceived usefulness are the main drivers of blockchain adoption because it provides solutions to SCF automation problems such as Know Your Customer (KYC), accounting, and transaction settlement. Smart contracts offer easy and fast transactions such as in L/C export processing as perceived ease to use. Of the 30 blockchain projects, 21 offer the usefulness of automated accounts receivable financing, 15 offer easy-to-use purchase order financing and 8 offer easy-to-use inventory financing processes. This study provides the current state of blockchain technology adoption by exploring 30 real application cases in SCF globally. Blockchain advantages provide automation solutions in global supply SCF practices with smart contracts, transparency and security of distributed ledger data feature.</jats:p>"

This study examined the potential contribution of digitalization of the food system to such transition by reviewing 76 relevant journal articles, indexed on the Scopus database, using the integrative literature review approach and descriptive content analysis with MAXQDA 2020 software. ‘Blockchain’ was the top hit among keywords and main concepts applied to the food system. The UK as a country and Europe as a continent were found to lead the scientific research on food system digitalization. Use of digital technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and related information and communications technologies were identified as enablers. Traceability, sustainability, resilience to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing food waste were among the key benefit areas associated with digitalization for different food commodities. Challenges to practical applications related to infrastructure and cost, knowledge and skill, law and regulations, the nature of the technologies, and the nature of the food system were identified. Developing policies and regulations, supporting infrastructure development, and educating and training people could facilitate fuller digitalization of the food system.</jats:p>"

The objective of this achievement is the satisfaction of the water needs of the city of Ain Azel (drinking water supply, irrigation and industrial water supply) and even the transfer to other municipalities suffering by the lack of water and the resumption of mining activity at the deposit of Kherzet Youcef. This water table is located in carbonate formations of Paleo-Neogene age linked to lead-zinc mineralization. Knowledge of water quality and its suitability for human consumption is an obligation. These metals have adverse health effects. We used the results of Sonarem's analyses between 1973-1979. In addition, we carried out two analyses, during two years 2015 - 2016, on five boreholes. The parameters analyzed are major elements, physical parameters and trace metal elements (Zn, Pb and Fe). The analyses were done by ICP-AES. In our work, it has been shown that waste water is suitable for use in agriculture. For this we used the electrical conductivity at 25°C and those of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). For drinking water supply, monitoring the change in TME (Zn, Pb and Fe) for two years has allowed us to conclude that groundwater in the groundwater table east of the Kherzet Youcef fault is generally acceptable. They are eligible by the quality standard set by Algerian regulations. However, they exceed WHO standards, especially for lead. We recommend a revision of drinking water quality standards set by Algerian regulations, rigorous monitoring of TME content variation and water treatment before distribution.</jats:p>"

With forecasts of demand for lithium chemicals alone forecast to grow by three times later this decade, at least $10B USD is needed to flow into the upstream supply chain to ensure an efficient and timely build-out. Significant additional capital is needed for other portions of the supply chain such as other raw materials, cathode or anode production, and battery cell manufacturing. Recent exogenous shocks such as the US-China trade war and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have made securing adequate capital for the supply chain a difficult challenge. Without the steady stream of funding for new mine and chemical conversion capacity, widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) could be put at risk.

To meet the huge and continuous demand for filtering facepiece respirators, this concept paper suggests a supply chain management framework based on the disaster management principle. This concept paper adopts an exploratory and qualitative literature review to provide managerial insights for the supply chain participants. Due to implementation delay and strategic interdependency, the supply chain management strategies need to be systematically integrated. A viable way to integrate strategies is based on the disaster management cycle: mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery phases. Our model integrates innovative and successful but overlooked supply chain management strategies. First, the production capacity should be flexible so that the production mode in emergency and normal situations can be different. Second, the concept paper and development facilities can utilize their capacities for actual production in emergencies. Third, the quality certification process should accommodate the flexible production capacities. Fourth, inventory stockpiling should be renewable. This concept paper contributes to policymakers, healthcare sector decision-makers, stakeholders throughout the FFR supply chain to cope with future crises caused by pandemics by providing a systematic approach to constructing an effective, flexible, and resilient supply chain.</jats:p>"

I exploit a disclosure regulation enacted in California, which mandates that firms disclose how they conduct due diligence to address their suppliers' human rights abuses. I find that treated firms increase their supply chain due diligence, and their suppliers' human rights performance improves following the regulation. The effects are stronger when firms face greater pressure from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and socially conscious shareholders, when customers have greater incentives to use the newly disclosed information, and when the regulation leads to a larger increase in information comparability. Collectively, the results suggest that mandatory nonfinancial disclosure can affect firms' real decisions through market mechanisms and that stakeholder responses play a key role.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: G14; G18; G38; J80; K22; K31; K38; L23; M41; M48.</jats:p>",

It is therefore imperative to develop a water quality index to evaluate irrigation water more accurately. This study highlights an Integrated Irrigation Water Quality Index (IIWQIndex) using the sub-index and aggregated equations. This proposed index model was improved and updated across four characteristics: the verified desirable and permissible value of parameters, maximum hazard class, and modified rating system of diversified parameters. The proposed IIWQIndex model classified irrigation water into five categories: rejection, poor, moderate, good, and excellent. This model assessed two types of water to justify the model by categorizing the irrigation waters. The calculated results showed that the index values were 75.77 and 36.51, and the water category was ‘good’ and ‘rejected’ for the calcite (Ca–HCO3) and sodic (Na–Cl) water, respectively. This index model also satisfactorily evaluated different types of water datasets of eight geographic locations in the world. The study illustrated that the IIWQIndex evaluated values and water categories were rational and comprehensive at predicting the suitability of irrigation water.</jats:p>",

Also, the study involves evaluating the performance and applicability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) as a runoff model along with the trend analysis of rainfall for the above mentioned study area. The decadal land-use/land-cover (LULC) variation from 1985 to 2005 has been studied using data procured from Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES-DISC) and the groundwater table level of the study area was monitored using dug/bore well data collected from the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). Rainfall trend analysis for a period of 101 years using historic rainfall data procured from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been analyzed to foresee the future scenario. It was observed that the rainfall-runoff relationship of the area is getting affected by the LULC variation and is thereby affecting the groundwater regime. There is a significant deterioration in the forest cover and water bodies which is alarming. The study devises the importance of an immediate master plan to be implemented in the basin to avoid any future crisis. Also, the study emphasizes the advancement of remote sensing in the use of hydrologic models like SWAT more realistically.</jats:p>",

This places higher demands on performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management. The current paper studies the extent to which performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management can meet these higher demands. To gain this insight, a systematic literature review is conducted. Moreover, existing definitions of circular supply chain management are reviewed and an improved definition of circular supply chain management is developed. The current paper finds, among other things, that the literature on performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management is scarce. Moreover, most of the available performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management have not been tested in practice and are therefore still in an early phase of development. Furthermore, none of the available performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management meet the requirements for effective performance measurement systems. More specifically, including interdependencies between performance measures is a requirement that none of the performance measurement systems for circular supply chain management can meet. Including interdependencies would better support the complex decision making that arises in circular supply chain management and enable one to challenge strategic assumptions about the improvement of circularity, economic, environmental, and social performance in parallel.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Antitrust regulations are meant to promote fair competition in the market, but balancing administrative and legal costs with enforcement can be difficult when multilayered supply chains are involved. The canonical example of this challenge is the landmark Illinois Brick ruling, which limits antitrust damages to only the direct purchasers of a product; for instance, consumers can file antitrust claims against colluding retailers but not against colluding manufacturers—only retailers can file claims against manufacturers. This controversial ruling was meant to reduce legal costs, but it can clearly lead to missed enforcement opportunities. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Illinois Brick ruling interacts with contracts adopted in the supply chain, and we show that otherwise equivalent supply chain arrangements can have markedly different effects. In particular, we find that wholesale price, minimum order quantity, revenue sharing, and quantity discount contracts lead retailers to take legal action against manufacturers in the event of collusive behavior. However, the wholesale price plus fixed fee contract structure (also known as a two-part tariff or slotting fee contract) facilitates collusion among the manufacturers with retailers compensated by the fixed fee and not filing the antitrust litigation. We further demonstrate that collusion is more likely under high demand uncertainty and high competition at the retail level but is less likely under high competition at the manufacturer level. Our paper helps public enforcers identify market conditions conducive to antitrust violations. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management. </jats:p>",

Blood transfusion services are a critical part of healthcare services, and blood and blood products can neither be synthesized nor stored for a long period. So, proper management of blood supply and blood demand is mandatory to preserve adequate safe blood. A failure to manage blood inventory and the resulting blood shortage are considered national and international health security threats because maintaining an adequate supply of safe blood is lifesaving for many patients. Blood shortages lead to the failure of blood transfusion services that ends with the collapse of the health system and health insecurity if health authorities do not take immediate corrective action. An imbalance between blood supply and blood demand is not only a threat to health security, but also poses some of the greatest threats to the national and international economy and security. The perception of health issues as an international health security threat is associated with benefits through attracting political and decision-makers’ attention and support. The global health policies and international health regulations concerning the management of blood supply and blood demand should be implemented and updated regularly. The information provided by this chapter addresses the management of blood supply and blood demand as an international health security issue and provides guidance in planning for proper management of blood inventory to avoid a sudden blood shortage and its catastrophic consequences.</jats:p>"

While the situation reduced the state’s capacity to provide normal drinking water treatment for millions of people, calls for water conservation during the emergency period resulted in virtually no change in water consumption. Here, we point out that 38–40% of the potable water produced by one of the major utilities in Florida is not used for drinking water but instead is used for outdoor landscape irrigation. This suggests that emergency-level calls for reduced water use could have been made if outdoor irrigation was limited, but we present data showing that there was little change in public behavior, and the state was unable to meet necessary water use reductions during the emergency. This inability to meet short-term emergency water conservation needs foretells a long-term lack of resilience against other global change scenarios and suggests that much work is still needed to build resilience into Florida’s water future.

The teaching material of the course was represented by six lectures recorded by J. Jansen and available online (www.principlesofsupplychainfinance.nl/scf-course/). Combination of the recorded lectures and interactive online seminars for discussion of home assignments allows students to gain a deeper understanding of the topic SCF. Finally, the course was finished with an individual online oral exam. Students and teaching staff of CSU evaluated this extra-curricular course. This pilot of distance learning will be developed into a course of a master programme at the faculty of Economics of CSU. The educational theories of Biggs, Bloom, Hattie, Garrison, Vaughan, Klabbers, Sousa and Kolb were applied to provide students with the best modern experience of distance learning.</p>"

The short food supply chain (SFSC) becomes one of the crucial solutions for these issues. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of the SFSC, assess the short vegetable supply chain (SVSC) in Vietnam, identify its barriers and challenges, and explore interventions and support as key success factors of the SVSC by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This study initially proposes the SFSC framework with six pillars and 28 indicators, this model is used to assess the SVSC. The results show that the SVSC brings various social, economic, and environmental benefits: First, it can increase farmers’ income, employment, fairness, and health. Second, the SVSC can decrease environmental pollution, food waste, and energy consumption. Third, it can improve food quality and consumers’ health. Fourth, the SVSC enhances on-farm education, agricultural tourism, local livestock farming, and traditional culture and relationship. However, the SVSC encounters various barriers and challenges impeding its performances and benefits. The vegetable value chain gains several interventions and support from the government and the project to overcome these barriers. Overall, the SFSC, good agricultural practice, and sustainability are strongly associated: good agricultural practice and sustainability are inherent in the SFSC.</jats:p>"

Recently, one of the issues that have aroused widespread global concern is the problem that the international shipping prices represented by the trans Pacific route continuously rising. This is the apparent performance of the global shipping supply chain interruption and brings interruption to the global supply chain. International shipping is a barometer of the international economic. The reasons behind the sharp rise in shipping prices are complex and diverse. The labor shortage under the pandemic is the root cause of low operation efficiency. The serious shortage of export containers in Asia is the direct cause of demand exceeds supply. The imbalance of international trade is the internal reason for the increase in demand. In addition, there are additional reasons such as the congestion accident in Suez Canal. In order to deal with this situation, each governments use policies, decrees and other measures to intervene moderately on the basis of the market power to restore balance for hoping to recover as soon as possible. But some international organizations related to this issue hold the opposite attitude. Shipping operators have interests directly relevant should reasonably dispatch all available transport capacity to meet demand, rationally treat and make use of short-term high profits and actively cooperate in the face of national survey, review and supervision. The problem of global shipping supply chain interruption needs to be solved jointly by all parties and strengthen pandemic control then solve the problem from the source, to release the delayed transportation efficiency as soon as possible to restore the global shipping supply chain and promote the recovery of the world economy.</jats:p>"

The closeness of its results to the observational data compared to the finite difference solution showed the higher accuracy of this method with a root mean square error for MLPG of 0.757 m compared to the finite difference which equaled 1.197 m. Particle warm algorithm was used as the optimization model. The objective function was defined as the summation of the absolute values of difference between the groundwater level before abstraction and the groundwater level after abstraction from wells. In the Birjand aquifer, which was investigated in transient state, the value of objective function before applying the optimization model was 2.808 m, while in the optimal condition it reached 1.329 m (47% reduction in drawdown). This was investigated and observed in three piezometers. In the first piezometer, the drawdown before and after model enforcement was 0.007 m and 0.003 m, respectively. This reduction occurred in other piezometers as well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological advances such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, social media, geographic information systems represent a building block of the digital transformation that supports the resilience of the food supply chain (FSC) and increases its efficiency. This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published nearly over five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technology-enabled FSCs. To the authors&amp;rsquo; best knowledge, the current study is one of the few endeavors to explore technology-enabled FSCs using a comprehensive sample of journals articles published during the past five decades.</jats:p>"

The autonomy of the plant and marine plantations is ensured by the automation of technological processes with energy supply from renewable sources. The development is based on the task to expand the capabilities of mariculture by creating autonomous automatic installations for growing marine aquatic organisms with remote dispatch control and management. This solution provides the possibility of placement away from the coast and automatic program selection of the optimal immersion depth of cultivated aquatic organisms to intensify the growth of aquatic organisms and escape from the storm, and service by standard methods of the fishing fleet without diving operations. Solving this problem will increase the efficiency and scale of mariculture in food production and introduce into practice autonomous biotechnical systems for biological treatment of sea areas exposed to anthropogenic impact.</jats:p>",

Farm animal enclosure requirements can push traditional “short” supply chains like eggs toward vertical integration. However, vertically integrated systems (e.g., broiler chickens and hogs) may benefit from the induced farm-level concentration by increasing bargaining power among contract farmers. In all systems, the increased farm-level concentration induced by enclosure requirements may lead to greater ability to solve future collective action problems like wastewater pollution and antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>"

The potential includes reduction of vulnerable party exploitation and avoiding environmentally harmful practices. Yet, it remains unclear how these potential improvements are created and whether blockchain can truly contribute. Therefore, this field study explores and identifies the mechanisms for blockchain technology to facilitate positive social and environmental impacts in supply chains. We applied an explorative qualitative research approach and interviewed blockchain technology implementers and practitioners that allowed a detailed analysis of this problem despite the scarcity of practice data. The results include the development of a middle-range theory that shows barriers and drivers of blockchain-based technologies in supply chains, introduces the concept of blockchain-enabled system, and outlines expected outcomes and impacts. We further identify four impact pathways that describe how blockchain-enabled system create positive impact: (voluntary) market mechanisms, plausibility checks, smart contracts and tokenisation, and peer-to-peer trust. The study contributes by providing insights into “how” blockchain-based technologies in supply chains can lead to social and environmental impacts. The study also furthers the discussion on blockchain technology’s role in supply chain implementation and addresses the yet unresolved problem of measuring the impact of such blockchain-enabled systems.</jats:p>"

It is important to balance business and industry with the environment and community impacts. This study presents selected aspects of corporate social responsibility, such as society, the environment, and corporate governance in relation to the industry responsible for energy production and distribution. This group includes the energy sector (mining oil, gas, consumer fuels, and energy equipment and services), the materials sector (metallurgy and mining), as well as distribution (gas, electricity supply, independent energy producers, and renewable energy). The aim of the article was to present the level of implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility in enterprises responsible for the production and supply of energy. The article uses the analysis of the literature and the statistical analysis showing the level of use of the described concept in the analysed entities. It was based on an analysis of 1904 companies from 41 countries around the world. The article presents the level of implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility in selected sectors, divided into three areas: social, environmental, and corporate governance. In each of them, the analysis was performed with regard to the selected, most important factors. In addition, an analysis of the described industry, in relation to the others, is presented, which shows the level of use of individual CSR aspects. Thus, it shows which criteria are followed by enterprises in their activities and indicates the real areas of CSR impact on companies.</jats:p>"

This study not only demonstrates the profit function for a retailer, but also provides those for both the manufacturer and the entire channel in a supply chain problem. The proposed multi-period ordering model provides explicit insights into how the ordering decisions of the retailer are affected in a specific period by considering unsold inventory or unsatisfied demand from a previous period.

Tangki ini memiliki desain yang berbeda dengan tangki biasa karena memiliki dua lapisan yaitu lapisan pertama berisi ruang vacumm dan lapisan kedua adalah tempat menyimpan liquid. Ruang vacumm pada tangki ini digunakan untuk membatasi terjadinya perpindahan panas dari lingkungan kedalam tangki. Akibat kesalahan operator dan kurang perhatiannya pihak maintenance terhadap banyak tangki yang rusak dan tidak dapat digunakan. Kerusakan yang paling banyak ditemukan adalah tekanan vacuum yang naik akibat kesalahan-kesalahan yang terjadi dilapangan.

Managers were invited to complete a questionnaire, where the central questions queried the mentioned performance metrics, but also other conditions like the presence of ERP or Lean practices. When comparing the means between companies with and without an MES, it shows that on each performance metric, MES-companies perform better than non-MES companies do. The results of the statistical analysis support the authors’ claim that companies with an MES in place outperform their competitors without an MES on the inventory- and logistics performance, as well as on Order Lead Time.</p>",

Rainfall forecasting is difficult due to the ever-changing nature of weather conditions. In this study, we carry out a rainfall predictive model for Jimma, a region located in southwestern Oromia, Ethiopia. We propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based prediction model capable of forecasting Jimma's daily rainfall. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed models using various metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), and R2, and the results were 0.01, 0.4786, 0.81 and 0.9972, respectively. We also compared the proposed model with existing machine-learning regressions like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). The RMSE of MLP was the lowest of the four existing learning models i.e., 0.03. The proposed LSTM model outperforms the existing models, with an RMSE of 0.01. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a lower RMSE and a higher R2.</jats:p>",

The system is designed and implemented by combining the latest most innovative and disruptive technologies in the market—Self Sovereign Identity system, Blockchain, and Inter Planetary File System. The crucial aspects that it aims to hit are the storage and access of food/process certifications, and the proper eligibility verification of these certifications exploiting the concepts of the Self Sovereign Identity-based models. The proposed system, realized by using standards that are WWW Consortium-compatible and the Ethereum Blockchain, ensures eligibility, transparency, and traceability of the certifications along a food supply chain, and could be an innovation model/idea that the companies that adopt the Open Innovation paradigm might want to pursue.</jats:p>"

Since then, the virus has spread over all corners of the world and has been taking huge toll of people’s life. The nature of contamination and spread of the virus has disrupted all sorts of business and social activities let alone the supply chains. Supply chain professionals and their stakeholders are working hand in hand to tackle the challenges and exploring ways to covert the challenges into opportunities to tap on. Scholars with interest in supply chain management are not only scrutinizing the situation but also taking up research to analyse the situation and provide data driven, knowledge-based recommendations. This research takes an explorative approach to identify the major themes, approaches, findings, recommendations generated by the body of literature focusing on supply chain management issues during and after the COVID 19 pandemic. Recent research articles on the topic are identified and downloaded using key word search from Google Scholar, Taylor &amp; Francis, Harvard Business Publishing, Elsevier, Wiley, Emerald and Springer sites. 20 articles were selected for in-depth analysis based on the following criteria-written in English, relevance to the topic, publication in peer reviewed journals listed in Scopus data base, and accessibility of full paper. The systematic analysis of literature done in this study helps in identification and categorization of the key research in the field in terms of their context, focus, current and potential impacts, prescribed responses, and future outlooks. The study also detects the research gaps and offers direction to advance future research on the topic.

The Ghana cocoa industry is, however, challenged by a lack of adequate decision support systems across the supply chain. Particularly, cocoa farmers have limited access to information, which impedes planning, pricing, benchmarking, and quality management. In order to address this asymmetric access to information and ensure fair access to information that will allow the making of informed decisions, the supply chain stakeholders need to adapt their business processes. For identifying the requirements for better information flow, we identified the existing (as-is) processes through a systematic survey study in Ghana. We then identified the main problems and bottlenecks, designed new (to-be) business processes, and showed how IT systems support and enable inclusive business models in the Ghana cocoa industry. To enable inclusiveness, we incorporated IT solutions that improve information flows towards cocoa farmers. The results show that there are many opportunities (e.g., improving farmer livelihoods and a potential increase in export earnings) in the cocoa sector for Ghana and all stakeholders that can be utilized when there is chain-wide collaboration, equitable access to services, and proper use of IT systems.</jats:p>"

Many imaging techniques have been applied to rodents in preclinical studies, to evaluate the magnitude of collateral blood flow and the time course of responses during the early phase of ischemic stroke. The collateral supply follows several different routes at the base of the brain (the circle of Willis) and its surface (leptomeningeal or pial arteries), corresponding to the proximal and distal collateral pathways, respectively. In this review, we describe and illustrate the cerebral collateral systems and their modifications following pre-Willis or post-Willis occlusion in rodents. We also review the potential pharmaceutical agents for stimulating the collateral blood supply tested to date. The time taken to establish a collateral blood flow supply through the leptomeningeal anastomoses differs between young and adult animals and between different species and genetic backgrounds. Caution is required when transposing preclinical findings to humans, and clinical trials must be performed to check the added value of pharmacological agents for stimulating the collateral blood supply at appropriate time points. However, collateral recruitment appears to be a rapid, beneficial, endogenous mechanism that can be stimulated shortly after artery occlusion. It should be considered a treatment target for use in addition to recanalization strategies.</jats:p>",

The adoption of lean coordination mechanisms over the supply chain (SC) and lean approaches in omnichannel strategies can guarantee the business sustainability and resilience. Furthermore, we investigate whether business sustainability, along with digitalization through mobile apps, Artificial Intelligence systems, and Big Data and Machine Learning enable firms’ resilience. We first explore the background on the subject, identify the research gap, and develop some research hypotheses to be tested. Then, we present the data collection process and the sample, which finally consists of firms from different sectors, including retailing, electronics, pharmaceutics, and agriculture. Several logistic regression models are developed and estimated to generate findings and managerial insights. Our results show that a lean omnichannel approach is an effective practice to preserve production costs, SC visibility, inventory available over the SC, and sales. Furthermore, lean coordination with contracts can make a business sustainable by preserving quality, ROI, production costs, customer service, and inventory availability. Finally, firms can be highly sustainable through resilience when they engage in sustainable ROI, SC visibility, and sales; in contrast, the adoption of mobile apps worsens firms’ resilience, which is not influenced by Artificial Intelligence and Big Data and Machine Learning.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain. Although most companies have realized the importance of blockchain technology, they often lack understanding of how to plan, measure, cultivate, and improve their own blockchain operation capabilities. Academic research has insufficiently explored the connotations and internal structure of blockchain operation capabilities and does not provide a clear understanding of how to transform blockchain operation capabilities to produce effective performance. In this context, we proposed a concept of blockchain operation capabilities for first time. We took the perspectives of the resource-based view and sociomaterialism theory, based on IT capabilities, big data analysis capabilities, and existing blockchain supply chain research, and explored the relationship between blockchain operation capabilities and competitive performance. We then constructed a hierarchical model for blockchain operation capabilities. To test our proposed research model, we used an online survey to collect data from 1206 firm managers with blockchain technology supply chain experience. The results showed that blockchain operation capabilities has a positive impact on supply chain integration and competitive performance, while supply chain integration has a strong mediating effect on the blockchain operation capabilities and competitive performance relationship. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Buses carried about 47% of passengers crossing the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) boundary in 2013. The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private bus companies operates roughly 680 intra-provincial bus routes and 400 inter-provincial bus routes in the Western Province according to the bus route information from the National Transport Commission (NTC, 2012) . The number of buses on the seven (7) major radial corridors carries more bus passengers than other roads in the Western Province. Kandy, Galle and Malabe Road corridors are the highest followed by High Level, Negombo, Horana and Low Level Road corridors. This research paper is an attempt to analyse the bus passenger demand and supply on seven major corridors connecting Western Province boundaries. The impact of the passenger demands and volumes from the seven major corridors and the traffic speed are the main outcome of this analysis. The present bus traffic information and the impact of the traffic congestion due to the high traffic flow on major corridors are discussed in the analysis. The research will also focus on alternative solutions and the importance of integrating other public transport modes to cater the demand from the major seven corridors for the better utilisation of public transport inside the Western Province boundaries.</jats:p>"

The waste heat of the condensers of TPPs and NPPs, together with the circulating water, enters the environment, causing its thermal pollution. The use of this heat in an energy-biological complex, for example, in fisheries, increases their efficiency and solves an environmental problem. Compared to ordinary ponds, this energy complex has an almost year-round increase in biomass and accelerated maturation of producers. The article presents a developed methodology that makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of such a fishery. Calculations using this method were carried out for a fish farm raising sturgeons on the basis of the waste heat of a nuclear power plant with a VVER-1200 reactor and a K-1200-6.8/50 turbine</jats:p>",

These lead to more difficulty for enterprises in managing and building information sharing systems. Thus, it is a necessary for enterprises to limit the scope of the information sharing system by selecting essential partners. The aims of this study are to quantify the cooperation of each supply chain member, and evaluate and visualize their effects in information sharing systems in order to support policymakers in making their decisions in supply chain management. The network analytical method in network science is applied to indicate the relationship between supply chain members and present a comprehensive supply chain visually. Moreover, Motor Corporation’s topology in Japan is used as a representation of global enterprise features to analyze the relationships between supply chain members. The data for Motor Corporation is secondary data which includes the number of suppliers, manufacturers, and dealers, and the interaction among them. Data is collected and verified from reputable websites such as www.marklines.com, or www.statista.com. As a result, this study contributes by applying a new method for not only determining the impact levels of supply chain members but also giving visual descriptions of impact levels on the large-scale information sharing system.</jats:p>",

This requires aeration followed by rapid sand ﬁltration (RSF) to remove iron, manganese, arsenic and ammonium. The mechanisms responsible for their removal or the clogging of RSFs and breakthrough of colloidal iron or manganese oxides have not been fully elucidated in previous studies. In this work, factors affecting iron precipitation have been studied in aerated, continuously stirred bench scale jar experiments to simulate the supernatant layer of submerged sand filters. Time series data of filtered iron concentration and precipitate size have been collected in experiments with synthetic groundwater with and without P, Si, HCO3 and Ca at neutral pH. We observed that precipitate growth is not influenced by different HCO3 concentrations but is reduced drastically when natural organic matter (NOM) is present in water and, to lesser extent, Si as well. The addition of P appears to hamper precipitate growth to some extent, but requires more research to fully understand the implications. We also observed that addition of Ca improved the growth of Fe precipitates in the presence of Si and especially NOM. These results have great significance for improving Fe removal efficiency of groundwater treatment plants in The Netherlands and abroad.</jats:p>",

Although several conventional power supplies are available in the market to provide CC, CV, and CP, their outputs are specific and limited to one or two of these power modes. In light of this, this paper introduces a multipurpose power supply that can deliver power in all three modes (CC, CV, and CP) irrespective of load dynamics. A novel branch type resonant converter comprising three inductors and a capacitor is investigated for the design and development of the power supply. Consumers can choose their preferred mode of operation by switching the operating frequency. This multipurpose power supply subsidizes the space, technology, time, and economy required for three individual supplies and bags magnificent features such as simple control with efficiency greater than 95% in the CC mode and above 80% in CV and CP modes, subjected to loading constraints. The versatility of the power supply is validated by a hardware prototype tested at different load conditions. Regardless of the changes in load resistance, the proposed power supply remained rigid and efficient in each of the mentioned modes.</jats:p>",

In this research 20 indicators were identified in four warehouse activities based on Frazelle model.  The most important indicators in each warehouse were then determined. The study was conducted through a descriptive design using a survey of 3 medium warehouses in Nakuru.  The study employed purposive sampling to select the sample and sample elements. The sample size of 10 warehouse management officers were used in the study. Structured questionnaire was adopted as data collection instrument. The research findings indicated that most important performance indicators for receiving is productivity, for storage is space utilization, for order picking is cycle time and for shipping is productivity. Process improvement steps were proposed based on benchmarking among warehouses handling similar goods. It was noted that different types of warehouses require different indicators.

Since the occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic with regional restrictions, one of the LAT cultivation industries of the Red Claw (Cherax Quadricarinatus) type in the Sidoarjo area, East Java, has experienced problems in supplying lobster to consumers in various regions outside cities in Indonesia. The delay in the supply of lobster results in delays in the supply of raw materials for consumers, the majority of whom are restaurant or restaurant activists. The success of supply chain management is determined by the number of costs that can be minimized, short time, and quality that is maintained, as well as the level of risk minimization (supply chain risk). Based on the problems that occur, risk identification will be carried out in each process to see its effect on cost, time, and quality. Then proceed with determining the weight based on the level of resistance (severity), possible resistance (occurrence), and the cause of the detected obstacle (detection). The last step is to calculate the RPN (Risk Priority Number) value obtained from the severity results. From the results of the analysis of risk identification and calculation of RPN with the FMEA approach, the highest risk weight with an RPN value of 105 was obtained due to the risk factor for the increase in distribution costs of cultivation products due to the impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Thus, the company should consider reorganizing its business strategy to focus on areas that are close to the point of supply of freshwater crayfish. </jats:p>"

This paper provides a way to understand why supply chains fail to overcome the violation of workers’ rights by mapping the UN SDGs onto the social foundations of the doughnut model, with respect to workers’ rights in supply chains. We develop the sustainable supply chain doughnut model with regards to the SDGs, through which we investigate workers’ rights violations. Examples from both UK-based and world-wide supply chains illustrates our conceptual model. Supply chains have shortfalls in all aspects of the social foundation when it comes to workers as one of their main stakeholders. Until supply chains are successful in overcoming shortfalls across all elements of the social foundation, moving to the next layer of the doughnut framework is impossible, which is the safe and just space for all humans, including workers. This ‘safe and just space’ seems out of reach despite international efforts such as the SDGs. The resulting conceptual model can be the foundation for descriptive, instrumental, and normative research on workers’ rights in the supply chain as part of the social sustainability.</jats:p>"

SCs are prone to shortages in delivering their output goals due to several factors such as personnel undersupply, inefficient processes, policy failure, equipment malfunction, natural hazards, pandemic outbreaks, power outages, or economic crises. Recent notable supply-chain failures include the 2021 Texas power crisis, personal protection equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional or global food chain shortages. The consequences of such shortages can range from negligible to devastating. The Texas power crisis resulted in the death of 70 people and left approximately 4.5 billion homes and businesses without power for multiple days.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, we presented a methodology to quantify the failure probability of the throughput of a supply chain. We divided the methodology into two major categories of steps. In the first step, we converted the given or assumed supply chain data into fault trees and quantify them. In the second step, we iterated the quantification of the fault tree to build a supply chain shortage risk profile. We introduced the notion of success criteria for the output from a facility, based on which we included or excluded the facility for quantification.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With the inclusion of relevant field data, we believe that our methodology can enable the stakeholders in the supply-chain decision-making process to detect vulnerable facilities and risk-inform prevention and mitigation actions. Applications for this methodology can include construction, inventory stocking, assessing manufacturing quantities, policy changes, personnel allocation, and financial investment for critical industries such as nuclear, pharmaceutical, aviation, etc.</jats:p>",

Supply chains have become the major enablers of world trade and the world is connected through supply chains. Any disruptions in any part of the world has led to disruptions in supply chains and economic recessions. Crisis like Tsunamis, earthquakes, 911 terror attacks, epidemics/pandemics like COVID-19 etc. have affected the businesses worldwide. COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated economic crisis due to disruption of supply chains and suppressed demand for many products and services worldwide. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected global economic growth to be negative 4.9%. This economic crisis has resulted in substantial erosion of market capitalization across the globe. The impact of COVID-19 is very significant on both health of the people and economy worldwide. Almost all businesses and governments are trying its best to save people from health and economic crisis. This requires rebuilding of supply chains through appropriate configuration with reliable sources of supply, collaboration, manufacturing and distribution of goods and services. Sectors like essential items, pharmaceutical, e-commerce have started early recovery of economy. However, other sectors require suitable interventions from government, business organizations in their policies and practices and use of digital technologies for economic recovery.</jats:p>"

In this article, impact of two independent variable i.e., lenient policy of return of buyer and trust of buyer was analyzed against the dependent variable internet decision of purchase. A questionnaire of 21 questions was prepared. Data of 100 respondents was collected from buyers of Karachi. Reliability Analysis, ANOVA and regression analysis are performed using SPSS tool to find the results. Study concluded that lenient policy of return of buyer and trust of buyer has positive association with internet decision of purchase in Pakistan which means when buyers are provided with lenient policies for the return of goods for any reason and their trust in seller increases it will impact the decision of purchase positively. Thus, it will be beneficial in terms of chasing market competition and generating higher returns.</jats:p>"

When the fluctuation between the actual and predicted water consumption exceeds a certain threshold, water leakage occurs on that day. Through solving the model, the following conclusions are finally drawn: (1) the annual water leakage rate of the school is 10.74%, and the water leakage is 29131.418L. (2) The water leakage rate in the first quarter is the highest, and the water leakage in the second quarter is the highest.(3) The school aquaculture area is the most serious leakage phenomenon, and the maximum water leakage rate of each water meter node is more than 10%.</jats:p>",

The analysis revealed similar factors and their dimensions that are critical for effective supply chain management: environmental and public sector issues, collaboration and cooperation with partner organizations, environmentally friendly production and development systems, human-centered operation plans, and risk management. While the study results delineated several key categories, there were variations among the four firms’ sustainability reports, indicating a need for global standards for comparative analysis. This study highlights the importance of sustainability, its effective measurement, and global standards for sustainability reports.

There are conflicts among all members of the SCM. In order to maximize the total profit of the SCM, negotiation among all members is necessary. For enterprise in the supply chain, the supply chain partnership has become a significant factor affecting firm performance. In this paper, I examine the impact of cooperation between enterprise and its supply chain partners. Specifically, I collect survey data from Chinese manufacturing firms about their relations with partners and use regression analysis to test hypotheses about the associations between firm performance and supply chain partnership. My results support that superior supplier partnership has a positive impact on reducing transaction costs and improving financial and market performance. In additional test, I establish a series of models with interactive terms. The results of additional test indicate that the impact is enhanced if the competition of each sub industry of the manufacturing industry is different. Above all, I put forward the following suggestions. Enterprise managers could establish an evaluation mechanism of suppliers and retailers, which select high-quality cooperative partners and reduce low-quality transaction costs for enterprises. When participating in business operation, shareholders could comprehensively understand the business conditions of various supply partners and choose reliable supply chain partners for investment. Also, the government can guide the realization of resource sharing and information exchange among supply chain enterprises, which is beneficial to create a more competitive supply chain to promote economic development.</jats:p>"

The implementation of this policy may affect female employment. Based on this background, this work aims to the impact of UTCP on the number and employment of Chinese women workers, and find out the countermeasures for the adverse impact of the policy. Firstly, the role of the Propensity Score Matching-Differences in Differences model is introduced, and the average and dynamic effects of UTCP on women’s employment are discussed by using the Propensity Score Matching model. Secondly, the survey data on issues related to female employment after the implementation of UTCP from 2016 to 2020 is analyzed. Finally, a conclusion is drawn according to the survey data. The results demonstrate that the implementation of UTCP widens the income gap between men and women. Meanwhile, the younger the couple, the greater the income gap. Besides, the unemployment rate changes slightly after the introduction of the policy. As the growth rate of female income is significantly lower than that of men of the same age, UTCP has little impact on the employment of Chinese female workers, but has a great impact on the quality of employment. Among all the respondents, the proportion of employed men is higher than employed women, which is about 64% ~ 65%. However, it is still unknown whether age, education, family characteristics, nationality, occupations, and economic development of the province have a certain impact on female income, which is worth noting by follow-up research. On the whole, the full liberalization of the second child has little impact on the employment of female workers in China, but has a great impact on the quality of employment. The present work lays a foundation for the study of the impact of UTCT on female employment in future, and offers a certain reference for the further study of the impact of the policy on employment in the future.</jats:p>"

It is found that the translation quality of hierarchical phrases is significantly improved after using the parallel algorithm of machine translation, which is about 9% higher than before, and the problem of context free grammar is also solved. The research also found that the use of parallel algorithm can effectively reduce the network memory occupation, the original 10 character content, after using the parallel algorithm, only need to occupy 8 characters, the optimization reaches 20%.

The application of smart water sensors can effectively monitor household water consumption and feedback the recorded data to citizens promptly, thereby influencing family members' water-saving attitudes and behaviours. For the widespread use of future water sensors in households, it can demonstrate its essential role in three aspects: water use information feedback to reduce water consumption, water information measurement helps to cultivate water conservation awareness, and water use information release as an effective means of behavioural intervention. This research provides some suggestions for the promotion and use of smart sensors in the home and points out the future research directions for the impact of water sensing on household water-saving behaviour.</jats:p>",

Since the generation of renewable energy can depend on weather conditions and other parameters, the use of short- or long-term energy storage enables an increase in the covered building energy demand. Due to the large number of available technologies for renewable energy generation and storage, it is possible to combine these systems into different energy supply concepts. By optimizing and comparing the designed concepts, the most suitable one can be determined with respect to the current and future investments. A comprehensive comparison of energy supply concepts must include both economic and energy evaluation criteria. This study focuses on parametric numerical simulations to identify economically feasible and sustainable energy supply concepts for a practical case of new residential buildings. The results show that electrical storage and on-site power generation can provide the greatest benefits. In contrast, large thermal storage systems are not economically viable.</jats:p>",

In the context of the pandemic, organizations must face consequences striking the wider dimensions of sustainability. Thus, after the COVID-19 pandemic, how will the value chains collaborate for the transition from a traditional (linear) to a Circular Economy? Methods: From this question, in this paper, we analyze the international papers that connect sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with circular economy (CE). We conducted an Integrative Literature Review based on the Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2010 to 2020, using the Methodi Ordinatio protocol to classify the papers. Results: The 37 best-ranked papers were analyzed thoroughly. The results show the prominent authors, institutions, the network relationship between authors, the evolution of publications, and the leading journals. The content of these articles was categorized and discussed about the changes in the way products are manufactured, distributed, consumed, and recovered. The integration of CE principles in SSCM has been evaluated as having potential utility for industries, cities, and businesses in general. Conclusions: Finally, an agenda was identified with suggestions for further research, which can aid researchers and practitioners acting in this field. Managers can obtain insights to improve supply chain sustainability and consequently respond to the challenges imposed by the current pandemic.</jats:p>"

The main features of transportation of perishable agricultural cargoes are excreted. Based on these aspects, specific requirements which must be considered during transportation, this category of cargoes is established. All possible alternatives of options of delivery have been to unite in five groups for determination of average cargo capacity of the park. At the same time, four technological and transport schemes of delivery of perishable agricultural cargoes are represented for using a distribution center. It is outlined that the most often found scheme of a chain of deliveries of perishable cargoes in Ukraine is direct way: from the producer to the recipient's doors. The structural description in the form of conditional schemes of delivery is carried out for each supply chain. The analytical dependences of calculation of average cargo capacity of the trucks were proposed for considering the features of the transportation process for each variant. The technique of forming the combinations at the distribution of a row of trucks cargo capacity is based on the practical recommendations of carriers. These recommendations include information about type and tonnage of automobiles which must be used at each variant of a supply chain. They will define the quantitative characteristics of this parameter when it will be used in models developed further.\nKey words: technology, perishable agricultural cargo, variant of delivery, a supply chain, transportation, truck, cargo capacity.</jats:p>",

The study design is a combination of descriptive and policy research unit by applying analysis of Rice Milling Unit (RMU) Entrepreneurs, Wholesalers and Retailers, Farmers and stakeholders concerned. The sampling was carried out by non-probability sampling method. The first sampling used purposive sampling method, and then the snowballing sampling method. The data comprised two types of data, primary and secondary data. The primary data were obtained through direct observation and interviews. The secondary data were obtained through literary searches. The data processing was done by the framework of the Food Supply Chain Networking (FSCN). The results indicated that Malang Regency has successfully contributed to the increase of national unhulled rice production. Furthermore, every year Malang Regency has a surplus of rice. The rice distribution pattern consists of the rice traders, millers, wholesalers, Bulog Malang Sub Division, and retailers. The distribution pattern of rice in Malang Regency has five channels of trade distribution system. In general, the market structure of unhulled rice / rice in Malang Regency is competitive. It is characterized by a number of participants of the market not only at the village, district but Regency as well. The distribution pattern has been established and supported by adequate infrastructure. Moreover, the distribution is quite smooth without encountering any major obstacles. The results of this study provide interesting findings because the rice produced by farmers in Malang Regency is mostly sold outside Malang Regency. Most of the people of Malang Regency consume rice from other areas because the price is cheaper than the rice of Malang Regency farmers. This condition should improve the welfare of farmers because the rice produced is of premium quality and is more expensive, but market conditions make this expectation difficult to fulfill because the price is affordable at RMU. To Strengthen the supply chain management of rice, it is needed the growth and strengthening of the system either upstream or downstream of economy through institution of the village. The institution has a bridging function for both the interests and needs of the community. The government should provide sufficient funds through Bulog to buy all rice produced by farmers at a price that supports farmers in making a profit, then distribute it to the community at a price affordable to the purchasing power.</jats:p>"

For warehousing, purchase and distribution channels, and customers, it largely determines whether the structure of supply chain is stable and efficient. The rationality of structure can determine the value of supply chain. By analyzing these four levels, this paper judges whether the supply chain structure is reasonable; the judgment standard is based on the three popular machine learning models, Stochastic Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine. The three models are based on a large number of real data environments. Through data simulation and parameter optimization, four supply chain characteristics are put into the model for simulation training for many times, and the three error numbers of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of the model are analyzed to judge the reliability of the model. On this basis, through the combination of models, it is determined that the average percentage error of the combination of the three models is higher than that of the other pairwise combinations, reaching 0.937, which completes the expectation of intelligent prediction of supply chain structure.</jats:p>",

The insignificant Russian experience of using small condensation boilers in residential construction shows that it is often used to simply replace traditional equipment with condensation technology in existing (or traditionally used) heat schemes, for example, with protection of the boiler from “cold return” by recirculating heat carrier or installing a hydraulic regulator. The consequence of this is almost completely lost the effect of the use of condensing boilers. At the same time, even using the heating temperature schedule of quality regulation 80-60°C and applying water heating to the DHW target up to 45°C you can achieve the effect of the boiler operation in the condensation mode, depending on the construction area, up to 75% of the total working time per year, generating about 70% of thermal energy in the annual cycle. However, it must be borne in mind that the efficiency of the condensing boiler is determined by the part of the latent heat of water vapor in the combustion products, which can be obtained with partial condensation. If this part is small, for example, when cooling the flue gases to 50-45°C (on gas), then the efficiency gain is only 1-3%.</jats:p>",

Taking the construction material industry in Taiwan as the research object, representative enterprises with artificial intelligence applied sustainable supply chain management are studied. With the Delphi method and data envelopment analysis, the public data of annual statistics reports of the enterprises are used for selecting the performance indicators of inputs and outputs. Empirical data analysis is also performed to provide reference for the improvement. The research results are summarized as follows. 1. Substituting various input/output index values into CCR and BCC models, the overall production efficiency and pure technical efficiency of enterprises are calculated; by dividing the two, the returns to scale of enterprises are acquired. 2. Critical factors in artificial intelligence applied sustainable supply chain management could be found out through sensitivity analysis. Using the rate of sensitivity change as the evaluation baseline, sensitive factors contain financial aspect, scale aspect, financial performance, and profit before tax. Finally, discussions are proposed according to the results, expecting to help domestic businesses in the construction material industry establish steady and flexible supply chains and present diversified procurement sources to reinforce the emergency defensive ability of the construction material industry.</jats:p>"

Data is growing at a massive amount of time, and the value of data itself is increasing rapidly. In the era of big data, the demand for security continues to increase, and traditional methods are obviously unable to meet the increasing demand. As a trust-building machine, blockchain technology, especially the multi-center architecture and multi-institutional cooperation scenarios of the alliance chain, satisfies the needs of cross-domain authentication among regions, industries, and enterprises. The purpose of this article is to analyze and discuss the application of blockchain technology in the supply alliance chain under the time domain of big data. This article first introduces the core technology of blockchain through an overview of blockchain theory, and analyzes the status quo of supply alliance chains. Finally, it integrates big data and blockchain technology to explore the supply of blockchain technology in the time domain of big data. Experimental research shows that compared with the traditional supply alliance chain technology, the supply alliance chain that applies the blockchain technology in the big data time domain is more feasible.</jats:p>",

Several factors that play a significant role in design are uncertainty in data, non-linear relation of head loss &amp; discharge, combinatorial nature of the problem, and high computational requirements. In addition, many conflicting objectives are possible and required for effective WDN design, such as cost, resilience, and leakage. Most of the research work published has used multiobjective evolutionary optimization in solving such complex WDN. However, the challenge of such population-based evolutionary approaches is that they provide multiple trade-off Pareto optimal solutions to the decision-maker who will have to choose another set of techniques to arrive at a single optimal solution. The present study employs a fuzzy optimization approach that would provide a single optimal WDN design for Hanoi and Pamapur, India. Maximization of network resilience (NR) and minimization of network cost (NC) are employed in a multiobjective context. Later, minimization of network leakages (NL) is also incorporated, leading to three objective problems. Hyperbolic membership function (HMF), exponential membership function (EMF), and non-linear membership function (NMF) are employed in Self-Adaptive Cuckoo Search Algorithm-based fuzzy optimization. HMF is found suitable to determine the best possible WDN design for chosen case studies based on the highest degree of satisfaction.</jats:p>",

This study aims to (i) identify and select key enabling factors from a comprehensive literature review, and (ii) prioritize them using a multiple criteria decision-making approach, validated through industry experts’ opinions. The results showed that system integration and IoT infrastructure are the top enabling factors in increasing the overall success of IoT adoption. Furthermore, enabling factors of IoT adoption are directly connected with organizational resources/technological capabilities that support the resource-based view theory. Supply chain managers can use the findings of this study to guide and prioritize IoT adoption, and develop strategies for going forward with IoT settings, using the relative importance of enabling factors and interdependencies among them from the technological and organizational perspectives. To generalize these findings through benchmarking of enabling factors in manufacturing, a broader range of industries within the manufacturing sector should be considered in future studies.</jats:p>"

A digital twin is a virtual representation that replicates a physical object or process over a period of time. These tools directly assist in reducing the manufacturing and supply chain lead time to produce a lean, flexible, and smart production and supply chain setting. Recently, reinforced machine learning has been introduced in production and logistics systems to build prescriptive decision support platforms to create a combination of lean, smart, and agile production setup. Therefore, there is a need to cumulatively arrange and systematize the past research done in this area to get a better understanding of the current trend and future research directions from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Methods: Strict keyword selection, search strategy, and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database (2010 to 2021) to systematize the literature. Results: The findings are snowballed as a systematic review and later the final data set has been conducted to understand the intensity and relevance of research work done in different subsections related to the context of the research agenda proposed. Conclusion: A framework for data-driven digital twin generation and reinforced learning has been proposed at the end of the paper along with a research paradigm.</jats:p>"

Exploring this thesis in the marketisation of housing land supply, the article provides a forensic study of an accountancy procedure called the Housing Delivery Test that modelled an ideal housing market in the English land-use planning system. The study points to the importance of Polanyi's analysis in theorising the performativity of calculative practices in the project of marketisation, not as creating the economy they describe but in fashioning a fictional market. </jats:p>",

Computational fluid dynamics model (CFD) is validated with laboratory experimental investigations. In the discharge analysis through broad crested weirs, the upstream head over the weir crest (h) is crucial, where the result is mainly dependent upon the weir crest length (L) in the transverse direction to flow, water depth from channel bed. Currently, minimal investigations are known for CFD validations on compound broad crested weirs. The hydraulic research for measuring discharge numerically is carried out using FLOW 3D software. The model applies renormalized group (RNG) using the volume of fluid (VOF) method for improved accuracy in free surface simulations. Structured hexagonal meshes of cubic elements define discretized meshing. The comparative analysis of the numerical simulations and experimental observations confirm the performance of the CBC weir for precise measurement of a wide range of discharges. Series of CFD model studies and experimental validation have led to constant range of discharge coefficients for various heads over the weir crest. The correlation coefficient of discharge predictions is 0.999 with mean error of 0.28%.</jats:p>",

Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are crucial tools used in various simulations for potential climate change effects, including precipitation and temperature. Statistical downscaling methods comprise the improvement of relations between the large-scale climatic parameters and the local variables. This study presents the trend analysis of the observed variables compared to the statistically downscaled emission scenarios that are adopted from the Canadian Second Generation Earth Systems Model (CanESM2) in the basin of Göksu River which is located in Turkey. The key purpose of the research is to evaluate both the predicted monthly precipitation and the projections of GCMs within the three simulated scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 by Gene Expression Programming (GEP). In addition, the findings of statistical downscaling of monthly mean precipitation will be compared to the Linear Regression (LR) model. The R-value is 0.827 and 0.755 for precipitation of the GEP model for the periods of calibrating and validation. In comparison with the LR model for the validation and calibration periods (1971–2005), the results of the GEP model prove its applicability in projecting the data for monthly mean rainfall. Generally, in the simulated periods of 2021–2100, the mentioned scenarios forecast a decline in the monthly mean precipitation in the basin. Moreover, the scenario of RCP8.5 projected more suitably for the case study than expected under the scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP2.6. The mean statistically downscaled CanESM2 model was compared with the trend analysis of the areal mean precipitation over the case study area, and the trend was shown as decreasing. However, the RCP 8.5 scenario was the more quasi-asymptotic for trend.</jats:p>",

Aposelemis project is differentiated from standard water supply dam projects, through a special component of an underground tunnel that diverts uphill surface water from Lasithi Plateau into the reservoir. The study concerns the first years of project’s operation, and focuses at four affected areas, namely the Lasithi Plateau upland area, dam’s region, river estuary and water supplied cities. The investigation was based on various site visits, while a significant aspect involves local stakeholders’ observation, opinion and perception on the environmental impact of the project in everyday life, through four detailed questionnaires posed to the affected areas’ population. The recorded consequences were characterized as positive or negative and evaluated according to their size and importance, estimated for the current period and also for the future. Among the main positive effects are urban areas’ drinking water supply and improved upland plateau’s flood water drainage, while among the negative consequences appear multiple water resources’ impacts and feelings of downstream lakeside residents. The investigation indicates the initial environmental impact and sets the basis for further future research towards sustainability.</jats:p>"

This perspective broadens the gaze away from a narrow gaze on the technical and structural aspects of infrastructure to encompass the socio-political dimensions. This paper starts by outlining the history of the water supply in Delhi. We then outline five axes of exclusion which can be read as infrastructural violence and explores how aspects of water policy, legislation, and planning uphold these injustices. Our discussion centers on how economics, political ideology, and power infiltrate governing mechanisms to influence water infrastructure to entrench poverty and marginalization. Attempts to improve water security for Delhi's residents face minimal impact without addressing these embedded inequities. Therefore, our analysis offers a framework to systematically create awareness of the factors to be addressed to enable a more equitable governance of water supply.</jats:p>"

The study analyzes the abilities of HSCs provided in the literature and those that are relevant for the HSC vaccination in Mexico. In addition, the stakeholders involved in HSC for immunization were studied. A sentiment analysis of more than 900 newspaper articles was conducted to determine society’s perception of the government’s strategy for vaccine distribution. Considering these aspects and a review of the state-of-the-art in the design of supply chains, a methodology for HSC is proposed. Some of the findings are that resilience and agility, the most important abilities in HSCs in Mexico, can be achieved through government support and strong collaboration between different stakeholders, which was found to be the weakest point of the strategy. The problems observed in the vaccination strategy in Mexico were as follows: (1) a single physical space per municipality was defined for the application of the vaccine, (2) there is a shortage of vaccines, and (3) as far as we know, no methodology has been applied to carry out immunization. This approach considers the design of HSCs in terms of capabilities and stakeholders, which, to the best of our knowledge, is a novel aspect of the literature. This methodology can be used for various scenarios of HSCs in Mexico.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n\nImplementation of the Healthy China Strategy and the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system has injected new vitality into medical services. Given the insufficient supply of medical services and increasing demand for medical treatment, exploring the supply-demand pattern of medical services has become an urgent theoretical and practical problem to be solved. The equity of healthcare facilities has received widespread attention, but due to limited data, there is little research on the supply-demand pattern of medical services. This study focuses on evaluating the supply-demand matching pattern of medical services at different levels in Haikou City with big geographic data and promoting the realization of a balance between medical supply and demand.\nMethods\n\nThis study utilizes spatial data of medical institutions, didi travel data, and population density data. Firstly, use the two-step floating catchment area method and GIS spatial analysis to explore characteristics of the supply-demand patterns of medical services at different levels in Haikou. Secondly, based on didi travel data, mine residents' demand for medical treatment. Then combined with population density data, divide supply-demand matching of medical institutions into four types. Finally, propose optimization strategies for the problems.\nResults\n\nThe accessibility pattern of high-level medical institutions in Haikou presents high in the north and low in the south. The accessibility pattern of low-level medical institutions is the opposite. High-level medical institutions have a strong need for medical treatment, which is less hampered by distance. The healthcare demand of low-level medical institutions is small, and they mainly are medium- and short-distance medical travel. The types of medical services at different levels are mainly \"low supply - low demand\" and \"high supply - low demand\" types.\nConclusions\n\nMedical services at different levels in Haikou are mainly in supply-demand imbalance. Therefore, we put forward optimization strategies to promote the equity of primary medical services, such as propelling the establishment and improvement of the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, building a new model of medical and health service supply, and strengthening balanced coverage of primary medical institutions. The mining of big geographic data is beneficial to alleviate the contradiction between medical supply and demand, although the data and methods need to be improved.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the present work is to assess the impact of risk events and unstable conditions on the level of quality of supply chain services and economic indicators of the retail trade network. Using the anyLogistix software tool, a simulation model was constructed that allows assessing operational risks and their impact on key indicators of the supply chain using the bullwhip effect. Besides, a statistical model of the impact of the ripple effect in the event of failures caused by the occurrence of a man-made risk event and the shutdown of production of one of the suppliers on the financial, customer, and operational performance indicators of the supply chain of grocery retail. The results obtained show that the main factors of changes in the supply chain are operational risks associated with fluctuations in demand and order execution time by the distribution center. With a sufficiently high level of occurrence, their impact on productivity and quality of service is low because they can be eliminated in a short time. The simulation results show that the most tangible risks for the food retail supply chain are supply chain failures, whose consequences require significant coordinating efforts and longer recovery times, as well as additional investments. For example, events, such as a fire in one distribution center and the shutdown of production for 1 week of one of the suppliers of dairy products will lead to the loss of USD 181.75 million by the grocery retailer, which is 3% of the expected revenue. We believe that risk management in supply chains is becoming increasingly complex, and to make effective managerial decisions, it is necessary to constantly improve the tools that combine analytical and optimization methods, as well as simulation modeling.</jats:p>"

Design/Methodology/Approach - This work evaluates various AM-enabled supply chain configurations through Monte Carlo simulation. Historical demand simulation and intermittent demand forecasting are used in conjunction with a mixed integer linear program to determine optimal network nodal inventory policies. By varying demand characteristics and AM capacity this work assesses how to best employ AM capability within the network. Findings - This research assesses the preferred AM-enabled supply chain configuration for varying levels of intermittent demand patterns and AM production capacity. The research shows that variation in demand patterns alone directly affects the preferred network configuration. The relationship between the demand volume and relative AM production capacity affects the regions of superior network configuration performance. Research limitations/implications - This research makes several simplifying assumptions regarding AM technical capabilities. AM production time is assumed to be deterministic and does not consider build failure probability, build chamber capacity, part size, part complexity, and post-processing requirements. Originality/value - This research is the first study to link realistic spare part demand characterization to AM supply chain design using quantitative modeling.</p>"

A conductive electric road allows for relatively low complexity whilst being able to provide high levels of power. When utilising a conductive electric road, safety precautions must be considered with regard to isolation between the charging supply (the electric road) and the vehicle’s traction voltage system (TVS), since no protective Earth connection can be guaranteed. Isolation can be achieved by separating the two systems galvanically or by double isolating the entire TVS and all equipment connected to it on-board the vehicle. This study used the experimental results from a previous paper to model and evaluate three different electric powertrains/charger topologies, including a novel integrated design fulfilling the required safety features. The models were used in a full vehicle model and further investigated in a city bus scenario in terms of how charging performance, energy consumption and battery ageing are affected by the aforementioned charging topologies and electric road characteristic. We discovered that charging topology has a strong influence on energy consumption, and that electric road characteristics have a strong influence on battery ageing.</jats:p>"

However, measuring the cyclicality of markups is as important as understanding the microeconomic mechanisms underlying that cyclicality. The latter requires measurement of firm-level markups and separating supply from demand shocks. We construct a novel dataset with detailed (multi-) product-level prices for individual firms. By estimating a structural model of supply and demand, we evaluate how companies adjust prices and marginal costs as a response to shocks. We find that price markups respond positively to supply shocks and negatively to demand shocks. The mechanism explaining the observed markup behaviour is the same for both shocks: incomplete pass-through of changes along the marginal cost curve to price adjustments. These observed price and output responses are consistent with dynamic demand considerations. Finally, we use our estimated shocks to show how aggregate markup fluctuations in the sample period are mostly explained by aggregate demand shocks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We examine the effect of financial cross-ownership—a situation in which a retailer holds stocks in a competitor—on two crucial operational decisions in a supply chain with competing retailers sourcing from a single supplier: information acquisition and production output. Academic/practical relevance: Financial interconnectedness between competing retailers raises fundamental questions regarding the way information is managed in such markets and the way it affects consumer welfare. Thus, in addition to the relevance to operations management scholars, this subject is of potential interest to policy makers and regulators. Although financial cross-ownership has mainly been unchallenged by regulators, the European Commission has recently called for a deeper understanding of the competitive aspects of this investment tool. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model, in which we analyze a supply chain comprised of an incumbent retailer holding stocks in an entrant and both retailers source from a mutual supplier. The incumbent can obtain costless demand information, and the supplier decides whether to leak this information if it is available to him or her. Results: We demonstrate that holding stocks in a rival better aligns the incentives of the rival retailers and results in a lower competition level during the production stage. However, financial cross-ownership can also result in an increased incentive for information acquisition, even when the information is later leaked to the entrant. The acquisition of information benefits not only the retailers but can also make the consumers better off. Managerial implications: Our work contributes to the heated policy debate regarding the competitive effects of financial cross-ownership. In addition, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to study the way financial cross-ownership affects operational decisions. Specifically, we show that financial cross-ownership provides incentives to acquire demand information even under the threat of information leakage. </jats:p>",

The agricultural sector provides livelihood to a significant portion of Nigerian population, especially in rural areas, where poverty is more pronounced. Thus, a growing agricultural sector contributes to both overall growth and poverty alleviation. The study specifically examined the effects of agricultural input supply on agricultural growth in Nigeria from 1990 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine agricultural input supply in Nigeria and its implications on the growth of agricultural growth in Nigeria. The study used time series data covering 1986-2016 obtained from FAOSTAT, World Development Indicator and Central Bank of Nigeria data base. This study utilized Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to investigate the variables. The finding of the study shows that there is co-integration between the variables. The result of the study shows that gross capital formation and Fertilizer supply to agriculture were significant in influencing agricultural growth in Nigeria with coefficient values of (-0.002468), and (0.001506), with P-values of (0.0222) and (0.0171) respectively. Given the robust nature of the result, it is evident that agricultural input supply contributes in great measure to agricultural growth in Nigeria. The study then conclude that agricultural input is essential for the growth of agricultural sector in Nigeria and recommend that given the lean resources available to government, attention should be given to the inputs that contributes significantly to the growth of the sector.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Our research group's stated objective was to evaluate the effects of sediment gradation, flow depth, spur angle and spur length on the scouring process. Since most existing studies generally employed uniform sediment, in this study uniform and non-uniform sediment were selected. Experiments were made in a rectangular open channel in uniform flow conditions. Results showed that the effect of the spur dike length and the orientation angle on sediment scour varies with the type of sediment used. Scour volumes were 40% greater in uniform sediments than in non-uniform sediments. Measured scour depth was maximum at spurs perpendicular to the flow, whereas the scour volume was maximum at spurs directed upstream. The scour depth increased with an increase in the spur length; however, the effect of spur length on scouring varied at a contraction rate of 0.29 for uniform sediments and 0.36 for non-uniform sediments. A multiple regression analysis was also performed, and four equations were suggested to predict the scour depth and scour volume. Comparisons were made with the literature equations applicable for clear-water scouring to check the suggested equation. Because of the wide range of contraction ratios considered in this study, the equations which considered the contraction effect yielded better estimates.</jats:p>",

We formulate a hypothesis that the accuracy of the forecast of transport demand and supply can be increased if the classifying model takes into account and analyses not only the properties of a particular territory, but also the characteristic features of the systems with which it interacts. Hexagons and heat maps were chosen for the classification of territories. A feature of the proposed approach is the unification and simplification of the neural network architecture..</jats:p>",

This requires implementing product development lifecycle, production system lifecycle, and business cycle for supply chain management. In short, a considerable amount of data is generated in a given manufacturing enterprise. Likewise, progress has been made to adopt blockchain in financial industries, but the adoption is slow in non-financial sectors. The article elaborates a methodology for the realization of a traceable and intelligent supply chain. First, the methodology elaborates on the realization of traceability of enterprise entities, which are an integral part of the supply chain. In this case, each participating stakeholder of the supply chain is required internally to realize a smart manufacturing system with an extension to write critical control data to the blockchain (i.e., a subset of process data). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted in most industries. A supply chain stakeholder has access to its data and can employ AI to derive new insights. The data available with the stakeholder provides a narrow context. With blockchain, all the stakeholders have access to the data from other stakeholders. Subsequently, the insights derived by a stakeholder will be more meaningful. This will assist in realizing an intelligent supply chain.</jats:p>",

The standard applied in a model, defined as a complex solitaire or “singlet”, is the Water Efficiency Management Systems (WEMS) standard. Visualised model is built by creating clusters using a software program designated for Small World Networks. This phase is preceded by the compilation of Excel spreadsheets, where requirements are divided into common and specific ones. The resulting cluster of selected areas includes the context of organizations that provide services, considering the common and specific requirements of interesting parties, managing their leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation and improvement. It could be very useful to extend the cluster by another standard depending on the needs of the drinking water supplier and the transport piping systems at the site.

The performance of supply chain implementation for avocado at the planning level was at 45%–90%, product distribution performance was at a moderate level at 25%–80%, delivery of goods was at a good level at 70%–83%, and receiving product performance was at 0%–100%. Strategies to restrain the entry of imported fruit and penetrate the avocado fruit export market are required to improve product competitiveness, quality management, and integrated product chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Improving the production capacity of agriculture in Nigeria through agricultural input supply is an important policy goal in a country where agriculture represents an important sector in the economy. The agricultural sector provides livelihood to a significant portion of Nigerian population, especially in rural areas, where poverty is more pronounced. Thus, a growing agricultural sector contributes to both overall growth and poverty alleviation. The study specifically examined the effects of agricultural input supply on agricultural growth in Nigeria from 1990 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine agricultural input supply in Nigeria and its implications on the growth of agricultural growth in Nigeria. The study used time series data covering 1986-2016 obtained from FAOSTAT, World Development Indicator and Central Bank of Nigeria data base. This study utilized Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to investigate the variables. The finding of the study shows that there is co-integration between the variables. The result of the study shows that gross capital formation and Fertilizer supply to agriculture were significant in influencing agricultural growth in Nigeria with coefficient values of (-0.002468), and (0.001506), with P- values of (0.0222) and (0.0171) respectively. Given the robust nature of the result, it is evident that agricultural input supply contributes in great measure to agricultural growth in Nigeria. The study then conclude that agricultural input is essential for the growth of agricultural sector in Nigeria and recommend that given the lean resources available to government, attention should be given to the inputs that contributes significantly to the growth of the sector.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we examine if immigration has actually affected fertility exploiting the natural experiment occurred in Italy in 2007, when a large inflow of migrants—many of them specialized in the supply of child care—arrived unexpectedly. With a difference-in-differences method, we show that immigrant female workers have increased native births by a number that ranges roughly from 2% to 4%.

A healthy diet involves the intake of different fatty acids especially from omega-3 (n-3) series. Seafood provides a very good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), but in Bulgaria there is limited information regarding the n-3 PUFA contents in traditionally consumed seafood by the population. The aims of this study were to determine lipid content, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA), and the recommended daily intake of eleven fish species, three bivalves, rapana, and shrimp harvested in the Western part of Black Sea, Bulgaria. Total lipids were extracted according to the method of Blight and Dyer and fatty acid composition was analyzed by GC/MS. Fatty acid profile showed differences among species. PUFA were found in high content among total lipids, especially in shellfish (60.67–68.9% of total lipids) compared to fish species (19.27–34.86% of total lipids). EPA was found in higher amounts in rapana (0.16 g/100 g ww) and two of pelagic species (up to 0.29 g/100 g ww), whereas DHA prevailed in demersal and the most of pelagic fish (0.16–1.92 g/100 g ww) and bivalves (0.16–1.92 g/100 g ww). The health beneficial n3/n6 and PUFA/SFA ratios were found in all analyzed species. The lower values of the lipid nutritional quality indices (AI &lt; 1, TI &lt; 1) and higher for h/H index (0.8–1.78 for fish and 1.52 to 4.67 for bivalves and shrimp) confirm that the commonly consumed Black Sea fish and shellfish may provide health benefits for local populations.

This study attempts to objectively analyze the medical oxygen supply chain in India along the principles of value stream mapping (VSM), identify bottlenecks and recommend systemic improvements.\nMethodology:\n\nProcess mapping of the medical oxygen supply chain in India was done. Different licenses &amp; approvals, their conditions, compliances, renewals among others were factored-in. All relevant circulars, official orders, amendments and gazette notifications pertaining to medical oxygen since April 2020 were studied and corroborated with information from PESO official website.\nFindings:\n\nAll steps of medical oxygen supply chain right from oxygen manufacture to filling, storage and transport up to the end users; have regulatory bottlenecks. Consequently flow of materials is sluggish and very poor information flow has aggravated the inherent inefficiencies of the system. Government of India has been loosening regulatory norms at every stage, which is reactive rather than proactive policy making.\nDiscussion:\n\nRegulatory bottlenecks have indirectly fuelled the informal sector over the years, which is not under Government’s control. This has also caused difficulties in clamping down black-marketing and hoarding. Technology enabled, data-driven regulatory processes with minimum discretionary human interface is the way to go.</jats:p>"

The results show that when customers’ environmental awareness increases, both total environmental impact and social welfare decrease. The downstream firm’s monitoring will certainly reduce the total environmental impact. In most cases, it does not matter whether the downstream firm chooses to monitor the supplier or not, the total environmental impact and social welfare would not be affected when the government chooses subsidy. If a subsidy is present, firms and environment will be better than those without subsidy. Hence, the government is more likely to choose to provide subsidy and the downstream firm will not monitor the supplier’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction effort. In a few cases when environmental impact is too large, taxation may be the optimal choice for the government and the downstream firm will choose to monitor the supplier’s GHG emissions reduction investment.</jats:p>"

Thus, the water of Narmada was found to be alkaline in nature. Piper diagram inferred that the water was dominated by Ca-Mg-HCO3− type of hydrochemical facies. Gibb's plot clarified that rock-water interaction regulates the ion chemistry of the Narmada. Various indices like sodium percentage (Na%), sodium absorption ration (SAR), Kelly index (Ki), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH) was calculated which showed that the surface water was suitable for irrigation. Lastly, one-way ANOVA (p &amp;lt; 0.05) confirmed no significant differences in water quality except for temperature, EC and SO4−, for pre- and post-monsoon season.</jats:p>",

Because these response traits are correlated, selective effects on mean community cell size of one environmental factor should impact the ability of phytoplankton to cope with other factors. Here, we experimentally apply expectations on the functional importance of phytoplankton cell size to the community level. We used a natural marine plankton community, and first altered the community’s cell size structure by exposing it to six different grazer densities. The size-shifted communities were then treated with a saturated nutrient pulse to test how the changes in community size structure influenced the mean community growth rate in the short-term (day 1–3) and nutrient storage capacity in the postbloom phase. Copepod grazing reduced the medium-sized phytoplankton and increased the share of the smallest (&lt;10 µm3) and the largest (&gt;100,000 µm3). Communities composed of on average small cells grew faster in response to the nutrient pulse, and thus confirmed the previously suggested growth advantage of small cells for the community level. In contrast, larger phytoplankton showed better storage capabilities, reflected in a slower post-bloom decline of communities that were on average composed of larger cells. Our findings underline that the easily measurable mean cell size of a taxonomically complex phytoplankton community can be used as an indicator trait to predict phytoplankton responses to sequential environmental changes.</jats:p>"

Therefore, a solid grasp of the move from “conventional” to “sustainable” supply chains is necessary. In this paper, we focus on the supply chain management of the agri-food sector, seeking to shed light on practices which may contribute to the transition of the sector towards sustainability. In this vein, we extend the conceptual framework which was proposed by Beske and Seuring (2014) so that it accommodates the contemporary particularities of agri-food supply chains.</jats:p>",

We investigate whether slowing down product diffusion by choosing to partially satisfy demand might be profitable for the producer. Academic/practical relevance: We provide new insights into sales management in closed-loop supply chains by uncovering the role key market characteristics play in profitability of partial demand fulfillment as well as its optimal timing and magnitude. Methodology: We develop a dynamic model in which demand arrives as a slightly modified Bass diffusion process, and end-of-use products required for remanufacturing are constrained by earlier sales. Results: The optimal sales plan involves partial demand fulfillment when the product diffusion rate is high, the profit margin from remanufacturing is large, and the remanufactured item is in limited demand. Partial demand fulfillment extends to earlier stages of the life cycle as the diffusion rate grows, the demand for remanufactured items shrinks, or the number of consumers who return their end-of-use items increases. It is profitable to backlog more customers when the word-of-mouth effect dominates the diffusion process or when the demand for remanufactured items is lower. Finally, the benefit of delaying product diffusion tends to increase with diffusion rate. Managerial implications: Our findings suggest that deliberately backlogging some customers may be an effective lever (in the absence of flexibility to dynamically adjust prices) for durable-good producers in fast-clockspeed industries to improve their total profits from the jointly optimized sales of new and remanufactured items. </jats:p>",

Efficient utilization and allocation of limited water resources are one of the main means to solve the above contradictions. In this paper, the multidimensional joint distribution of natural streamflow series in reservoirs is constructed by introducing the mixed Copula function, and the probability of wet and dry encounters between natural streamflow is analyzed. Luan River is located in the northeastern part of Hebei Province, China, taking the group of Panjiakou Reservoir, Douhe Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir in the downstream of Luan River Basin as an example, the probabilities of synchronous and asynchronous abundance and depletion of inflow from the reservoirs are calculated. The results show that the probability of natural streamflow series between reservoirs is 61.14% for asynchronous wetness and dryness, which has certain mutual compensation ability. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the risk of water supply security in Tianjin, Tangshan and other cities, and strengthen the optimal joint water supply scheduling of reservoirs. The research results are reasonable and reliable, which can provide reference for water supply operation of other basins.</jats:p>",

This research aimed to investigate and identify cooling techniques, namely vacuum cooling and package icing used in supply chains, and any resulting extension of broccoli shelf-life, maintenance of physicochemical quality, and delay in microbial growth at retail stores. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica cv. Montop) sustainably grown in the highlands of northern Thailand, Chiang Mai Province, under the Royal Project Foundation was experimented on vacuum cooling and package icing were selected to precool broccoli to 4 ± 1 °C. The effects of vacuum cooling using a final pressure of 0.6 kPa for 30 min and package icing using liner Styrofoam boxes (the best ratio of broccoli to crushed ice was 1:1 w/w) on physicochemical qualities, microbial growth, and shelf-life in simulated refrigerated retail displays were examined. The results illustrated that the shelf-life and quality of broccoli could be extended using both vacuum cooling and package icing. Both precooling techniques inhibited the yellowing of florets, provided high sensory scores, delayed microbial growth, and could be able to extend the shelf-life of broccoli. However, package icing offered greater potential for maintaining quality, especially retaining bioactive compounds, and extending shelf-life, thereby increasing the produce market window from 5 to 12 days at 8 ± 1 °C with 85% RH. Therefore, package icing was recommended in the supply chain for fresh broccoli cv. Montop grown in northern Thailand.</jats:p>"

However, the difficulties of power consumption and mission planning lead to the challenge of optimal sizing of the power supply for future cellular telecommunication networks. In order to deal with this challenge, this paper presents an optimal approach for sizing the photovoltaic (PV)-battery power supply for drone-based cellular networks in remote areas. The main objective of the suggested approach is to minimize the total cost, including the capital and operational expenditures. The suggested framework is applied to an off-grid cellular telecommunication network with drone-based base stations that are powered by PV-battery systems-based recharging sites in a rural location. The PV-battery system is optimally designed for three recharging sites with three different power consumption profiles with different peak and cumulative loads. Results show that the optimal design of the PV-battery system is dependent on geographical data, solar irradiation, and ambient temperature, which affect the output power of the PV system, as well as the power consumption profile, which affects the required number of PV panels and battery capacity.</jats:p>"

The Moroccan automotive industry was one of the export sectors most affected negatively by the corona crisis; it collapsed during the three months of confinement and the pandemic has created immense uncertainties in demand and disrupted global supply chains. Indeed, to save the automotive industry, Morocco relies on its competitiveness and challenges current supply models for supply chain agility in order to better prepare for future disruptions. Achieving a competitive edge requires aligning company with suppliers and customers as well as working together to achieve agility, organizationally, strategically and individually. However, agile supply chains are the most powerful competitive vehicles of the manufacturing companies. To help automakers deal with the many challenges associated with the pandemic, let’s present this research on the key enablers that will need to be monitored as the situation evolves. Thus, our article presents an original approach which, by linking the competitive priorities, agile supply chain attributes and enablers, aims at evaluates and enhances supply chain agility of a Moroccan automotive factory. Let’s adopt fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD) approach and, in particular, the two houses of quality (HOQ) with a fuzzy scale in order to identify the most appropriate enablers to be implemented by the factory. This evaluation demonstrates that there are three enablers needing maximum attention: process compliance, logistics and distribution capabilities and supportive information technology.

We gathered a harmonised global food system material flow database for crop, livestock and aquaculture production including the availability of food system by-products. This allowed us to analyse the potential to replace the food-competing feedstuff, here cereals, whole fish, vegetable oils and pulses, that currently account for 11% of total feed used globally, with available food system by-products. While considering the nutritional requirements in animal production, we found that the replacement could free food-grade feeds for human consumption and increase the current food supply in kcal by 11-17% (6-11% if the use of crop residues is not accounted for) and in terms of protein 11-15% (9-14%). Our results thus indicate that the increased feed use of by-products has considerable potential, particularly when used in combination with other measures, in the much needed transition towards more sustainable and circular food systems.</jats:p>"

The main aims of using the MSPIM are to enhance motor reliability and reduce torque pulsation. A three-to-six phase transformer has been designed, implemented, and employed to enable the SPIM to be driven from a three-phase supply. It is preferable to use the three-to-six phase transformers integrated with three-phase inverter on using the six-phase inverter to generate lower values of harmonics and lower steady-state error of speed and reduce the starting current and because also it isolates the primary circuit from the secondary, and the cost will be lower compared to the design of a special six-phase inverter. Dynamic models of SPIM, three-to-six phase transformer, and three-phase variable speed drive are derived. Then, a scalar (V/F) closed-loop control of SPIM is employed, and the results are discussed. Fine-tuning of PID controllers is used to keep the motor speed tracking the reference value. A low pass filter is connected to reduce the ripple of voltage and current waveforms. An experimental setup has been built and implemented to check the possibility of controlling SPIM by a variable speed drive system fed from a three-to-six phase transformer. It is found that the proposed method can be effectively used to drive the SPIM from a three-phase supply.</jats:p>"

For the correct solution of this problem, it is relevant to use the direct comparison of deterministic quantities such as the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of toxic pollutants with the result of its measurements (C) and methods of approach for evaluating the results of research. Material and methods. To improve the reliability of hygienic assessment of water quality in the proposed method tolerance control, envisaging the elucidation of the implementation type inequality and estimation of the probability of this event: where is the risk of false imprisonment. The number of concurrent measurements of water quality parameters guaranteeing an acceptable level of risk of error of research results is established by the authority of sanitary-epidemiological supervision, receiving a limited level of tolerable error taking into account the possibilities of metrological assurance of conformity assessment/quality of water and its normative level. Results. It is shown that in cases when the compliance of controlled safety indicators is evaluated, the values of which are limited on both sides, as is the case when studying the physiological usefulness of water, it is necessary to establish a two-way range of values of the permissible probability of violation of the specified requirements. Conclusion. First installed: the rule “if it is impossible to argue that controlled water quality indicators do not meet hygienic requirements. Thus requirements are met” is not equivalent to the law “if the indicators meet the requirements, then they can’t be inappropriate”, which more reliably indicates compliance with these requirements.</jats:p>",

Developing scenario is an important tool for planning and decision-making process in these situations. Therefore, this study intended to develop possible scenarios for hospital supply chain resilience. Material and Methods   This research study is applied in terms of purpose and is based the scenario method and the probabilistic trends approach. The participants of the study were 14 experts from two hospitals who were selected through a purposeful sampling method. The data obtained in the first phase of the semi-structured interviews, were coded and analyzed through using MAXQDA Software. In the next phase, the cross impact analysis questionnaire was used to develop the scenario and the analysis of the data was performed through Scenario Wizard software.  Results The results of combining 35 states for 12 factors affecting hospital resilience which also included all possible future states, showed that 7 scenarios with high adaptation and 467 scenarios with poor adaptation can be considered. Strong scenarios were divided into three groups of scenarios as \"optimistic\", \"intermediate\" and \"pessimistic\" based on similarity and degree of desirability. Conclusion   The Findings revealed that the strength of the impact of unfavorable states was more than that of favorable states. Therefore, for the resilience of the hospital supply chain, it is necessary to pay more attention to unfavorable scenarios to provide the necessary preparation to face those states, and with proper planning, the desired states can be achieved. Extended Abstract  Background and Objectives The complexity and intensity of environmental fluctuations combined with unexpected accidents and dangers have increased the probability of hospital supply chain disruptions. The hospital and its supply chain must be intelligent to resist unforeseen events, so that in different situations, there is no work stoppage in their activities. Scenarios are an important tool for improving the planning and decision-making process in these situations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a scenario for hospital supply chain resilience. Material and Methods  This research is based on the scenario method, and it is applied in terms of purpose. In addition, in the category of normative scenarios and based on the probabilistic modified trends (PMT) school. The Participants were 14 experts from two hospitals who were purposefully selected. The data obtained in the first phase from interviews, were coded and analyzed through MAXQDA Software. In the second phase, based on the participants' viewpoints, the possible states of each of the identified factors in the previous stage were defined, and the cross impact questionnaire was designed. The cross impact questionnaire is in the form of a matrix in which respondents determine the effect of each state on other states. Finally, cross impact analysis method and Scenario Wizard software were used to compile the scenario and compatibility coefficients and total impact score indices were used to examine compatible scenarios. Results  Based on analysis results of the semi-structured interviews, 30 drivers of hospital supply chain resilience were identified. These factors were clustered in the form of 12 main components including: \"staff preparedness and accountability in the event of a disaster\", \"safety of infrastructure and equipment\", \"recovery of infrastructure after disaster\", \"cooperation and participation of various organizations and communication systems among them\", \"support systems and potential hospital capacity\", \"coordination and flexibility of suppliers\", \"planning and management of disaster\", \"nature of accidents\", \"government policies\", \"sanctions on drugs and equipment\", \"people's culture at the time of the accident\", and \"funding\". The output of Scenario Wizard software showed 7 strong scenarios that were divided into three groups of scenarios as \"Optimistic\", \"pessimistic\" and \"interstitial\" based on their rank and degree of desirability. The Optimistic scenarios include ideal resilient and hard resilient scenarios, the interstitial scenarios comprise high-capacity and troublesome challenging scenarios, and the pessimistic scenarios consist of vulnerable, defenseless and fragmented scenarios.  Conclusion   The results showed that the strength of the impact of undesirable situations was more than that of desirable situations. Hence, for the resilience of the hospital supply chain, it is necessary to pay more attention to undesirable scenarios in comparison to desirable ones in order to provide the necessary preparation to face those situations and to reach the desirable situations through proper planning.  Practical Implications of Research   Due to the challenges of traditional planning in the face of the future, in this study, the scenario developing approach was used as a tool to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of planning in the hospital supply chain. Managers and planners can substitute alternative futures for a single future and plan to take advantage of favorable future situations and avoid or reduce the effects of unfavorable future situations to be better prepared to face the future.

Quality assurance (QA) plays an important role in RLSCs, which needs an information-rich environment enriched with external stakeholders’ influence strategies. However, due to ineffective external stakeholders’ influence, useful information is not available, making macro-level uncertainties for QA. Given this, the current study aimed to identify the macro-level uncertainties for QA in the RLSC of DW. The study used a qualitative approach involving 21 semi-structured interviews representing five external stakeholder categories. The study found the regulatory uncertainties are the root causes that propagate through incentivizing and contractual uncertainties to influence QA in the RLSC. The external stakeholders could employ measures such as ‘reforming regulatory instruments’, ‘employing effective incentivizing schemes’ and ‘active involvement of forward supply chain actors’ to minimize uncertainties at their source. The external and internal stakeholders can use these findings as a roadmap to determine suitable measures to overcome macro-level uncertainties in the RLSC. Furthermore, the study paved an avenue to integrate stakeholder theory and organizational information processing theory (OIPT) in future research.</jats:p>"

The findings indicated that multiple factors in TOE contribute significantly to the adoption of IAT. We have validated the proposed framework by structural equation modelling utilizing AMOS 22.0. This research offers a new and vital paradigm for adopting this innovation in the FSC, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of a hotel. The proposed TOE framework has identified several factors like relative advantage, reliability, complexity, cost, innovation adoption, top management support, skilled employees, IT awareness, environmental uncertainty, competitive pressure, information intensity and supplier’s pressure, which helps in the adoption process of IAT in the FSC.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water supply of the pumping station must meet the needs of the consumer which change during the day. Therefore, its performance needs to be adjusted. Any deviation of the pump unit’s performance from the nominal value leads to additional energy costs. Under such conditions, great importance is paid to optimising the operation of electric drives of the water supply pumping station. To regulate the performance of a pumping station, it is often resorted to changing the number of operating pumping units, the engines of which are started directly from the electrical network. Medium-and high-power engines are subject to technical restrictions for a direct start, which are supplemented by the need to maintain pauses between starts. Therefore, when ensuring the desired value of pumping station performance, it is very important to consider the features of starting pump engines. Control systems are widely used in the field of electric drive and water supply. It is in these areas that the efficiency of the control system depends on the amount of electricity that will be consumed by the technological process or the reliability of its operation. It is known that pumps account for about half of all energy produced. Therefore, the issue of effective control systems is particularly relevant in the field of water supply. The purpose of this study is to increase the reliability and efficiency of the water supply system by considering the distribution properties of the pipeline network when controlling electric pump drives, which will allow coordinating the operation of the pumping station, the pipeline network, and the consumer. To achieve this purpose, the study was conducted to assess the impact of the distribution and length of the pipeline network. The system of water supply and distribution is analysed, what criteria affect the correct performance of work and what problems may arise during operation for a long period of time are investigated. Ways to optimise the operation of pumping stations to increase their energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of installations are investigated. The main reasons for the expediency of using an adjustable electric drive to control pumping units are considered</jats:p>",

A use case on a supply chain of food products is presented to illustrate how a blockchain can be used to trace the movement of goods and record the related transactions. Subsequently, building on this scenario, we use the transaction cost framework to generate propositions related to accounting and auditing that can be empirically tested in future studies as data become available.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: D83; G14; M41; M42; O33.</jats:p>",

The accumulative added value per tree gives the benefits of palmyra growing and its value addition. According to the findings, the highest profit was shared by farmer cum processors (31.33%) followed by wholesalers (21.58%) for palm sugar, and for palm, jaggery wholesalers had the maximum profit (28.86%) followed by the marketing cooperatives (28.47%). Base on the accumulated added value the payback period of the palmyra tree is the 12th year and the lifetime added value per tree can reach up to Rs. 36000 during the peak period from 41 to 60 years of its age. Growing palmyra has the feasibility of giving more income and strengthening the marketing channel by reducing the intermediaries can give additional income to the farmers in the consumer price.</jats:p>"

Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis. The result of the analysis shows that there is a weak positive relationship between annual rainfall received and the public water supply in the study area during the selected (2006-2020) years. The results obtained from the computation of correlation were used to test for the validity of the first hypothesis. It was discovered that water demand by each household is almost similar from zone to zone which shows that the people are with similar water needs with 52.92% of the population needing 401 to 600 liters of water per day while 10.48% consumes over 800 liters of water per day The result also shows that the calculated value (3.807) is greater than the tabulated value (2.167). Therefore we reject the null hypothesis which states that there is no relationship between rural water supply and rainfall variability in the study area to accept the alternative hypothesis which states that there is a relationship between rural water supply and rainfall variability in the study area confirming that water availability and water supply is vulnerable to climate change and rainfall variability. The study recommends that the people, civil society organizations, government as well as non-governmental organizations should rededicate their efforts of ameliorating the adverse effect of climatic change and rainfall variability on water supply through massive development of ground water sources and rain harvesting techniques.</jats:p>"

Methods of control of gas generators are divided into two groups depending on the mathematical models used to describe the operation of such gas generators. It is shown that when using as such a mathematical model the transfer function of the gas generator in the form of an inertial link, it is possible to implement control algorithms both by its phase-frequency characteristics and by its time constant. In the first case, the phase-frequency characteristic is measured at an a priori set frequency. In the second case, there is no such restriction. When using as a mathematical model of the gas generator the transfer function in the form of a fractional-rational function of the second order, the implementation of algorithms for its control can be carried out directly using the phase-frequency characteristics of the gas generator. With this implementation of algorithms for monitoring the technical condition of gas generators, the measurement of the values of their phase-frequency characteristics is carried out at several frequencies. This approach to the control of gas generators can increase the reliability of its results. All methods of monitoring the technical condition of gas generators of hydrogen storage and supply systems are focused on the use of tolerance criteria. The parameters of the tolerance criteria can be both the values of the time constants of gas generators of hydrogen storage and supply systems, and fixed values of the phase-frequency characteristics of such gas generators. In the latter case, control algorithms are implemented that cover the entire operating frequency range of gas generators.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: We conduct a controlled human-subjects experiment in a two-tier supply chain where a supplier’s per-unit production cost may be private information while bargaining with a buyer. Academic/practical relevance: Academically, supply chain studies often assume full-information or highly structured bargaining. We consider private information with dynamic, unstructured bargaining. In practice, a buyer may not know its supplier’s cost exactly and interact with its supplier in a back-and-forth bargaining environment. Thus, understanding how a supplier’s private cost information affects both supply chain outcomes and bargaining is new to the literature and relevant to practice. Methodology: We employ insights from mechanism design to generate restrictions on the space of agreements and solve for a specific bargaining solution under private information to generate precise predictions. These predictions are then tested through a human-subjects experiment. Results: In our experiment, theory predicts that all supplier types should earn at least 50% of total profits when their cost information is private. However, we find that high-cost suppliers earn a disproportionately low share of total profits under private information, 20.16%. We show that this is because buyers, under private information, act as if they are bargaining with the lowest-cost supplier and suppliers do not appear to blame buyers for behaving this way. Based on these findings, we conduct an additional experiment where suppliers have the ability to communicate their private costs to buyers and observe that verifiable disclosure significantly increases profits for high-cost suppliers. Managerial implications: High-cost suppliers actually suffer from having their costs as private information, which runs counter to theory. However, if high-cost suppliers can credibly disclose their costs to buyers, they can significantly increase profits. Lastly, although private information does not lead to more disagreements, negotiations do take longer, which can be costly to firms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The wine industry involves both the production (i.e., from vine to wine) and consumption of wine (i.e., dining and tourism experiences). This results in a complicated system of intertwined product and services supply chains. Recent studies in the field suggest several key perspectives for future research, such as sustainability, resilience and circular economy. However, the complex nature of the sector which comprises numerous stakeholders and flows (i.e., products—services—information), entailing knotty interactions and interdependencies, makes any research direction questionable in terms of its effectiveness. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a tool for designing targeted future research in such multiple environments. We employed an end-to-end mapping approach using data from the Greek wine supply chain, identifying essential insights for a compelling research agenda. The key output is a set of three supply chain maps revealing the structure, processes and actors from all the main angles: basic production, value chain and stakeholders. A synthesis of these maps supports an overall understanding of the sector, unmasking any interaction and hidden information holdups. The study thus aims to offer an integrated research framework that highlights the leading priorities of the Greek wine industry.</jats:p>"

To provide fresh insights into the issue of urban mental health and wellness, this paper defines the psychiatric disorder of urban citizens as ‘new urban pathology’ which primarily results from a highly competitive, stressful, and fast-paced urban life. Based on 40 interviews from citizens in two rapidly urbanizing cities in mainland China, this paper attempts to investigate how the supply of leisure facilities affects new urban pathology. There are three general findings of this research: (1) First, new urban pathology commonly exists and varies with urban communities. However, it is not significantly influenced by the pace of city life. It is found that the worse prospect the living standards, the more significant the negative impacts of the new urban pathology. (2) Sufficient urban leisure facilities do have positive impacts on relieving psychological pressure of urban dwellers. Apart from these, residents also achieve stress relief from surrounding therapeutic landscapes like aesthetic public space, well-designed architecture, etc. (3) The perceived usefulness of leisure environment serves as a key factor to mediate the stress-mitigating effect of leisure supply. When leisure facilities’ functions highly match the needs of residents, leisure environmental supply can be utilized effectively, which helps alleviate the new urban pathology. This research advances the literature of urban health studies by tentatively revealing the interaction between the supply of leisure environmental facilities and urban mental health. It suggests that urban practitioners should optimize the quality of facilities rather than simply increasing the quantity for reducing the daily stress of urban life.</jats:p>"

Academic/practical relevance: The complexity in managing healthcare supply chains offers opportunities for important and impactful research avenues in key supply chain management areas such as coordination and integration (e.g., new care models), mass customization (e.g., the rise in precision medicine), and incentives (e.g., emerging reimbursement schemes), which might, in turn, provide insights relevant to traditional supply chains. We also put forward new perspectives for practice and possible research directions for the supply chain management community. Methodology: We provide a primer on supply chain thinking in healthcare, with a focus on healthcare delivery, by following a framework that is customer focused, systems based, and strategically orientated and that simultaneously considers clinical, operational, and financial dimensions. Our goal is to offer an understanding of how concepts and strategies in supply chain management can be applied and tailored to healthcare by considering the sector’s unique challenges and opportunities. Results: After identifying key healthcare stakeholders and their interactions, we discuss the main challenges facing healthcare services from a supply chain perspective and provide examples of how various supply chain strategies are being and can be used in healthcare. Managerial implications: By using supply chain thinking, healthcare organizations can decrease costs and improve the quality of care by uncovering, quantifying, and addressing inefficiencies.</jats:p>",

So the minimum charging time is obtained, but with maximum storage power. We present battery charging control method and auto switch off on this system. The controller is based on a constant voltage (CV) charge control scheme. In order to keep the parameters constant, this research prototype uses a DC-DC controller. The experimental results show that, the new controller charging period is significantly reduced. Moreover, the proposed controller has high accuracy and minimized battery overcharging.</jats:p>",

Their simple modification into supply air wall can increase their thermal performance without great effort. This paper deals with the creation of an original supply air wall or window test bench and with the numerical and experimental study of a supply air wall (or ventilated wall) based on modified modern integrated insulation clay hollow blocks where large cavities (about 4 cm) are filled by mineral wool. In some cavities, mineral wool is removed to create a flow pattern, which aims to recover heat losses from inside and solar energy from outside. At first, a 3D CFD numerical model is presented to assess the energy performance of a 1 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> sample of ventilated wall. Then, an experimental test bench, based on a modified guarded hot box simulating solar effects and airflows between the two chambers, is carried out to assess the real performances. A comparison between these two studies allows validating the results which show a good correlation in terms of temperature difference gains between outdoor temperature and pre-heated temperature going up to a maximum of 14 K for only 1 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of wall and for a volume flow rate of 4 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h (4,5 K for 32 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h).</jats:p>",

Our results suggest that protein supply chains have become subject to tens of thousands of regulatory constraints over the past half-century. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the number of state restrictions associated with animal production, indicative of large differences in the amount of administrative law across states.

In the present work, the algicidal strain G1 was isolated from sediments of a reservoir in Xi'an, China, identified by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and its algicidal effects were investigated. The rDNA sequence of G1 (GenBank accession number MW205793) is 99.86% similar to that of Chitinimonas sp., and the strain indirectly solubilised algae. Algae removal by G1 was optimal during the decay phase (algae solubilisation rate = 65.85%). Temperature (5–120 °C) did not significantly affect algae removal, pH 5–9 was tolerated, and pH 7 achieved the highest algae lysis rate (63.56%). Ultrasonic treatment of G1 destroyed the algae-solubilising effect. An injection ratio of 15% achieved the highest algae lysis rate (67.64%) under 12 h:12 h light:dark conditions, and full darkness achieved the highest algae lysis rate (68.21%). Thus, G1 can effectively inhibit the reproduction of M. aeruginosa, making it a promising biological agent for controlling algal growth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pallets are among the most used returnable transport items (RTIs), and they are critical assets for a supply chain as they have significant environmental and economic impacts during their whole life cycle. Differently from other packaging products, pallets are specifically designed to be repeatably repaired and reinjected for use. While this environmentally is beneficial as it reduces waste, it can create complex interactions between the stakeholder-involved manufacturers, pallet providers, users and recyclers. Further, the number of different actors is usually high, and the flow of materials among them needs to be coordinated. In addition, different business models can be implemented (such as internal management versus outsourcing) as well as logistics alternatives (closed- versus open-loop). Thus, the aims of this study are first to propose a systematization of design and management decisions regarding the pallet supply chain; next, to review the state of the art models and tools adopted to support each decision process relying on an analysis of the archival literature published between 1978 and 2021 on pallet management, to summarize the main decision problems addressed by the different stakeholders involved in the pallet life cycle and the adopted methods, and, finally, to highlight potential existing research gaps. This effort helps to outline potential contributions towards more sustainable pallet supply chains and can support pallet operators and companies in evaluating solutions to increase the economic and environmental sustainability of their pallet management. Results show that the perspectives of the pallet provider and of the supply chain are the most widely addressed in the existing literature, while those of pallet manufacturers and repairers should be further analyzed.</jats:p>"

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the designed supply chain network seeks to deliver medical equipment to hospitals on time within a defined time window to prevent overcrowding and virus transmission. In order to achieve a suitable model for designing a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network, important decisions such as locating potential facilities, optimal flow allocation, and vehicle routing have been made to prevent the congestion of vehicles and transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Since the amount of demand in hospitals for medical equipment is unknown, the fuzzy programming method is used to control uncertain demand, and to achieve an efficient solution to the decision-making problem, the neutrosophic fuzzy method is used. The results show that the designed model and the selected solution method (the neutrosophic fuzzy method) have led to a reduction in vehicle traffic by meeting the uncertain demand of hospitals in different time windows. In this way, both the chain network costs have been reduced and medical equipment has been transferred to hospitals with social distancing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread global disruptions. While much is being discussed about the health and economic impacts, there has been a limited focus on the immediate food sector shocks and their related social implications in developing countries, especially when the farmer surveys cannot be conducted due to mobility restrictions in many countries. To overcome these challenges, this study uses news mining and content analysis of media articles published from February to April 2020, to assess the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain and farm distress in India. It also presents the media perception of the impact of the pandemic and resulting policy measures using sentiment analysis, in addition to the cross-tabulation of results that show differential impacts across food supply chain components among different commodity groups and regions. The results show wide-scale impacts across different components of the food supply chain ranging from crop harvesting and processing, distribution and logistics to disruptions across food markets, as represented by 22, 11 and 30% of total articles, respectively. The impacts are also differentiated by commodity groups, with animal products having more trade and demand-side issues, logistic bottlenecks in fruits and vegetables and crops showing problems in labor availability and harvesting. Sentiment analysis of news items shows a spike in the negative sentiment immediately post the national lockdown, with relatively less negativity in subsequent weeks due to large-scale policy and community action. Sentiment classification along different indicators shows the highest negative sentiment for animal products (85%) in commodity groups, western states of India (78%) among different regions, and food supply (85%) and markets (83%) among supply chain components. Further, extreme weather analysis (using excess rainfall events) shows that farmers faced compound risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events in many parts of the country. The results highlight the importance of building resilient food systems, especially when the biotic and abiotic shocks are projected to increase globally due to many drivers including biodiversity loss and climate change.</jats:p>"

This research addresses a supply-chain network design problem with four levels: suppliers, factories, warehouses, and customers. The problem considered decides on the number, locations, and capacities of factories and warehouses and the transportation between levels in the supply chain. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of two matheuristic algorithms to solve the problem. Matheuristics are algorithms that combine exact methods and heuristics, attracting interest in the literature because of their fast execution and high-quality solutions. The matheuristics proposed to select the warehouses and their capacities following heuristic rules. Once the warehouses and their capacities are fixed, the algorithms solve reduced models using commercial optimization software. Medium and large instances were generated based on a procedure described in the literature. A comparison is made between the algorithms and the results obtained, solving the model with a time limit. The algorithms proposed are successful in obtaining better results for the largest instances in shorter execution times.</jats:p>"

The present study investigated the process parameters of a relatively new process combination in which powdered calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was added prior to an ultrafiltration (UF). In order to reach the targeted pH value (≥7.8), dosing concentration, type of material and retention time were evaluated in pilot-scale experiments. The deacidification followed the same kinetics as for limestone filtration and yielded similar filtrate characteristics with dosing concentrations of 20 and 40 g/L CaCO3. No significant increase in transmembrane pressure was observed during the operation of a pilot-scale UF module at low flux (34 L m−2 h−1). Critical flux was determined in a laboratory scale to evaluate the potential impact of CaCO3 particles on the UF operation. Stepping-flux experiments revealed the presence of fouling only at high-dosing concentrations, resulting in a critical flux of 55 L m−2 h−1. At a higher flux, a CaCO3-fouling layer was formed, which decreased the membrane's permeability by 20% over 5 h. Considering that effective air-enhanced backwash and acidic chemical cleanings will be implemented in large-scale applications, the investigated process combination promises to be an appropriate treatment technology for turbid and soft acidic waters.</jats:p>",

Analysis was carried out on laws and regulations related to drinking water through content analysis. The results showed that government capacity in building and administering drinking water supply system was still lacking. In addition, the government shared the responsibilities to enterprises, both owned by the government and by private institutions. Finally, it is necessary to equip and expand laws and regulations to provide drinking water distribution.

The research literature on SSCM has increased exponentially over the last decade to meet the mounting demand for information on how to tackle often conflicting sustainability-related requirements while satisfying all internal and external stakeholders. Due to the continuously evolving and wicked nature of SSCM, a limited number of scholars have approached the issue with design thinking problem solving methodologies (DTPSMs). The results of a systematic literature review (SLR) were mirrored with the Evolved Double Diamond (EDD) design process model to formulate a design thinking overview and trace potential research gaps of selected frameworks and models regarding the sustainability transition (ST) of supply chains (SCs). The research results demonstrate that modelling the ST in SC as a wicked problem can contribute to the creation of more structured and novel SSCM models and frameworks, which take into deeper consideration the evolving nature of the issue and improve facilitation practices of stakeholder engagement.</jats:p>"

This will result in an unsatisfactory transfer of revenue value for farmers, because the bargaining position is still weak. In addition, transactions in the marketing chain of beef products and their by-products have not yet been solidly established, so the obligations and rights of some parties are not guaranteed. The objective was to analyze the role of stakeholders in each supply chain and distribution of value chains as revenue in the marketing transactions of cattle, beef, and derivative products. The study was conducted in West Timor, which has 85.0% of the cattle population in NTT. Four sample districts (Kupang, TTS, TTU and Belu) in 8 sample sub-districts or 16 sample villages were included in the study. Respondents in marketing activities consisted of farmers, village traders, sub-district/district traders, slaughter traders, inter-island traders, by-product/waste traders, as well as beef, cowhide, bone, and fat/blood processing industries. Data collection were conducted by a questionnaire-based interview. The data were analyzed descriptively-quantitatively with a supply chain analysis model.  It canbe concluded that (1) Market supply chains include cattle traders (farmers, village traders, sub-district traders, inter-island traders and slaughtering traders), as well as beef traders (fresh beef retailers, frozen beef exporting traders, and processed beef products traders); (2) The ideal model of the value chain in the form of revenue share from marketing of cattle, beef, processed beef products, by-products, and cattle waste has not been fully established in NTT; (3) The ideal model includes five marketing blocks (cattle block, beef block, processed beef block, by-product block, and waste block).</jats:p>"

The water quality parameters included are the concentration of hydrogen ions (pH), Electrical Conductivity, Turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, Calcium, Sulphate, Chloride, Magnesium, Iron, COD, DO, and BOD. The water samples collected show that the mean values of physicochemical parameters are in the range set by WHO and BIS except for hardness in summer (1,680 mg/L), monsoon (832.22 mg/L), winter (1,876.66 mg/L), spring (1,535.55 mg/L); TDS in summer (1,000.33 mg/L), monsoon (683.44 mg/L), winter (1,087.66 mg/L), spring (776.66 mg/L); and sulphate in summer (927.22 mg/L), monsoon (446.77 mg/L), winter (925.77 mg/L), spring (944.88 mg/L), which indicate bad quality of water. The WQI values were calculated for three locations in different weather conditions. WQI values in summer, winter and spring are 630.90, 279.61, 279.91, showing that the river water is not suitable for drinking purposes whereas the WQI value in monsoon is 75.89, showing that water is fit for drinking purposes due to the dilution of the river water. A moderate positive correlation was observed for turbidity with total hardness, iron, total alkalinity, and sulphate. Negative correlation was observed with pH. Moderate correlation was seen with TDS–EC (0.608), TDS–Alkalinity (0.7794), EC–Ca (0.723), and strong correlation was observed for BOD–DO (0.941) and Ca–Mg (0.999). Principal component analysis revealed that five factors were significant (eigenvalue &amp;gt; 0.5) with total variance of 39.43%–85.19% respectively. The ICP-MS study of water samples from point sources indicate the presence of Ni2+, Cr6+, Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions at higher concentrations.</jats:p>",

Samples were analyzed for 18 water quality parameters. SAR, RSC and %Na values were calculated to examine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used to assess the groundwater quality parameters. The average EC value of groundwater in the pre-irrigation period was 1.21 dS/m and 1.30 dS/m after irrigation in the study area. It was determined that there were problems in two wells pre-irrigation and one well post-irrigation in terms of RSC, while there was no problem in the wells in terms of SAR. Piper diagram and cluster analysis showed that most groundwaters had CaHCO3 type water characteristics and only 3% had NaCl- as the predominant type. Seawater intrusion was identified as the primary factor influencing groundwater quality. Multivariate statistical analyses to evaluate polluting sources revealed that groundwater quality is affected by seawater intrusion, ion exchange, mineral dissolution and anthropogenic factors. The use of multivariate statistical methods and geographic information systems to manage water resources will be beneficial for both planners and decision-makers.</jats:p>",

Methods: We conducted an empirical study that provides guidance on the performance benefits of ICT adoption specifically for the downstream supply chain of the retail industry. This study employed the feature engineering technique to prioritize the functional elements of the supply chain to maximize the benefits of ICT adoption on supply chain performance. Results: ICT adoption benefits the retail industry’s overall downstream supply chain performance in the range of 9–41%. Moreover, the study discovered the key functional elements of the supply chain for ICT adoption that significantly improve the overall supply chain performance. Conclusions: The study presents a definite view of the quantitative benefits of ICT adoption to the supply chain decision-makers of the retail industry and aids them in selecting appropriate functional elements for ICT adoption to maximize their supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Based on multi-source data and using the Maximum Entropy model and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools, this research comprehensively assesses the supply and demand of recreational services from green space in Beijing. The supply of recreational services in Beijing is influenced by natural and human factors, showing large spatial variability. The supply level of mountainous areas with good natural geographical conditions and intact ecological landscape is significantly higher than that of plain areas with reduced vegetation and overexploitation. Residents have a high demand for recreational services in green space landscape and low demand in non-green space landscape. The quantitative balance pattern of supply and demand varies greatly, and most areas show the state of undersupply. The spatial matching pattern of supply and demand varies significantly too, and the mismatch is apparent. Spatial allocation should be more carefully considered than the aggregated supply and demand. Differentiated development strategies such as ecological reshaping, ecological development, restoration, and protection should be implemented for different areas in the future of planning and management in urban green areas. This will optimize and balance the supply-demand matching pattern for recreational services and promote the effective improvement of ecosystem service functions and residents’ ecological welfare.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As global brands assume more accountability for their extended supply chains, some request that their first‐tier suppliers in turn adopt sustainable procurement practices, thereby “cascading” sustainability requirements to second‐tier suppliers. However, such cascading has not yet become institutionalized. We partnered with a leading sustainability electronics company—here called “Tronics”—to investigate which Chinese suppliers are more likely to adopt sustainable procurement and when Tronics' power—measured by its percentage of its Chinese suppliers' business—is more/less relevant. We gathered secondary (audit and company records) and primary (survey) data on Tronics' relationship with 134 Chinese suppliers, and complemented these sources with three archival datasets from CDP's Supply Chain Program, the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System of China, and the World Economic Reports. The results show that Chinese suppliers that either have an integrated management system composed of economic, environmental, and social pillars or engage with key stakeholder networks are more likely to adopt sustainable procurement practices, and that these effects are boosted when Tronics' power is low to moderate. Interestingly, Chinese suppliers with sustainability violations are not necessarily less likely to adopt sustainable procurement practices. When Tronics represents a large percentage of a supplier's business, it can persuade a noncompliant supplier to adopt sustainable procurement practices, though it has limited power over suppliers that exhibit critical violations. </jats:p>",

There has been stated one of the most important problems of energy saving: many existing consumers are located at a significant distance from centralized power supply systems. Today connecting such consumers to large power grids is economically inexpedient. These facilities are supplied from the stand-alone power plants. According to the program of energy saving and energy efficiency improvement of FGC UES, PJSC, reducing electricity consumption for auxiliary needs of transformer substations is one of the main mechanisms for the program implementation.</jats:p>",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders and efforts to limit contact with others can affect water access for those with unreliable home water supplies. We explored whether water service delivery and household water-use behaviors changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hubballi–Dharwad, India, and whether they differed if households had IWS or continuous (24×7) water supply through a longitudinal household survey in 2020–2021. We found few perceived differences in water service delivery or water access, although one-quarter of all households reported insufficient water for handwashing, suggesting an increased demand for water that was not satisfied. Many households with 24×7 supply reported water outages, necessitating the use of alternative water sources. These findings suggest that water demand at home increased and households with IWS and 24×7 both lacked access to sufficient water. Our findings indicate that water insecurity negatively affected households’ ability to adhere to protective public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of access to uninterrupted, on-premise water during public health emergencies.</jats:p>",

In spite of this approach having success stories, studies have shown that failures are also being recorded. This study investigated the sustainability of rural water supply facilities under the CBM approach in Chipinge District of Zimbabwe. The specific objectives were to assess the technical, financial and institutional factors influencing sustainability. A cross sectional study design was used. Data was collected using Focus Group Discussions, Key Informant Interviews, household questionnaires and an observation checklist. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS and Microsoft Excel while qualitative data was analysed using the thematic approach. Results showed that the technical factors which are influencing sustainability are age of the water facility, frequency of carrying out preventive maintenance and existence of external support. Regression analysis showed a positive linear correlation between age and breakdown frequency (R2 = 0.46) and the odds of obtaining a breakdown decreased as the frequency of preventive maintenance increased. User communities were contributing inadequate O&amp;M funds resulting in long downtimes. Non-functionality of WPCs negatively influenced sustainability. The study recommends training of user communities on CBM and technical skills.</jats:p>",

The estimated impacts of unreliability on residential housing prices, however, are not uniform across the distribution of prices. Specifically, we find that BWNs have a larger impact on medium- to low-priced houses (at or below the 60 percent quantile) compared with high-priced houses.

Tap water was collected in situ at sampling cabinets using an <jats:italic>in‐line</jats:italic> sampling procedure that provided a representative sample with minimal risk of external contamination and avoided the transportation of large volumes to the laboratory. Microplastics &gt; 50 μm were analysed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Microplastics were detected in 38% of samples with a mean concentration of 0.01 microplastics per litre and polymers identified were polypropylene (PP), polyester (PES) and polyamide (PA). Detection of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and silicone particles were associated to the maintenance of cabinets. This study contributes to increase the knowledge regarding the presence and behaviour of microplastics throughout a large drinking water supply network providing water to 3 000 000 inhabitants. Results indicate that the pipes and the supply network not release microplastics into the drinking water.</jats:p>",

The simulation results show that when a fault occurs, the arc current becomes smaller (almost zero) due to the increase in the impedance of the lighting circuit; this phenomenon is called the “current zero off” phenomenon of the fault arc current. The current zero off phenomenon of the fault arc current is the main fault feature in the landscape lighting circuit. In this paper, the wavelet algorithm is used to detect the fault current waveform. According to the fault characteristics, by judging whether the modulus maximum value of the wavelet coefficient has periodic characteristics with an interval of 100±15 sampling points, it is analyzed whether a series-type arc fault occurs. The built physical model verifies the feasibility and correctness of the arc detection algorithm. The research results of this paper have certain reference value for the detection and application of fault arc.</jats:p>",

Understanding how heat and drought affect plant reproduction is thus key to predicting future plant fitness under rising global temperatures. Recent work suggests reproductive tissues are highly vulnerable to water stress in perennial plants where reproductive sacrifice could preserve plant survival. However, most crop species are annuals where such a strategy would theoretically reduce fitness. We examined the reproductive strategy of tomato (<jats:italic>Solanum lycopersicum var</jats:italic>. Rheinlands Ruhm) to determine whether water supply to fruits is prioritized above vegetative tissues during drought. Using optical methods, we mapped xylem cavitation and tissue shrinkage in vegetative and reproductive organs during dehydration to determine the priority of water flow under acute water stress. Stems and peduncles of tomato showed significantly greater xylem cavitation resistance than leaves. This maintenance of intact water supply enabled tomato fruit to continue to expand during acute water stress, utilizing xylem water made available by tissue collapse and early cavitation of leaves. Here, tomato plants prioritize water supply to reproductive tissues, maintaining fruit development under drought conditions. These results emphasize the critical role of water transport in shaping life history and suggest a broad relevance of hydraulic prioritization in plant ecology.</jats:p>",

Service pressure regulation strategy is an evolved approach that encompasses all goals of pressure management. This paper has investigated this approach in a rural network with hydraulic complexities as a case study so that some parts of the network have excess pressure and other low pressure. A computer code based on the method of characteristics (MOC) has been developed for network hydraulic analysis. The generated code analyzes unsteady flow, pressure-driven demand analysis, and dynamic adjustment of pressure control valves based on the target node. Also, the experimental results of a laboratory network have been applied to validate and calibrate the numerical simulation. In addition, by measuring the flow rate and pressure of the network and the results of the minimum night flow method, three consumption patterns were used to generate pulsed nodal demands. Studies show that creating pressure-management areas by hydraulic analysis by MOC will determine the best control strategies. The mean pressure decreased 54% by applying this strategy. Furthermore, the average fluctuations of pressure reduced from 9.7 meters to 3.5 meters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The oil and gas networks are overlapped because of the inclusion of associated gas in crude oil. This necessitates the integration and planning of oil and gas supply chain together. In recent years, hydrocarbon market has experienced high fluctuation in demands and prices which leads to considerable economic disruptions. Therefore, planning of oil and gas supply chain, considering market uncertainty is a significant area of research. In this regard, this study develops a multi-objective stochastic optimization model for tactical planning of downstream segment of oil and natural gas supply chain under uncertainty of price and demand of petroleum products. The proposed model was formulated based on a two-stage stochastic programming approach with a finite number of realizations. The proposed model helps to assess various trade-offs among the selected goals and guides decision maker(s) to effectively manage oil and natural gas supply chain. The applicability and the utility of the proposed model has been demonstrated using the case of Saudi Arabia oil and gas supply chain. The model is solved using the improved augmented <jats:italic>ε</jats:italic>-constraint algorithm. The impact of uncertainty of price and demand of petroleum products on the obtained results was investigated. The Value of Stochastic Solution (VSS) for total cost, total revenue, and service level reached a maximum of 12.6%, 0.4%, and 6.2% of wait-and see solutions, respectively. Therefore, the Value of the Stochastic Solution proved the importance of using stochastic programming approach over deterministic approach. In addition, the obtained results indicate that uncertainty in demand has higher impact on the oil and gas supply chain performance than the price.</jats:p>",

Thus, this paper offers an extended approach on the emergence of an institutional logic of sustainability (ILS). Our contribution includes the macro mechanisms supporting the robust and continuous adoption of an ILS for procurement. Three distinct trajectories of an ILS emerged from the literature, and their application to sustainable PSM is illustrated using real‐world examples. The trajectories rely upon the evolution of (1) institutional entrepreneurs or (2) PSM structures but also can happen through (3) the co‐evolution of both. By offering a conceptual model and a set of research propositions for future theory and empirical testing, this paper helps scholars and practitioners to advance their knowledge on managing purchasing departments according to sustainability values and making it a competitiveness factor. Lastly, this paper adds value to both implementation and formulation of sustainable business strategies as the application of our conceptual framework can lead to better strategic alignment of PSM practices.</jats:p>",

This information system will also help the supply chain of subsidized fertilizers to be more effective and efficient. This research was conducted for one year to study the supply chain traceability process and the development of a website-based subsidized fertilizer information system. The method used in this research is to use the unified modelling language (UML) method. The UML used to design the system consists of use case diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams. The traceability system that has been designed is implemented into a website-based information system.

Thus, the study of water supply, demand and balancing are important for effective water resources management. This study aims to simulate the LULC data using the CLUE-S model, estimate water supply using the SWAT model, and calculate water demand using a water footprint basis for water balancing on the Island. In addition, tourist water demand was separately estimated under normal and new normal conditions (COVID-19 pandemic) to fit with the actual situation at national and international levels. Water balance results with the consideration of ecological water requirements suggest that a water deficit occurs every year under the dry year scenario in normal and new normal conditions. In addition, the monthly water balance indicates that a water deficit occurs in the summer season every year, both without and with the consideration of ecological water requirements. Consequently, it can be concluded that remote sensing data with advanced geospatial models can provide essential information about water supply, demand, and balance for water resources management, particularly water scarcity, in Phuket Island in the future. Additionally, this study’s conceptual framework and research workflows can assist government agencies in examining water deficits in other areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inventory creation of rechargeable batteries for vital operating equipment requires continuous monitoring of material flows and their optimization. Optimizing inventory processes and material flows in logistics chains is a complex task that depends entirely on knowledge of data on past flows and plans or predictions of future flows. Equally important are knowledge of the service life of materials and knowledge of mathematical models, including the possibilities and regularities of their application for various model situations. The input data for each specific subject reflects not only the business task, but also its concept and position in the sales or production market. It is obvious that the concept of inventory creation will be different for a manufacturing company, different for a commercial subject and different for a state-financed entity. The state-financed and managed entities have specific requirements for the creation of inventories arising from the purpose of their existence and concurrently from the restrictions given by the management systems and regulation of financial flows. It is the limitation resulting on the one hand from the methodologies and laws governing the principles of public procurement that may be in partial conflict with internal normative acts. Using the analysis of input parameters of purchases with subsequent application to a specific inventory creation model from inventory theory, the influence of standard inventory creation processes on the speed and completeness of spare parts deliveries and the resulting level of the maximum required amount of held inventory is shown on the selected entity.</jats:p>",

As an important part of grass-roots public services, tax service is also facing the transformation of service demand. However, the traditional grass roots working mechanism of tax departments has limited effect under the new situation, it is difficult to meet the increasingly refined service needs of taxpayers, and there is a gap between the fragmented working mechanism at the grass- roots level and diversified service demands.

To account for the effects of surface roughness, the classical Christensen theory of rough surface has been taken. Analytic expressions for film pressure in bearing regions have been established for radial and circumferential patterns of roughness. Numerical results for film pressure, load carrying capacity and lubricant flow rate has been plotted and analysed. Due to surface roughness and fluid inertia in overall regions, significant improvement in performance properties have been observed.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the red soil in survey area contained a relatively large amount of arsenic in the range of 36.41–153.52 mg/kg, which is higher than the National Soil Environmental Quality Standard Grade III. The arsenic pollution in the surveyed lake was relatively serious, as the amount of arsenic contained in the water of Lake Datunhai was between 0.23 and 0.663 mg/L. The amount of arsenic in the sediment was between 273 and 755 mg/kg. The results of laboratory adsorption experiments with different soils showed that when the ratio of soil and water was 3.5/1000, the amount of arsenic in the water sample taken from the lake reduced from 0.3 mg/L to 0.03 mg/L, which would satisfy the Water Quality Standard Grade III (below 0.05 mg/L). The selected red soil was relatively effective for arsenic absorption. Based on theoretical calculations, the thickness of sediment would increase by about 0.95 cm by applying fixed arsenic solid on arsenic-polluted water treatment.</jats:p>",

Eutrophication was due to climate warming and anthropogenic activities. The turbidity and chromaticity showed a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.85) of the Bi Lake in Taipei city. Both the swimming area and the bridge are popular with the general public and had the worst turbidity (35.80–44.00 NTU) and chromaticity (495.37–552.27 Pt). The CTSI had a stronger linear relationship with the phycocyanin (PC) concentration (R2 = 0.605) than with any other three CTSI factors like chlorophyll-a concentration, total phosphorus (TP) concentration, and transparency. The TP pollution had a potential to cause an increase in PC concentration found in this study (R2 = 0.86). The absorbances of the water samples represented that the environment is PC (cyanobacteria) dominant in winter. The PC concentration in Bi Lake ranged from 75.55 to 80.24 μg/L and was higher with lower water temperature. Measurement of in-situ chlorophyll fluorescence is similar to lab-scale spectrophotometer (R2&amp;gt;0.92).

Worker discrimination, health and safety for workers, consumers and local community were identified as the social aspects with relevant significance into the business or for the influence on customer’s perception of the products studied. Therefore, results can represent a reference scenario for the future assessment of innovative solutions in the Spanish meet sector.

We show how the highly unequal vaccine distribution between the Global North and the Global South is shaped by the concentration of high-added value activities of vaccine development and production in the Global North and their nationalistic economic policies. These policies are short-sighted, as they fail to take account of the health risks that low vaccination rates in the Global South entail, not only for the North, but for the whole world. Using the metaphor of pawns moving in a chess game, we advance two possible scenarios. In the first, regional suppliers from low- and middle-income Global South countries will remain unimportant actors in the global vaccine supply chain, leaving inequalities intact. In the second, these suppliers will upgrade their activities in the vaccine supply chain, supported by public policies fostering industrial infrastructure, systems reforms and technological standardisation, leading to a more polycentric supply chain configuration. The persisting concentration of the governance of Global Value Chains in the Global North, we argue, will not only exacerbate current inequalities, but also likely lead to worldwide health, economic and social vulnerabilities. </jats:p>",

It has particularly affected the countries of the Mediterranean area, with serious repercussions in terms of not only infections and deaths, but also economic losses. In particular, social distancing measures, severe restrictions, and lockdowns imposed by governments have had serious repercussions on the labor market. The impact of the pandemic on the labor market has prompted numerous researchers to examine and quantify its consequences. However, mainly macroeconomic analyses have been carried out and there is a lack of studies aimed at examining the impact on the labor market in the individual municipalities. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply and demand of labor in Spanish municipalities, and the factors that can influence these levels of employment. The results show the relevance of the characteristics of the business fabric in the supply and demand for employment during the first months of the pandemic. In addition, they show that the economic activity of the municipality and the demographic features of the population condition the labor market.</jats:p>"

To overcome the abovementioned issue, a precise model of monitoring several distributed products in supply chain management has been introduced with high sustainability error reduction. The framed model in the management process has been integrated with the boosting algorithm, a type of machine learning algorithm where training dataset has been introduced appropriately.

The collaborative manufacturing model has become a widely adopted manufacturing model for manufacturing companies. Aiming at the problem of partner selection for collaborative manufacturing of complex products in a collaborative supply chain environment, this paper proposes a multi-objective decision-making model that comprehensively considers the maximization of the matching degree of manufacturing capacity and the profits of supply chain, and gives the modeling process and application steps in detail. The method first uses fuzzy theory to evaluate the manufacturing capabilities of candidate collaborative manufacturing partners. Secondly, Vector Space Model (VSM) is used to calculate the matching degree of manufacturing capacity and manufacturing demand. Then, the paper studied the profit of the supply chain under the “non-cooperative” mechanism and the “revenue sharing” mechanism. Furthermore, the decision-making model is established. Finally, a simulation was carried out by taking complex product manufacturing of Gree enterprise as an example. The research results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a novel mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model is proposed to integrate cellular manufacturing systems into a three-stage supply chain to deal with customers’ changing demands, which has been little explored in the literature. This model determines the types of vehicles to transport raw materials and final parts, the suppliers to procure, the priorities of parts to be processed, and the cell formation to configure work centers. In addition, queueing theory is used to formulate the uncertainties in demands, processing times, and transportation times in the model more realistically. A linearization method is employed to facilitate the tractability of the model. A genetic algorithm is also developed to deal with the NP-hardness of the problem. Numerous instances are used to validate the effectiveness of the modeling and the efficiency of solution procedures. Finally, a sensitivity analysis and a real case study are discussed to provide important management insights and evaluate the applicability of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

Transportation in a supply chain is the movement of a product from origin to destination, especially the warehouse’s movement from the warehouse to the end-user. At present, the success of managing a supply chain is measured by its low cost and its environmental and social impact, which is what is called a sustainable supply chain. Because transportation is the most crucial part of supporting the supply chain to achieve a sustainable supply chain, transportation must also have a sustainability orientation. The sustainability context includes three central pillars (often referred to as the three Es): social equity, economic efficiency, and environmental responsibility. Based on this background, this paper will discuss transportation sustainability in support of a sustainable supply chain, especially in agri-food products. The study results show that implementing multi-mode concepts can improve the sustainability of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

In addition, a list of contracts with transfer payments is presented to elucidate the retailer’ collection efficiency and motivate the retailer to make the optimal investment. Besides, the impact of related factors on the recovery cost and social welfare level using numerical simulations is validated. Under government regulation, the retailer could maximize profit only by reporting the true recovery technology-type information to the government. Moreover, the retailer with high-recovery efficiency could obtain both retained profit and additional information rent. Finally, as the retailer made efforts to increase the recovery level, it increased investment cost, which affected the enthusiasm of enhancing the retailer’s recovery efficiency. Thus, the government should not blindly pursue the enhancement of recycling efficiency regardless of the cost, but should focus more on the control of recycling equipment and technology cost. Overall, this study facilitates scientific policy development and provides a reference for promoting CLSC operations.</jats:p>",

However, little work has been done on assessing the resilience response and intervention based on segments. This study investigates the impact of intervention (valve density and protection of critical segment) and response (recovery time and recovery sequence) on system resilience taking valve layout into consideration. An algorithm to identify segments based on the graph theory is proposed. Resilience is quantified using the satisfactory rate of the water supply demand. Critical segments are ranked based on resilience analysis. The resilience evaluation method is applied to a case study network. It is found that valve optimization can significantly reduce the number of valves without considerably decreasing the resilience performance. Valve density and the protection of critical segment can reduce the severity of pipe failure, while efficient recovery response can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of pipe failure simultaneously. The criticality of segments depends on the segment location and hydraulic interdependency among segments.</jats:p>",

The possible contribution of failures of water policy implementation to this state of affairs is explored. This review identifies and assesses 122 studies in Zimbabwe and in other countries that have analyzed water policies, in order to understand the factors which create gaps in policy implementation. It was found that these implementation gaps are mainly a result of capacity limitations in institutions, finances, and social and technical/human resources. There is currently very limited literature available that analyses water policy in Zimbabwe. In order to overcome the water conundrums in Zimbabwe's urban areas it is recommended that a literature review combined with an empirical study of both qualitative and quantitative gaps between the Zimbabwe National Water Policy and its implementation be undertaken. In particular, the review and study should focus on capacity limitations in institutions, finances, and social and technical/human resources in Zimbabwe.</jats:p>",

However, the problem could not be solved by simply adding more power plants for various technical reasons, such as the unsuitability of using renewable energy as baseloads due to its intermittency. Furthermore, establishing the required cooperative systems for regionally distributed power adjustment is also tricky. Based on these backgrounds, this paper constructs an operation plan that minimizes CO2 emissions by correcting the generation and load patterns of the renewable energy of solar power, utilizing power generation from waste as a substitute for baseload power, and estimating the power demand of each facility. The result shows that by adjusting the operation plans, the model can reduce CO2 emission by 20.95 and 8.30% in weeks with high and low solar power generation surpluses, respectively. Furthermore, these results show that it is possible to reduce CO2 emissions in regions that have power sources with low CO2 emission coefficients by forecasting the amount of power generation and power load in the region and appropriately planning the operation in advance.</jats:p>"

However, in a real production environment, such factors are uncertain and increase the adverse effects on product completion time. This research focuses on the role of internal factors in small- and medium-scale supply chains in developing countries, enhancing product completion time during the manufacturing process in fuzzy conditions. In the first step of this research, a list of factors was found clustered into six main groups: technology, human resources, machinery, material, facility design, and social factors. In the next step, fuzzy weights of each group factor were determined by a fuzzy inference system to reflect the uncertainty of the factors in utilizing product completion time. Then, a hybrid fuzzy–TOPSIS-based heuristic is proposed to generate and select the best production alternative. The outcomes showed that the proposed method could generate and select the alternative with a 10.13% lower product completion time. The findings also indicated that using the proposed fuzzy method will cause less minimum variance compared to the crisp mode.</jats:p>"

Considering the importance of this issue, designing a multiobjective closed-loop supply chain network has been discussed in this research. The main contribution of this research is the integration of green and agility concepts in supply chain design. In this regard, a mathematical model is presented with economic, environmental, and agility objectives. First, the mathematical model is solved using the Epsilon constraint method, and then, the multiobjective weed algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The results of comparisons between the two methods show that the multiobjective weed algorithm has performed well in terms of various metrics of NPS, SNS, and Max Spread. In terms of the solving time, the average solving time of this algorithm was about 0.1% of the solving time of the Epsilon constraint method. Moreover, all cases show the superiority of the multiobjective weed algorithm over the Epsilon constraint method in solving the proposed mathematical model.</jats:p>",

In recent decades, Tehran has also experienced much wider socio-economic inequalities, reflected in its spatial configuration. Therefore, this study explored the possible correlation between the UGS supply and accessibility in the 22 Tehran municipal districts and their socio-economic development level. For this purpose, UGS supply (per capita) and accessibility (areas within 800 m walking distance to UGS) indicators are used to assess the UGS justice in Tehran. The research data are drawn from official spatial and statistical data, analysed using ArcGIS. This quantitative data are converted into map layers to shape a basis for UGS assessment indicators in conjunction with socio-economic status. The findings show an unbalanced distribution of UGS in Tehran. However, the areas with highest socio-economic status are at an optimum level of UGS justice in relation to all 22 districts, but no direct correlation confirms the same results for areas with lower socio-economic status.\n</jats:p>",

However, in the context of efficient energy use the question arises: can using high temperature heat for supplying low temperature demand still be considered the best option? This article presents an innovative approach to covering wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) internal demand with low temperature wastewater heat recovery, making thermal energy from digester gas combustion available for feed-in to a local high temperature district heating network. The presented feasibility study was carried out in an Austrian municipality and investigates the heat balance, the economic risk, climatic benefits and the social aspects of the suggested approach. The practical implementation of the novel approach was planned in two steps. First, the WWTP should be connected to the district heating network to enable the feed-in of excess heat. Second, the WWTP internal heat supply should be modified and based on wastewater heat recovery from the effluent. Due to the promising results of the feasibility study, the first step was realized in summer 2020. The second and final step was initiated in 2021.</jats:p>"

This is followed by a discussion on the definition of food safety, the impact of the pandemic to food safety, as well as the steps to be taken to ensure food safety. Hygiene of food handlers, complete vaccination requirement, kitchen sanitation and strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be in place to ensure the safety of food products, either in food industries or small scale business. Additionally, the aspect of the food supply chain was also discussed, including the definition of the food supply chain and the impact of COVID-19 to the food supply chain. Travel restriction and lack of manpower had impacted the usual operation and production activities. Lack of customers and financial difficulties to sustain business operational costs had even resulted in business closure. As a conclusion, this article provides insight into crucial factors that need to be considered to effectively contain COVID-19 cases and highlights the precaution methods to be taken through continuous monitoring and implementation by Malaysian government.</jats:p>"

The implementation of green supply chain management is an effective sustainable development approach that combines “environmental awareness” and “economic development.” Therefore, introducing the concept of “green” effectively is the main direction for the sustainable development of agriculture in the future. The impacts of green credit policies on agricultural supply chains have rarely been discussed before. Therefore, we focus on the incentive mechanism of green credit policies in the agricultural supply chain. We use the Stackelberg Leadership Model to construct a pricing model which adds the interest subsidy and required reserve ratio (RRR) cuts, and determines the pricing rules of bank loans and production decisions of the farmer in the agricultural supply chain under the incentive policy of green credit by quantifying the optimization problems of the bank and the farmer. The result shows that optimal decisions exist for both farmer and bank in the supply chain game framework. The implementation of the green credit policies contributes to both of their profits. Additionally, the green credit policies give the bank room to reduce interest rates so that the overall utility level of the supply chain could be improved.</jats:p>"

Drawing on an exploratory sequential research design that combines a qualitative and quantitative thematic analysis of 72 BIDs’ business plans, the findings suggest that UK BIDs have described a non-hierarchical operational framework as services providers considering that: (i) elementary placemaking services, such as ‘clean, green and safe’, have regained thematic relevance due to recent environmental sustainability concerns; (ii) higher-tier lobbying and advocacy services have been an operational priority since BIDs’ inception; (iii) while consumer and place marketing/branding services have seen continual thematic reductions, digital presence and marketing services have emerged as a new category of operational activities.

A review of the judicial practice of securing land use rights on the territory of sanitary protection zones (SPZ) of sources of centralized household drinking water supply of the population, a comparative analysis of Russian and foreign approaches to the legal regulation of sanitary protection of sources of centralized household drinking water supply (starting now - SPZ). The computational methods for assessing the spread of pollutants and determining the size of the boundaries of the 2 nd zone of the WSS for water sources, analysis of the degree of protection of aquifers of drinking water supply sources, which can become an alternative to expensive measures to prohibit economic activities in the territory of the SPZ, have been updated. The data on the water pollution of the sources of the centralized drinking water supply of the population of the Russian Federation, the Moscow River, on the effect of surface runoff polluted with persistent organic substances on the sanitary state of surface waters are presented. Material and methods. Methods of the survey, comparative analysis were applied to assess the legal regulation of sanitary protection of sources of centralized drinking water supply to the population in urbanized areas, hygienic assessment of water pollution, correlation and regression analysis. Results. The data of field studies of surface water bodies and groundwater in the Russian Federation indicate the low efficiency of wastewater treatment to ensure water quality safety in the sources of centralized drinking water supply to the population. On the one hand, the low efficiency of groundwater protection and the ability to protect groundwater due to natural conditions are shown. Judicial practice confirms the need to establish the security of a water supply source from wastewater when justifying health hazards and violations of current regulations. Conclusion. The analysis of the legal regulation of the protection of sources of centralized economic water supply to the population and treatment, wastewater disposal showed that the issues of the legal status of the territory of the SPZ of water sources are not developed. The need to standardize approaches to the organization of SPZ and the methods used to ensure the protection of sources of centralized drinking water supply to the population was not evaluated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we study the green credit financing equilibrium in a green supply chain (GSC) with government subsidy and supply uncertainty. The GSC system is composed of one manufacturer, two retailers, one bank, and the government. The manufacturer is subject to both supply uncertainty and limited capital. The manufacturer invests in the R&amp;D of green products and borrows loans from the bank. The government subsidizes banks to encourage banks to provide loans to manufacturers with lower interest rates, which is termed “green credit financing”. The two retailers decide their order quantities with horizontal competition or horizontal cooperation. We first developed a Stackelberg model to investigate the green credit financing equilibriums (i.e., the interest rate of the bank, the manufacturer’s product green degree and wholesale price, and the retailers’ order quantity) under horizontal competition and horizontal cooperation, respectively. Subsequently, we analyzed how the subsidy interest rate, supply uncertainty, and supply correlation affect financing decisions regarding equilibrium green credit. We found that a high subsidy interest rate leads to a low interest rate of bank and the manufacturer can set a high level of green product and high wholesale price, while the retailers can set a high order quantity. Finally, we compared the green credit financing equilibriums under horizontal competition with those under horizontal cooperation using numerical and analytical methods. We found that, in general, the optimal decisions and profits of bank and SC members, consumer surplus, and social welfare under horizontal competition are higher than those under horizontal cooperation. The findings in this research could provide valuable insights for the management of capital-constrained GSCs with government subsidies and supply uncertainty in a competing market.</jats:p>"

The results revealed that the boundary condition for manufacturers to participate in value co-creation on a shared supply chain platform is that the net production cost of the manufacturers’ participation in the platform value co-creation must be less than that of nonparticipation. In addition, the boundary condition for the shared supply chain platform to actively participate in value co-creation is that the cost of the shared supply chain platform for active participation in value co-creation must be less than that of passive participation. Moreover, value co-creation behavior on the shared supply chain platform is a dynamic game interaction process between players with different benefit perceptions.

High charging power, low resonant current, and high pulse repetition rate were targeted in the design. In this paper, ac analysis for the calculation of impedance and resonant frequency, and frequency dependence on current gain, and the steady state analysis of the proposed scheme have been studied and presented. The performance is analyzed by simulating the circuit for two values of load capacitances. The simulation and prototype results show linear charging of the load for both values of load capacitances. The charging times of 1.47 and 0.97 ms have been achieved for load capacitances of 1.5 and 1.0 µF, respectively. The performance of the LLC topology has been compared with a conventionally used series resonant scheme. A high charging power of 18.4 kJ/s has been achieved. The topology shows a faster charging rate by ∼36% in comparison with the series LC resonant topology. The results of the analysis match with the simulation and prototype results, which confirms that the proposed scheme is suitable for rapid and reliable CCPS applications.</jats:p>",

First, an analysis is performed on the supply and demand relationship between suppliers and manufacturers in the supply chain environment and the production mode of intelligent plant based on cloud manufacturing. It is found that the efficient management of spare parts inventory can effectively reduce costs and improve service levels. On this basis, different prediction methods are proposed for different data types of spare parts demand, which are all verified. Finally, the inventory management system based on cloud-edge collaborative computing is constructed, and the genetic algorithm is selected as a comparison to validate the performance of the system reported here. The experimental results indicate that prediction method based on weighted summation of eigenvalues and fitting proposed here has the smallest error and the best fitting effect in the demand prediction of machine spare parts, and the minimum error after fitting is only 2.2%. Besides, the spare parts demand prediction method can well complete the prediction in the face of three different types of time series of spare parts demand data, and the relative error of prediction is maintained at about 10%. This prediction system can meet the basic requirements of spare parts demand prediction and achieve higher prediction accuracy than the periodic prediction method. Moreover, the inventory management system based on cloud-edge collaborative computing has shorter processing time, higher efficiency, better stability, and better overall performance than genetic algorithm. The research results provide reference and ideas for the application of edge computing in inventory management, which have certain reference significance and application value.</jats:p>"

Substructure techniques with experimental testing methods that target numerical component conductors with communication loop components as well as transfer systems to form an entire system commonly referred to as Hybrid Simulation. In this study, we aim to find solutions so that the supply chain network in the forestry sector is not cut off by using hybrid simulation method. Hybrid simulations used can take into account when the supply chain will run out and prevent excessive exploitation so as to repair damage and recycle the supply chain so that it is not disconnected until the time period is taken into account.

The various economic, environmental, and social objectives were optimized for a multi-period, multi-modal transportation network of the supply chain. The results show that among the various sustainable criteria selected in this study, product cost, environmental management system, and health and safety rights of employees are the most important for decision-makers. The results of the mathematical model highlighted the impact of multimodal transportation on overall cost, time, and environmental impact for all periods. An analysis of results revealed that transfer cost and customer clearance cost contribute significantly towards overall cost.

With a modified selling to the newsvendor Stackelberg game, we obtain the chain's equilibrium financing strategies. We find that bank financing is adopted only when the <jats:italic>inefficient</jats:italic> supplier sells to the very poor retailer. When the retailer is not very rich, the efficient supplier offers trade credit financing with trade credit rate equal to a risk‐free rate, even in the presence of supplier's monitoring cost, otherwise, the retailer uses either bank financing or self‐financing, depending on the retailer's initial capital and the bank's and the supplier's monitoring cost. There exists a chain efficiency loss region (<jats:italic>supplier's monitoring distortion</jats:italic>) that the poor retailer uses bank financing at the supplier's benefit, while the overall output can be improved through trade credit financing. The presence of the bank's monitoring cost might benefit the chain. When the factoring market is intensely competitive, we find that factoring can improve the channel efficiency and the supplier's profit.

Until now, this commodity continues to be developed because it has become the main income for the people in this area. This study pupose to map the porang supply chain as well as to analyze its value chain which includes socio-economic and contributions between the business actors involved in the porang supply chain in Klangon Village, Saradan Subdistrict, Madiun District.The research activity was carried out in Klangon Village, Saradan Subdistrict, Madiun District in March – April 2021. The method used was the Hayami method. The results showed that the current profit level of porang business for each kilogram from the largest to the smallest are farmers 80.26%, wholesalers 67.57% and collectors 22.80%. The wholesalers sell porang chips, therefore their added value is greater than the farmers and collectors. The amount of added value successively from farmers, collectors and wholesalers are IDR. 8433/kg, IDR. 3000/kg, and IDR. 62000/kg. Based on this analysis, it proves that post-harvest handling in converting fresh porang into chips can increase added value, and currently the added value is still owned by wholesalers. Efforts to increase added value and profits at the farm level can be done through increasing post-harvest handling capacity into more valuable forms such as chips and flour.</jats:p>",

The construction of China’s agricultural product logistics market is still very backward, mainly including imperfect information system and high cost of intermediate circulation links. How to optimize the supply chain of agricultural products, ensure the normal supply of agricultural products quality and quantity in the market, improve people’s living standards, and achieve the purpose of improving benefits is an important topic to be studied today. Aiming at the problems of traditional agricultural products supply chain, the application of Internet of Things technology in supply chain can be effectively solved. Therefore, this paper proposes the research on the environmental effect evaluation of rural economic supply chain based on Internet of Things technology and proposes to build a wireless sensor network for agricultural products for the collection and exchange of agricultural products information. At the same time, RFID (radio-frequency identification) electronic tags integrated with sensors are applied in other links of the supply chain. The experimental results show that the construction of the rural economic supply chain system based on Internet of Things technology can effectively optimize the rural economic supply chain, realize efficient information sharing, improve the quality of agricultural products, reduce the cost of each link of the supply chain, improve the competitiveness of rural supply chain, and promote the good development of rural agricultural products and rural economic supply chain environment.</jats:p>",

Taking into account the uncertainties and imprecisions within the framework of water demand forecasting, the uncertain time series prediction method is introduced for water demand prediction. Uncertain time series is a sequence of imprecisely observed values that are characterized by uncertain variables and the corresponding uncertain autoregressive model (UAR) is employed to describe it for predicting future values. The main contributions of this paper are shown as follows. Firstly, by defining the auto-similarity of uncertain time series, the identification algorithm of UAR model order is proposed. Secondly, a new parameter estimation method based on the uncertain programming is developed. Thirdly, the imprecisely observed values are assumed as the linear uncertain variables and a ratio-based method is presented for constructing the uncertain time series. Finally, the proposed methodologies are applied to model and forecast Beijing's water demand under different confidence levels and compared with the traditional time series, i.e. ARIMA method. The experimental results are evaluated on the basis of performance criteria, which shows that the proposed method outperforms over the ARIMA method for water demand prediction.</jats:p>",

However, the influence of injected bare NZVI deposition on the permeability of aquifer remains unclear, together with which are still the key factors of engineering cost and contamination removal. Hence, this study sought to assess a method of measuring hydraulic conductivity with a constant head device and to examine the permeability loss mechanism of NZVI injected into different saturated porous media, using column tests. The results showed that it was feasible to determine hydraulic conductivity by the constant head device. The permeability loss caused by NZVI injection increased with a decrease in the grain size of the porous media, and was determined by the amount and distribution of NZVI deposition. The NZVI distribution area had a good linear correlation with dispersivity of the porous media. Additionally, although surface clogging occurred in all porous media, the amount of NZVI deposition at the injection point was largest in fine sand, so that its permeability loss was the most; this was more likely to cause hydraulic fracturing and expand the area of the contaminant source zone. These results have implications for NZVI field injection for successful groundwater remediation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Consumer’s valuation of merchandise is an important factor affecting consumer buying behavior. When the consumer’s valuation exceeds the price of product, the consumer generally makes a decision to purchase the product; conversely, when the consumer’s estimate is lower than the price of product, the consumer will usually refuse to buy the product. From the perspective of consumer product valuation, this study assumed that the consumer’s product valuation obeys a uniform distribution, and a novel consumer demand function was proposed. On this basis, we studied enterprises’ pricing decisions in the supply chain of green agricultural products and obtained the equilibrium prices and optimal profits of the enterprises in several different scenarios, including Vertical Nash game model (VNM), firm A Stackelberg game model (FASM), firm B Stackelberg game model (FBSM), and cooperative game model (CM). In addition, the influence of parameters, such as green level, green preference payment coefficient, and green cost on the optimal profit, was discussed based on game theory and numerical simulation analysis. It was found that equilibrium prices always existed in several different scenarios, and when consumer’s green preference payment coefficient was large enough, the optimal profit of firm B was greater than the optimal profit of firm A. Furthermore, in CM, the sum of optimal profit of firm A and optimal profit of firm B is maximum for four scenarios. Finally, in the three competitive scenarios, green level, green preference payment coefficient, and green cost, have a positive or negative effect on the optimal profits of firm A or firm B. The research conclusions of this study provided theoretical support for the decision-making of enterprises and related management departments.</jats:p>",

Central Kalimantan as consumers of ginger, especially red ginger, is affected by this fluctuation price directly which is indicated by soared price of red ginger almost tripled from IDR 20,000 to more than IDR 55,000. Moreover, the ginger supply of the province seems to depend on other surrounding provinces such as South Kalimantan.

It also evaluates the efficiency and performance of ginger supply chain for improving the balancing system in the future. Data were collected from the farmers in the central of ginger area production, middle traders, traders in the central market in Palangkaraya city, and consumers households. The result shows that Central Kalimantan produce ginger in some regencies such as Pulang Pisau, Kapuas, Kota Waringin, Gunung Mas. However, it did not sufficiently meet ginger’s production but still supported by south Kalimantan province and West Kalimantan province. Therefore, this paper can give the information generally for all drivers, and it can drive appropriate policy for the government, especially for the development plan of ginger in Kalimantan.</jats:p>",

Since such network design challenges belong to the class of NP-hard problems, an algorithm based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed to design a multi-stage RL network with fixed transportation cost and variable cost for the routes. Four network characteristics of different sizes were designed, and 30 instances were randomly generated for each network characteristic to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The computational analysis of the results shows the high-quality effectiveness of the proposed ACO algorithm compared with the exact results. </jats:p>",

The main circuit of this\n  power supply is using a full bridge (H-bridge) structure, and the\n  output current through the high-precision direct current current\n  transducers (DCCT) to transfer the reference voltage to the\n  controller. Previous TPS corrector power supply had a 4.7 kHz\n  current bandwidth, and its output current ripple was\n  100 μA. Such current ripple and bandwidth do not satisfy the\n  requirements of a rapidly orbiting feedback system of air core\n  loading. Therefore, our research team designed a novel prototype\n  power supply with a high bandwidth (more than 10 kHz) and low\n  output current ripple (less than 10 μA) which was developed\n  via a novel topology circuit. The operation frequency of the main\n  power switch's n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic of this novel\n  circuit is increased to 245 kHz.

To produce a perfect finished product, the quality of a raw material is a crucial issue of a production system. This paper has examined this issue with an insightful production-inventory model of the manufacturer of a deteriorating item selling goods to multiple markets with different selling seasons. We have provided an answer strategy to track down the optimal production plan for raw materials and the ideal creation plan for completed items. Transportation cost was incorporated for transporting the raw material. Marketing of the finished product is another crucial factor for selling products and earning revenues. The main objective of the present study is to adopt a production model in inventory for inferring request capacities for multi-item, multi-outlet circumstances. As of late, much accentuation has been given to the consideration of the control and support of creation inventories of disintegrating things. The demand rate is persistent and holding cost is a direct function of time. This paper has followed an analytical approach to diminish the entire inventory cost. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of changes of different parameters of the model on the optimal policy. Moreover, in order to approve the determined models, we have clarified mathematical models and examined affectability.</jats:p>"

To accomplish this goal, a trial was conducted in the experimental field of the Agricultural Institute - Stara Zagora with Sudan grass on meadow-cinnamon soil under irrigated conditions. The following variants have been studied:  1 - without irrigation (control variant); variant 2 - optimal irrigation, 75-80% of field capacity (FC); variant 3 - irrigation as in variant 2, but with the removal of the first watering; variant 4 - irrigation as variant 2, but with the removal of the second irrigation; variant 5 - irrigation as variant 2, but with the removal of the third watering. It was found that when growing Sudan grass as a second crop with optimal irrigation and disturbed irrigation regime done by canceling successive watering, the highest yield of dry biomass is obtained with optimal irrigation including three irrigations. Its yield increased by 24.2% compared to the control treatment. Irrigation of Sudan grass with only the second and the third irrigation in a row, without the first irrigation provided, leads to the lowest yield of dry biomass - 11290 kg / ha. Among the chemical composition indicators, the most significant change is observed in the content of the crude fat, followed by that of the crude fiber and crude protein, depending on the method of growing Sudan grass (with or without irrigation).</jats:p>",

Thus, the aim of this study was the development of a real-time dynamic shelf-life criterion (DSLC) for fresh pork filets based on a multi-model approach combining predictive microbiology and sensory modeling. Therefore, 647 samples of ma-packed pork loin were investigated in isothermal and non-isothermal storage trials. For the identification of the most suitable spoilage predictors, typical meat quality parameters (pH-value, color, texture, and sensory characteristics) as well as microbial contamination (total viable count, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterobacteriaceae) were analyzed at specific investigation points. Dynamic modeling was conducted using a combination of the modified Gompertz model (microbial data) or a linear approach (sensory data) and the Arrhenius model. Based on these models, a four-point scale grading system for the DSLC was developed to predict the product status and shelf-life as a function of temperature data in the supply chain. The applicability of the DSLC was validated in a pilot study under real chain conditions and showed an accurate real-time prediction of the product status.</jats:p>"

The double cumulative curve method and the attenuation analysis method were used to analyze the impact of precipitation and human activities on runoff and sedimentary transport, and other influencing factors were qualitatively analyzed also. The results showed that: (1) In the past 60 years, Kizil Reservoir's runoff and sedimentary transport have shown an upward trend; the mutation point of the reservoirs' runoff was in 1994; the annual runoff had a periodicity of 7, 13, and 28 years; the annual sedimentary transport had a periodicity of 4, 12, and 26 years. (2) The impact of precipitation and human activities on runoff were 485.37% and −385.37%, respectively; the impact of precipitation on sedimentary transport was first high and then low, while the impact of human activities on sedimentary transport was first low and then high. Solar activities, ENSO, underlying surface changes and glacier snow melt also contributes to water-sediment changes to some extent.</jats:p>",

This research contributes to the expanding field of CSR, sustainable innovation ambidexterity (SIA), sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), and second-order social capital (SOSC). This research produced a theoretical framework based on social exchange theory, social capital theory, and Carroll’s CSP model to investigate the impact of CSR on SIA, SSCM, and SOSC. Furthermore, this study examined the mediating effects of SSCM and SOSC on the correlation between CSR and SIA. Additionally, this study presents a model to explain the impact of SSCM and SOSC on SIA. This study concentrated on top-level managers of several manufacturing businesses situated in Pakistan. A total of 42 manufacturing businesses were chosen utilizing a convenience cluster sampling method. As per the results of this research, CSR was discovered to have a positive impact on SSCM, SIA, and, SOSC. Moreover, SOSC and SSCM were found to be in a significant relationship with SIA. Finally, SOSC and SSCM fully mediated the relationship between CSR and sustainable innovation ambidexterity. This research can guide companies by effectively delivering their finances in CSR initiatives. The findings also suggest that companies should concentrate on improving their CSR initiatives because CSR has a significant effect on SIA. The SDGs provide a road map for companies that can assist them to tactically manage their CSR initiatives according to the international and national sustainable development guidelines. Hence, the CSR–SDG tie is essential for the improvement in the role of CSR in sustainable development. Moreover, to improve and measure SSCM, SOSC, and SIA, policymakers and general managers should devote efforts to CSR.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Risks arising from the effect of disruptions and unsustainable practices constantly push the supply chain to uncompetitive positions. A smart production planning and control process must successfully address both risks by reducing them, thereby strengthening supply chain (SC) resilience and its ability to survive in the long term. On the one hand, the antidisruptive potential and the inherent sustainability implications of the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model should be highlighted. On the other hand, the digitization and virtualization of processes by Industry 4.0 (I4.0) digital technologies, namely digital twin (DT) technology, enable new simulation and optimization methods, especially in combination with machine learning (ML) procedures. This paper reviews the state of the art and proposes a ZDM strategy-based conceptual framework that models, optimizes and simulates the master production schedule (MPS) problem to maximize service levels in SCs. This conceptual framework will serve as a starting point for developing new MPS optimization models and algorithms in supply chain 4.0 (SC4.0) environments.</jats:p>"

It is assumed that underground water can be explored, but at a minimum level to avoid aquifers depletion or any eventual saline intrusion, and that surface water can be mobilised with the construction of a dam. Other important sources of water that were identified, assessed, and compared include treated wastewater produced in the complex, which can be reused for irrigation after undergoing tertiary treatment, and desalinated sea water, which requires the construction of a desalination plant. The devised procedure includes the definition of all feasible alternatives by a deterministic complete enumeration, and the selection of the optimised solution that may be determined by a single objective cost function to be minimised, as well as by a multi-criteria decision-making process that considers a conventional 1–5 score to be maximised. Beyond the cost, four additional criteria are considered and scored for each solution, namely, Environmental Sustainability, Water Quality, Resilience, and Local Integration, and for the relative weighting between criteria a weighted sum model is assumed. For the parameters and cost models used, the best solution that was found considers that the landscape irrigation is performed with surface water and reused wastewater, and that the water distribution network is supplied with underground and desalinated water. Other solutions more or less close can be selected based on different scores or different decision maker weighting preferences.</jats:p>"

The need for the functioning of the consumers remains in the long term. The study of the wind energy potential in the western sector of the Russian Arctic showed emerging prerequisites to be favourable for the efficient use of this renewable energy source in the coastal areas of the Barents and White Seas. Average annual wind speed at a height of 10 m in the areas mentioned are 6-8 m/s. There is a pronounced seasonal wind intensity maximum, which coincides with the seasonal maximum of the consumer’s demand for power and heat. Exemplified by facilities located in the coastal Kola Peninsula, it is shown that it is possible to save a significant amount of expensive imported fuel combusted at diesel power plants and boiler rooms, and thereby to reduce the generated electricity and heat costs by 25-40%, when implementing wind turbines.</jats:p>",

Regarding the population issues and the government’s planning for the new capital city of Indonesia, Balikpapan will be a buffer city facing serious risk in water supply issues in the future. Therefore, this study seeks to analyze an alternative of water supply. Following the concepts in Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), The rainwater harvesting (RWH) method was chosen for preventive analysis, and Institut Teknologi Kalimantan (ITK) as one of the reputable’s universities in Balikpapan will be taken as a study location. The results obtained that the monthly water demand in ITK was ranged from 3228.34 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>to 16632.97 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Using RWH, water supply analysis was obtained from 3790.62 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>to 10697.31 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>in various rainfall durations (0.5 to 2 hours) and 20 years projections (2022 to 2042).

Most of the real‐life supply chain pricing problems consider competition as a crucial factor in order to expand the market share and tackle emerging competitors. Accordingly, competitive pricing in SCM has attracted great attention by practitioners and academicians in the last four decades. Now after 40 years, it seems necessary to systematically review and classify the previous studies and present the most appealing future research directions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state‐of‐the‐art published papers in scientific journals. Here, 166 papers published from 1983 to 2021 are reviewed and classified to introduce the major models and specific considerations in this field. After reviewing the selected competitive pricing models, some research insights and potential subjects for extending the literature are presented to illustrate the most appropriate and challenging future research directions.</jats:p>",

Improved water resource management in this region would enhance water availability for its population, but this requires reliable quantitative data to guide relevant policy decisions. The Water Poverty Index (WPI) and its components can be valuable sources of such data but there has not been any recent calculation of this index for countries or communities in the Caribbean. In this study, the WPI was determined for three rural communities in the southern Caribbean: Carriacou, Grenada; Nariva, Trinidad and Tobago; and Speightstown, Barbados. Using data collected from 606 surveys of households as well as published statistics, the overall WPI scores were calculated to be 65/100 for Carriacou, 65/100 for Nariva and 70/100 for Speightstown, which all fell in the ‘medium-low’ and ‘low’ water poverty scale respectively. Resource and Use components had the lowest scores and thus require urgent attention. There were no statistically significant differences across the major components, which demonstrates the common water-related challenges in these Small Island Developing States, despite geographical diversity. This research will aid in defining national water resource management policies in rural communities of the Caribbean.</jats:p>",

Ag NPs ink was inkjet-printed onto Eagle-XG glass substrates. Constant final-step currents of 0.4 and 0.5 A with various time intervals were applied to the printed samples. The final-step current of 0.5 A damaged the line at a comparatively shorter time duration. On the other hand, the lower final-step current of 0.4 A prevented the line damage at longer time durations while producing comparatively lower Ag NPs specific resistance. The minimum specific resistances of the printed samples sintered at 0.4 and 0.5 A were 3.59 μΩ∙cm and 3.79 μΩ∙cm, respectively. Furthermore, numerical temperature estimation and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis were conducted to elaborate on the results. The numerical temperature estimation results implied that the lower estimated peak temperature at the final-step current of 0.4 A helped prevent Ag NP line damage. The SEM micrographs suggested that a high surface porosity—caused by higher sintering peak temperatures—in the case of the 0.5 A final-step current resulted in a comparatively higher Ag NP line-specific resistance. This contribution is a step forward in the development of Ag NP sintering for printed electronics applications.</jats:p>"

This paper uses a case study approach to illustrate the challenges of SCs reliability for mining projects in the northern Baffin Bay and on Greenland, discussing the technological and organisational developments that can mitigate them. A bow-tie approach shows the challenges faced by the industry and the effect of mitigating initiatives. We conclude that increased traffic will require technological, organisational and infrastructure developments to manage SC hazards and increase SC reliability. The available protective and preventive barriers have focused on avoiding periods where hazards could impact SC reliability. However, this strategy is unsustainable in the long term as a viable strategy for mining operations. It exposes the operations to Arctic hazards that are difficult to mitigate when time is limited. The consequence is that SCs often lack access to effective Arctic hazard barriers, ensuring increased SC reliability.</jats:p>",

Facility locations and activation BCT for VSCND is the first stage of decisions; finally, we determine flow transshipment between components in the next stage. The GAMS-CPLEX is used for solving the model. The results show that running BCT will decrease 0.99% in costs. There is an economic justification for using BCT when demand is high. A fix-and-optimize and Lagrange relaxation (LR) generate lower and upper bound to estimate large scale in minimum time. The gap between the main model and fix-and-optimize is better than the LR algorithm. Finally, this research suggests equipping VSCND by BCT that becomes more resilient against demand fluctuation, sustainable, and agile.</jats:p>",

После определения рабочих доз реагентов (коагулянт гидроксохлорид алюминия, флокулянт Praestol 650TR) проводилось пробное озонирование с последующей реагентной обработкой на лабораторном флокуляторе. Для достижения норматива по содержанию марганца в речной воде 0,1 мг/дм3 потребовались высокие дозы озона – от 35 мг/дм3. Подщелачивание исходной воды до рН 9 позволило снизить дозу озона до 23 мг/дм3. Снижение цветности до 15 град происходит при дозах озона 6–7 мг/дм3. Очистка речной воды на пилотной установке производительностью 50 л/ч проводилась по полной технологической схеме (озонирование, обработка коагулянтом и флокулянтом, отстаивание, фильтрование через песчаный фильтр, фильтрование через угольный фильтр, опреснение-умягчение обратным осмосом). Доза коагулянта составляла 5 мг/дм3, флокулянта – 0,3 мг/дм3.

The water of the Tobol River is hard and mineralized with an average color value of 24 degrees, a manganese concentration in the winter period of more than 0.8 mg/dm3. After determining the operational doses of the chemicals (polyaluminum chloride coagulant, Praestol 650TR flocculant), test ozonation was carried out followed by the chemical treatment in a laboratory flocculator. To achieve the standard for manganese concentration in river water of 0.1 mg/dm3, high doses of ozone were required – from 35 mg/dm3. Alkalinization of the initial water to pH 9 provided for reducing the ozone dose to 23 mg/dm3. A decrease in color to 15 degrees occurred at ozone doses of 6–7 mg/dm3. River water purification at a pilot plant with a capacity of 50 l/h was carried out according to the complete process flow scheme (ozonation, treatment with coagulant and flocculant, sedimentation, filtration in a sand filter, filtration in a carbon filter, desalination-softening by reverse osmosis). The coagulant dose was 5 mg/dm3, and that of the flocculant – 0.3 mg/dm3. In the steady run of the pilot plant at an ozone dose of 25 mg/dm3, the following quality indicators of the sand filter filtrate were achieved: color 5–7 degrees; manganese 0.05–0.15 mg/dm3; total iron 0.02–0.03 mg/dm3; aluminum 0.05–0.08 mg/dm3; permanganate index 3–4 mg/dm3. Based on the estimate indicators of the Tobol River water composition related to the manganese concentration in water of 0.8 mg/dm3, the theoretic dose of ozone is ≈ 8 mg/dm3, the design dose of ozone can be assumed as 10 mg/dm3 (g/m3).</jats:p>",

These characteristics have extended the supply chain desired traits from just being cost-effective and responsive. The agri-food supply chains include a diverse range of products, which differentiate in various aspects such as processing, life-cycle, seasonality, vulnerability, etc. These characteristics lead to different supply chain typologies and various requirements for synergies among stakeholders in order to meet these objectives. The situation gets even more complicated when sustainability objectives enter into the supply chain design and operation process.

Among others, they encompass the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy; they are responsible for feeding the planet; they are associated with various environmental and social impacts. Therefore, their operation, efficiency and performance are crucial in many contexts. In this paper we investigate the transitions of agri-food supply chains towards two different goals: circular economy and resilience. Circular economy has been a focal priority in the EU and global agenda, which aims at redefining the patterns that have been associated with linear economy models in order to meet environmental, social, and economic challenges of our era. On the other hand, supply chain resilience is the capacity of supply chains to be prepared for unexpected risk events, act and recover promptly to probable disruptions, and return to their original position or move to a better ideal condition. In particular, we focus on the enablers and barriers for both goals and identify possible convergences and deviations. The former are expected to lead to win-win opportunities, whereas the latter will lead to trade-offs.</jats:p>",

Within food system interventions, policies directed to supply chains have the potential to increase the availability and affordability of a healthy diet. This qualitative study aimed to identify opportunities to integrate nutrition as a priority into the food supply policy space in Mexico. Methods: Data were collected through analysis of 19 policy documents and 20 semi-structured stakeholder interviews. As an analytical framework, we used policy space analysis and embedded the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and the steps of the food chain of the conceptual framework of food systems for diets and nutrition. Results: Policy issues relevant to nutrition were viewed differently in the economic and agricultural sectors versus the health sector. Overall, the main policy objective related to nutrition within the economic and agricultural sectors was to contribute to food security in terms of food quantity. Nutrition was an objective in itself only in the health sector, with a focus on food quality. Our policy space analysis reveals an opportunity to promote a new integrated vision with the recent creation of an intersectoral group working on the public agenda for a food system transformation. This newer integrative narrative on food systems presents an opportunity to shift the existing food security narrative from quantity towards considerations of diet quality. Conclusion: The political context and public agenda are favorable to pursue a food system transformation to deliver sustainable healthy diets. Mexico can provide a case study for other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for putting nutrition at the center of food policy, despite the ongoing constraints on achieving this.</jats:p>",

The main aim of the present study is to determine the extent to which Hungarian fresh sour cherry producers show a willingness to operate in a short supply chain and what investments they would make to do so. The sour cherry producers involved in the study clearly show a willingness to operate in a short supply chain. Some producers approach this in a “complex” manner, so they would even meet individual consumer needs and deliver orders to the consumer. Farmers opting for a “simpler” solution would prefer to sell their products to the consumer at their premises or at farmer’s markets. Further results support the fact that the more producers believe in the viability and future of SSCs and the higher their level of education is, the more willing they are to adapt in terms of resources or production processes in order to achieve complete transition. The results reflect the importance of examining the factors that determine farmers’ intentions to operate in the short supply chain, but it is also worthwhile and justified to explore how willing they are to “sacrifice” and invest in order to completely adapt.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the moisture sources of summer (JJA) rainfall in the TCZ over East Asia during 1979-2010 with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model. Seven moisture source regions and associated contribution are quantified: Eurasia continent to northwest of the TCZ (EC, 18.01%), central-eastern China (CEC, 17.14%), western Pacific Ocean (WPO, 7.46%), South China Sea and Indonesia (SCSI, 3.56%), Bay of Bengal (BOB, 2.55%), Arabian Sea (AS, 2.13%) and local evaporation (TCZ, 19.96%). The moisture contribution from ocean (16.06%) is less than those from the continent (55.11%), due to the great loss en-route. In particular, the local evaporation not only contributes the most moisture among 7 selected source regions, but also has the greatest influence in summer precipitation variability in TCZ. Furthermore, westerlies precipitation and monsoon precipitation are discriminated according to the dominant system of water vapor source regions. It is found that summer monsoon contributes most of water vapor (33.2%) to summer rainfall in TCZ, while only 18.01% comes from the mid-latitude westerlies dominant area. Finally, further analysis of dry and wet years shows that summer monsoon system also takes more responsibility for a drier or wetter summer in TCZ from the perspective of moisture supply, followed by local evaporation and mid-latitude westerlies.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the lack of quantitative approaches to assess NBSs’ effectiveness limits their technical, social and cultural acceptance. Within the PHUSICOS project (EU H2020 Innovation Action; Grant Agreement nr. 776681) a comprehensive assessment framework tool (AFT) has been developed to fill this gap. This paper presents an ex-post analysis with the PHUSICOS AFT applied to the Isar River case study. The restoration of the urban reach of the Isar River, in the city of Munich, was implemented in the early 2000s and represents a successful example of ecosystem and user-friendly flood risk management plan. The performance of the NBS measures implemented to manage the flood risk and improve the ecological status of the river (NBS scenario) is assessed in comparison with an alternative scenario with traditional hard engineering measures (grey scenario, GS). Results underscore the NBS as a competitive alternative. The ex-post analysis shows the potential of the PHUSICOS AFT for NBS performance assessment, providing guidance on indicator selection, stakeholders’ management and performance assessment. The application discussed here is expected to aid professionals and researchers involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NBSs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The manufacturing sector in Kenya is faced by the challenges of performance and unstructured supply chain strategy. Further, the manufacturing sector growth in 2014 was 3.4% compared to a 5.6% growth in 2013 (Waiguru, 2015). This slow growth in manufacturing sector performance can be attributed to several environmental uncertainties such as the general election, high production costs, supply disruptions, political stability, unavailability of raw materials or demand fluctuations, technological changes, employees’ strikes, financial risk, terrorism and competition from imported goods (KNBS, 2018).The purpose of the study was to determine the moderating effect of environmental uncertainties on the relationship between risk hedging supply chain strategy and performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study utilized descriptive research design. The target population was 829 managers from manufacturing firms around the country. A sample of 270 managers was selected using stratified random sampling. Results indicated that risk hedging supply chain strategy explained 63.8% of the total variations in performance of manufacturing firms. In addition, risk hedging supply chain strategy had a positive and significant effect on firm performance (β=0.675, P &lt; .000).  With introduction of moderating variable (environmental uncertainties); risk hedging supply chain strategy explained 34% of the total variations in performance of manufacturing firms. This denoted those environmental uncertainties had a negative moderating effect on the relationship between risk hedging supply chain strategy and performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study concluded that risk hedging supply chain strategy had a positive and statistically significant effect on performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study further concluded that environmental uncertainties lower the effect of risk hedging supply chain strategy on firm performance. The study recommends that manufacturing firms should strengthen aspects related to risk hedging supply chain strategy. The firms should particularly strengthen safety stock, suppliers’ management and quality. The improvement of these aspects is expected to enhance performance of the manufacturing firms. This study further recommends that manufacturing firms should factor in environmental uncertainties related to demand, supply and technology when implementing supply chain strategies.</jats:p>",

Therefore, preparing sufficient and healthy blood in crisis conditions is a challenge that health systems encounter. Along with examining the conducted investigations in this field, the main contribution of current research is to develop a biobjective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for relief supply under crisis condition. For this purpose, this paper proposes a model for routing of bus blood receiver under crisis conditions considering different blood groups. Besides, hours of unnecessary travel by bloodmobiles (buses) between each blood station (BS) and the crisis-stricken city for dispatching the collected blood is prevented thanks to considering a helicopter. The mentioned model has two objectives: maximizing the amount of blood collected by bloodmobiles and minimizing the arrival time of the blood receiver buses and a helicopter to a crisis-stricken city after the collected blood is used up. The model is coded by CPLEX software, and the results obtained from solving the model indicate that, without considering a helicopter, the demand is not supplied within the critical period after crisis. Given that blood cannot be artificially produced, its primary resource is blood donors. Concerning the importance of this issue under crisis conditions, this research investigates the relief vehicles’ routing problem, including bus and helicopter, in a crisis considering supply and transfer of different blood groups to a crisis-stricken city for maximum relief supply and blood transfer within the shortest period.</jats:p>",

To eliminate a number of the disadvantages associated with the difficulty of energy-efficient regulation of the generated parameters, such as the generated current and voltage, the use of modified multi-winding synchronous generators with permanent magnets is proposed. It allows solving the problem of controlling this type of generator. In addition, the use of this type of generator helps to increase the amount of energy generated. The authors have proposed several synchronous generators with permanent magnets of various supply network architectures: single-phase, two-phase and traditional three-phase types. This will simplify the design of architecture for several cases of consumer power supply systems. It will also help to eliminate the need to organize a balanced distribution of loads in phases to prevent accidents, damage and/or disabling of consumers themselves. Here, we considered mathematical descriptions of several types of generators that differ in their assembling, in particular, the number of phases (one-, two- and three-phase generators), the number of pairs of permanent magnet poles on the rotor, and the method of switching the generator windings among themselves. Using the developed mathematical descriptions that describe the operation of every single winding of the generator, their mathematical models were developed in the SimInTech mathematical modeling environment. The results of the mathematical modeling of these generators were presented; their interpretation for use with renewable energy sources was made; and the methods of using these generators were described. The developed mathematical descriptions of synchronous generators with permanent magnets can be used for further study of their operation. It can also help for the development of control systems and power systems for micro-grid energy complexes that use renewable energy sources to increase the energy efficiency of micro-grid systems.</jats:p>"

Meat, milk, eggs, even skins still can not be fully supplied from national production. Livestock supply chain strategies such as the application of the creative economy and creative industries are needed to overcome the dependency gap on imported raw materials. The challenge in Indonesia is lack of technology &amp; knowledge. This study aimed to determine the role of the creative economy and the creative industry in improving the livestock supply chain in Indonesia. This study used a conceptual method from a literature study. Currently, the creative economy and creative industries are still relatively at the level of SMEs. The recurring problem shows the weak management of technology and knowledge. Based on the literature study result, the creative economy and creative industries can increase the supply of livestock in Indonesia. Hopefully the research on creative economy strategies and creative industries will not only become a trend but also sustainable in the future.</jats:p>",

Hydrogen carrier introduces a power to hydrogen (P2H), and power to hydrogen to power (P2H2P) facility to store the excess energy in renewable energy storage systems, with the facts of large-scale storage capacity, transportability, and multiple utilities. This work examines the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid solar photovoltaic (PV)/hydrogen/fuel cell-powered cellular base stations for developing green mobile communication to decrease environmental degradation and mitigate fossil-fuel crises. Extensive simulation is carried out using a hybrid optimization model for electric rnewables (HOMER) optimization tool to evaluate the optimal size, energy production, total production cost, per unit energy production cost, and emission of carbon footprints subject to different relevant system parameters. In addition, the throughput, and energy efficiency performance of the wireless network is critically evaluated with the help of MATLAB-based Monte-Carlo simulations taking multipath fading, system bandwidth, transmission power, and inter-cell interference (ICI) into consideration. Results show that a more stable and reliable green solution for the telecommunications sector will be the macro cellular basis stations driven by the recommended hybrid supply system. The hybrid supply system has around 17% surplus electricity and 48.1 h backup capacity that increases the system reliability by maintaining a better quality of service (QoS). To end, the outcomes of the suggested system are compared with the other supply scheme and the previously published research work for justifying the validity of the proposed system.</jats:p>"

This study is the first attempt to investigate the evolution of these source areas through time. Our analysis of sediment budgets from subsurface data in the Greater Barents Sea Basin and application of the BQART approach to estimate catchment properties shows that (1) during the Lower Triassic, sediment supply was at its peak in the basin and comparable to that of the biggest modern-day river systems, which are supplied by tectonically active orogens; (2) the Middle Triassic sediment load was significantly lower but still comparable to that of the top 10 largest modern rivers; (3) during the Upper Triassic, sediment load increased again in the Carnian; and (4) there is a large mismatch (70%) between the modeled and estimated sediment load of the Carnian. These results are consistent with the Triassic Greater Barents Sea Basin succession being deposited under the influence of the largest volcanic event ever at the Permian-Triassic boundary (Siberian Traps) and concurrent with the climatic changes of the Carnian Pluvial Event and the final stages of the Northern Ural orogeny. They also provide a better understanding of geodynamic impacts on sedimentary systems and improve our knowledge of continental-scale sediment transport. Finally, the study demonstrates bypass of sediment from the Ural Mountains and West Siberia into the adjacent Arctic Sverdrup, Chukotka, and Alaska Basins in Late Carnian and Late Norian time.</jats:p>",

However, increasing demand of eucalyptus certainly make availability of eucalyptus being determined, known as limited supply chain. Due to the increasing demand and limited supply chain, the eucalyptus wood supply should managed, by integrated the supply chain well. In this research study, the supply chain of eucalyptus wood for pulp and paper industry was diagnosed and divided into three degree, there are direct supply chain, extended supply chain, and ultimate supply chain. Four main stakeholders in this chain identified consisted of the eucalyptus seedling developers and sellers, the suppliers, the distribution centers, and the pulp and paper production plants.</jats:p>",

The data was collected using a closed questionnaire, containing several statements measured by a 5-point Likert scale. The data collected includes communication (language, clarity of message content, communication frequency, decision without pressure, and communicates honesty); commitment (affective, avoiding opportunists, normative, continuous improvement, goal oriented, confidence); and supply chain performance (the smoothness of the goods flow, money flow, and information flow).

The reason is that communication can increase understanding and help equalize perceptions of the marine fish supply chain among the entities involved.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to: (1) analyze supply chain mechanisms related to product flows, information flows and financial flows on rice; (2) analyze added value received by actors in the rice supply chain network; and (3) analyze marketing efficiency of rice in West Lombok Regency. This research uses descriptive methods. Data collection was carried out using surveys to the research locations of the districts of Narmada, Lingsar and Gerung, which all are the centers of rice in West Lombok Regency. There were 30 rice farmer respondents and some institutions or individuals involved in the flow of rice from farmers to end consumers. Data were analyzed by applying the analyses of descriptive, added value, and marketing efficiency. The results showed that in the rice supply chain there have been flows of product, finance, and information, amongst marketing actors or institutions. The added value and profit resulting from processing unhulled rice to hulled rice were IDR 6,100/kg and IDR 5,850/kg, respectively. It was also found that in West Lombok Regency there are three patterns of marketing channels and all of the channels operated efficiently.</jats:p>",

In this paper, an integrated energy system optimization model of new energy cogeneration with energy storage equipment is established. An example shows that the integrated energy system with energy storage can effectively solve the independent decoupling operation relationship among cool, heat and electricity. At the same time, the proposed model can also solve the energy interaction among cool, heat and electricity. In this way, the optimal operation of the integrated energy system can be realized.</jats:p>",

Education is the direct way to form human capital. At the same time, vocational education is a part of the education system. Vocational education is mainly to cultivate skilled\n human capital. From the perspective of human capital, this paper studies the impact of talent supply of vocational education on tobacco economic growth. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis was used. This paper analyzes the current situation of talent supply of vocational\n education and tobacco economy in China. It also analyzes the correlation between talent supply of vocational education and tobacco economy. Based on the theoretical model of human capital economic growth. Establish the theoretical model of talent supply in vocational education and tobacco\n economic growth. Comprehensively consider the spatial interaction of economic growth. Using the spatial panel econometric model, this paper makes an empirical analysis on 29 provinces and cities in China. Use Geoda, MATLAB and other software for empirical calculation. The results show that\n the supply of vocational education talents and the growth of tobacco economy are on the rise. However, the regional distribution is uneven. And vocational education is positively correlated with tobacco economic growth. The empirical results show that the regional tobacco economic growth in\n China has negative spatial auto-correlation. Employment, lifetime number of vocational education and human capital level in the tobacco industry significantly promote the economic growth of the tobacco industry. The results provide a reference for the regulation of China's tobacco industry.</jats:bold></jats:p>",

However, many challenges are encountered in the development of horticultural supply chains (HSCs) in Indonesia. One of them is the lack of production planning that suits the market demand. This results in inefficiency, high food losses and price fluctuation. HSCs systems are complex, especially in developing countries like Indonesia in which many smallholders are involved. Concerning this situation, ICT-based approaches have been widely proposed to integrate planning along supply chains. One of the approaches is a symbiotic simulation that enables a close association between the real system and simulation system. Symbiotic simulation is designed to support decision-makers to plan their activities using the real/near real-time data generated by the real systems as the inputs. However, how this system model can be used in HSC systems involving many smallholders is still a question. This paper proposes a framework to design decision support symbiotic simulations for HSC systems involving smallholders. The framework is designed based on the literature study on symbiotic simulation and agricultural supply chains in developing countries. In this framework, four activities in the HSCs are considered: 1) production; 2) post-production; 3) logistics, and 4) market. This framework can be used by farmer organisations or agricultural companies that have partnerships with smallholders to plan their activities along their supply chains.</jats:p>",

That is why comprehensive research on aspects of their resistance to water stress and the search for scientifically substantiated ways to improve the existing ones and develop modern, competitive technologies of growing legumes in arid conditions are becoming especially relevant. The aim of the work was to investigate the processes of formation and functioning of soybean-rhizobial symbiotic systems developed under conditions of different water supply and influence of nanocarboxylates of cobalt, ferum, germanium, chromium, сuprum and molybdenum. The nanoparticles of specified metal nanocarboxylates were used as components of the inoculation suspension of rhizobia of Tn5 mutant B1-20 for soybean seed treatment. A model drought lasting 14 days was created by controlled irrigation. Microbiological and physiological research methods were used in the study. We determined that insufficient water supply caused a significant decrease in the nodulation potential of rhizobia and the intensity of molecular nitrogen fixation by symbiotic systems formed with the participation of soybean plants and nodule bacteria without adding these metal nanocarboxylates to the inoculation suspension. Application of most of the metal nanocarboxylates used as components of the inoculation suspension mitigated the negative impact of stress on the investigated parameters. The study revealed the stimulating effect of cobaltnanocarboxylate on the activity of molecular nitrogen fixation, which was more pronounced in the conditions of insufficient water supply. Symbiotic soybean systems formed with the participation of nodule bacteria containing germaniumcarboxylate nanoparticles were proved to be the least sensitive to the negative impact of insufficient water supply. This was indicated by high rates of nodulation and nitrogen-fixing activity compared with other studied symbiotic systems. We confirmed that the addition of chromium nanocarboxylate to the inoculation suspension of rhizobia provided the highest rates of nodulation and nitrogen-fixing activity of soybean root nodules under optimal growing conditions and, at the same time, had no noticeable positive effect under water stress. We determined that сuprum and molybdenum nanocarboxylates, as components of the inoculation suspension, regardless of the water supply level, had a less notable positive effect on the processes of nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, and in some cases even led to a decrease in the investigated values for control plants. Thus, the study demonstrated that the use of germanium, cobalt and ferum nanocarboxylates as components of the bacterial suspension helped to increase the adaptation of the formed legume-rhizobial symbiotic systems to water stress, as evidenced by the maximum indexes of nodulation and molecular nitrogen fixation in the context of insufficient water supply and recovery of their level to optimal after the stress influence had ended. Based on the results, it was concluded that inoculation of seeds by the complex bacterial preparations made on the basis of Bradyrhizobium japonicum B1-20 with a content of germanium, cobalt and ferum nanocarboxylates in the concentration of 1:1000 can become one of the important means in soybean growing technologies of increasing the nitrogen-fixing potential and resistance of plants to insufficient water supply.</jats:p>"

It is in the context of the environmental supply for Eco-tourism and nature-based tourism. The study is in the area of the Pha Team National Park (PTNP) in Thailand, which consists of natural and historical features. PTNP has a distinctive geomorphological appearance. The uniqueness of the national park makes it more valuable as a site for not only establishing a national park but a geo-park as well. The PTNP is located on the edge east of Thailand’s territory. The boundary of the PTNP is along with Thailand and the Lao PDR border across the Mekong River. This study employed a semi-structured interview with the national park staff and superintendent. Fifteen questions ranging from the perspective of sustainable tourism development goals to environmental supply were posed to the respondents. The findings demonstrated that to successfully manage the national park and achieve its sustainable tourism development goals the national park should be careful with its management plan and deal cautiously with stakeholders. The national park tourism management plan should include the stakeholder in the planning process to avoid potential conflicts. Moreover, it is necessary for effective tourism management that the park staff enhance their expertise and skills with regard to the tourism operations and tour management aspects of the park.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to identify and analyze the sago agro-industrial supply chain management. Data were collected by interviews and discussions with stakeholders who have competence in the sago industrial supply chain management. The data was analyzed qualitatively. The results showed that the supply chain management of sago agroindustry consists of sago farmers, tual traders (toke), sago refinery owners, Harmonis Cooperatives, Individual Distributors, and Companies (PD) in Cirebon and Medan as well as businessmen of household sago processing industries, and local traders. The Sago agroindustry supply chain management in Meranti Island Regency is not efficient and not well managed.</jats:p>",

The long‐term business case effects for various utility‐scale photovoltaic (PV) configurations in their interaction with other developments in the electricity market, including battery storage and flexible assets, like electrolyzers, are investigated. For both wind and solar energy, the cost to produce one more unit of energy is very low, near zero, and therefore these renewable power plants deliver electricity at any positive price in the market. These so‐called marginal costs are much higher for fuel‐based power plants. The amount of wind and solar energy, which is offered on the electricity market, is also rather variable, literally, by nature. The impact of increased PV capacity at near‐zero marginal cost in the context of the Dutch electricity market is looked at. It is shown that growth of utility‐scale PV parks to a total capacity of 40–100 GW results in 30%–80% lower electricity prices in the next 20 years. It is also shown that variation in PV system configurations only has marginal effect on the electricity price. In contrast, large deployment of hydrogen electrolyzers (flexible demand) or local battery storage (delayed supply) increases the electricity price.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Although high uptake rates were observed across the study reach, they were uncorrelated to gross primary production. Overall, despite winter temperatures, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> uptake rates were high compared to small streams and rivers.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the number of tourists reducing to almost zero. Since tourism contributes around one-half of the gross provincial product of Phuket, the impact was so severe that even the numbers of people employed and registered as locals decreased. Analysing the data from January 2015 to March 2021, we found that the total, residential and non-residential monthly consumptions dropped significantly after Thailand's State of Emergency was declared in March 2020. Unlike other studies that reported residential consumption increasing when people were required to stay home for a prolonged period, Phuket's residential consumption decreased by more than 10% from the pre-COVID-19 level, possibly due to the drop in peer-to-peer accommodation bookings. To study the impact on consumption in detail, we modelled using cascade regression analysis by dividing the predictors into three groups, namely socioeconomics, weather and calendar period. The results showed that the number of guest arrivals was the most statistically significant in all types of consumption and should be used as a predictor for water demand forecasting models in tourism areas.</jats:p>",

Implementing circularity in business operations is a practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for achieving sustainable development goals established by the United Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility, AI–IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE) environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated version of the extended‐resource‐based view, and dynamic capability theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms through a questionnaire‐based survey and examined using “structural equation modeling (SEM).” The study results show that information flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on AI–IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with AI–IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between organizational flexibility and AI–IoT adoption. These findings pave the way for cross‐country analysis, formation of practical strategies, and policies related to AI–IoT and CE implementations.</jats:p>",

Comparing the modal composition of river sands and the outcrop area of different lithologies in the different sub-basins, an over-concentration of the volcaniclastic fraction, mainly represented by loose crystals of clinopyroxene, garnet and amphibole, is shown. This has been related to the preferential erosion of pyroclastic deposits, characterized by high production of sand-sized loose minerals, together with the carbonate lability and the low sand-sized detritus production from claystones and marls. The occurrence of volcaniclastic components upstream of Monte Vulture can be explained as a contribution from the lacustrine–fluviolacustrine deposits cropping out in the upstream sector or from pyroclastic fall deposits of Monte Vulture and/or Campanian volcanoes. This research shows that the volcanic record in the fluvial sands of the Ofanto River comes from weathering and sorting processes of volcaniclastic deposits rather than of the lavas building the main edifice. Therefore, caution must be taken during palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions when relating the type and abundance of the volcanic component in sediments to the weathering stage and evolutionary history of the volcano.</jats:p>",

Technologies as power-to-heat (PtH) allow flexible and effective utilisation of available surplus green electricity when integrated with seasonal heat storage options. However, insights and methods for integration of PtH and seasonal heat storage in multi-energy systems are lacking. Therefore, in this study, we developed methods for improved integration and control of a high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES) system within a decentralized multi-energy system. To this end, we expanded and integrated a multi-energy system model with a numerical hydro-thermal model to dynamically simulate the functioning of several HT-ATES system designs for a case study of a neighbourhood of 2000 houses. Results show that the integration of HT-ATES with PtH allows 100% provision of the yearly heat demand, with a maximum 25% smaller heat pump than without HT-ATES. Success of the system is partly caused by the developed mode of operation whereby the heat pump lowers the threshold temperature of the HT-ATES, as this increases HT-ATES performance and decreases the overall costs of heat production. Overall, this study shows that the integration of HT-ATES in a multi-energy system is suitable to match annual heat demand and supply, and to increase local sustainable energy use.</jats:p>"

Проспективное одноцентровое исследование проводилось с октября 2018 по апрель 2019 г. на базе Республиканского научно-практического центра «Мать и дитя». Осуществлена оценка антропометрических и лабораторно-инструментальных показателей 72 доношенных новорожденных детей. Группы наблюдения выделены в зависимости от антропометрических показателей пациентов следующим образом: группа 1 (Гр1) 25 крупновесных к сроку гестации новорожденных (КГС), группа 2 (Гр2) 15 маловесных к сроку гестации новорожденных (МГС), группа 3 (Гр3) 32 новорожденных смассой тела при рождении, соответствующей сроку гестации (НГС). Оценивались уровни 25(ОН)D и остеокальцина в пуповинной крови и сыворотке крови матери методом иммуноферментного анализа. Статистическая обработка данных выполнялась с помощью пакета программ Statistica 10 и Microsoft Excel. Результаты. Уровни 25(OH)D в пуповинной крови составили 19,1 [10,8-26,5] нг/мл у крупновесных новорожденных, 22,8 [12,5-30,1] нг/мл у маловесных новорожденных и 25,2 [18,132,9] нг/мл в контрольной группе (р1-3=0,042). Содержание остеокальцина пуповинной крови в группах не имело статистически значимых различий. Уровни 25(OH)D у новорожденных всех групп коррелировали (p&lt;0,05) с аналогичными показателями женщин (Гр1 r=0,689, Гр2 r=0,302, Гр3 r=0,784). Недостаточность витамина D выявлена во всех группах наблюдения и отмечалась у 84,0% крупновесных детей, у 66,7% маловесных новорожденных и у 59,4% младенцев группы контроля. Дефицит витамина D зарегистрирован у 8,0% пациентов Гр1, 13,3% Гр2 и не установлен ни у одного ребенка в Гр3. В Гр2 выявлены умеренные прямые корреляционные связи между содержанием витамина D и Z-score массы тела (r=0,673, p&lt;0,05) и Z-score длины тела (r=0,584, p&lt;0,05). У новорожденных Гр3 уровень остеокальцина сыворотки женщин положительно коррелировал с длиной тела при рождении (r=0,567, p&lt;0,05). Заключение. У крупновесных к сроку гестации доношенных новорожденных установлена значимо более низкая обеспеченность витамином D по сравнению с маловесными детьми и младенцами контрольной группы. У маловесных к сроку гестации доношенных новорожденных уровень витамина D пуповинной крови связан с Z-score массы и длины тела при рождении. Установлены положительные корреляционные взаимосвязи между уровнями витамина D пуповинной крови и содержанием D сыворотки крови матерей во всех группах наблюдения.

Materials and methods. A prospective single-center study was conducted from October 2018 to April 2019 on the basis of the Republican Scientific and Practical Center «Mother and Child». The assessment of anthropometric and laboratory-instrumental parameters of 72 full-term newborns was carried out. The observation groups were divided depending on the anthropometric parameters of the patients as follows: group 1 (Gr1) 25 newborns large for gestational age (LGA), group 2 (Gr2) 15 smalls for gestational age (SGA), group 3 (Gr3) 32 newborns, with birth weight and length corresponding to term of gestation (appropriate for gestational age AGA). The levels of vitamin D and osteocalcin were assessed by determining the content of 25 (OH) D and osteocalcin in the umbilical cord blood and maternal serum by enzyme immunoassay. Statistical data processing was performed using the Statistica 10 and Microsoft Excel software package. Results. Levels of 25 (OH) D in umbilical cord blood were 19.1 [10.8/26.5] ng/ml in newborns large for gestational age, 22.8 [12.5-30.1] ng/ml in small for gestational age and 25.2 [18.1-32.9] ng/ml in the control group (p1-3=0.042). The umbilical cord blood osteocalcin content in the groups did not have statistically significant differences. Levels of 25 (OH) D in newborns of all groups correlated (p&lt;0.05) with those in women (Gr1 r=0.689, Gr2 r=0.302, Gr3 r=0.784). Vitamin D deficiency was detected in all observation groups and was observed in 84.0% of LGA newborns, 66.7% of SGA infants and 59.4% of infants in the control group. Vitamin D deficiency was registered in 8.0% of Gr1 patients, 13.3% of Gr2 newborns, and not a single Gr3 child was diagnosed. In Gr2, moderate direct correlations were found between the vitamin D content and the Z-score of body weight (r=0.673, p&lt;0.05) and the Z-score of body length (r=0.584, p&lt;0.05). In newborns Gr3, the serum osteocalcin level of women positively correlated with body length at birth (r=0.567, p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Significantly lower vitamin D provision was found in full-term newborns of large for gestational age compared small for gestational age newborns and infants of the control group. Umbilical cord blood vitamin D levels in SGA age are associated with the Z-score of birth weight and length. Positive correlations were established between the levels of vitamin D in umbilical cord blood and the content of D serum in mothers in all observation groups. The obtained data actualize the issue of monitoring the supply of vitamin D and adequate supplementation with vitamin D preparations for pregnant women and newborns born in the autumn-winter-spring period.</jats:p>",

The study performed a bio-physicochemical characterization of leachate from two landfills in Oman, i.e., Multaqa landfill leachate (MLL) and Barka landfill leachate (BLL) before and after rainfall. Samples were characterized for 92 parameters. Additionally, the leachate pollution index (LPI) was estimated to assess the expected contamination levels and potential environmental health risks. The study found a high value of the leachate parameters without any rainfall incidents. Pearson correlations (±ve) are seen at more than 90% in all cases, which is a strong association (r&amp;gt;0.75) for the measured parameters in both MLL and BLL. Rainfall significantly reduced the concentrations of organic contaminants and solids in leachate due to dilution. The study revealed about 18%–29% and 14%–28% reductions in the LPI sub-index for organic and inorganic contaminants, respectively, after rainfall. The overall LPI values were higher compared with similar findings from the literature. Such deviations could be attributed to the unsegregated nature of solid waste, resulting in the formation of contaminants or from the disposal of a high volume of solid waste in a smaller area. Therefore, the study recommends efficient management strategies for landfills to reduce potential leachate groundwater contamination.</jats:p>",

Given that these wastes contain toxic elements, it is important to establish their impact on the quality of several surrounding natural sources of water that are considered potential drinking water supplies. This study identified four water source types, in which the contents of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and thallium (Tl) were exceeded, according to international guideline values for drinking water quality. The first type of aqueous sample corresponded to leachates produced by rainwater infiltration in tailings and water–mineral waste interactions. The second type corresponded to surface water along the Xichú and La Laja Streams, and the third and fourth types involved two groundwater well samples and spring samples, respectively. The Chiquito Stream was used as a reference area that had not been impacted by the mine wastes. The isotopic signatures associated with δ34Ssulfate and δ18Osulfate compositions from the El Ojo de Agua spring are similar to those of the Santa María River and are different from those of the mine waste leachates. This study shows evidence of the presence of As in the El Ojo de Agua spring, which results from dissolution of secondary mineral phases that were produced by alteration of the mine wastes, which then migrated along the Xichú Stream system until reaching the spring. These As-bearing fine particles are prone to dissolution when in contact with this water source. Principal component analysis revealed that the observed As, Tl, and Hg can be attributed to weathering of the mine wastes. However, the results suggest that a natural contribution of these elements could be associated with rainwater–igneous rock interactions.</jats:p>"

In the environment of the internet of things, from the perspective of supply chain configuration and enterprise’s expected risk minimization, this paper establishes the optimization model of raw material supply chain of primary and secondary school uniform based on the internet of things. Through the improved genetic algorithm to solve the model, the best raw material supply chain of primary and secondary school uniform is obtained.

They include TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B42V7,3B42RT and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data,CHIP). In this paper, the observation data of rainfall stations and IDWP precipitation data interpolated by IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted) are used as true value of precision comparison, and the detection accuracy of remote sensing precipitation products from 2001 to 2010 is evaluated on the time scale (day, month and quarter) and spatial scale in Naoli River Basin.The results of the study indicated that 3B42V7 and CHIP have a high detection accuracy for precipitation, and their CC (correlation coefficient) values are 0.47 and 0.49 respectively in daily time scale. The accuracy of their observation for monthly precipitation is better than that of daily precipitation, and the CC are 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. The multi-year average precipitation at different grid positions in the basin is overestimated by 3B42RT, and its evaluation results are poor at different time scales. For the precipitation intensity range of (0,20], the observed results of 3B42V7 and rainfall station are close to each other. For the precipitation intensity ranges of (0,1) and (50,+∞), 3B42RT and CHIP have overestimated or underestimated the precipitation in different degrees. Based on the above analysis results, 3B42RT can be considered as data that can detect whether precipitation occurs on different spatial positions in the basin. 3B42V7 and CHIP can be applied to flood forecasting and non-point source pollution control in cold regions.</jats:p>",

Methods   We conducted a side-by-side comparison of two contrasting sites in close proximity on Alcedo Volcano, Galápagos, one on basaltic lava and the other on rhyolitic pumice.     Key results   The lava site was covered by lush, stratified woodland, whereas the pumice site was covered by grassland with only few plant species. The soil on lava was a Leptosol, whereas on pumice, an Andosol had formed. Both soils had similar pH (6.0–6.5 in H2O), but the soil organic carbon stocks at the lava site were almost twice as high as at the pumice site (13.1 ± 1.6 vs 7.6 ± 1.3 kg m−2 to 25 cm depth). The soil at the pumice site had considerably lower levels of Mehlich-3-extractable P, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn and B. Soil microbes at the pumice site had lower biomass P (and a higher C:P ratio) and excreted more phosphatase. The grass biomass here also showed lower (and deficient) levels of P and other nutrients compared to the lava site.     Conclusions and implications   The contrasting lithologies and their bearings on soil formation and nutrient availability diversify the aboveground and belowground ecosystems and favour the development of distinct ecological niches in close proximity.</jats:p>"

An optimal design of the system is realized thanks to a double-objective optimization based on a proposed operational strategy of the system and on firefly algorithm (FA). The two objective functions simulated simultaneously using FA are: the function defining the cost of water (COW) and the function which defines the loss of water supply probability (LWSP). The system is designed to supply water to around 328 households in Cameroon, each composed by an average of six (06) persons. For different LWSP, the double-objective simulation determines the optimal configurations of the system with their related cost. The optimal and reliable (LWSP of 0%) system configuration obtained is composed by a number of 7 PV modules, a reservoir volume of 98.4 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> with 2 days autonomy, a total dynamic head of 40 m, and a pump power of around 1 kW. The related COW corresponding to this configuration is 0.1185 $/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, and the total investment cost is 27,506 $. The sensitivity analysis of the system revealed that the PV size, the volume of reservoir storage, and the efficiency of the pump influence the system both technically and economically, whereas the total dynamic head only influences the system economically. The validation of the optimized system has been done by comparison with manufacturer datasheets. It is demonstrated in this paper that the techno-economic analysis of energy systems based on multi-objective optimization using firefly algorithm is a powerful tool for decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hemp is a multipurpose crop that is cultivated worldwide for fiber, oil, and cannabinoids. Nitrogen (N) is a key factor for getting a higher production of hemp, but its application is often excessive and results in considerable losses in the soil–plant–water continuum. Therefore, a rational N supply is important for increasing N efficiency and crop productivity. The main objective of this paper was to determine the responses of four hemp cultivars to different levels of exogenous-N supply as nutrient solution during the vegetative growing period. The experiment was conducted at Yunnan University in Kunming, China. Yunma 1, Yunma 7, Bamahuoma, and Wanma 1 were used as the experimental materials, and five N supplying levels (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, and 24.0 mmol/L NO3-N in the nutrient solution) were set by using pot culture and adding nutrient solution. The root, stem, and leaf of the plant were sampled for the determination of growth indexes, dry matter and N accumulation and distribution, and physiological indicators. The plant height, stem diameter, plant dry weight, and plant N accumulation of four hemp cultivars were significantly increased with the increase in exogenous-N supply. Root/shoot dry weight ratios, stem mass density, and N use efficiency decreased significantly with the increase in exogenous-N supply. Nitrogen accumulation, chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, and nitrate reductase activity in leaves were increased with the increase in exogenous-N supply. Among the four indexes, the increase in N accumulation was more than the increase in NR activity. The activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase in leaves were increased first and then decreased with the increase in exogenous-N supply, with the maximum value at N 6.0 mmol/L, while the content of malondialdehyde in leaves increased significantly when the level of exogenous-N supply exceeded 6.0 mmol/L. These results revealed that increasing the exogenous-N supply could improve the plant growth, dry matter accumulation, and N accumulation in hemp during the vegetative growth period, but N supply should not exceed 6.0 mmol/L. Among four hemp cultivars, Wanma 1 performed well at 6.0 mmol/L N application.</jats:p>"

To quantify this effect, this spatial‐economic analysis simulates feedstock cost and cost variability of an industry based on corn stover as a function of the number of biorefineries. Results are reported for nine scenarios (a base case and sensitivity analysis of four variables – harvest efficiency, sustainability constraints, opportunity cost, and corn grain yield) under deterministic and stochastic simulations, assuming biorefineries using 658 000 Mg (725 000 tons) year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of corn stover in 2019. The resulting supply curves are highly elastic (i.e. little change in cost) for the first 50 of the 121 biorefineries, with price increases in subsequent biorefineries depending on scenario. In the base‐case deterministic scenario, weighted‐average stover costs are $66 Mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ($60 ton<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), $69 Mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ($62 ton<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and $156 Mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> ($142 ton<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), at the first, 60th, and 121st biorefineries, respectively. The stochastic simulations, subject to observed 30‐year corn yield variability, follow a similar pattern, with price distributions that vary by scenario. The base‐case stochastic simulations illustrate minimal cost variability for the first 60 biorefineries, but rapid increases in cost variability in the second half of potential biorefineries, with similar patterns observed in the other scenarios. Of the four variables explored, price was most sensitive to harvest efficiency, followed by sustainability constraints, corn yield, and opportunity cost. Results suggest that, under conventional logistics, about half of the US corn stover resource is reliably available with minimum cost increase and variability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A water supply network is an essential part of industrial and urban water systems. The water intake in a conventional water supply network varies periodically over time, depending on the amount of available water resources and the demand at water sinks or water-using units. This paper establishes a super-structural mathematical model for the optimal design and operation of a multi-period water supply network with multiple water sources. It considers the flow rate fluctuation of raw water availability and the demand of water sinks during different periods. The influence of multi-period demand variation on technology and the capacity selection of desalination water stations is examined, which affects the overall cost of the water supply network. The operating cost penalty factor is introduced, which quantitatively clarifies how the network operating status influences the operating costs. The comparison results of three scenarios considering with and without multi-period variation of water demand verify the validity of the proposed model, i.e., for a municipal water price of 4 CNY·t−1 and penalty factor of 0.3, one reverse osmosis desalination unit of capacity 800 t·h−1 is selected. However, in the multi-period case, two reverse osmosis desalination units with capacities of 500 t·h−1 and 300 t·h−1 are selected. In both cases, the operating costs are different because of the different operating status of the network. The work can guide the design and operation of industrial and urban water supply networks.</jats:p>"

A project results assessment was conducted in 2016 by the AfDB Independent Development Evaluation (IDEV) to measure the sub-program impacts on the living conditions of the communities. This approach allowed the measurement of project impacts based on comparative pre-and post-intervention data, as well as beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries' groups considering collected quantitative data (963 households, 38 schools, 23 health centres and 46 GPS points of infrastructures) and qualitative data (31 individual interviews and 4 focus group discussions). Several analyses (descriptive statistics, correlative analysis, effects and impact analysis with Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and cartographic treatment) were carried out to determine the project's results indicators as well as their overall effects. The results show an access rate of 73% for drinking water among beneficiaries against 6% among non-beneficiaries, and an access rate of 72% for sanitation (improved latrine) in the treatment areas against 33.7% in the control areas. In sub-program focus areas, an increase in the quantity of water used per household by 157 liters, a reduction in water price by 0.072 USD and reduction in time taken to supply drinking water of 65 minutes were observed. Also, it was noted a reduction in arduousness of carrying water by 2 km from the supply point, an increase in the schooling rate of children, especially girls, in income-generating activities, a decrease in the number of sick people avoided by 2 persons and increase in medical treatment avoided were noted. The progress made by the project's achievements demonstrate that improvement in water access, sanitation and hygiene access is one of the main drivers and levers of change and transformation of the households' living conditions in rural areas, often explaining the priority given to this area of intervention within the implementation of the MDGs and SDGs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS Increase of water and sanitation level access in rural areas.

The study was carried out on adequate mathematical models of CHP tur-bines and heat supply systems, considering heat pipelines' actual diameters and lengths. The main energy efficiency indicator is the specific reference fuel consumption for electricity sup-ply, calculated under comparable conditions for the operating modes of turbine plants and the load of the heat supply system. The study took into account the electricity consumption for the drive of network pumps, standard heat losses in heating networks and the electricity generation for the heat consumption of CHPPs. The study results allowed for the first time to determine the integral indicators of the energy efficiency of work during the transition of CHPPs from the normative design ones to the temperature schedules reduced by the temperature of the supply water. At the same time, the calculations revealed the limitations on the parameters of the extended schedules of regulation when transitioning to reduced temperature schedules. The most important results of the work should also be attributed to the determination of the optimal schedules of the temperature of the supply water for different values of the district heating coef-ficient of the CHPP. The results obtained are essential for assessing the efficiency of the transi-tion of heat supply systems to reduced supply water's design temperatures when using modern heating regulation schedules.</jats:p>"

As one of such measures, the article considers the ways of organizing a mini-TPP (thermal power plant) on the example of a large district boiler house for the purpose of energy supply for their own needs. This solution will increase the energy independence of the boiler house from the external network, reduce the cost of electricity consumption. The paper presents the results of a technical and economic analysis of options for organizing own generation, taking into account the actual operating conditions of the boiler house, linking the mini-TPP to the existing communications of boiler house, the impact of the joint operation of the mini-TPP and the boiler house on the sanitary zone. Based on the analysis of the loading graphs of the electric equipment of the boiler house, the required capacity of the gas engine generator plant and the place of its installation on the production site are determined. The operation of the gas engine generator plant involves the production of electric energy only for its own needs without issuing it to an external electrical network, in connection with which an automation system is provided that does not allow electricity to be issued to an external network. This restriction is related to the requirements of the technical specifications of the electric grid company.</jats:p>",

We also present the retailer's financing preference under equilibrium and show how the initial capital affects the retailer's financing selection.

In the proposed model, a periodic review replenishment policy is applied by the buyer, whereby the distributor is responsible for determining the optimal review period. Therefore, a game theory approach is used to show how government intervention influences the replenishment decisions, transportation, and safety factor. Due to the government constraint imposed to control GHG emissions, the distributor has to set a longer review period involving fewer trucks, resulting in his/her decision leading to more shortage costs for the buyer. The results of four numerical examples indicate that the buyer is not given any incentives to cooperate with the distributor due to his/her reduced revenue. Hence, this study proposes two‐part tariff (TPT) and cost‐sharing (CS) contracts to increase the profitability of both players. Finally, the results show that both coordination mechanisms can effectively coordinate the supply chain, but the TPT contract can also reduce GHG emissions. Furthermore, in all scenarios where the government constraint is implemented, the number of unfilled trucks in each replenishment inventory has been decreased.</jats:p>",

High resolution petrographic, heavy‐mineral and geochemical datasets, combined with published geochronological data, allow us to monitor compositional changes, estimate erosion rates and investigate lithologic, climatic and anthropic controls on sediment fluxes along this large sediment‐routing system entirely developed within high mountain areas. Sediment generated from the Lhasa Block along the southern margin of Asia is characterized by abundant feldspar and volcanic rock fragments, amphibole‐dominated transparent heavy mineral suite and high concentrations of K, Rb, Be, Th and Pb. Himalayan‐derived sand, instead, is characterized by sedimentary to low‐rank metasedimentary rock fragments, poor transparent heavy mineral suite dominated by durable recycled (zircon, tourmaline) or metamorphic minerals (chloritoid, garnet) and high Ca concentration. Sand from the ophiolitic suture is distinguished by serpentinite grains and mafic volcanic or metavolcanic detritus, transparent heavy mineral suite including olivine, Cr‐spinel, enstatite and clinopyroxene, and high Mg, Cr, Ni and low rare earth elements. Himalayan detritus is prominent in Yarlung Tsangpo upper reaches, whereas detritus from the Lhasa Block becomes progressively predominant in the middle and lower reaches. Provenance budgets based on integrated petrographic, heavy‐mineral and geochemical datasets indicate that ca. 83% of the detritus is supplied by the Lhasa Block and the rest mostly from the Himalaya (ca. 12%) and subordinately from the ophiolitic suture (5%). A low average erosion rate of ca. 0.06 mm/a was estimated for the Yarlung Tsangpo catchment upstream of the Namche Barwa syntaxis, which resulted from dry climate, relatively mild average relief and sediment storage in wide valley tracts of the middle and lower reaches. The decrease in sediment flux recorded in recent decades is mainly ascribed to growing human activities, which are becoming a prominent control on sediment generation and transportation even in the high‐mountain area of South Tibet.</jats:p>",

The assessment of the supply chain collaboration index will perform Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to weight the collaboration behaviour factors and Supply Chain Collaboration Index (SCCI) to measure the depth level of collaboration. The collaboration behaviour factors examined in this study are including joint effort, collaboration values, sharing activities, adaptation, trust, power, stability, commitment, continuous improvement and coordination. Based on the computation process using SCCI, the collaboration index among company X and its supplier is 76.72 on a scale of 1-100. It implies that the collaboration is at a moderate level. Consequently, the company needs to recognise the low score factors and develop a strategy for improvement. Some aspects that deserve further attention are sharing activities, power, and stability. By enhancing the performance of these factors, the supply chain collaboration index can also be increased.</jats:p>",

Brushless doubly fed alternator (BDFA) works through the rotor's pole pairs' transformation to get excitation indirectly, without magnets, brushes and slip rings. Both DC and AC excitation can be used. Therefore, it has high reliability and a good application prospect in the CCPS system. However, the existing research studies lack analysis of the parameters that affect charging performance, and have no experimental analysis of the prototype. To solve this problem, a comprehensive design method and experimental procedure of the pulsed BDFA are proposed and investigated. First, the operation principle of the pulsed BDFA is illustrated. Then, the charging performances under different design schemes are comparatively analysed through the finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, a prototype of the pulsed BDFA is manufactured, and the related experiments are carried out. The results verify the feasibility of the experimental procedure and the accuracy of FEA. The comprehensive design method and experimental procedure in this work provide a straightforward reference for the subsequent applications in the CCPS system.</jats:p>",

We find that long-term elevated phosphorus deposition and accumulation strongly correlate with increased organic matter decomposition and lower carbon accumulation in the catotelm. This contrasts with literature that finds short-term increases in phosphorus supply stimulates rapid carbon accumulation, suggesting phosphorus deposition imposes a threshold effect on net ecosystem productivity and carbon burial. We suggest phosphorus supply is an important, but overlooked, factor governing long-term carbon storage in ombrotrophic peatlands, raising the prospect that post-industrial phosphorus deposition may degrade this carbon sink.</jats:p>"

In this paper, two different modes (the centralized model and decentralized model) are, respectively, conducted and investigated for equilibria. Analytical results reveal that socially responsible retailer (manufacturer) cares more about CSR (altruistic fairness) concern and will increase his counterpart’s pure profit as well as the pure channel profit, ending up with decreasing his own pure profit. The cooperative agents in decentralized scenario can coordinate the channel and achieve the maximum pure channel profit as much as that in a pure profit-maximizing centralized model. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel two-stage carbon cap-and-trade policy for the government and examines how it is affected by the CSR concern level and the altruistic fairness in such a socially responsible supply chain.</jats:p>",

Both lack sufficient domestic energy resources, apart from nuclear energy. But nuclear energy has become controversial after the nuclear meltdown accident at Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Without reconsidering nuclear energy as a future energy resource, the cooperation in the energy market between the EU and Switzerland becomes even more vital for securing energy supply. While in the past, Switzerland has fulfilled an important function in securing energy supply in neighbouring EU Member States, lately, the EU has provided for its own governance for emergency situations. However, Switzerland will maintain its function as an interface in the electricity sector. This is even more true, since the new focus on renewable energies fosters the demand for flexible cross-boundary solutions. An electricity agreement between Switzerland and the EU might provide a stable legal framework for these developments. The price to pay for Switzerland will be a further opening of the market, offering the private consumer a choice of energy providers. The good news for Swiss strategies for promoting renewable energies is that EU Member States are still allowed to take a flexible approach towards national promotion measures, especially in designing them to their territory. Therefore, the cooperation between Switzerland and the EU offers some advantages in terms of flexibility in the quest for security of supply while fighting climate change.</jats:p>"

With the accelerated urbanization and industrialization in China, the potential demand for water resources will be enormous. Therefore, accurate prediction of water resources demand is important for the formulation of industrial and agricultural policies, development of economic plans, and many other aspects. In this study, we develop a model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network to predict water resources demand in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, a city with severe water shortage in China. The prediction accuracy is then compared with PCA-ANN, ARIMA, NARX, Grey–Markov, serial regression, and LSTM models, and the results showed that the PCA-BP model outperformed other models in many evaluation factors. The proposed PCA-BP model reduces the dimensionality of high-dimensional variables by PCA and transformed them into uncorrelated composite data, which can make them easier to compute. More importantly, BP and weight threshold adjustment in model training further improve the prediction accuracy of the model. The model analysis will provide an important reference for water demand assessment and optimal water allocation in other regions.</jats:p>",

We randomly divided 75 rabbits into three groups: A, B, and C, with 25 rabbits in each group. The central corneal epithelium was removed from all eyes of the rabbits using a 5 mm trephine. Group A rabbits were given low flow oxygen (3 L/min; concentration: 33%) for 2 h per day through goggles.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> According to the current power supply focused reform in China, a dual-channel and multienergy supply chain model is constructed. The supply chain has a new energy enterprise, a traditional energy enterprise, and the State Grid that is the retailer. New energy company and traditional energy company sell electricity to the State Grid at wholesale prices, and at the same time they enter the market to retail power products. Multiequilibriums and their practical significance are discussed. The complex dynamic is investigated using a bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent, parameter basin, and fractal dimension. In this multilayer supply chain network, the price adjustment of the State Grid will make the entire supply chain face greater volatility risks, and dual-channel suppliers, that is, new energy and traditional energy companies are also involved in this volatility. Further, considering the sticky information, the sticky expectation of electricity price is built for studying the lagging electricity price. The dynamic characteristics of the sticky model are investigated, and new phenomena are discovered: 3-orbit bifurcation and mutation appear with fractals. This means that prices continue to swing and oscillate on three tracks. Through comparison of the fractal dimension, an important conclusion is discovered: the purpose of sticky expectations for electricity prices is to stabilize price fluctuations, but sticky expectations make the market more complicated. The article provides a strategic reference for exploring the power market in China. </jats:p>",

From the data collected, the problem was defined as the three worst parts, which are the mudguard, rear fork, and top cover, as it was found that they are recurrent in more than 50% of the models produced. These defects are due to the improper storage of the parts, which present scratches and beat marks. The need to establish an ideal condition of ideal storage was raised, and a manual was elaborated in which basic actions are listed to avoid small defects.

Mutation supply influences features of population genetics, such as the pool of adaptive mutations, evolutionary pathways and importance of processes, such as clonal interference. The resultant trait evolutionary dynamics, in turn, can alter population size and species interactions. However, controlled experiments testing for the importance of mutation supply on rapid adaptation and thereby population and community dynamics have primarily been restricted to the first of these aspects. To close this knowledge gap, we performed a serial passage experiment with wild‐type <jats:italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</jats:italic> and a mutant with reduced mutation rate. Bacteria were grown at two resource levels in combination with the presence of a ciliate predator. A higher mutation supply enabled faster adaptation to the low‐resource environment and anti‐predatory defence. This was associated with higher population size at the ecological level and better access to high‐recurrence mutational targets at the genomic level with higher mutation supply. In contrast, mutation rate did not affect growth under high‐resource level. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic mutation rate influences population dynamics and trait evolution particularly when population size is constrained by extrinsic conditions.</jats:p>",

In this study, we innovatively investigate the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and consumer green preferences (CGP) on supply chain performance and product green level in the dual-channel green supply chain (DCGSC). Specifically, four models of DCGSC (centralized, independent CSR, cooperative CSR, and collaboration contract) are investigated. Next, we use game theory to investigate the optimal product green level, online and offline selling prices, social welfare, profits of supply chain enterprises, and the whole supply chain under the four models. We give numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and viability of the four models. We find several interesting conclusions. First, increasing the attention to both CSR and CGP by supply chain enterprises is conducive to stimulating innovation and improving product green level. Second, when supply chain enterprises actively execute their CSR, they can reasonably control online and offline selling prices and increase consumer surplus and the profits of whole supply chain and social welfare are increased. Third, it is beneficial to increase the value of supply chain enterprises to enhance CSR within a certain threshold, but when CSR is higher than the threshold, the profitability of supply chain enterprises is weakened. Finally, collaboration contracts are capable of coordinating DCGSC and guaranteeing the profitability of supply chain enterprises.</jats:p>",

We develop a game‐theoretic model wherein the manufacturer produces a product at a certain level of quality to the retailer at a static wholesale price or at dynamic wholesale prices over two periods. The retailer determines whether to share the market demand information with the manufacturer. Conventional wisdom suggests that the retailer prefers not to share the information because of the double marginalization effect. Under the two‐period setting, we show that the retailer may disclose information to the manufacturer voluntarily. Specifically, if the manufacturer adopts the static wholesale pricing strategy, sharing (no) information over two periods is beneficial for the retailer when the quality cost coefficient is low (high). If the manufacturer implements the dynamic wholesale pricing strategy, it is beneficial for the retailer to share information only in the first period when the quality cost coefficient is moderate. When the quality cost coefficient is sufficiently low (high), the retailer prefers to share (no) information for both periods. Our result suggests that the manufacturer always benefits from the information‐sharing, that is, a “win‐win” outcome for the retailer and manufacturer may be achieved under certain conditions, which stands in sharp contrast to the literature on information‐sharing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phosphorus (P) is an important nutrient affecting nodulation and nitrogen fixation in soybeans. To further investigate the relationship of phosphorus with soybean nodulation and nitrogen fixation, the seedling grafting technique was applied in this study to prepare dual-root soybean systems for a sand culture experiment. From the unfolded cotyledon stage to the initial flowering stage, one side of each dual-root soybean system was irrigated with nutrient solution containing 1 mg/L, 31 mg/L, or 61 mg/L of phosphorus (phosphorus-application side), and the other side was irrigated with a phosphorus-free nutrient solution (phosphorus-free side), to study the effect of local phosphorus supply on nodulation and nitrogen fixation in soybean. The results are described as follows: (1) Increasing the phosphorus supply increased the nodules weight, nitrogenase activity, ureide content, number of bacteroids, number of infected cells, and relative expression levels of nodule nitrogen fixation key genes (GmEXPB2, GmSPX5, nifH, nifD, nifK, GmALN1, GmACP1, GmUR5, GmPUR5, and GmHIUH5) in root nodules on the phosphorus-application side. Although the phosphorus-application and phosphorus-free sides demonstrated similar changing trends, the phosphorus-induced increases were more prominent on the phosphorus-application side, which indicated that phosphorus supply systematically regulates nodulation and nitrogen fixation in soybean. (2) When the level of phosphorus supply was increased from 1 mg/L to 31 mg/L, the increase on the P– side root was significant, and nodule phosphorus content increased by 57.14–85.71% and 68.75–75.00%, respectively; ARA and SNA were 218.64–383.33% and 11.41–16.11%, respectively, while ureide content was 118.18–156.44%. When the level of phosphorus supply was increased from 31mg/L to 61mg/L, the increase in the regulation ability of root and nodule phosphorus content, ARA, SNA, and ureide content were low for roots, and the value for nodules was lower than when the phosphorus level increased from 1 mg/L to 31 mg/L. (3) A high-concentration phosphorus supply on one side of a dual-root soybean plant significantly increased the phosphorus content in the aboveground tissues, as well as the roots and nodules on both sides. In the roots on the phosphorus-free side, the nodules were prioritized for receiving the phosphorus transported from the aboveground tissues to maintain their phosphorus content and functionality.</jats:p>"

In this system, the scheme for generating continuously high-frequency pulses depends on the cooperation of multiple power modules with a new structure. Multiple power modules are connected in parallel to energize the pulsed magnet, and each module is composed of two capacitor banks and a pulse transformer, which is used to realize the conversion of the energy between the two capacitor banks. As the residual energy in one capacitor is transferred to another, the energy required to be replenished for the next pulse reduces substantially. Then, the high repetition rate of the RPHMF can be achieved by discharging the capacitor banks of each module in sequence. The scheme has been validated by the experiment of a 2.4 T/12 Hz prototype with only one power module. Simulation shows that the frequency of the RPHMF can be improved to 12*N Hz with N power modules, and a higher repetition rate of the RPHMF may bring new opportunities to the water electrolysis.</jats:p>",

Monthly means of the variables pH, apparent color and turbidity of raw, decanted and treated waters were used, in addition to the volume accumulated by the Epitácio Pessoa reservoir, during the period from January 2016 to December 2017. The arrival of the transposition waters abruptly changed the apparent color and turbidity of the raw water. In spite of that, the treated water presented low variability of the mentioned parameters, indicating that WTP-Gravatá was able to adapt its treatment. From the factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA) it was found that changes in reservoir volume alter the apparent color and turbidity of the raw water, requiring interventions in the coagulation/flocculation/decantation stages. The increasing of these parameters in the decanted water overloads the filtration step, raising the apparent color of the treated water. The cluster analysis distinguished the different phases experienced by the Epitácio Pessoa reservoir. The information obtained can help decision-making in WTPs, considering changes in reservoir volumes.</jats:p>",

In this paper, two different attack methodologies are presented based on inserting faults through the clock signal or the control signal. The optimization of the attacks is evaluated under supply voltage and temperature variation, experimentally determining the feasibility through the evaluation of different Trivium versions in 90 nm ASIC technology implementations, also considering different routing alternatives. The results show that it is possible to inject effective faults with both methodologies, improving fault efficiency if the power supply voltage decreases, which requires only half the frequency of the short pulse inserted into the clock signal to obtain a fault.

This island has its attractions in terms of flora and fauna as well as the uniqueness of its local community. The electricity supply status of the island is minimal, and the local electricity provider only provides two units of electrical generator that only supply energy from 18:00 to 06:00. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that if the target resident can obtain a better electricity supply, they can generate higher income and improve their standard of living. This study aims to identify the status of solar energy sources, estimate the basic electrical load, and conduct a techno-economic analysis of homestay enterprises of residents. Geostationary satellite data on solar energy resources were gathered and analyzed using Solargis. The electricity load was calculated based on the daily routine activities of the residents and usage of primary electrical appliances. Techno-economic analysis was done by determining the key parameters to calculate the return on investment and payback period. The results showed that Mantanani Island had great potential for implementing a photovoltaic system, by the estimated value of the total annual solar energy and peak sun hour of 1.447 MWh/m2/y and 4.05 h, respectively. The variation in total monthly solar energy was minimal, with a range of only 61.3 Wh/m2. The calculated electrical load was 7.454 kWh/d. The technoeconomic assessment showed that the return on investment was MYR 3600 per year. However, the value of the payback period varies according to the value of the cost of capital spent. Regarding the cost of capital of this study, the shortest and longest payback periods achievable were 2.78 and 13.89 years, respectively. This calculation is in line with a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 2.2 kWp.</jats:p>"

Technologies for delivering these nutrients and for monitoring their concentrations can help to ensure proper nutritional balance. Eccrine sweat is a potentially attractive class of biofluid for monitoring purposes due to the ability to capture sweat easily and noninvasively from nearly any region of the body using skin‐integrated microfluidic technologies. Here, a miniaturized system of this type is presented that allows simple, rapid colorimetric assessments of the concentrations of multiple essential nutrients in sweat, simultaneously and without any supporting electronics – vitamin C, calcium, zinc, and iron. A transdermal patch integrated directly with the microfluidics supports passive, sustained delivery of these species to the body throughout a period of wear. Comparisons of measurement results to those from traditional lab analysis methods demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this platform. On‐body tests with human subjects reveal correlations between the time dynamics of concentrations of these nutrients in sweat and those of the corresponding concentrations in blood. Studies conducted before and after consuming certain foods and beverages highlight practical capabilities in monitoring nutritional balance, with strong potential to serve as a basis for guiding personalized dietary choices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Введение. Доставка кислорода в ткани определяется величиной объемного кровотока; он, в свою очередь, зависит от сосудистых и реологических факторов. Снижение вязкости крови (ВК) может способствовать приросту объемного кровотока и повышению эффективности доставки кислорода. Поскольку ВК тесно связана с микрореологическими свойствами эритроцитов, то можно полагать, что их положительные изменения будут способствовать улучшению кислородтранспортной функции крови. Цель исследования: сравнительный анализ гемореологических профилей у лиц с разным уровнем обеспечения организма кислородом и определение роли оксида азота (NO) и сульфида водорода (H2S) в изменениях микрореологических характеристик эритроцитов. Материалы и методы. На основе результатов определения максимального потребления кислорода (МПК) были сформированы 2 группы, в каждой из которых было по 24 практически здоровых мужчины-добровольца в возрасте от 20 до 35 лет: группа 1 – лица с умеренным обеспечением организма кислородом (МПК = 40–50 мл/кг/мин) и группа 2 – лица с относительно высоким его уровнем (МПК = 51–65 мл/кг/мин). Регистрировали параметры гемореологического профиля, напряжение кислорода в коже предплечья (tсрО2), метаболизм оксида азота (по соотношению нитраты/нитриты, NOx). Для исследования влияния газотрансмиттеров (ГТ) на микрореологию эритроцитов их инкубировали с донором NO (нитропруссидом натрия, 100 мкмоль) и донором H2S (гидросульфидом натрия, 100 мкмоль) с последующей регистрацией деформируемости и агрегации эритроцитов. Результаты. У лиц с относительно высоким обеспечением тканей кислородом отмечалась сниженная вязкость крови, ее высокий кислородтранспортный потенциал, эффективная микрореология эритроцитов и их более высокая чувствительность к ГТ при положительном влиянии последних на агрегацию и деформируемость эритроцитов. Заключение. Данные, полученные на моделях микрореологических ответов эритроцитов на доноры двух газотрансмиттеров, позволяют заключить, что, во-первых, эти ГТ, как сигнальные молекулы, положительно влияют на микрореологические характеристики эритроцитов и, следовательно, на их транспортный потенциал, и, во-вторых, эритроциты лиц, имеющих высокий уровень обеспечения организма кислородом, более чувствительны к регуляторному действию газотрансмиттеров, поскольку их микрореологические ответы на доноры были статистически значимо более выраженными.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Background. Oxygen delivery to tissues is determined by the volume of blood flow that, in turn, depends on vascular and rheological factors. Blood viscosity (BV) decreasing can promote an increasing of volumetric blood flow and provide more efficient oxygen transport. Since BV depends on the erythrocyte microrheological properties it can be assumed that their positive changes will contribute to better oxygen transport. Objectives: to investigate hemorheological profiles in individuals with different levels of body oxygen supply and the role of nitrogen oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in changes of the erythrocyte microrheological characteristics. Patients/Methods. Based on the determination of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), 2 groups were formed, each of which consisted of 24 practically healthy male volunteers aged 20–35 years: group 1 – persons with moderate body oxygen supply (VO2max = 40–50 ml/kg/min) and group 2 – persons with a relatively high body oxygen supply (VO2max = 51–65 ml/kg/min). Hemorheological profi le parameters, oxygen tension in the forearm skin (tcpO2), and nitric oxide metabolism by the ratio of nitrates/nitrites (NOx) were recorded. To study the effect of gasotransmitters (GTs) on erythrocyte microrheology, they were incubated with NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, 100 μmol) and H2S donor (sodium hydrosulfide, 100 μmol), and erythrocytes deformability and aggregation were registered. Results. Individuals with a relatively high oxygen supply of tissues showed a reduced blood viscosity, high blood oxygen transport potential, an effective microrheology of erythrocytes and their higher sensitivity to GTs with their positive effect on erythrocytes aggregation and deformability. Conclusions. The obtained data on models of erythrocyte microrheological responses to donors of two gasotransmitters allow us to conclude that, firstly, these GTs, as signaling molecules, have a positive effect on the erythrocyte microrheological characteristics and, consequently, on their transport potential, and, secondly, erythrocytes from individuals with a high level of oxygen body supply are more sensitive to the regulatory action of GTs, because their microrheological responses to donors were statistically significantly more expressed.</jats:p>",

However, dynamic load scenarios, internal and external disturbances, and the characteristics of strong nonlinearity make the control of complex air supply systems challenging. This paper mainly studies the modeling of PEMFC air supply system and the design of a nonlinear controller for oxygen excess ratio tracking control. First, we analyze and calibrate the system’s optimal oxygen excess ratio control target and explore how the system temperature and humidity impact it, respectively; second, a second-order affine oriented control model which can represent the static and dynamic characteristics of the air supply system is derived, and a disturbance observer is designed to estimate and compensate the “lumped error” online. Then, aiming at the problem of unmeasurable cathode pressure, a state observer based on Kalman optimal estimation algorithm is proposed to realize the real-time estimation of cathode pressure; finally, a dynamic output feedback control system based on observer and backstepping nonlinear controller is proposed, and the comparison and evaluation of two control strategies based on constant oxygen excess ratio tracking and optimal oxygen excess ratio tracking are carried out. The simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the designed control system compared with the reference controller.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, many social or environmental incidents that occur in one enterprise could bring huge risk or disruption for the entire supply chain. This study discusses the manufacturer’s cooperation strategy of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) composed of a dominant manufacturer with CSR behavior consciousness, a retailer with CSR investment, and a third-party recycler. In the CSR-CLSC, the manufacturer exhibits CSR behavior consciousness through considering stakeholders welfare, the retailer makes CSR investment through profit donation and the third-party recycler exhibits CSR activity through product recycling. And under the Stackelberg Game setting, we formulate four different decision-making models to investigate the interaction between manufacturer’s CSR behavior consciousness and retailer’s CSR investment, as well as their impact on the manufacturer’s cooperative strategy selection and CLSC operation. The results show that both the CSR behavior consciousness of manufacturer and CSR investment of retailer are conducive to reducing the wholesale price of new products, enhancing the recycling rate of waste products and improving the performance of CSR-CLSC members, and both of them have the function of mutual incentives. The vertical cooperation strategy of manufacturer is conducive to increasing the overall performance of CSR-CLSC, and compared with the cooperation with the third-party recycler, the manufacturer has stronger motivation to cooperate with the retailer, and it is also more beneficial to improving the CSR investment level, the waste product recycling rate, and the performance of CSR-CLSC members.</jats:p>",

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory‐Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered‐Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20‐year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research‐to‐operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach. This work demonstrates the capacity for gridded and point snow products to be used to objectively update model states in an operational forecasting setting.</jats:p>",

In order for these destinations to compete effectively, it is essential to explore how natural disasters may have impacted the destination. Basic utilities such as water resources could have been impacted by natural disasters. To date, little is known on the impact of natural disasters on the water supply which may directly and indirectly affect the image of a destination. Information on the characteristics of natural disasters, namely floods and drought, (i.e., the time duration, location and the severity) based on the individual destination are also not known. Hence, the main objective of this study is to understand the economic and socio-economic aspects of natural disasters on water supply. To fulfill the research gap, a qualitative study was performed. Specifically, two focus group discussions were executed on household representatives of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur in regard to natural disasters like floods and droughts. Based on the research findings, there is no issue of water supply associated with the flood crisis. However, there are mix opinions on the correlation of droughts and the water supply, with majority believing that there is no correlation between droughts and water supply in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. The findings of this qualitative study may serve as the foundation for a quantitative study (i.e., developing sets of questionnaires), and may contribute for policymakers and water utility providers in comprehending the issues and taking precautions prior to the occurrence of natural disasters.</jats:p>"

К ним относятся математическое ожидание, дисперсия и среднеквадратическое отклонение (с.к.о.) пропускной способности ГС, а также коэффициент надежности газопровода. Методы: эквивалентирования, аналитический метод на уровне случайных Марковских процессов - схема «гибели и размножения», теоремы сложения и умножения вероятностей, композиция рядов распределения; математическая модель анализа надежности проектируемого магистрального газопровода (МГ). Результаты. На основе математической модели оценки надежности проектируемого магистрального газопровода и разработанной вычислительной программы были выполнены расчеты по определению интегральных показателей надежности условной газораспределительной системы. Исследования показали, что при изменении исходных показателей надежности (интенсивностей отказов и восстановлений) элементов ГС на одинаковую величину их влияние на изменение интегральных показателей надежности ГС имеет разную силу. Выводы. На основе предложенной математической модели анализа надежности ГС показано влияние показателей интенсивности отказов и интенсивности восстановлений элементов, характеризующих безотказность и ремонтопригодность газотранспортных систем, на ее интегральные показатели надежности, в частности, на коэффициент надежности.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The Relevance of the research is due to the need for active gasification of large territorial entities (new residential agglomerations under construction, cottage and dacha settlements, as well as large industrial complexes). On the other hand, the increase in the total length of gas distribution systems and the complexity of the configuration of gas pipeline schemes continues. These factors affect the reliability of the gas distribution systems and place high demands on the part of energy consumers for trouble-free operation. Purpose. The main initial reliability information used for analyzing the reliability of gas pipelines is the failure rates of its elements: individual sections of the linear part, gas pumping units, etc., and the recovery rates of these elements. These indicators characterize such properties of reliability as reliability and maintainability. The purpose of the research is to assess the impact of reliability and maintainability of equipment on the integral reliability indicators of the gas distribution system (GDS). These include the expectation, variance and standard deviation of the throughput of the GDS, as well as the reliability coefficient of the pipeline. Methods: equivalent methods, analytical method at the level of random Markov processes - the scheme of \"death and reproduction\", the theorem of addition and multiplication of probabilities, the composition of distribution series; mathematical model of reliability analysis of the designed main gas pipeline. Results. On the basis of a mathematical model for assessing the reliability of the designed main gas pipeline and the developed computational program, calculations were performed to determine the integral indicators of the reliability of the conventional gas distribution system. So, studies have shown that when the initial reliability indicators (failure rates and recoveries) of the GDS elements are changed by the same amount, their effect on the change in the integral reliability indicators of the GDS has a different effect. Conclusion. On the basis of the proposed mathematical model for analyzing the reliability of the GDS, the influence of the failure rate indicators and the recovery rate of elements characterizing the reliability and maintainability of gas transmission systems on its integral reliability indicators, in particular, on the reliability coefficient, is shown.</jats:p>",

Considering the problems of environmental deterioration and income disparity faced by China, this paper first incorporates environmental pollution and income disparity as undesirable outputs into the TFP analysis framework, and extends the concept of inclusive green TFP (henceforth IGTFP).We measure and analyze the IGTFP in China’s provinces from 1995 to 2017 using the Malmquist–Luenberger index, and then examine, for the first time, the impacts of economic structural optimization in the supply-side structural reform on the IGTFP. The results are shown as follows. First, China’s national IGTFP index is significantly smaller than the traditional TFP index. That is, the traditional TFP without the constraints of environmental pollution and income disparity overestimates China’s real TFP. Second, there are significant regional differences in China’s IGTFP, the average annual growth rate of IGTFP shows a gradual downward trend from east to west. This would further exacerbate the regional imbalance in China’s economic development. Third, among the structural factors in economic structure optimization, industrial structure and energy structure are negatively correlated with the IGTFP, while factor structure, labor structure and urban–rural structure are all positively correlated with the IGTFP. These results imply that the economic structure optimization driven by supply-side structural reform will improve China’s IGTFP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Submarine landslides can generate complicated patterns of seafloor relief that influence subsequent flow behaviour and sediment dispersal patterns. In subsurface studies, the term mass transport deposits (MTDs) is commonly used and covers a range of processes and resultant deposits. While the large-scale morphology of submarine landslide deposits can be resolved in seismic reflection data, the nature of their upper surface and its impact on both facies distributions and stratal architecture of overlying deposits is rarely resolvable. However, field-based studies often allow a more detailed characterisation of the deposit. The early post-rift Middle Jurassic deep-water succession of the Los Molles Formation is exceptionally well-exposed along a dip-orientated WSW-ENE outcrop belt in the Chacay Melehue depocentre, Neuquén Basin, Argentina. We correlate 27 sedimentary logs constrained by marker beds to document the sedimentology and architecture of a &amp;gt;47 m thick and at least 9.6 km long debrite, which contains two different types of megaclasts. The debrite overlies ramps and steps, indicating erosion and substrate entrainment. Two distinct sandstone-dominated units overlie the debrite. The lower sandstone unit is characterised by: 1) abrupt thickness changes, wedging and progressive rotation of laminae in sandstone beds associated with growth strata; and 2) detached sandstone load balls within the underlying debrite. The combination of these features suggests syn-sedimentary foundering processes due to density instabilities at the top of the fluid-saturated mud-rich debrite. The debrite relief controlled the spatial distribution of foundered sandstones. The upper sandstone unit is characterised by thin-bedded deposits, locally overlain by medium-to thick-bedded lobe axis/off-axis deposits. The thin-beds show local thinning and onlapping onto the debrite, where it develops its highest relief. Facies distributions and stacking patterns record the progradation of submarine lobes and their complex interaction with long-lived debrite-related topography. The emplacement of a kilometre-scale debrite in an otherwise mud-rich basinal setting and accumulation of overlying sand-rich deposits suggests a genetic link between the mass-wasting event and transient coarse clastic sediment supply to an otherwise sand-starved part of the basin. Therefore, submarine landslides demonstrably impact the routing and behaviour of subsequent sediment gravity flows, which must be considered when predicting facies distributions and palaeoenvironments above MTDs in subsurface datasets.</jats:p>"

This study is a techno‐economic analysis of three different scenarios (clean chips, dirty chips, or pulpwood) based on data collected from whole‐tree harvesting systems over 6 years. Each scenario had two different cases: one with costs and revenues allocated by mass (allocated system), and the other without allocation (whole system). The six cases of three scenarios tested resulted in a wide range of positive net present values (NPVs) from $1 713 000 to $819 in US dollars. Clean chip production generated substantial NPVs and dirty chips generated marginal NPVs. The minimum selling prices (MSPs) of clean chips from two cases were similar, $45.92 and $45.55 per green metric ton (Mg), with maximum hauling distances (MHDs) of 247 and 250 km (km). The MSPs for dirty chips from four cases ranged from $34.38 to $37.47 per Mg with the range of MHDs from 184 to 351 km. MSP and sensitivity analyses suggest that the selling prices and harvesting production levels of clean chips and dirty chips, and purchase prices of forestry logging equipment are the key factors that most influence the profitability of the regional forest biomass feedstock supply chain. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Co3O4 (5%) was obtained to reduce the thermal decomposition range to 260–450°C and reduce the pyrolysis interval ∆T to 46.2°C. Through the development of three metals (Fe, Mg, and Mn), under four mass fractions (2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%) mixed with Co3O4 (5%), the results of the effective oxygen production efficiency test for the thermal decomposition reaction of sodium chlorate demonstrated that Mn (6%)–Co3O4 (5%) exhibited the best catalytic and heat coupling effect; the effective oxygen production efficiency of 97.8% was achieved. Oxygen candle oxygen supply experiment was conducted; the oxygen candle composition for the test was determined to be NaClO3 (86%), Mn (6%), Co3O4 (5%), and kaolin (3%); in the four stages of the oxygen candle oxygen supply reaction test, the average oxygen supply rate reached 1.647 L/min, actual oxygen production was 28 L, and effective oxygen production rate of the oxygen candle was 53.6%. An increase of 9% was observed compared to the previous similar studies.

We also checked the carcinogenic risk (CR), non-carcinogenic risk (Hazard Index (HI) and Hazard Quotient (HQ)), and pollution index (PI) for the studied canned tuna samples. As and Se concentrations in all groups are above the intake values set by FAO/WHO considering specific groups.

The pollution index (PI) results show that the main canned tuna fish contaminant is aluminum, then selenium and arsenic, respectively. Only half of the samples did not present elemental contaminant levels. All studied brands of canned tuna presented elemental concentrations that could pose a health risk to human consumption, that could be from CR, HQ, HI, or PI. The contaminant levels are alarming and should raise a red flag for the intake of these products, especially a long-term one.

However, dryland vegetation attenuates surface friction velocities, and soil crusting reduces the supply of loose erodible material and increases surface resistance to abrasion. Under such conditions, variability in saltation bombardment efficiency and intensity could have a large effect on dust PSDs. We present dust emission measurements from vegetated, supply‐limited aeolian systems that indicate the dependence of emission‐flux PSD on wind friction velocity. We find the fine fraction (&lt;5 μm) of dust particles increases with friction velocity. Results suggest models that assume wind‐invariance of the emission‐flux PSD may not be generalizable for crusted soils with vegetation.

To reduce the head loss and energy consumption, a new type of filter for treating surface water – the pre-pump micro-pressure filter was proposed. The pre-pump micro-pressure filter was studied, and physical model tests on the flow rate, water separator type, and filter screen area were conducted under clean water conditions. Statistical and dimensional analysis methods were used to analyze the test results. Our results showed that the order of the factors affecting the head loss of the filter was flow rate &amp;gt; water separator type &amp;gt; filter screen area. The various water separator types showed no significant differences in terms of head loss, while the different flow rates showed significant differences. A head loss prediction model was constructed, and the coefficient of determination R2 reached 0.987. Our results can provide technical support for new filter development and enrich the theory of micro-pressure filtration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. We present results from the FAOSTAT agri-food systems emissions database, relative to 236 countries and territories and over the period 1990–2019. We find that in 2019, world-total food systems emissions were 16.5 billion metric tonnes (Gt CO2eq yr−1), corresponding to 31 % of total anthropogenic emissions. Of the agri-food systems total, global emissions within the farm gate –from crop and livestock production processes including on-farm energy use—were 7.2 Gt CO2eq yr−1; emissions from land use change, due to deforestation and peatland degradation, were 3.5 Gt CO2eq yr−1; and emissions from pre- and post-production processes –manufacturing of fertilizers, food processing, packaging, transport, retail, household consumption and food waste disposal—were 5.8 Gt CO2eq yr−1. Over the study period 1990–2019, agri-food systems emissions increased in total by 17 %, largely driven by a doubling of emissions from pre- and post-production processes. Conversely, the FAO data show that since 1990 land use emissions decreased by 25 %, while emissions within the farm gate increased only 9 %. In 2019, in terms of single GHG, pre- and post- production processes emitted the most CO2 (3.9 Gt CO2 yr−1), preceding land use change (3.3 Gt CO2 yr−1) and farm-gate (1.2 Gt CO2 yr−1) emissions. Conversely, farm-gate activities were by far the major emitter of methane (140 Mt CH4 yr−1) and of nitrous oxide (7.8 Mt N2O yr−1). Pre-and post- processes were also significant emitters of methane (49 Mt CH4 yr−1), mostly generated from the decay of solid food waste in landfills and open-dumps. The most important trend over the 30-year period since 1990 highlighted by our analysis is the increasingly important role of food-related emissions generated outside of agricultural land, in pre- and post-production processes along food supply chains, at all scales from global, regional and national, from 1990 to 2019. In fact, our data show that by 2019, food supply chains had overtaken farm-gate processes to become the largest GHG component of agri-food systems emissions in Annex I parties (2.2 Gt CO2eq yr−1). They also more than doubled in non-Annex I parties (to 3.5 Gt CO2eq yr−1), becoming larger than emissions from land-use change. By 2019 food supply chains had become the largest agri-food system component in China (1100 Mt CO2eq yr−1); USA (700 Mt CO2eq yr−1) and EU-27 (600 Mt CO2eq yr−1). This has important repercussions for food-relevant national mitigation strategies, considering that until recently these have focused mainly on reductions of non-CO2 gases within the farm gate and on CO2 mitigation from land use change. The information used in this work is available as open data at: https://zenodo.org/record/5615082 (Tubiello et al., 2021d). It is also available to users via the FAOSTAT database (FAO, 2021a), with annual updates.\n                        </jats:p>"

A Bayesian game accounting for asymmetric information is established to optimize the CM’s outsourcing price and the OEM’s selling price. A Stackelberg game incorporating yield and demand uncertainties is subsequently modelled to optimize the CM’s production quantity and the OEM’s order quantity. Finally, a shortage penalty with surplus purchase contract is proposed to coordinate the supply chain. It is found that the optimal outsourcing price is either the lower limit or the stationary point of the common price domain, while the optimal selling price is the upper limit. Whether the CM adopts a conservative or an aggressive production strategy depends on the threshold of the outsourcing price. Moreover, the coordination contract offers great flexibility in parameter selection. By setting the order quantity, penalty price and surplus purchase price properly, the supply chain can realize a win-win situation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Among various climate drivers, direct evidence for the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) control of sediment supply on the millennium scale is lacking, and the changes in ITCZ migration demonstrated in paleoclimate records need to be better investigated. Here, we use clay minerals and Sr-Nd isotopes obtained from a gravity core on the Ninetyeast Ridge to track the corresponding source variations and analyze the relationship between terrestrial material supplementation and climatic changes. On the glacial-interglacial scale, chemical weathering weakened during the North Atlantic cold climate periods, and falling sea level hindered the transport of smectite into the study area due to the exposure of islands. However, the influence of the South Asian monsoon on the sediment supply was not obvious on the millennium scale. We suggest that the north-south migration of the ITCZ controlled the rainfall in Myanmar and further directly determined the supply of clay minerals on the millennium scale because the transport of smectite was highly connected with ITCZ location. Furthermore, the regional shift of the ITCZ induced an abnormal increase in the smectite percentage during the late Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in our records. The smectite percentage in the studied core is similar to distinct ITCZ records in different time periods, revealing that regional changes in the ITCZ were significantly obvious, and that the ITCZ is not a simple N-S displacement and closer connections occurred between the Northern-Southern Hemispheres in the eastern Indian Ocean during the late Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).\n                        </jats:p>"

This paper studies the multi-product pricing and green product design strategies under different supply chain structures and government subsidy strategies. Considering different channel leadership, we establish the centralized (C), manufacturer-led (MS), and retailer-led (RS) supply chain models, respectively. By applying a game-theoretical approach, corresponding equilibrium pricing, green product design, and government subsidy decisions under different supply chain structures are obtained. Through comparison and numerical analysis, we find that: (1) the different subsidy strategies of the government have an important impact on green product development. When the government provides a uniform subsidy strategy, a RS supply chain can bring greener product, more market demands, more profit, and more social welfare; (2) when the government provides a differentiated subsidy strategy, MS and RS supply chain structures can bring greener product and more market demand than the centralized supply chain. They can also bring the same social welfare and the same product to the green design level. However, the MS supply chain structure can bring more profit for the firm; (3) the consumers’ green awareness positively impacts the design and development of green product. Therefore, it is beneficial for the firm to adopt reasonable measures to boost the environmental awareness of consumers in order to realize the sustainable development of our society.</jats:p>"

Pot experiments with drought-tolerant shrub Calligonum caput-medusae supplied with water at five field capacities in the range of 30–85% were conducted using local soil at the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert. We examined the changes in plant biomass, soil N status, and plant N traits, and addressed the relationships between them in four- and seven-month-old saplings and mature shrubs after 28 months. Results showed that the growth of C. caput-medusae was highly responsive to increased soil moisture supply, and strongly depleted the soil available inorganic N pools from 16.7 mg kg−1 to an average of 1.9 mg kg−1, although the total soil N pool increased in all treatments. Enhancement of biomass production by increasing water supply was closely linked to increasing total plant N pool, N use efficiency (NUE), N resorption efficiency (NRE), and proficiency (NRP) in four-month saplings, but that to total plant N pool, NRE, and NRP after 28 months. The well-watered plants had lower N concentrations in senesced branches compared to their counterparts experiencing the two lowest water inputs. The mature shrubs had higher NRE and NRP than saplings and the world mean levels, suggesting a higher N conservation. Structural equation models showed that NRE was largely controlled by senesced branch N concentrations, and indirectly affected by water supply, whereas NRP was mainly determined by water supply. Our results indicated that increasing water availability increased the total N uptake and N resorption from old branches to satisfy the N requirement of C. caput-medusae. The findings lay important groundwork for vegetation establishment in desert ecosystems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a model to assess the value of a distributor in a dynamic stochastic cooperative advertising supply chain in which a manufacturer wholesales its product to a distributor who in turn sells it to a retailer. Moreover and importantly, the distributor also intermediates the pricing and advertising decisions between the manufacturer and the retailer. For the resulting three‐player hierarchical game formulation of the supply chain, we characterize the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium in terms of a system of coupled algebraic equations and show it to admit a unique solution. We find that the value added by the distributor to the supply chain depends critically on the nature of the demand function for the product, a result that has practical implications for the kinds of product where having a distributor is most desirable. Second, our model indicates that the presence of the distributor can enhance the margins of both the retailer and the manufacturer relative to the case of no distributor, and provide explicit conditions for this to occur. Third, we present numerical analysis that indicates that if the distributor generates sufficiently large transportation cost savings, then the three‐echelon supply chain can lead in the long run to higher market awareness, lower advertising expenditure, and higher value extracted, relative to the two‐echelon model. Finally, in addition to retailer advertising that is subsidized by the manufacturer, we also provide the manufacturer an option to do national advertising and show its viability. </jats:p>",

Among AM processes, PBF yields excellent dimensional accuracy, and the built parts can be applied to molding dies and topology-optimized parts. Furthermore, PBF can be used to build porous structures. In this study, a highly functional die casting method was established using PBF, which involved a release agent supplied through the porous structure to the surface of the proposed die. The arrangement of the porous structure made it possible to apply the release agent to the deep groove, which is not possible using a spray as in conventional supply methods. The laser-irradiated area was visualized to confirm pore formation, and the building conditions of the porous structure suitable to supply the release agent were investigated. The resulting die casting characteristics were evaluated. Considering the obtained results, guidelines to build dies or molds for die casting with porous structures are recommended. The amount of release agent could be controlled at each position of the die casting die, and the melted Al alloy did not penetrate the porous structure. In addition, the obtained Al alloy casting did not exhibit any castability defects. Moreover, suitable control of the supply of the release agent enabled enhancement of the die casting characteristics.</jats:p>",

SIPAN undergo fusion events, rapidly exchange proteasome particles with the surrounding milieu and quickly dissolve following amino acid replenishment.

Using ANSYS FLUENT software and different inflow conditions (e.g., pressure, velocity, sediment concentration, and sand particle diameter), internal turbulent multiphase flow and sand deposition were simulated by the Eulerian multiphase flow model. Particle erosion in the labyrinth channel was calculated by the Discrete Phase Model (DPM). The results show that vortex movements and shear actions at the boundary layer cause self-flushing in the channel. The location of sand particle deposits and the turbulent dissipation rate are related to the operating pressure, which is optimal at 300 kPa. The erosion rate of the channel wall is proportional to the inflow sediment concentration but has no obvious relationship with inflow velocity. Based on the movement regulation of sand particles in the labyrinth channel, recommendations on filtration requirements and operating pressure of irrigation systems are proposed.</jats:p>",

This paper constructs the centralized model and the decentralized models, respectively, and studies the emission reduction and revenue distribution strategies of construction supply chain considering fairness concern and cap-and-trade. Numerical analysis is carried out to analyze the influence of cap-and-trade and fairness concern on the optimal decision and the maximum profit of construction supply chain. This paper shows that, under cap-and-trade policy, the centralized model has the best emission reduction effect and the highest supply chain profit without fairness concern, while the general contractor’s Stackelberg model has the best emission reduction effect and the highest supply chain profit with fairness concern. In the two scenarios, the Vertical Nash model is the most unfavorable to emission reduction, and it will also seriously damage the interests of enterprises. In practice, supply chain should choose the general contractor’s Stackelberg model and avoid the Vertical Nash model. Because fairness concern of the subcontractor will damage the supply chain profits and emission reduction performance, the general contractor shall try to select the subcontractor with lower fairness concern to avoid the loss of profit. Besides, enterprises should actively take measures to reduce fairness concern, such as enterprises signing the contract price confidentiality clause, which aims to reduce fairness concern of the subcontractor. The results of this paper can not only enrich the research content of construction supply chain management, but also provide references for the government to formulate emission reduction policies.</jats:p>",

In this thesis, a case study of the traceability of agricultural products is to explain a traceability solution of agricultural products supply chain based on blockchain and IPFS. The latter one is used to store large quantities of transactions data; and the former one is used for the safety of data storage and circulation. And consumers can know the quality of agricultural products in the shortest time through the evaluation function. As shown in the experiment, the solution is more efficient and secure compared with existing supply chain traceability methods, meeting the traceability requirements of security, transparency, and reliability. Furthermore, the traceability, safety, and performance of the scheme are also analyzed here.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Logistics distribution is the terminal link that connects the manufacturer and product user and determines the efficiency of the manufacturer’s service. Therefore, the disruption risk of the joint system is an essential factor affecting the product user experience. In this paper, while considering the product user’s supply disruption risk preference (PUSDRP), a biobjective integer nonlinear programming (INLP) model with subjective cost-utility is proposed to solve the manufacturer’s combined location routing inventory problem (CLRIP). According to the user’s time satisfaction requirement, a routing change selection framework (RCSF) is designed based on the bounded rational behavior of the user. Additionally, the Lagrange Relaxation and Modified Genetic Algorithm (LR-MGA) is proposed. The LR method relaxes the model, and the MGA finds a compromise solution. The experimental results show that the biobjective cost-utility model proposed in this paper is effective and efficient. The RCSF based on user behavior is superior to the traditional expected utility theory model. The compromise solution provides a better solution for the manufacturer order allocation delivery combinatorial optimization problem. The compromise solution not only reduces the manufacturer’s total operating cost but also improves the user's subjective utility. To improve the stability of cooperation between manufacturers and users, the behavior decision-making method urges manufacturers to consider product users’ supply disruption risk preferences (PUSDRPs) in attempting to optimize economic benefits for the long term. This paper uses behavior decision-making methods to expand the ideas of the CLRIP joint system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management (SCM) involves an interconnected structure of facilities that produces elements or compounds for transforming into a semifinished compound. After completion, the final compound is delivered to customers via a distribution system. Owing to ever-changing customer demands, increasingly efficient and resilient SCM is necessary, which requires support from the latest technologies. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of the latest technologies in SCM and logistics. The management of a supply chain and role of the different actors involved differ from industry to industry and company to company. Consequently, SCM has become a crucial issue to manufacturers, professionals and researchers. The latest technologies identified in this paper include radio frequency identification, vehicular ad hoc networks, the Internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence and blockchain. Moreover, the application of the aforementioned technologies in different industries and systems is discussed to understand how the technologies impact practitioners. Although not discussed thoroughly, other recent technology trends in SCM and logistics, such as machine learning, autonomous vehicles/drones, advanced analytics, cloud logistics, supergrid logistics, anticipatory logistics, omnichannel logistics and additive manufacturing (3D printing), are also highlighted in this paper. By understanding the advancements in SCM technology, the possible direction of future innovations can be effectively planned and articulated.</jats:p>"

By constructing the information entropy and the equilibrium degree model of industrial land-use structure, this study evaluates the transfer characteristics of industrial land of different functional types in various provinces of China, analyzes the scale advantages of various types of transferred industrial land by using the land transfer scale advantage index, and summarizes the spatial distribution characteristics of different types of industrial land transfer in China through the spatial center of gravity analysis and cold/hot spot regional distribution mapping. The following results were obtained. (1) There are significant differences in the transfer scale of industrial land among provinces in China. The transfer scale of Eastern and Central China is large, whereas that of Western China is small. (2) From the perspective of land-use structure, the transfer scale of industrial land in the central and western regions is more balanced than that in the east. (3) From the gravity center distribution of the standard deviation ellipse, the land transfer direction of the energy industry, and the mining industry, and other types of industries is more significant than that of the culture and sports hygiene industries, modern manufacturing industry, and high-tech industry. (4) From the analysis of cold and hot spots, the mining industry, the energy industry, and other types of industries in the western region with rich mineral resources are the hot spots of industrial land transfer, and the southeast coast is the cold spot; the eastern coastal area is a hot area for land transfer of modern manufacturing, the high-tech industry, and the culture and sports hygiene industries. The results reveal the regional differences and spatial distribution characteristics of industrial transfer in China and provide a reference for authorities to formulate industrial planning and industrial land collection, storage, and transfer plans.</jats:p>"
