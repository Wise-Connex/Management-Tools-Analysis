      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the North Atlantic regional (<jats:italic>NAR</jats:italic>) study the supply model was designed to complement the demand model. The level of complexity of the supply model was developed from a balance of limits of resources and time available and the need to capture certain characteristics of the system. The resulting model is a mathematical programing model minimizing efficiency costs expressed in annual terms. Those cost curves that are nonlinear are approximated by using piecewise linear functions. It is a static annual model based on a critical period analysis and selected risk levels. The model incorporates the cost curves for supply from the headwater and mainstream storage, groundwater, desalting for 50 subbasins of the planning area and for selected interbasin transfer possibilities. Hydrologic and in‐stream use constraints are incorporated. The costs are minimized subject to meeting these and the set of demand constraints. The model produces a configuration of supplies for the 50 subbasins to meet the particular demand sets produced by analyzing the demand model. Objectives other than efficiency can be reflected to some extent through manipulation of the objective function and the constraints.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Brains of mammals are supplied by paired internal carotid arteries and also by paired vertebral arteries. The internal carotids distribute to the forebrain with its developing neopallium. The hindbrain with the expanding cerebellum and newly acquired middle cerebellar peduncle are supplied by the vertebral‐basilar system. In the opossum and armadillo the caudal rami of the internal carotid arteries resemble the patterns seen in submammals. The major source of blood to the posterior cerebral arteries is variable, coming from the basilar, the internal carotids or both. The ventral arterial circle (circulus arteriosus) is open as there is no anterior communicating artery in the two forms described. With the increase in size of the lateral lobes, the cerebellum of lower mammals is sufficiently larger and better developed to require a pair of inferior cerebellar arteries in addition to the phylogenetically older superior cerebellar arteries which originate from the basilar trunks. The latter are formed by the bifurcation of the basilar artery. The tectum in these forms is supplied by branches from the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries as well as tectal rami arising from the basilar trunks. Branches of the basilar artery going to the brainstem have a branching pattern similar to that seen in the submammals.</jats:p><jats:p>The intrinsic patterns in both the opssum and armadillo are essentially like those observed in all vertebrates. They are remarkably constant and are easily recognized from one form to another. The arterioles penetrating the armadillo brain terminate in a continuous capillary plexus like the intrinsic plexuses observed in most of the submammals as well as in all mammals except marsupials. Arterioles penetrating the brain of the American opossum, as well as of all other marsupials, do not form a capillary plexus but terminate in capillary loops. Every penetrating arteriole is accompanied by a venule; each pair of vessels terminates in one or more capillary loops, thus constituting a true end‐system. However, as in the rest of its body, capillaries in the infundibular process and stalk, choroid plexuses, area postrema, supraoptic crest and subfornical organ are not paired but form freely anastomosing plexuses.</jats:p><jats:p>The major developmental advance, i.e., the “mammalian shift,” in the blood supply to brains of primitive mammals is the addition of the vertebral arteries to supply the brainstem and an inferior cerebellar branch going to the cerebellum. The implications of these phylogenetic changes are discussed and related to the functional development.</jats:p>",

To investigate the use of existing and supplemental water supplies, the operation of the canal was simulated by using detailed data on the water used during ship transits, the storage capability of the reservoir system serving the canal, the hydropower capability of each reservoir, the operating constraints for shipping, the anticipated municipal water supply diversion, the historical shipping use, the economics of shipping, the hydropower production, and the supplemental water supplies. Canal operation for different operation criteria and different shipping levels was used with chronological run‐off data for simulation.

Further growth is by centrifugal spread; the basal endometrium is stretched and no new arteries are tapped. In <jats:italic>Cercopithecoidea</jats:italic> the placenta has a sharp border from early on. Spread with stretching of the underlying endometrium occurs here, too. Additional arteries running in this stretched endometrium are secondarily tapped and increase the total number. The disc of <jats:italic>Hominoidea</jats:italic>, remaining after formation of the chorion laeve, also stretches the underlying decidua, but then trophoblast pervades much of it until it taps arteries in a much larger area than in the other forms.</jats:p>",

The computer model of canal operation and the use of reservoir rule curves to provide operational criteria are presented. The use of simulated runoff to investigate canal operation under other synthetic chronological streamflow traces with the same statistical characteristics as those of the historical sequence are discussed.</jats:p>",
