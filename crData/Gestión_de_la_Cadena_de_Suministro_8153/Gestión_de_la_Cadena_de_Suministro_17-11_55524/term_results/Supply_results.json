Producers? Both? The chapter demonstrates that market prices and quantities occur where consumers and producers come together in the market as represented by the market supply and demand curves. The chapter shows how changes in demand and supply will affect prices and quantities in the market. Using the demand and supply framework, the chapter analyzes the expected impact of a proposed tax on sugar sweetened beverages to decrease caloric intake. The chapter ends with a demonstration and discussion of the effects of multiple changes in demand or supply on the market equilibrium prices and quantities.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Small businesses are seen as the impetus behind a country’s economic growth. The South African government’s continued commitment to prioritise the development of small businesses, the promising rise of the retail sector in South Africa and the substantial contribution of small businesses to trade, business services, personal services and construction make the small retailers a force to be reckoned with. Businesses often fail because of a lack of strategic fit between the competitive and supply chain strategies. It is imperative that the supply chain design, resources and processes provide the necessary capabilities to support the desired competitive strategy. Managing the three logistical supply chain drivers of facilities, inventory and transportation can contribute to achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply chain strategy. The logistical supply chain drivers should not only be managed as a cohesive unit, but should also be aligned with the orientation of the selected supply chain strategy, in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency.Objective: The objective of this article is to provide guidelines from literature that small business retailers can use in managing their logistical supply chain drivers to be aligned with the orientation of their selected supply chain strategy in terms of responsiveness and cost-efficiency.Method: An extensive literature review was conducted pertaining to the management of the three logistical supply chain drivers by small retailers.Results: It was determined that small responsive retailers typically order inventory on a frequent basis, hold excess inventory, provide customers with a seamless in-store experience and are located close to their customers. These responsive retailers make use of direct delivery from suppliers (and to customers) to increase their flexibility and reduce lead times. On the other hand, small cost-efficient retailers typically do not hold excess inventory, and their stores are usually located further away from customers. These cost-efficient retailers take advantage of both economies of scale when purchasing inventory and economies of distance when transporting inventory.Conclusion: Literature guidelines with regard to the management of the logistical supply chain drivers are provided to assist small retailers in achieving a strategic fit between the selected competitive strategy and supply chain strategy.</jats:p>"

The analytics of profit maximization when the firm operates in a competitive environment and is a price taker are then presented. The chapter determines the rule that guides production in order to maximize profit when the firm is a price taker. This analysis leads to a derivation of the firm’s (farm’s) supply curve. The chapter also explains what factors may cause a shift in the supply curve. The chapter explains the difference then between the supply curve and the supply function for a commodity. The chapter closes by emphasizing the main point of this chapter: any consideration of growing alternative commodities must consider revenue <italic>and</italic> cost differences.</p>",

In this study, we formulated water supply uncertainties and then evaluated risks related to droughts and sudden water pollution. A case study was then performed with the Danjiangkou Reservoir and emergency operation rules were proposed for water supply in dry seasons through the trial and error method. The results show that the reservoir inflow and water pollution location have a significant effect on emergency operations for water supply. However, insufficient reservoir inflow can make the situation worse, resulting in a reduction or even cessation of water supply and consequently enormous economic losses. The water supply problem could be alleviated to some extent with the increase of distance between the pollution location and the reservoir release gate. The proposed emergency operation rules considering forecast uncertainties and risks resulting from potential droughts and sudden water pollution may provide important insights into reservoir water supply in dry seasons.</jats:p>",

In the past, the uncertainties of food production too often have led to food insecurity, and the future holds further uncertainties posed by climate change. Rapid urbanization in developing countries is changing where vegetables are grown and how they are made available to consumers. The depopulation of the land means that farming will have to become more efficient and less labour intensive. There is agreement among agricultural scientists that the way forward is to increase the productivity of farmland everywhere and to do this sustainably, reducing the impact of agriculture on the environment. The chapter then looks at how government policies play pivotal roles in global food production, as well as the importance of agricultural research and biotechnology.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Supply chains have more and more become global supply chains, due to which it becomes increasingly more difficult for states to monitor whether the production process of goods entering the territory has been free of labour rights abuses. States are less able to hold corporate entities accountable that are knowingly or unknowingly benefiting from labour rights abuses. Transparency measures have been suggested as a way to close this accountability gap and circumvent traditional issues of enforcement when production and consumption of goods takes place in different jurisdictions. This paper discusses whether transparency measures live up to these expectations by assessing the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (California Act). We analyse whether the Act does indeed contribute to greater accountability by filling the existing information gap between companies and consumers. The workings of the Act, as well as its impact on primary stakeholders will be determined. The paper discusses action taken by companies, consumers and non‐governmental organizations by looking at the degree to which the new California Act generated differences in behaviour and practices of these affected parties. Based on this information the question is answered which possibilities and limitations are connected to the use of transparency measures in combatting the abuse of labour rights in the global supply chain. It is discussed which lessons can be learned from the California Act and which policy implications this could have for future transparency measures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Business negotiations constitute a key element of supply chain interactions that can create additional value for both the buyer and supplier. However, negotiations can also render the parties vulnerable to deception. While a large body of knowledge on buyer–supplier relationships exists, research on deception and bounded ethicality in supply chain relationships is still nascent. We advance this new research stream in behavioral supply chain management by first <jats:italic>conceptualizing</jats:italic> two types of deception—bluffs and lies. Departing from previous content‐dependent conceptualizations/definitions, we define both as convention‐dependent, norms‐based constructs: Bluffs (lies) are deceptions that are palatable (unpalatable) to both parties in a buyer–supplier negotiation. Second, studies 1 and 2 of our article employ Q methodology and best–worst scaling to <jats:italic>operationalize</jats:italic> bluffs while refining the construct of a lie. Third, a correlational study (study 3) examines the <jats:italic>psychological properties/cognition</jats:italic> of a negotiator who lies, bluffs, or does neither (i.e., communicates honestly). Fourth, a behavioral experiment (study 4) investigates the <jats:italic>psychological consequences</jats:italic> of bluffs, lies, and honesty for the targets. Bluffers (liars) show low (high) degrees of moral disengagement. Targets of bluffs experience high degrees of self‐directed anger but are willing to engage in further negotiations with the bluffer, while targets of lies experience high degrees of anger directed at the liar and show a low willingness to further negotiate with the liar. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the dynamics of bluffing and lying in buyer–supplier negotiations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This paper will discuss about the design of a portable photo voltaic electric generator capable of tracking sunlight in all directions. Such power generator is designed for disaster affected area with power outage, such as during major floods like Jakarta in 2012, or strong earthquake such as Yogyakarta in 2006 and Japan in 2011 (Tohoku) and 2016 (Kumamoto). Such occurence usually results in disruptions of public service, especially power grids. The system consists of a 10 Wp PV solar panels capable in two axes movement, which is 120° horizontal and 360° azimuth movement with ATMega8535 micro controller as the main controller. Two-axis movement is based on two types of sensors, 360° directional movement is based on the HMC5883 compass sensor. This compass sensor panel also be configured to always directs towards the sun so that if the direction of the base plate was changed, it will automatically direct the panel to the direction of the sun. While 120° vertical movement based on three pieces of LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) as sun sensors. The purpose of this system is to maximize the amount of light received by the panel so the panel power output is also maximized so it can generate emergency electrical supply for lighting and other basic needs.</p>"

Attenuation of growth metabolism when NSC content is low could explain why some NSC is conserved through the night. A dynamic model, incorporating diurnal variation in NSC, was developed to simulate growth of seedlings hour-by-hour. I compared predictions of this model to published growth and NSC data for seedlings that varied according to temperature, light, day length, or CO2. Prolonged-darkness experiments showed a temperature dependent upper limit on the respiration capacity. Respiration was attenuated as NSC was depleted. Furthermore, when NSC was high at dawn, inhibition of photosynthesis could attenuate the accumulation of NSC under low temperature, or high light, or high CO2. These concepts were used to simulate plant metabolism and growth rates and diurnal variation of NSC in tomato seedlings under two light levels and various temperatures. Comparison of other results using the same model parameters showed the dynamic model could predict results for starch and starch-less plants, and when growth was affected by CO2 enrichment and day length.</jats:p>"

The authors discussed that appeared trade-offs are a product of established current foreign arrangement, administrative measures provided by the National Bank of Ukraine and range of fundamental variables, which are traditionally significant for Ukrainian economy. By means of FAVAR modeling model of demand and supply equlibrium on non-cash foreign currency was built on empirical data of Ukrainian Interbank Foreign Exchange Market, splitted into the periods, proposed by the authors. Next, it was discussed disconnection properties in the model and shown log-linearized specification of the one. The efficiency of fulfillment hypothesis on decointegrating of the fundamental variables' time series has been provided in form of critical statistics values. Also, instrument of GAP analysis of deviation from equilibrium state was proposed and the further analysis of a regulation style of monetary authority was provided. In conclusion, it was summarized that increased share of the cash out of the banks has significantly jeopardized the price stability in Ukraine and the NBU interventions would become more effective if the flexible foreign exchange rate will be accompanied with flexible regime of inflation targeting.</jats:p>",

Medical and lay public sentiment have become more cautious with respect to prescription opioid use in the past few years, but a comprehensive strategy to reduce our reliance on prescription opioids is lacking. Addressing this epidemic through reductions in unnecessary access to these drugs while implementing measures to reduce demand will be important components of any comprehensive solution. Key supply-side measures include avoiding overprescribing, reducing diversion, and discouraging misuse through changes in drug formulations. Important demand-side measures center around educating patients and clinicians regarding the pitfalls of opioid overuse and methods to avoid unnecessary exposure to these drugs. Anesthesiologists, by virtue of their expertise in the use of these drugs and their position in guiding opioid use around the time of surgery, have important roles to play in reducing patient exposure to opioids and providing education about appropriate use. Aside from the many immediate steps that can be taken, clinical and basic research directed at understanding the interaction between pain and opioid misuse is critical to identifying the optimal use of these powerful pain relievers in clinical practice.</jats:p>",

We use a Stackelberg game to acquire the equilibrium decisions of dual-recycling and single-recycling channels and analyze how cost disruptions affect the manufacturer’ production and collection strategies. We show that, cost disruption of new products produces a positive impact whilst the remanufacturing cost disruption has a negative impact on collection quantity of used products and negative cost disruptions of both new and remanufactured products could be profitable to the manufacturer. As for the manufacturer’s channel choice, the dual-recycling channel dominates single-recycling channels when new product cost faces positive disruption, because the manufacturer acts as both a buyer and a competitor to the collector and can determine an appropriate acquisition price and transfer price to coordinate the online-offline recycling channel. While if cost disruption of new products is negative, the manufacturer prefers the dual-recycling channel instead of single-recycling channels only if the remanufacturing cost faces large size of negative disruption.</jats:p>"

SiO2, (s) and ZnO(s) were dosed as particles to promote charge interactions and/or serve as a nucleus to accelerate floc formation. In the pH range 6–9, SiO2, (s) is negatively charged, while ZnO(s) carries a positive charge. Ca2+ and HPO42− were selected to investigate charge interactions in the water phase. A significant delay in floc growth due to charge repulsion between negatively charged iron species was observed at pHini 9. For positively charged species at pHini 6, a delay in floc growth was observed as well, but to a lesser degree. These effects could be neutralized by either dosing (positively charged) ZnO(s) or Ca2+ at pHini 9, or (negatively charged) SiO2, (s) at pHini 6. The addition of phosphate did not hinder floc growth at pHini 6. While phosphate completely inhibited floc growth at pHini 7–9 in the presence of negatively charged SiO2, (s), the presence of positively charged ZnO(s) partly neutralized the detrimental influence of phosphate on floc growth. Similarly, dosing Ca2+ partly neutralized the effect of phosphate.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we consider reliable supply chain design for biomass collection against feedstock seasonality and time-varying disruption risks. We optimize facility location, inventory, biomass quantity, and shipment decisions in a multi-period planning horizon setting. A real-world case in Hubei, China is studied to offer managerial insights. Our computational results show that: (1) the disruption risk significantly affects both the optimal facility locations and the supply chain cost; (2) no matter how the failure probability changes, setting backup facilities can significantly decrease the total cost; and (3) the feedstock seasonality does not affect locations of the collection facilities, but it affects the allocations of collection facilities and brings higher inventory cost for the biomass supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, few studies have explored this proposition in developing countries. So, in this paper, annual series data from 2000 to 2016 is applied to analyze the relationship between the money supply (M2) and the macroeconomic variables (the real GDP, the inflation rate &amp; the interest rate) under the vector auto regression (VAR) model in China. The purpose of this paper is to verify the impact of these variables on the money supply in China. After performing an empirical analysis, conclusions can be obtained that an increase in the real GDP can result in an increase in the money supply; Also, an increase in the inflation rate can lead to an increase in the money supply; Conversely, an increase in the interest rate can cause a decrease in the money supply. Therefore, via adjusting the change of real GDP, inflation rate and interest rate, a better control of the money supply can be performed for the policy-makers in China.</jats:p>",

Previously, most studies focused mainly on developing technical innovations for delivering sustainable water services and little attention was given to subject areas such as governance, policy implementation, and legislation. Now, water professionals and policy makers are beginning to recognise that efficient services occur when social, political, economic, environmental and technical issues are taken into consideration; hence, subject areas like policy implementation have started receiving attention as well. Thus, many nations such as the UK, Australia, and the USA are constantly aiming to establish best institutional practices for their water sector, while countries such as Nigeria are yet to establish effective policy implementation processes. This research examines the challenge of effective policy implementation in Nigerian urban water utilities. The research showed that policies and legislation developed were of commendable standards, but the implementation process was predominantly hindered by five factors. Hence, these factors will need to be managed actively if the Nigerian urban sector wishes to achieve the intended results from water legislation and policies.</jats:p>",

The EMA is a simple algorithm that can be used by practitioners in the planning and management of WDS. The EMA employs the Jatropha Curcas (JC) tree as a source of oil for fueling water pumps. The EMA is demonstrated on a WDS in Senegal, West Africa, and calculates the level of JC production required to be self-sufficient in fueling the water system to meet drinking, sanitation, and JC irrigation requirements. It was found that the EMA successfully showed that the demonstration WDS can be energy self-sufficient to provide recommended amounts of drinking water for the people and enough irrigation for the JC trees, but only if greywater was used to supplement the irrigation and if a mechanical press was used in lieu of a hand press to extract the oil from the JC leaves. An adequate amount of oil was thus produced to power the required mechanical press as well. Payback periods of significantly less than the life of the required equipment indicate the viability of JC oil as fuel and the feasibility of having an energy independent WDS.</jats:p>",

According to the energy strategies of different countries, various seawater purification techniques such as distillation and reverse osmosis (RO) are used to produce fresh water. Due to the selective separation capability and cost-effective properties, membrane based methods such as RO, electrodialysis, and ultra/micro/nano/filtration are prevalent, especially in Europe. Recently, innovative desalination technologies have been investigated by researchers. Among them, pervaporative separation, in which non-porous membranes are used, appears to be an emerging and promising method. The key part of the system is the membrane. Hence, scientific investigations are focused on the production of high-performance membranes. In this study, non-porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) blend membranes were prepared in different PVDF/PVP ratios and Marmara seawater was desalinated using the pervaporation method at different temperatures. Desalination performance was evaluated as a function of flux and salt retention. The highest salt retention of 99.90% and flux of 1.60 kg/m2.h were obtained at 60 °C when the PVDF/PVP ratio was 1.5.</jats:p>",

We formulate the measurements for carbon emissions of different transportation modes, including air, sea and land transportation. A hybrid genetic algorithm-based optimization approach is developed to handle this problem, in which a hybrid genetic algorithm and heuristic procedures are combined. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by means of various problem instances. We observe that the coordination of production and green transportation has a large effect on the overall supply chain sustainability, which can reduce the total supply chain cost by 9.60% to 21.90%.</jats:p>"

The role of an enhanced coupling of the power, heat and transport sectors in such systems is not yet fully understood. This paper analyses the least-cost composition and operation of a fully renewable power supply system as part of a carbon neutral energy supply in Brazil. It relies on the application of the high-resolution energy system model REMix. Our analysis reveals that the expansion of wind and solar power is more cost-efficient than the construction of additional hydroelectric plants. This is favoured because the existing hydroelectric plants offer large capacity of dispatchable power to compensate for fluctuations, and thus no additional storage is necessary. Furthermore, the REMix analysis indicates that varying shares of solar and wind power technologies as well as the spatial distribution of power generation have only a small influence on supply costs. This implies that the transformation strategy in Brazil can be primarily based on other criteria such as regional development, public acceptance, environmental impact or industrial policy without major impacts on system costs.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a real-time monitoring system that utilizes smartphone-based sensors and a big data platform. Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based sensor to gather temperature, humidity, GPS, and image data. The IoT-generated sensor on the smartphone has characteristics such as a large amount of storage, an unstructured format, and continuous data generation. Thus, in this study, we propose an effective big data platform design to handle IoT-generated sensor data. Furthermore, the abnormal sensor data generated by failed sensors is called outliers and may arise in real cases. The proposed system utilizes outlier detection based on statistical and clustering approaches to filter out the outlier data. The proposed system was evaluated for system and gateway performance and tested on the kimchi supply chain in Korea. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive input/output of sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors and clients increases. The current commercial smartphones are sufficiently capable of combining their normal operations with simultaneous performance as gateways for transmitting sensor data to the server. In addition, the outlier detection based on the 3-sigma and DBSCAN were used to successfully detect/classify outlier data as separate from normal sensor data. This study is expected to help those who are responsible for developing the real-time monitoring system and implementing critical strategies related to the perishable supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the effect of microeconomic variables on stock return with moderating role of money supply (MS). The selected microeconomic variables in this study are debt-to-equity ratio (DE), dividend per share (DPS), and quick ratio (QR). Firm size and book-to-market value are considered as controlling variables. The period of the study is from 2003 to 2012 and the sample population of this study is 300 companies listed on Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Secondary data were collected from DataStream International, financial annual reports, and the World Bank databank. Generalized least squares (GLS) technique was used to estimate the predictive regressions in form of multiple models of panel data sets. According to the findings, MS moderates the impact of DE and QR on stock return, but does not moderate the effect of DPS on stock return. Besides, MS moderates the impact of all selected predictors on stock return. The findings of this study further show that an increase in value of a firm’s debt relative to its equity would cause a decrease in the firm’s stock return. The results also indicate that firms with higher QR and DPS are likely to have a higher stock return. Overall, the findings of this research are consistent with Modigliani and Miller's capital structure theory, as well as Pecking Order and Bird In Hand theory. The findings of this study would be of interest to domestic and international investors, stockbrokers, board of directors, financial managers, and policy makers.</jats:p>"

This data flow is necessary to support critical business decisions that may impact product cost and market share. Current SC information systems are unable to provide validated, pseudo real-time shipment tracking during the distribution phase. This information is available from a single source, often the carrier, and is shared with other stakeholders on an as-needed basis. This paper introduces an independent, crowd-validated, online shipment tracking framework that complements current enterprise-based SC management solutions. The proposed framework consists of a set of private distributed ledgers and a single blockchain public ledger. Each private ledger allows the private sharing of custody events among the trading partners in a given shipment. Privacy is necessary, for example, when trading high-end products or chemical and pharmaceutical products. The second type of ledger is a blockchain public ledger. It consists of the hash code of each private event in addition to monitoring events. The latter provide an independently validated immutable record of the pseudo real-time geolocation status of the shipment from a large number of sources using commuters-sourcing.</jats:p>"

Three factors were proposed, which are information sharing, development programme and outsourcing. A total of 214 sets of questionnaires was completed by owners and firm’s personnel from 13 industrial sectors. The findings from this study revealed that information sharing and development programme have a significant and positive relationship with firms’ performance. Even though outsourcing shows a positive relationship with firms’ performance, but the relationship was not statistically significant.

Plants are characterised by their tolerance to a surplus of this resource and the maximum number of seeds a plant can produce in a year. Interaction among plants is reduced to blocking a part of the resource by the plant’s nearest neighbours. Spatial and temporal conditions are homogeneous. There are no trade-off mechanisms nor immigrants. Plants may suffer from both a lack and too much of the resource. We consider two systems - plants of one type (target plants) and a mixture of two types, where the second type differs from the target ones only by the tolerance to surplus of the resource. We show how the life cycle of a plant depends on its tolerance, on supply of the resource and on how it is affected by the presence of the second type of annuals. We demonstrate that even in such a simple system coexistence of the two species is possible, and we determine the conditions for this. We present also a mean field type approach to the problem, showing that the results from simulations and mean field are quite similar. However the mean field approach cannot answer questions concerning spatial arrangement of plants, like possible formation of niches for different types of plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prefabricated construction is a sustainable alternative to traditional on-site construction methods. However, many challenges still exist in the prefabricated construction process. For example, self-manufacturing or outsourcing decisions are vital to the industrial structure and organization of the prefabricated construction industry, and the company’s production and operation decision-making. This paper considers a prefabricated construction supply chain, which is composed of one upstream component manufacturing company and two downstream contractors. The large contractor can get the precast component through self-manufacturing or outsourcing, while the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) contractor can only buy components from the component manufacturer. A comprehensive game model (Cournot-Stackelberg model) under different decisions, that is, component self-manufacturing or outsourcing, was established. By solving the profit functions of different companies in the prefabricated construction supply chain, the equilibrium solutions of output, price and profit can be achieved. These solutions of equilibrium indicate the optimal decision on the production and operation, and the profit’s boundary conditions. After assuming relevant parameters, the profit levels of the companies in the supply chain are analyzed via a dynamic simulation in the changing process of prefabricated construction market size under different behavioral decisions. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the profit levels of all supply chain enterprises and the whole supply chain are increasing with an increase of market size; (2) the downstream contractors and the whole supply chain have a higher profit level under the component self-manufacturing decision, however, on the contrary, the upstream component suppliers get a higher profit level under the component outsourcing decision; (3) the equilibrium output of the SME contractor is reduced under the outsourcing decision of the large contractor, and the SME contractor is at a disadvantage in market competition, which is particularlyfull of risk when the market size is not big enough, but higher profit level can be expected as the market size increases. According to the results of the game-theoreticanalysis and the numerical simulation, managerial implications are put forward from the angles of extensive publicity, mandatory implementation, strengthening industrial chain integration, and intensifying component factory guidance to promote the development of prefabricated construction. Finally, the main problems which need to be studied further in the future are presented.</jats:p>"

Both the government and non-government organizations are now promoting reverse osmosis based small scale desalination plants (SSDPs) to ensure safe drinking water. The aim of this study was to assess the physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of the desalination plants (DPs) installed in southwest coastal Bangladesh. Water samples were collected from the inlet and outlet of 10 DPs. The product water mostly complied with water quality standards. High levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) in feed water were reduced significantly after the treatment, although 10% and 20% of the product water samples respectively did not comply with the WHO drinking water standards for those parameters. Compliance of product water with the WHO and Bangladesh drinking water standards for chloride, bicarbonate and sodium were found in respectively 80%, 90% and 70% of the samples, although their concentrations in all the feed water samples were higher than both of the standards. About one-third of the DPs did not meet the drinking water standard for sodium, which may be an important health concern for the people consuming this water. Apart from one of the DPs, all of them complied with the standard for faecal coliform and Escherichia coli. Results suggest that proper maintenance of the SSDPs is necessary to ensure safe drinking water for the coastal population of southwest Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

The desalination technologies for agricultural irrigation play a major role in satisfying growing water demands in water scarce regions. Due to stringent ionic concentration standards for agricultural irrigation water, desalination for agriculture is more energy demanding and additional post-treatment is requisite. Reverse osmosis (RO) has emerged as an efficient technology, but the burning of fossil fuels to fulfil the energy requirements is becoming expensive and emission of greenhouse gases is recognized as harmful to the environment. Thus, efforts should be directed towards cost reduction by integrating renewable energy resources into the process. Many of the bench and pilot scale trials like integrated RO with low energy such as forward osmosis (FO), nanofiltration (NF), microfiltration (MF) and solar energy revealed significant improvements in cost savings. However, all these modern technologies have their own problems which can be overcome by further research and development. This paper aims to review the main benefits and constraints associated with desalination technologies for agriculture. The available water resources, the desired qualities of water for agriculture and the challenges and future of desalination in agriculture are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To exploit the extraordinary property of graphene in practical electrical and optical devices, it is necessary to produce large-sized, single-crystal graphene. Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) on polycrystalline Cu surface is a promising scalable route of graphene synthesis but the unavoidable multiple nucleation limits their reachable domain size. Here, we report that effective suppression of nucleation was achieved by only turning off hydrogen supply before introduction of the carbon source for graphene growth. The density of graphene decreased from 72.0 to 2.2 domains/cm2 by turning off hydrogen for 15 min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy studies show that the Cu surface was covered with 3–4 nm thick highly crystalline Cu2O, which would be caused by oxidation by residual oxidative gasses in the chamber during the turning off period. It was also revealed that elevating the temperature in Ar followed by annealing in H2/Ar before turning off hydrogen led to the enlargement of the Cu domain, resulting in the further suppression of nucleation. By optimizing such growth parameters in the CVD process, a single-crystal graphene with ~2.6 mm in diameter was successfully obtained.</jats:p>"

The investment feasibility analysis and the potential for potable water savings were obtained by means of computer simulation. The potential for potable water savings ranged from 26.70% to 64.70%. The net present value, internal rate of return and payback period for the best scenario were, respectively, R$132,801.47, 3.73% per month and 32 months. For the worst scenario the net present value was R$9,451.26, the internal rate of return was 0.91% per month and the payback period was 166 months.

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. The study population was the 13 county governments with annual budgetary allocation of Ksh 8 Billion and above in Kenya; the respondents were the procurement officers of these counties. 181 procurement officers were selected using simple random sampling and were issued with questionnaires. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analysed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Multiple regression model was used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analysed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.Results: First, in regard to key performance indicators, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.537 on performance of county governments. Second in regard to monitoring and evaluation, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.097 on performance of county governments. With regard to the third objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.067 on performance of county governments. Lastly, in regard to the fourth objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.080 on performance of county governments.Conclusion: Based on the study findings, the study concludes that performance of county governments can be improved by key performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation, balanced scorecard and governance structures.Policy recommendation: Existing literature indicates that as a future avenue of research, there is need to undertake similar research in other institutions and public sector organizations in Kenya and other countries in order to establish whether the explored practices herein can be generalized to affect performance in public entities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the irrigated agricultural regions in Europe are supplied by surface irrigation networks managed by local water authorities (WAs). Under such conditions, WAs are not able to fully monitor water usage and farmers have an information advantage vis-a-vis the WA. This results in the water authority suffering ‘pricing failure’ if it decides to apply an incentive pricing strategy (tariffs proportional to the alleged water uses). Indeed, farmers could exploit their information advantage by behaving in an opportunistic manner, withdrawing more water than declared, and ultimately paying less than they should. This situation could also undermine the efficacy and the efficiency of the WA incentive pricing strategies. This paper analyses incentive water pricing schemes under asymmetric information by the means of a Principal-Agent model. The Agency problem between the WA and farmers is addressed by introducing a monitoring strategy that would enable the WA to detect farms action. In doing so, we compare incentive strategies with flat rate water pricing and investigate under what conditions the WA might provide/not provide incentive water pricing in the absence of water metering.</jats:p>"

We conducted two series of experiments. In the first series toxic lesion was caused by a single intragastric administration of acetaminophen suspension in 2 % starch solution to animals in a dose of 1250 mg/kg (1/2 LD50). In the second series the suspension of acetaminophen in 2 % starch solution in a dose of 55 mg/kg was given. Non-genetic form of experimental type 2 diabetes mellitus was modeled by a single intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin solution in doses 65 mg/kg, which was diluted by citrate buffer (pH 4.5) with the previous intraperitoneal nicotinamide administration in doses of 230 mg/kg. Rats, which were given the same amount of solvent (citrate buffer pH 4.5), were used as the control group.Results and Discussion.

Economic factors comprising market forces, cost of inputs, the macro economy and the cost of funding are one set of factors that impacts on the funding of the supply-side of housing.  Financiers’ reactionary actions to encourage uptake of credit is undertaken by use of innovation and technology. This paper sets to establish the relationships between both economic and innovative factors, and funding of the supply-side of housing in Kenya and also the moderating effect of the major stakeholders. Using an explanatory form of approach in research design a survey was conducted using questionnaires to collect data from a random sample of 212 branches in Nairobi of financial institutions drawn from a population of 43 commercial banks, 9 deposit-taking MFIs and three major financiers of housing. Factor analysis, correlation analysis and ordinal logit regression were used to determine the relationships. A negative relationship between economic factors and funding of housing was found, while innovative financing and technological factors were found to have no influence. A positive moderating effect of stakeholders on the relationships between both economic factors, and innovative financing and technological factors on one side, and funding of housing was established. The implication being that economic factors play a bigger role in impacting housing and a stable economy is conducive in encouraging investments in housing, with government acting more as an enabler. Innovative financing and technology act as facilitators only.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is to analyze different types of supply chain uncertainties and suggest strategies to deal with unexpected contingencies to deliver superior operational performance (OP) using symmetrical and asymmetrical modeling approaches. The data were collected through a survey given to 146 supply chain managers within the fast moving consumer goods industry in Thailand. Symmetrical modeling is applied via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in order to assess the theoretical relationships among the latent variables, while asymmetrical modeling is applied via fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to emphasize their combinatory causal relation. The empirical results support the theory by highlighting the mediating effect of supply chain strategy (SCS) in the relation between supply chain uncertainty (SCU) and firms’ OP and, hence, deliver business sustainability for the firms, demonstrating that the choice of SCS should not be an “either-or” decision. This research contributes by providing an illustration of a PLS-SEM and fsQCA based estimation for the rapidly emerging field of sustainable supply chain management. This study provides empirical support for resource dependence theory (RDT) in explaining the relation between SCU and SCS, which leads to sustainable OP. From a methodological standpoint, this study also illustrates predictive validation testing of models using holdout samples and testing for causal asymmetry.</jats:p>"

The main aim of this study was to analyse the supply response of milk producers to various economic and non-economic factors. The specific objectives were to determine the responsiveness of milk supply in Swaziland to price and its substitute price (milk powder) and to examine the responsiveness of milk producers to non-economic factors such as rainfall, technology and dairy cattle inventory. The study used time series data from 2010 to 2014 and each year was given in months in-order to have 60 data points. Several techniques relevant for analysing time series data were employed, which included testing for stationarity of the data, checking if the independent variables if are able to explain the dependent variable (cointegration), running the long-run regression, then dropping some of the residuals which were not significant, after which the Vector Error-Correction Model and the diagnostic tests were conducted. Such analysis included the formal test for stationarity. The Johansen cointegration test was used which provided evidence of cointegration between Milk Output and its determinants. The long-run regression results revealed that Milk Powder Output and Milk Powder Price are significant in determining milk response in the long-run in Swaziland with the elasticities of -0.48 and -0.92 respectively, while the short-run coefficients were-0.21 and -0.70 respectively. Both variable were significant at 1% in the short-run and only the Milk Output was significant at 5% (P&gt;0.05) in the short-run. The Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) came out with the correct -0.129 implying that only 12.9% of the shocks will be adjusted back to the long-run path within a month. The study therefore, recommended that the Swaziland Government should promote local market share and purpose policies to decrease the country’s reliance to imported dairy products, which negatively affects economic development.</jats:p>"

Forty unopened bottled water samples, of different trademarks, were collected from various localities in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia and analyzed for fungal contamination: (1) immediately after opening the bottles; and (2) after closing and storing them for 180 and 365 days. The fungal species were identified under a compound microscope followed by molecular sequencing. At least one fungal species were found in 58% of the bottles. In total, 18 fungal species belonging to 11 fungal genera were identified. Rhizopus nigricans and seven different species of Aspergillus were found to frequently contaminate the bottled water samples. Penicillium sp. were found in one sample. The 180 days storage of opened and reclosed bottles did not substantially affect the abundance of fungi or the species found. Some of the fungi identified may be pathogenic and the contamination of fungi in bottled water should be considered during the processing of water.</jats:p>",

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. The study population was the 13 county governments with annual budgetary allocation of Ksh 8 Billion and above in Kenya; the respondents were the procurement officers of these counties. 181 procurement officers were selected using simple random sampling and were issued with questionnaires. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analysed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Multiple regression model was used to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated was keyed in and analysed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.Results: First, in regard to key performance indicators, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.537 on performance of county governments. Second in regard to monitoring and evaluation, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.097 on performance of county governments. With regard to the third objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.067 on performance of county governments. Lastly, in regard to the fourth objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.080 on performance of county governments.Conclusion: Based on the study findings, the study concludes that performance of county governments can be improved by key performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation, balanced scorecard and governance structures.Policy recommendation: Existing literature indicates that as a future avenue of research, there is need to undertake similar research in other institutions and public sector organizations in Kenya and other countries in order to establish whether the explored practices herein can be generalized to affect performance in public entities.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the aspects of the educational tourism experience that are affected by tourism demand and supply. Data were collected from surveys that were sent to 150 respondents and were analyzed using path analysis. The results show that tourism demand and supply contributed to the variation of tourism activities by 45.1%, while the remaining was explained by other variables, such as national budget, local budget, ticket sale, and cooperation with some stakeholders. Tourism supply had a higher effect than tourism demand. Tourism demand did not particularly affect tourism experience. However, the results of the path analysis indicate that tourism supply had direct and indirect effects on tourism experience through the variation of tourism activities, with the indirect effect being the most predominant. In the management of Smart Park, there is still a gap between tourism demand and supply, so the tourism experience has not been maximized to its full potential.</jats:p>"

The method that is used in this study is descriptive analysis for qualitative and quantitative data by dividing three kinds of vegetables namely potato, cabbage and tomato. The research areas were selected through purposive sampling, namely sub-district Modoinding and the city of Manado. The research results show that the integration of supply chain, in this case an effective partnership, occurs at the farm gate itself in a Gapoktan organization. The result also shows that Track 1 is the most efficient but Tract 2 is the most effective with the ratio of productivity for 42%, the highest margin and profit are found in large middlemen, and tomato has the highest R/C and farmer share in small merchants and traders also an intermediary. Keywords: Integrated supply chain, productivity of transportation, profit margin and farmer share</jats:p>"

The input data used to describe supply chains is given as well as the basic constraints and the criterion functions used in the development of mathematical models describing the supply chains. Servicing actors in supply chains is the complex decision making problem. Operators in the supply chains are constrained by: production capacity of the suppliers, the demand of the customers in particular working days, storage capacities of warehouses, handling capacities of warehouses, suppliers’ and warehouses’ time windows and other. The efficiency of supply chain is described by cost of transport between operators, costs of passing cargoes through warehouses and delivery time to the recipient. The heuristic algorithms, like genetic and ant algorithms are detailed and used to identify issues related to the operation of actors operating in the supply chains are described. These algorithms are used for solving localization problems in supply chains, vehicle routing problems, and assignment problems. The complexity of presented issues (TSP is known as NP-hard problem) limits the use of precise algorithms and implies the need to use heuristic algorithms. It should be noted that solutions generated by these algorithms for complex decision instances are sub-optimal solutions, but nonetheless it is accepted from the practical point of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contracts in the for-hire trucking industry are unusual in that, although they establish prices for different services, there is typically no legally binding obligation or penalty for either party to offer or accept a load. When a load is rejected by all contract carriers, shippers must turn to the spot market, which can significantly increase supply chain costs. Because these transactions occur between private parties, data on load acceptances/rejections and contract/spot prices have not been available to academic researchers, leaving the freight rejection problem largely unexplored. We are able to examine this problem using a detailed transactional data set of a large national shipper. We estimate that spot prices for truckload services average about 62% higher than contract rates. We find key operational and economic factors to be drivers of freight rejection and the shipper-carrier relationship to be a deterrent to freight rejection. We also find that primary and secondary carriers respond differently to these operational and economic factors. We discuss how these insights could be used by a shipper to get better performance and lower cost from their carrier base. </jats:p>",

The existence of tea farmer groups as main actor on tea agribusiness plays important and strategic role in realizing sustainability business unit for tea smallholder downstream supply chain. This study aims to: (1) describes the role of tea farmer groups on tea smallholder downstream supply chain; 2) describes the development of tea smallholder downstream supply chain cooperatives. The main method of this study used a descriptive qualitative approach. Data was collected by in depth interview and focus group discussion (FGD). Data sources were analyzed by used analysis triangulation. The results shown that a few active tea farmer groups in West Java, can successful run the role of group as a business unit in downstream supply chain that has changed its member’s behavior in tea selling activity, improved the member’s income, improved the value added of tea smallholder product, improved the transfer of simple processing technology of tea production, encouraged the local tea product creation, improved tea promotion with government support, and built network in market. In develop sustainability tea supply chain cooperatives, tea farmer groups together joint in tea farmer group association (Gapoktan) to built own factory and village unit cooperative (Koperasi), built network and make a partnerships with government, private plantation, tea factories, and stores. The challenges of tea farmers groups in downstream supply chain are capital, tea prices, and policy that pro tea smallholder. So, sustainable assistance and extension to tea farmer groups important needed. Keywords: role, tea farmer group, downstream, supply chain, cooperative</jats:p>"

This article will examine these concepts and discuss a theoretical framework by which legal developments can be assessed. This theoretical framework will be applied in order to critically consider recent developments in two key areas relating to the sale and supply of goods, namely the action for price, and the characterization of contracts. In examining the interrelation between case law and legislation in these aspects of Commercial Law, the impact of the recent UK Supreme Court decision in PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The Res Cogitans) will be explored. This landmark case considered several provisions of the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979. Many common law jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have legislation that is very similar to the UK Sale of Goods Act, and Res Cogitans is thus of great interest and concern to those in such common law jurisdictions, since the courts in these jurisdictions are likely to view Res Cogitans as highly persuasive in the interpretation of similar local legislation. Various law reform options (including those inspired by the Canadian Uniform Sale of Goods Act) and suggestions for the drafting of contractual clauses will then be critically considered, with a view to promoting predictability, certainty, and party autonomy in the law relating to the sale and supply of goods. </jats:p>",

Production and delivery of component suppliers are based on the advance notification from their manufacturers. For this, most automotive firms integrate marketing channels internally, however, most healthcare firms do not. Consequently, it is difficult to forecast and control demand accurately like automotive firms. In this sense, for healthcare firms, it is a tremendous challenge to respond to demand fluctuation through integration with external marketing agencies. We show both companies strategies to mix <jats:abbrev>mts</jats:abbrev> and <jats:abbrev>mto</jats:abbrev> along with integrating internal and external parties.</jats:p>",

The objectives are to determine the optimum location and allocation of LPG facilities and investigate the relation between distribution costs such as transportation, inventory cost and location decisions in Indonesian multi-echelon LPG supply chain. Capacitated fixed-charged facility location-allocation problem is used to determine the optimal solution of the proposed model. The output of the optimal solutions reported that the costs associated to the proposed distribution are lower than the associated costs in the existing distribution system. It is noted that there is US$ 106.57 million saving per year of total cost by applying the proposed distribution system. In the sensitivity analysis, it is indicated that the trade-offs between facility locations and distribution costs are exist. Results report that as the number of facility increases, total transportation and inventory cost also increase.Keywords: Facility Location; Allocation; Inventory; Transportation.</jats:p>"

The paper employed a conceptual methodology for the estimation of carbon emissions in the four processes of coal mining, selection and washing, transportation and consumption. The results show that the total carbon emission of the coal supply chain in Wu’an is up to 3.51 × 1010 kg and is mainly sourced from the coal mining and consumption, respectively accounting for 13.10% and 84.62%, which indicates that deep coal processing plays a more critical determinant in coal production and consumption. Among the pillar industries, the carbon emissions from the steel industry accounts for 85.41% of the total in the coal consumption process, which indicates that the structure of carbon emissions is dependent on the local industrial structure. Additionally, the carbon directly from CO2 accounts for 89.46%. Our study is not only to be able to supply references for the formulation strategy of a low carbon city, but also to provide a new approach to urban development patterns with a new view for coal resource management.</jats:p>"

The effects of various parameters such as adsorbent dosage and contact time are studied using the batch technique. Kinetics models (pseudo-first and pseudo-second orders) and isotherms models (Langmuir and Freundlich) are used to fit the experimental data by linear and non-linear methods. The results show that the pseudo-second order kinetics model is the best for describing the adsorption of MP by Typha australis for all initial MP concentrations. The equilibrium data fit well with the Langmuir model, suggesting the existence of monolayer adsorption of MP. Typha australis leaf powder can be considered as a new useful low cost natural biosorbent for pesticide clean up operations in aquatic systems.</jats:p>",

In the modified version (MPeSOA), the Gaussian exploration was added to the algorithm. The MPeSOA performance was evaluated in optimal operation of a hypothetical four-reservoir system and Karun-4 reservoir as a real world problem. Also, genetic algorithm (GA) was used as a criterion for evaluating the performance of PeSOA and MPeSOA. The results revealed that in a four-reservoir system problem, the PeSOA performance was much weaker than the GA; but on the other hand, the MPeSOA had better performance than the GA. In the mentioned problem, PeSOA, GA, and MPeSOA reached 78.43, 97.46, and 98.30% of the global optimum, respectively. In the operation of Karun-4 reservoir, although PeSOA performance had less difference with the two other algorithms than four-reservoir problem, its performance was not acceptable. The average values of objective function in this case were equal to 26.49, 23.84, and 21.48 for PeSOA, GA, and MPeSOA, respectively. According to the results obtained in the operation of Karun-4 reservoir, the algorithms including MPeSOA, GA, and PeSOA were situated in ranks one to three in terms of efficiency, respectively.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to fill that gap by testing the hypothesis that the presence of water and sanitation facilities in schools can increase female-to-male enrolment ratios and reduce repetition and drop-out-ratios for girls, especially at ages when they menstruate. Quantitative analyses were undertaken of Education Management Information System (EMIS) data collected from over 10,000 schools in Zambia, to explore relationships between WASH facility provision in schools and enrolment, repetition and drop-out ratios disaggregated by gender and grade. Results indicated that improved sanitation provision in schools was correlated with high female-to-male enrolment ratios, and reduced repetition and drop-out ratios, especially for girls. A t-test revealed significant gender differences in grades 5–8 when many girls start to experience their menstrual cycle. Improved water supply in schools, however, did not reveal the same relationship. The findings confirm possible linkages between adequate toilets in schools and educational progression of girls.</jats:p>",

In this study, the latest Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product, 3B42V7, was validated against ground measurements in the region surrounding the Dongting Lake in China. In the subsequent model-based evaluation and comparison, the two precipitation datasets were separately included as the inputs for data-driven predictive models of the daily Dongting Lake level. The results show that (i) the daily 3B42V7 agrees well with the gauge measurements (correlation coefficient: 0.64–0.73); (ii) 3B42V7 underestimates the frequency of low-intensity (0–30 mm/day) rainfall and the contribution of low-intensity rainfall to the total rainfall volume, but slightly overestimates those of more intense rainfall; (iii) the lake level models driven by rainfall data from the two sources have similar performance, highlighting the potential of using 3B42V7 in data-driven modeling and prediction of hydrological variables in data-scarce regions; and (iv) the inclusion of rainfall as the model input helps achieve a balance between underestimation and overestimation of the lake levels in terms of both magnitude and quantity.</jats:p>",

In China, however, the benefit of this utilization is still in question because of high costs and CO2 emissions in the entire supply chain. In this paper, a multi-objective linear programming model (MLP) is employed to analyze the trade-offs between the economic and environmental benefits of all nodes within the forest biomass power generation supply chain. The MLP model is tested in the Mao Wu Su biomass Thermoelectric Company. The optimization results show that (1) the total cost and CO2 emissions are decreased by US$98.4 thousand and 60.6 thousand kg, respectively; 3750 thousand kg of waste-wood products is reduced and 3750 thousand kg of sandy shrub stubble residue is increased; (2) 64% of chipped sandy shrub residue is transported directly from the forestland to the power plant, 36% of non-chipped sandy shrub residue is transported from the forestland to the power plant via the chipping plant; (3) transportation and chipping play a significant role in the supply chain; and (4) the results of a sensitivity analysis show that the farmer’s average transportation distance should be 84.13 km and unit chipping cost should be $0.01022 thousand for the optimization supply cost and CO2 emissions. Finally, we suggest the following: (1) develop long-term cooperation with farmers; (2) buy chain-saws for regularly used farmers; (3) build several chipping plants in areas that are rich in sandy shrub.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The bargaining theory of capital structure implies that when firms raise their leverage, their suppliers will raise their own leverage in response, so as to maintain strength in negotiations with important customers. In contrast, the theory of firm-specific investments implies that when a customer raises its leverage, a firm will respond by lowering its own leverage to minimize the risk of bankruptcy. We test these theories by examining the relationship between the leverage decisions of suppliers and customers. We find that a firm’s leverage is positively associated with its customer’s leverage. Moreover, consistent with the bargaining theory, we find that the positive leverage relationship is stronger if the customer has a higher ex-ante bargaining power. We also find some support for the relation-specific investment theory of capital structure in that the positive leverage relationship is weaker if the supplier–customer relationship requires more relation-specific investments. </jats:p>",

The complexity of bedform development causes empirical methods to differentiate from each other in predicting bedform dimensions. In this paper, two novel hybrid intelligence models based on a combination of the group method of data handling (GMDH) with the harmony search (HS) algorithm and shuffled complex evolution (SCE) have been developed for predicting bedform dimensions. A data set of 446 field and laboratory measurements were used to evaluate the ability of the developed models. The results were compared to conventional GMDH models with two kinds of transfer functions and an empirical formula. Also, five different combinations of dimensionless parameters as input variables were examined for predicting bedform dimensions. Results reveal that GMDH-HS and GMDH-SCE have good performance in predicting bedform dimensions, and all artificial intelligence methods were dramatically different to the empirical formula of van Rijn showing that using these methods is a key to solving complexity in predicting bedform dimensions. Also, comparing different combinations of dimensionless parameters reveals that there is no significant difference between the accuracy of each combination in predicting bedform dimensions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past decades, the inappropriate subsidy policies in many nations have caused problems such as serious oversupply, fierce competition and subpar social welfare in the photovoltaic (PV) industry in many nations. There is a clear shortage in the PV industry literature regarding how dual supply chains compete and the key decision issues regarding the competition between dual PV supply chains. It is critical to develop effective subsidy policies for the competing PV supply chains to achieve social welfare maximization. This study has explored the dual PV supply chain competition under the Bertrand competition assumption by three game-theoretical modeling scenarios (or supply chain strategies) considering either the public subsidy or no subsidy from a social welfare maximization perspective. A numerical analysis complemented by two sensitivity analyses provides a better understanding of the pricing and quantity decision dynamics in the dual supply chains under three different supply chain strategies and the corresponding outcomes regarding the total supply chain profits, the social welfare and the required total subsidies. The key findings disclose that if there are public subsidies, the dual PV supply chains have the strongest intention to pursue the decentralized strategy to achieve their maximal returns rather than the centralized strategy that would achieve the maximal social welfare; however, the government would need to pay for the maximal subsidy budget. Thus, the best option for the government would be to encourage the dual PV supply chains to adopt a centralized strategy since this will not only maximize the social welfare but also, at the same time, minimize the public subsidy. With a smart subsidy policy, the PV industry can make the best use of the subsidy budget and grow in a sustainable way to support the highly demanded solar power generation in many countries trying very hard to increase the proportion of their clean energy to combat the global warming effect. Several subsidy policies such as shared solar energy arrangements and performance-based incentive (PBI) are proposed to integrate the market users and the PV supply chains. This study serves as a pioneering study into the dual PV supply chain research which is very limited in the PV management and policy study literature. The findings and several untended issues provide a foundation for the future PV supply chain studies.</jats:p>"

These FTS programs are intended, in part, to increase market access and therefore the viability of farms and ranches. Accordingly, the majority of FTS programs involve local food procurement directly from farmers, from non-traditional suppliers that market locally branded food products such as ‘food hubs’, or from traditional suppliers such distributors and food service management companies. Yet, there is reason to believe that transaction costs vary based on the supply chain that schools use to procure local food. Moreover, that the supply chain that schools use to procure local food has a relationship with school's expenditures on local food. We use the 2015 Farm to School Census to estimate the relationship between school district's local food expenditures per student and supply chain structure. We analyzed data using ordinary least squares regressions, controlling for the region of the USA, the type of local food products purchased, and other school-specific characteristics. Importantly, we find a negative and significant relationship between school district's non-milk local food expenditure per student, and purchases directly from the farm and from non-traditional suppliers. This implies that schools that purchase local food from traditional distributors are likely to have higher on average expenditures per student compared with schools that purchase local food directly from farmers or non-traditional distributors. Results point to the need for additional research in determining the efficacy of policies to support direct and non-traditional FTS marketing arrangements.</jats:p>",

This means complicating scholarship by widening the focus beyond the application of Northern norms to engage with complex and diverse practices in Southern cities. For water’s urbanization, this means focusing on what water supply is for the majority: neither the centralized piped‐water network nor its absence, but the range of practices and technologies that unite people, nature and artefacts in a complex socio‐ecological politics of water. Drawing on scholarship from Southern urbanisms, urban political ecology, and science and technology studies, we illustrate how expanding water’s urbanization to include more than networked infrastructure in Jakarta draws attention to the importance of ecological connections between piped water, groundwater, wastewater and floodwater. Thinking beyond the network requires deeper engagement with the ecological connections between the diverse flows of water in and around urban environments. These produce distinct forms of fragmentation that are missed when analysis is limited to piped‐water supply. The emphasis on ecological connections between flows of water and power seeks to draw attention back to the importance of the uneven exposure to environmental hazards in cities in which neither water nor nature are wholly contained by infrastructure.</jats:p>",

This is particularly the case in places like The North Sea, where there is a widespread push for O&amp;G producers to ditch on-platform generators in favor of cleaner sources of electricity (hydro, wind, etc). On account of their low electrical losses and high transmission capacity over long distances, subsea DC transmission lines have traditionally been utilized to supply power to offshore platforms — especially for structures at long step-outs from shore (&amp;gt;50 km). However, because these systems require the installation of a DC to AC power converter on the platform (along with other ancillary equipment), they pose significant challenges with regards to space, weight, and cost.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will examine how flexible AC transmission systems can be used to eliminate this problem by supplying offshore installations long distances from shore with reliable and eco-friendly grid-supplied power. It will outline the advantages of deploying an AC transmission system over conventional on-platform gas turbine generators – some of which include reduced CO2 and NOx emissions, increased availability, and less maintenance. A case study will be presented on Total's Martin Linge platform in the North Sea, which currently employs the longest subsea AC power link in the world at 163 km (Power Martin Linge, 2015). The AC transmission system helps reduce Martin Linge's CO2 emissions by two million metric tons through elimination of on-platform generators.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper will focus on the technologies and methodologies that were used on Martin Linge and will discuss the role that power grid simulation and modeling played in lowering the cost for critical power infrastructure, ensuring onshore grid stability, and minimizing overall project risk. The paper will conclude by discussing how producers can use flexible AC transmission systems in other regions of the world to reduce the environmental impact of their offshore installations by capitalizing on clean, reliable grid-supplied power.</jats:p>",

We examine types of decision-making by water utilities and government agencies, and the nature and origin of evidence available to them in their work on delivering safe drinking water to households. Using qualitative content analysis, we comparatively analyze water utilities and government agencies in Malawi, Ecuador, and Brazil. The results show that the water utilities perform combinations of decision-making types on water quality such as implementation, intelligence-gathering, and evaluation and choice, while government agencies perform more intelligence gathering. Sources and types of information are mainly water consumers, guidelines for water quality standards, and self-monitoring from water utilities. The analysis is useful in establishing a foundation for developing evidence-based management within water supply services, and potentially other water resources management activities.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the results of the simplified life cycle analysis of electricity production process from agricultural biogas used as an engine fuel. LCA analysis was conducted based on data from one of the national biogas plants. The selection criterion was based on the availability of substrates (maize silage, distillery slop and sugar beet pulp) and the possibility of obtaining high quality data for analysis (actual data based on the existing biogas plant). In addition, the environmental impact of the biogas power generation technology obtained through the methane fermentation process only of waste materials (distillery slop, sugar beet pulp) and coprocessing of waste and maize silage was compared.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditional (technical) concepts to ensure a reliable water supply, a safe handling of wastewater and flood protection are increasingly criticised as outdated and unsustainable. These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.</jats:p>"

While extant literature on stakeholder influences or risks in SSCM concentrates on selected issues, a comprehensive review of both stakeholder and risk constructs is missing. Hence, this paper examines stakeholder influences and risks in SSCM, as addressed by conceptual frameworks, empirical studies, and formal models to shed light on the trends and gaps in qualitative and quantitative SSCM research. Based on a content analysis of systematically selected journal publications, the commonalities and differences between the research designs are identified. The findings suggest that the integration of economic risks prevails over the consideration of environmental and social risks. Qualitative studies frequently focus on customers or multiple stakeholders that trigger SSCM and relate to supply, demand, and particularly reputational risks. In contrast, quantitative models rather concentrate on formalizing governmental triggers and operational risks. Thus, mutual stimuli between conceptual, empirical, and model-based SSCM research and their implications for future research directions are derived.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reliability of supply chain networks is an important issue affecting customer satisfaction and profitability of organizations. However, occurrence of disruptions such as flood, earthquake and fire could ruin performance of supply chains. Uncertainty of parameters is another important factor that could lower quality of long-term plans of companies. Hence, uncertainty of parameters and disruption strike are important issues adversely influencing reliability of networks. Also, responsiveness of supply chains is a significant matter that should be considered carefully while designing distribution networks. Responsiveness could increase customer loyalty and satisfaction that could result in increasing market share of companies and their long-term planned benefit. Regarding alluded matters, the aim of this paper is designing a reliable forward-reverse supply chain network that minimizes total costs of network design along with maximization of total responsiveness of distribution network. Extended closed-loop network is capable of considering environmental issues by caring about end-of-life products. Designing reverse supply chain network aside with forward ones could decrease bad environmental impact of end-of-life products. Notably, to cope with adverse effects of disruptions, a scenario-based approach is suggested that enables considering partial and complete disruption of capacity of facilities. Additionally, an effective possibilistic programming method is applied to appropriately control uncertainty of parameters. As quality of raw materials is important to produce high-quality products, minimum acceptable quality level of raw materials is considered in extended model to maximize customer satisfaction. Finally, it should be noted that designed test problems show appropriate performance of suggested model and its applicability in real world case studies. Extended model is solved regarding different risk-aversion levels and sensitivity analysis is performed for different parameters of network design that shows effectual performance of proposed model.</jats:p>",

These committees are designed to ensure respect for internationally recognized labour standards, to empower workers, and to reduce labour unrest. However, these committees have remained weak, and in countries such as Vietnam worker unrest remains common. This article argues that this is because lead firms in these CSR programmes are imposing a ‘sourcing squeeze’ on supplier factors by reducing the prices and production times they allot to their suppliers, which undermines efforts by committees to address cost‐sensitive issues and overtime violations. At the same time, the sourcing squeeze increases strike leverage, providing workers with a much more effective source of worker voice.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of using nZVI in removing benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) contaminants from aqueous solutions. The nZVI and the standard BTEX solution were prepared in the laboratory. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV spectrophotometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were used for nZVI characterization. The effects of contact time, initial BTEX mixture concentration, adsorbent dose, temperature, and pH on the amount of BTEX absorbed were investigated. The highest removal efficiency of 97% for the BTEX mixture was achieved at a stirring rate of 100 rpm, temperature of 60°C, and pH 7. The minimum effective time for efficient removal was 30 min, while the effective dose for BTEX compounds removal was 0.22 g/L. The Freundlich model was the best fit of experimental data. An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the BTEX removal efficiency. Modeling results showed that ANN with average absolute error of 0.6272% is reliable in describing the adsorption of BTEX onto the iron nanoparticles. It is estimated that the cost of BTEX removal by nZVI under the optimal conditions will be about 3.5 USD per cubic meter.</jats:p>",

This study also examines the “cost‐push” and “demand‐pull” theories. The results indicate the presence of cointegration among the three price series for each of the eight food chains. The “demand‐pull” factors are found to have a stronger impact along the food supply chain than the “supply‐push” factors. The short‐run causality results show bidirectional causal relations among the three prices, whereas the long‐run causality findings support the assertion that consumer prices dominate the other two prices, implying an attempt by retailers to exert control over the pricing mechanisms along the Finnish food supply chain. The impulse response functions show that the agricultural product prices experience higher and more prolonged fluctuations around the long‐run equilibrium than the other two prices.

Motivated by a real business investigation, in this study, a supply chain model with one supplier and one manufacturer is analyzed. We consider fairness concerns for the supplier and the manufacturer with sustainable green technology innovation development. We derive the optimal results in both with and without fairness concern. The results indicate that fairness concerns can promote and coordinate the supply chain members without advantage inequity averseness, to invest more on their sustainable green technology innovation development.</jats:p>"

Physical-chemical and microbiological balances characterize these ecological niches and their knowledge is essential to define water properties and support appropriate management. This study is a pilot application of a larger research project, involving metagenomics and aimed to fingerprint springs and map SPA biodiversity. Waters and their deposits were collected in six thermal springs from the Lazio region in Italy. The phylogenic microbial profiles performed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis showed a clear separation between different springs. Statistical analyses revealed correlations between the abundance of specific bacteria and environmental variables. Temperature, Sodium and H2S levels appear to play a key role in influencing the microbiota. The extension of this model to other springs will contribute to characterize and map the microbial community in thermal springs, allowing associations with chemical-physical factors. Biodiversity is a still underestimated property of thermal springs and a key element in several SPA applications. The Atlas progress is shedding light on biotic and abiotic components in these ecological niches, opening further perspectives for supporting appropriate use and management of thermal waters.</jats:p>",

The method of formation of coordinating decisions on maintenance with spare parts and accessories for carrying out TMPE at IE is described. The organization of intellectual support of formation of coordinating decisions by recognition of potential collision in the TMPE process is offered.

In this case, the decision is formed in the event of a disagreement between the need for spare parts and components for the TMPE maintenance, with their availability in the PP warehouse. The ways of software implementation of this method in the environment of multi-agent system are considered. In particular, the description of the multi-agent system developed during the prototype research is given. The prototype is implemented using CORBA technology, in accordance with DSTU ISO/ EC 2382-15:2005. The calculation of the efficiency of the application of the developed computer tools in production is shown. To assess the quality of the system, a sliding control method based on leave-on-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is applied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the decline phase of product lifecycle, industrials need to re-design their products to introduce new functions and/or customers’ new preferences. These changes may not only affect the product’s bill of material, but also its supply chain network. Consequently, new supply chain costs are generated. This paper addresses the problem of supply chain configuration considering new product re-design using a multi-agent system (MAS). The objective of the system is to ensure good collaboration between two different points of view, supply chain partners and product designers, to make better decisions. To model the proposed system, we select the multi-agent system engineering (MaSe) methodology. The MAS framework contains three types of agents, namely, “product design agent” and “supply chain agents” which are fitted with optimization tools. These tools allow costs’ optimization and selection of supply chain means (suppliers, technologies, etc.). Finally, the system contains a “communication agent” acting like a mediator; it facilitates data exchange between designers. To support distributed decision-making, two models of mixed integer linear programming are adopted and implemented within the framework for supply chain optimization. The overall MAS approach was tested in simulation with a case study. The objective of the simulation is to choose among three product alternatives the cheapest one based on its supplying and production costs, under capacity constraints. The MAS was able to find the best product alternative among three alternatives proposed by product design team and select optimal supply chain means. The optimal supply chain contains two suppliers: one machine and one subcontractor to satisfy customer’s demand. </jats:p>",

Based on the characteristics of the project, which include open channels, co-dependent structures and control structures, a mathematical model of the corresponding inner boundary was established. The numerical model of transient flow was developed by combining computer simulation techniques with the one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations. This approach is suitable for the water delivery system of cascade pumping stations. This model was subsequently applied in the study area. The numerical simulation results show that the model of the hydraulic transient process yielded relatively high precision (error of less than 2 cm). The model was used to perform numerical simulations of flow regulation and emergency conditions in the water conveyance system. The study provides a practical numerical method for precisely evaluating the hydraulic transient process for the water delivery system of cascade pumping stations, basic data for the operation and optimization of the water conveyance system, and a reference for the safe operation of the Miyun Reservoir Storage Project, as well as efficient water delivery.</jats:p>",

It has been assumed that in order to remain functional, nodes in one network must receive the support from nodes belonging to different networks. So far these models have been limited to the case in which the failure propagates across networks only if the nodes lose all their supply nodes. In this paper we develop a more realistic model for two interdependent networks in which each node has its own supply threshold, i.e., they need the support of a minimum number of supply nodes to remain functional. In addition, we analyze different conditions of internal node failure due to disconnection from nodes within its own network. We show that several local internal failure conditions lead to similar nontrivial results. When there are no internal failures the model is equivalent to a bipartite system, which can be useful to model a financial market. We explore the rich behaviors of these models that include discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. Using the generating functions formalism, we analytically solve all the models in the limit of infinitely large networks and find an excellent agreement with the stochastic simulations.</jats:p>"

We analyzed the effects of changes in precipitation and soil water storage (SWS) on runoff generation using the path-analysis method (PAM) in Xinjiang River Basin (XJRB). By using multiple trend analysis we found that precipitation, SWS and runoff in XJRB fluctuated throughout the past 30 years with no monotonic trends at both annual and seasonal scales. Further analysis demonstrated that runoff is more sensitive to precipitation than to SWS in XJRB. PAM results showed that direct influence of precipitation on runoff was seven times as large as that of SWS. Moreover, the indirect influence of precipitation on runoff through SWS accounts for 11–31% of the total influence of precipitation on runoff. This information will improve the description of precipitation and runoff relationship as well as the planning and management of water resources.</jats:p>",

In order to reach the objective proposed by the study, 78 semi-structured questionnaires were distributed among the contractors at Ceasa-MS. The questionnaires had as a theoretical framework the TCE in conjunction with the plural forms theory. Analyzing the transaction dimensions between the farmers and contractors at Ceasa-MS, we perceived that the assets studied possess: (a) average specificity; (b) uncertainty of the transactions is high; (c) and transactions occur on a recurring basis. Keeping such dimensions in mind, the TCE theory foresees that those transactions should happen in hybrid form, however the contractors served themselves with vertical integration and plural forms, the latter being the combination of hybrid forms and vertical integration. The presence of plural forms is explained by the ambiguity in the governing structure and the complexity in the way transactions are monitored. We verified that the use of plural forms or the simultaneous use of vertical integration with hybrid forms within all organizational arrangements, to reduce the transaction cost for the contractors as the combined positive aspects of the hybrid forms and vertical integration nullify their weak points.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable energy supply and environmental impact caused by burning of fossil fuels are two of the major worldwide concerns. Regarding sustainable energy supply, several non-conventional alternatives and technologies are currently under study to be implemented from short- to mid-term. On the other hand, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) has been considered as a means for controlling anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Based on these considerations, CCS along with non-conventional heat mining and use of geothermal energy is one of the mid-term concepts that is subject to an in-depth research. One of those research lines involves injection of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) in a naturally high-permeability hydrothermal reservoir in order to mine geothermal energy for subsequent power production. This requires to understand widely the behavior of sCO2 inside the geothermal reservoir, as well as to study feasible options for sustainable power production using sCO2 as a working fluid. The present work refers to CO2 captured from a fossil fuel plant that is compressed and injected into a geothermal reservoir forming a geothermal plume for extracting geothermal energy for power production. Assuming that hot sCO2 is available for power production, a power system is proposed and analyzed using a process simulation software. The plant configuration allows sCO2 to circulate through a direct expansion turbine for production of electricity, then sCO2 at the outlet of the turbine passes through a heat exchanger to provide heat to an organic Rankine cycle for additional power production. Supercritical CO2 leaving the heat exchanger is compressed and reinjected back into the geothermal reservoir for further heat mining. Based on a pre-selection stage, Isobutane, R245fa and CO2 were selected as working fluids to analyze the performance of these working fluids on the entire power system. The results show that the combined system makes use of geothermal heat mined by sCO2 more effectively than a pure ORC, increasing the overall energy efficiency of the system.</jats:p>",

POC testing services can improve access to healthcare especially where healthcare infrastructure is weak and access to quality and timely medical care is a challenge. Improving the accessibility and efficiency of POC diagnostics services, particularly in resource-limited settings, may be a promising route to improving healthcare outcomes. In this review, the accessibility of POC testing is defined as the distance/proximity to the nearest healthcare facility for POC diagnostics service. This review provides an overview of the impact of POC diagnostics on healthcare outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and factors contributing to the accessibility of POC testing services in LMICs, focusing on characteristics of the supply chain management and quality systems management, characteristics of the geographical location, health infrastructure, and an enabling policy framework for POC diagnostics services. Barriers and challenges related to the accessibility of POC diagnostics in LMICs were also discussed. Bearing in mind the reported barriers and challenges as well as the disease epidemiology in LMICs, we propose a lean and agile supply chain management framework for improving the accessibility and efficiency of POC diagnostics services in these settings.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, Brazil does not have a manufacturer that can provide this equipment and the Brazilian National O&amp;G agency regulator has been pushing for O&amp;G explorer and producers to use a minimum of machinery from local suppliers. With this regulatory demand, a BOP was developed from scratch. International Standards have been evaluated to understand what could be adapted as no standard is applied specifically to this equipment. Analytic and numerical simulations were performed and adjusted according to local suppliers’ limitations for materials and testing. Tree prototypes were built and tested to evaluate the design and functionality of the BOPs. At the end, the design was proven to work and the prototypes are being tested for long time without presenting any problems.

A relevant objective for all enterprises is to reduce consumption of reactive power in the network and ensuring reliable start of the engine by controlling the resistance value of the insulation. The most effective measure for reactive power compensation is placing the capacitor batteries directly at the points of connection of the asynchronous motor i. e. local reactive power compensation. The aim of the present research was to reduce the cost of production of the enterprise (which provides reactive power compensation), and in the period of technological pause to use the power stored in the capacitor to batteries in order control the changes of resistance value of insulation. After disconnecting the motor from the mains and its stop, the windings is being connected in parallel to the capacitor bank. The discharge of the capacitor is performed in the circuit consisting of the inductance of the motor winding, the integrated insulation resistance and battery capacity. Characteristic features of the transitional discharge process of the capacitor depend on the size of the equivalent circuit elements. The transition process may be aperiodic and periodic in its nature. Aging of motor winding causes a decrease of its impedance. When the magnitude of the insulation resistance reaches a critical value, this causes a change of the nature of the process. The device that has been developed monitors the insulation condition of the motor and the power supply cable during technological pauses without the low voltage power source and additional switching.</jats:p>"

Although HTSs are mostly studied as disaster agents, considering that they occur during the period when water supply systems are generally depleted, it is important to ascertain their potential contributions toward sustaining water supply. Using the Lake Michie–Little River reservoir system that supplies water to the city of Durham (North Carolina) as a representative test case, we implemented an integrated watershed and reservoir management model, supported by publicly available observations, to evaluate the extent to which HTSs impact water storages. Results indicate that HTSs can have a significant impact on reservoir water storage, with their effects being felt for more than a year for some storms. The impact on reservoir water storage is identified to be primarily controlled by 3 factors, namely, streamflow response size from HTSs, storage in the reservoir right before the event, and streamflow succeeding the event response to HTS (henceforth referred as postevent streamflow). Although the impact of streamflow response size on water storage is generally proportional to its magnitude, initial water storage in the reservoir and postevent streamflow have a nonmonotonic influence on water storage. As all the 3 identified controls are a function of antecedent hydrologic conditions and meteorological forcings, these 2 factors indirectly influence the impact of HTS on water storage in a reservoir. The identification of controlling factors and assessment of their influence on reservoir response will further facilitate implementation of more accurate estimation and prediction frameworks for within‐year reservoir operations.</jats:p>",

This paper reports on exploratory research, which used examples of SFSCs from London to build a more detailed understanding of different types of urban SFSC and their relative performance compared to each other. To do this, we undertook a participatory sustainability impact assessment (SIA) in which local food system stakeholders were asked to rank the perceived impacts of five different urban and peri-urban SFSCs compared with the current ‘mainstream’ food supply system (defined as supermarkets retailing mass-produced, standardized food products). The SFSCs ranked were: (1) urban gardening (self-supply), (2) urban gardening (commercial), (3) community supported agriculture (CSA), (4) direct sale (on-farm) and (5) direct sale (off-farm). Results from the SIA showed that CSAs were regarded as delivering the highest overall social, economic and environmental benefits, followed by urban gardening (commercial), urban gardening (self-supply) and direct sales (off-farm). The lowest overall rating was for the supply chain direct sales (on-farm). All five SFSCs were ranked highest on the social aspects of sustainability. Following the participatory SIA of perceived sustainability, we next developed a questionnaire in order to test the feasibility of measuring the specific (rather than ‘perceived’) impacts of an urban SFSC. We applied the test at a community-led local food market in South London, where we conducted face-to-face interviews with all market stallholders (18 respondents) and a random sample of consumers (51 respondents). Results from the community-led market were similar to those acquired at the SIA workshop, with greater agreement about the social benefits of the market, compared with economic and environmental impacts. The results also suggest that producers underestimated consumers’ willingness to share the risks that the producers face and we identify this as an important aspect for future research. The paper concludes with reflections on the strengths and weaknesses of the SIA methodology.</jats:p>",

Water scarcity is currently an especially key issue in Central Asia (CA), and therefore the study of WSVs can aid in the adoption of measures for mitigating pressures from contemporary environmental changes and economic development in CA. Based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and CRU meteorological datasets and a proposed combined filter strategy, WSVs in Central Asia and its surrounding areas over 30 years are investigated in this paper. The results indicate that the WSVs derived from GRACE and GLDAS over CA generally show a decreasing tendency. CRU data demonstrated that CA has been undergoing a warming trend. The water loss in CA may be caused by warming, which will lead to the loss of soil moisture. Moreover, the water mass in the Tibetan Plateau and Tarim basin increases, which may be caused by glacier melting in the Pamirs and Himalaya. The precipitation contributed little to changes in water storage, but at the basin scale, the precipitation anomalies were very similar to the GRACE and GLDAS data, which can be viewed as an indicator of WSVs.</jats:p>",

The choice to accept or discard suboptimal food is taken either before or after purchase (hence, in the retail store or in the household). The aim of the European research project COSUS (Consumers in a sustainable food supply chain) was to increase consumer acceptance of suboptimal food, before and after purchase, by implementing targeted strategies that are based on consumer insights, and that are feasible for and acceptable by the food sector. To reach this aim, different methodological approaches were applied to analyze this issue, to experiment with different aspects, and to test the resulting interventions. Each of these approaches was undertaken by competent consortium partners from Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands. The project finally provides validated strategies to promote the distribution and consumption of suboptimal foods, thereby improving resource efficiency in the food chain and contributing to a more sustainable food supply.</jats:p>"

Faced with serious atmospheric deterioration, governments have been seeking to reduce carbon emissions, with carbon trading and carbon taxes being considered the most effective regulatory policies. Over time, there has been a global consensus that integrated carbon trading/carbon tax policies are more effective in reducing carbon emissions. However, in an integrated carbon reduction policy framework, balancing the relationship between emission reductions and low-carbon benefits has been found to be a critical issue for governments and enterprises in both theoretical research and carbon emission reduction practices. As few papers have sought to address these issues, this paper seeks to reach a trade-off between economic development and environmental protection involving various stakeholders: regional governments which aim to maximize social benefits, and producers who seek economic profit maximization. An iterative interactive algorithmic method with fuzzy random variables (FRVs) is proposed to determine the satisfactory equilibrium between these decision-makers. This methodology is then applied to a real-world case to demonstrate its practicality and efficiency.</jats:p>"

As such, this paper presents the re­search undertaken on the subcontracting of scaffold manufacturing, supplying and delivering. It focuses upon the organi­sations, management and control in scaffolding subcontracting. A comparative analysis of three organisations was car­ried out to reveal issues with current practice in manufacturing, supplying and delivering scaffold products for assembly onsite. Their management and control approaches are also compared and contrasted. It is found that, while the divided contract approach may help save costs, enhance market exposure and is ideal when choice of subcontractor is limited, its risks can impact upon the entire project and be difficult for the contractor to control. The limited background in scaf­folding studies and importance of subcontracting within LNG infrastructure projects has made this research timely. This paper identifies issues in relation to quality assurance, warranties and rework, which have the potential to mitigate any cost benefits obtained from subcontracting practices within this supply chain.</jats:p>"

The supply chain of food banks is characterized by private sector companies, individual donors and governmental agencies providing monetary support and food inventory on the supply side, and the member agencies such as food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and volunteers delivering support on the demand side. Within the purview of this supply chain, food banks strive to improve their performance, which is commonly measured in terms of the amount of food delivered to the communities in need. Food banks rely on managerial talent that is relatively more constrained than the private sector and also use a voluntary workforce for attaining their performance goals. Considering the unique yet pertinent role of human assets in food banks to manage their supply chain integration initiatives, we employ an intellectual capital framework to analyze the human, organizational, and social capital antecedents of supply chain integration in food banks. Specifically, we suggest that intellectual capital drives supply chain integration in humanitarian organizations. Moreover, we propose specific relationships between the dimensions of intellectual capital. A carefully crafted survey is used to inform our results. The results indicate that human capital significantly impacts social capital, which, in turn, drives all supply chain integration dimensions. We discuss the implications of our findings for managing intellectual capital in the not‐for‐profit sector and offer directions for future research.</jats:p>",

In this study, we found that zinc stimulated aspect in cell motility and was essential in restoring the Ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced energetic metabolism damage in HEK293 cells. Moreover, using zinc supplementation and zinc deficiency models, we observed that zinc is conducive to mitochondrial pyruvate transport, oxidative phosphorylation, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and ultimate energy metabolism in both normal and toxic-induced oxidative stress conditions <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>, and it plays an important role in restoring impaired energetic metabolism. This zinc-mediated energetic metabolism regulation could also be helpful for DNA maintenance, cytoprotection and hereditary cancer traceability.

The proposed model not only introduces the uses of compound real options in sequential capacity planning, but also considers uncertainty induced by both risks and ambiguities. Both strategic decisions (i.e., facility locations and initial investment, service assignment across the entire CSC, and option holding status) and scenario‐based operational decisions (i.e., facility operations and capacity expansions, outsourcing policy, and transportation and inventory strategies) can be simultaneously determined using the model. By exploiting the nested decomposable structure of the model, we develop a new distributed parallel optimization algorithm based on nonconvex generalized Bender decomposition and Lagrangean relaxation to mitigate the computation resource limitation. One of the main CSCs in China is studied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the performance of the algorithm. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 64: 1246–1261, 2018</jats:p>",

A case study of ODP site 1247 at the Hydrate Ridge, offshore Oregon shows that dissolved methane transported by molecular diffusion and pore water advection is the major supply of methane for gas hydrate formation, while in situ methanogenesis contributes little to the gas hydrate reservoir. The gas hydrate reservoir was also evaluated considering the changes of sedimentation rate since 1.67 Ma. Our model results show that the variations of sedimentation rate lead to little change in the size of gas hydrate reservoir at ODP 1247. The calculated hydrate saturation amounts to ∼0%∼3%, which is consistent with the measured values using pressure coring.</jats:p>",

In this context, we consider a supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer and investigate the impacts of the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s fairness concerns on their production sustainability level, low-carbon promotion level and profitability. We also explore the coordination contract. The results show that the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s fairness concerns decrease their product sustainability and low-carbon promotion level, together with the profits of the system and the manufacturer. With regard to the retailer’s fairness concern, the product sustainability level and the manufacturer’s profit are lower; moreover, the low-carbon promotion level and the profits of the supply chain and the retailer are higher. A revenue-sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain perfectly; however, members’ fairness concerns increase the difficulty of coordination. Finally, the numerical results reveal that carbon tax regulation can encourage the manufacturer to enhance the product sustainability level. Further, the impacts on the low-carbon promotion level and firms’ profitability are related to the cost coefficients of product sustainability.</jats:p>"

Its complexity is due to the dynamics and nonlinearity of equations of state of an electrical network, recorded as related to node voltages, and also due to multiply connected network elements. Attempts to solve the problem by using the theory of sensitivity lead to the appearance – in addition to the matrices of the generalized parameters of the network – of several sensitivity matrices, for the formation of which sufficiently effective algorithms for fast recalculation of the matrices when switching schemes are not yet developed. It results in a need to calculate matrix data anew at each switching, or to recognizing some mode as a basic one considering other modes virtually unchanged at relatively small deviations of the parameters, which, in its turn, leads to additional errors. The new method of calculation of the power flows distribution in the network is proposed that based is not on physical modeling of the structure of the investigated circuit, but on the mathematical modeling of the structure of the equations describing the flow distribution, thereby removing the limitations imposed by heterogeneity and the presence of transformations.</jats:p>"

In this study, we focused on geographic accessibility to estimate and evaluate future demand and supply of healthcare services. We constructed a simulation model called the patient access area model (PAAM), which simulates patients’ access time to healthcare service institutions using a geographic information system (GIS). Using this model, to evaluate the balance of future healthcare services demand and supply in small areas, we estimated the number of inpatients every five years in each area and compared it with the number of hospital beds within a one-hour drive from each area. In an experiment with the Tokyo metropolitan area as a target area, when we assumed hospital bed availability to be 80%, it was predicted that over 78,000 inpatients would not receive inpatient care in 2030. However, this number would decrease if we lowered the rate of inpatient care by 10% and the average length of the hospital stay. Using this model, recommendations can be made regarding what action should be undertaken and by when to prevent a dramatic increase in healthcare demand. This method can help plan the geographical resource allocation in healthcare services for healthcare policy.</jats:p>"

Based on the resource orchestration theory, we argue that internal, supplier and customer sustainable development each orchestrate different types of resource and therefore their effects vary. Structural equation modeling of data from a survey of 203 Thai manufacturers was used to test a new theoretical model. Results confirm that financial performance was achieved through cost reduction created by customer sustainable development supported by internal and supplier sustainable development. On the other hand, better environmental performance created by internal sustainable development generated no financial gains. However, internal, supplier and customer sustainable development positively affected each other, and by acting together they made firms lean, green and profitable.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article assesses the impact of armed conflict on the drinking water service of Basrah from 1978 to 2013 through an ‘urban warfare ecology’ lens in order to draw out the implications for relief programming and relevance to urban studies. It interprets an extensive range of unpublished literature through a frame that incorporates the accumulation of direct and indirect impacts upon the hardware, consumables and people upon which urban services rely. The analysis attributes a step‐wise decline in service quality to the lack of water treatment chemicals, lack of spare parts, and, primarily, an extended ‘brain‐drain’ of qualified water service staff. The service is found to have been vulnerable to dependence upon foreign parts and people, ‘vicious cycles’ of impact, and the politics of aid and of reconstruction. It follows that practitioners and donors eschew ideas of relief–rehabilitation–development (RRD) for an appreciation of the needs particular to complex urban warfare biospheres, where armed conflict and sanctions permeate all aspects of service provision through altered biological and social processes. The urban warfare ecology lens is found to be a useful complement to ‘infrastructural warfare’ research, suggesting the study of protracted armed conflict upon all aspects of urban life be both deepened technically and broadened to other cases.</jats:p>",

Methodologically, this paper creatively introduces the HILE's probabilistic structured property into Granger causality test analysis, forming an HILE–Granger (H-G) model, so as to empirically estimate both the short-term and long-term causal relationship effects between the energy efficiency and resources allocation. Conclusion is drawn that optimization of resources allocation is positively proportional with the energy efficiency enhancement. This paper is to provide a decision-making reference for the supply side reform strategy of foreign trade enterprises under the background of green energy economy.</jats:p>",

A two‐stage least squares (2<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SLS</jats:styled-content>) multivariate Tobit regression model with random effects was applied. We find that impacts of drinking water conditions on off‐farm labour supply may be greater for women than men but depends on the specific family role or family structure. A strong within‐gender effect exists in households. For example, daughters are not sensitive to water access nor water quality, but householder's spouses are sensitive to water access, and daughters‐in‐law are sensitive to water quality. Our findings suggest that infrastructure development in improved access to safe water has contributed positively to reductions in traditional gender biases, evening the playing field between daughters, daughters‐in‐law, mothers and mothers‐in‐law. We also find that water the infrastructure program may actually encourage off‐farm labour mobility, reducing the supply of agricultural labour and the share of household labour on the farm. Thus, a broader approach to water policy should also include public investment in achieving greater labour efficiency and productivity.</jats:p>",

The framework is based on a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with a fluid‐induced seismicity rate proportional to the rate of injected fluid. The fluid‐induced seismicity rate model depends upon a set of physically meaningful parameters and has been validated for six fluid‐induced case studies. In line with the vision of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, the rate parameters are considered as random variables. We develop both the Bayesian inference and updating rules, which are used to develop a probabilistic forecasting model. We tested the Basel 2006 fluid‐induced seismic case study to prove that the hierarchical Bayesian model offers a suitable framework to coherently encode both epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability. Moreover, it provides a robust and consistent short‐term seismic forecasting model suitable for online risk quantification and mitigation.</jats:p>",

In this study, besides examining North Dakota water management policies and activities, we also analyzed three datasets: the Bakken horizontal well completion data (2008‐2014), North Dakota permitted water consumption data (2000‐2014), and groundwater level and streamflow observations in western North Dakota (2000‐2014). We found from 2008 to 2014, the annual total industrial water uses for Bakken shale oil development ranged between 0.5 and 10% of statewide total consumptive water use. The percentage increases were between 3.0 and 40% within the Bakken oil production region. The increased population of temporary oilfield service workers contributed additional domestic water use, which was equivalent to ~15% of annual industrial water use for the shale oil development in the Bakken. Despite being in a semiarid region, the impact of Bakken development on regional water supply was limited because the water in the Bakken was adaptively managed and the region received on average over 20% more precipitation than normal during 2008‐2014. Of the 15 glaciofluvial aquifers under study, 12 have seen water levels increasing or unchanged and the water levels for the remaining 3 aquifers have decreased.</jats:p>",

During peanut production in China, N fertilizer is applied one time as basal fertilizer, this causes overproduction during vegetative growth and early leaf senescence in the reproductive stage, resulting in decreased pod yield. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate peanut pod yield under different N fertilizer strategies. Five N fertilizer treatments with three replications were applied: N1: 180 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> as basal fertilizer; N2: 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> as basal fertilizer and 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> top dressing at R3 stage (beginning of active pegging and fruit development stage); N3: 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> as basal fertilizer and 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at R6 (the beginning of the seed filling stage); N4: 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at R3 and 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at R6 and Control: no N fertilizer applied. Results indicated that rational fertilization strategies caused peanut population growth to be more coordinated, senescence of the leaf blade was delayed at the later development stages, which enhanced source supply capacity for peanut yield and provided ample photosynthate for enrichment of seeds, increasing yield. As a result, N4 treatment produced the highest yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), while these were lowest in response to N1 treatment. These results indicate that peanut should be fertilized as for N4 in higher soil N condition.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dual channels have become popular strategies for manufacturers due to the development of innovative selling platforms. Examples in practice also show that the lack of relationship management, such as cooperation and sharing, may cause an unsustainable supply chain performance. However, previous studies on coordination of dual-channel supply chains always focus on the contribution to profits and neglect the sustainability of relationship development between channel members. In this paper, we study the coordination of a dual-channel supply chain including a direct channel and a traditional channel. Under the fact that sustainable economy, instead of profit maximization, is the more appropriate objective in channel members’ decision making, we consider the retailer’s risk exposure and assume the risk degree is also a factor that impacts decision making. We assume the manufacturer is risk-neutral and the retailer is risk-averse, and measure the risk attitude with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach. Two traditional contracts widely used in single-channel supply chains, i.e., revenue-sharing contract and buy-back contract, are analyzed first. Although some researchers have discussed that traditional contracts cannot coordinate the dual-channel supply chain, our results show that traditional contracts can still come into play with restrictions on the risk-averse degree. Then we propose a risk-sharing contract which could distribute profits between two channel members and coordinate the system under varied risk-averse degrees with a fixed risk-sharing degree. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of different parameters to illustrate the stable coordinating outcomes of this contract, and prove its generalization with more powerful channel members. The results provide important managerial insights.</jats:p>"

It addresses two main problems. First, it makes a spatially explicit assessment of fodder supply and demand extracted from a data poor environment. Fodder supply is assessed by combining rainfall-based production functions and rule-based assessment for prevailing land use. Fodder demand is based on a data consistency check of livestock statistics concerning herd size, composition and geographical distribution. Second, individual herd movements have to be evaluated jointly in concurrent migration patterns to assess local pressures on fodder resources. We, therefore, apply a transition model that relates stock levels to seasonal migration routings for all Afar sub-clans jointly so as to localize the hot spots where feed demand exceeds forage supply. Critical areas come to the fore, especially, near fringes of Highlands and in the southern part of the Afar. A sensitivity test shows that ‘Baseline’ scenario is close to the ‘Best’ but under ‘Worst’, the Afar region would fall into despair. We conclude that the model is a useful tool to inform policy makers on critical areas in the Afar region.</jats:p>"

We fully characterize the manufacturers’ equilibrium rebate decisions and show how they depend on parameters such as the fixed cost of a rebate program, market size, the redemption rate of rebate, the proportion of rebate‐sensitive consumers in the market and competition intensity. Interestingly, more intense competition induces a manufacturer to lower rebate value or stop offering rebate entirely. Without rebate, it is known that more intense competition hurts the manufacturers and benefits the retailer. With rebate, however, more intense competition could benefit the manufacturers and hurt the retailer. We find similar counterintuitive results when there is a change in some other parameters. We also consider the case when the retailer subsidizes the manufacturers sequentially to offer rebate programs. We fully characterize the retailer's optimal subsidy strategy, and show that subsidy always benefits the retailer but may benefit or hurt the manufacturers. When the retailer wants to induce both manufacturers to offer rebate, he always prefers to subsidize the manufacturer with a higher fixed cost first. Sometimes the other manufacturer will then voluntarily offer rebate even without subsidy. </jats:p>",

It can be observed from a systematic comparison and numerical analysis that the Vertical Nash structure is the best in the levels of the carbon emission reduction, the used-product collection, the retail price, and the entire supply chain's profit under the decentralized decision. The cooperatively reducing carbon emission is positive for the carbon emission reduction and collection under a manufacturer-led structure.</jats:p>",

Most of this population did not finish basic education (72.3%, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 159). Only one of the communities had a water supply (aqueduct), whereas the other received water via an adapted tanker ship. No respondents reported sewage services; 92.7% (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 204) had garbage service.

In the case of the German cement cartel that operated over 1991–2002, the primary source of noncartel supply was imports from Eastern European cement manufacturers. Testimonies in a private enforcement case have claimed that the cartel sought to control imports by sharing rents with intermediaries in order to discourage them from sourcing foreign supply. Specifically, cartel members would allow an intermediary to issue the invoice for a transaction and charge a fee even though the output went directly from the cartel member's plant to the customer. We investigate this claim by first developing a theory of collusive pricing that takes account of the option of bribing intermediaries. The theory predicts that the cement cartel members are more likely to share rents with an intermediary when the nearest Eastern European plant is closer and there is more Eastern European capacity outside of the control of the cartel. Estimating a logit model that predicts when a cartel member sells through an intermediary, the empirical analysis supports both predictions.</jats:p>",

Recent studies show that the frequency and variation in ENSO cycles are influenced by a changing climate, indicating that more sophisticated studies on the agricultural impacts of ENSO are needed. In many less developed countries, however, securing agricultural data as well as climate data for the analysis is extremely difficult due to limited data availability. In this study, monthly historical precipitation data in Tonga were examined to establish an ENSO relationship with long‐term crop data. Local market supply data, the only extant long‐term crop data, were used as a proxy for crop supply and analysed to find any significant variations in agricultural output linked to ENSO impacts. Among several crops with statistical significance, swamp taro was selected for an in‐depth statistical analysis using monthly market supply and monthly climate data. As a result, a statistically significant relationship was found between rainfall amount in critical growth stages and corresponding swamp taro supplies in the market. Based on the results, we suggest a practically applicable information transfer to Tongan farmers using a tercile‐category probability estimation of the crop supply based on seasonal ENSO forecasts. Different counter‐decisions based on the information are expected from various stakeholders based on their experience and priority and also depending on their decision‐making position in the society.</jats:p>",

We consider the completely decentralized model, M-R vertical cooperation model, R-R horizontal cooperation model, M-R-R vertical and horizontal cooperation model and completely centralized model, and also identify the optimal decision results and profits. It can be observed from a systematic comparison and numerical analysis that the completely centralized model is best in all optimal decision results among all models. In semi-cooperation, the M-R vertical cooperation model is positive, the R-R horizontal cooperation model is passive, and the positivity of the M-R-R vertical and horizontal cooperation model decreases with competitive intensity increasing in the used-products returning, carbon emissions reduction level, low-carbon promotion effort and the profits of the manufacturer and the entire supply chain.</jats:p>"

In the selling season of seasonal products, there is usually a sale period because product valuation drops significantly. We study the behavior of strategic customers in a supply chain selling seasonal products. Contrary to strategic customers, myopic customers buy or leave, and do not wait. Previous researches with myopic customers suggest that decentralization decreases the supply chain’s profit. We simulate supply chain members’ interaction and learning processes of decisions to investigate how decentralization of a supply chain affects its profit in the presence of strategic customers. We study the effect of customer heterogeneity over product valuation and find that: (i) The profit of the decentralized supply chain is higher than that of the centralized one when the degree of customer heterogeneity is high, the expected product valuation is low, and customers have low time sensitivity. (ii) Decentralization retards delaying purchases of strategic customers. In addition, we find that the endogenization of the sale price can weaken the negative effect of strategic customers on the supply chain’s profit. </jats:p>",
