Given that there are many proposed generating methods for synthetic hydrology, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of various synthetic streamflow generators (SSG's). Six different single‐site, monthly generators are considered here. The comparison demonstrates that preservation of statistical moments (mean, standard deviation, and lag correlation coefficients) may be a misleading criterion for judging the ability of an SSG to provide plausible estimates of water supply system performance. It is shown that it is operationally superior to base the specification of marginal distributions of monthly streamflows on transformed values of historical streamflow data rather than on the data itself. Two transformations are considered, the log transform and a newly developed normalizing transform. A new type of autoregressive‐moving average model is shown to be operationally superior to an autoregressive model.</jats:p>",

Compared to the conditions in resting fish in air-saturated water, hypoxia and injection of epinephrine significantly increased the proportion of secondary lamellae receiving stained cells, and acetylcholine caused a significant reduction, but hyperoxia did not significantly affect the proportion of lamellae containing stained cells. Perfusion of the filamental central compartment was not affected by the treatments. It is concluded that trout can respond to changes in oxygen supply by varying the number of secondary lamellae perfused with blood, and that the distribution of blood flow is regulated by cholinergic and adrenergic receptors. It is suggested, however, that lamellar recruitment would not be useful in minimizing the costs of osmo- and iono-regulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. Lactate and O2 uptake and glucose output were studied in isolated livers from starved rats at perfusate flow rates varying from 100 to 7% of “normal” (11.25-0.75 ml/min per 100 g body wt.). 2. With moderate diminution of flow rate, lactate and oxygen uptake fell more slowly than would be expected if uptake purely depended on substrate supply. 3. Use of a mathematical model suggests that the intrinsic capacity of the liver for lactate uptake is unaffected until the flow rate falls below 25% of “normal”. 4. Some lactate uptake was always observed even at 7% of the “normal” flow rate. 5. At flow rates below 33% of the “normal”, lactate was increasingly metabolized by pathways other than gluconeogenesis, which became a progressively less important consumer of available O2. 6. ATP content decreased with diminution of flow rate, but substantially less markedly than did lactate uptake and glucose output. 7. Intracellular pH fell from a mean value of 7.25 at “normal” flow rate to 7.03 at 7% of the “normal” flow rate.</jats:p>",
