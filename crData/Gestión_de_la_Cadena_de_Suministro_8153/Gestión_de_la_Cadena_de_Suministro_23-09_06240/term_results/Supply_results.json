Despite legislation and extensive guidance, annual corporate statements are disappointing, providing little evidence of substantive action. So far though, there has been little primary research of managers' understanding of the phenomenon or their perceived agency in tackling modern slavery. In a qualitative study, employing template analysis, data were drawn from multiple sources, including interviews with 32 managers from three large UK firms in a complex, high‐risk sector (construction). Four focus groups were used to establish credibility of the findings. As managers struggle with how to make sense of where to look, how to look, and what to see, they adopt narrowed perspectives and analogies that inhibit immediate, compelling action. Improved awareness of UK labor supply chain issues has distanced managers further from action relating to global material supply chains. Through analogy with health and safety legislation, which developed over a considerable period, managers justify a wait‐and‐see approach, deferring action. Such convenience framing helps them to avoid issues relating to complexity, control, cost, and (in)visibility. This framing needs to be disrupted for meaningful action to result. Drawing on sensemaking theory relating to paradoxical financial and sustainability objectives, the study suggests how extended legislation and governance may drive more substantive responses that transcend the constraints of business‐case logic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The supply chain disruptions that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continue to a lesser degree today, exposed vulnerabilities in many supply chains and increased C-level focus on supply chain resiliency. At the same time, the supply chain risk landscape is becoming more challenging to navigate with more points of vulnerability and an increase in the frequency of disruptive events. The semiconductor shortage that crippled automotive and electronics manufacturers was the most widely publicised example, but across industries material and component shortages, port congestion, severe weather events and other disruptions have taken their toll on business continuity and profitability. Supply chain organisations are taking a multifaceted approach to these challenges, including increasing inventory levels, diversifying supplier networks and re-engineering their supply chains. This paper focuses on using analytics-based risk mitigation tools to support decision making around these strategies and enable a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to supply chain risk. These tools integrate advanced technologies such as predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtualisation to improve risk identification, model complex supply chains during planning and enable proactive management during disruptive events. The paper reviews the current risk landscape, outlines how risk mitigation tools have evolved to meet current needs and the capabilities available in the current generation. It describes how the tools are used in procurement to improve supplier identification and management, in planning to design risk out of the network where possible, and in transportation management to adapt in real time to minimise the impact of disruptive events on delivery and production schedules. Finally, it outlines how these tools work with existing systems and processes to embed an analytics-based approach to risk mitigation into supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This study develops and tests theory on the relationship between reported supplier sustainability incidents and the associated stock price impact for the buying firm. An event study comprising 1699 events related to 374 buying firms supports our hypothesis that media coverage of environmental, social, or governance‐related transgressions in the supply chain results in decreased market capitalization for the buying firm. A subsequent regression analysis indicates that the influence potential of information intermediaries, the country‐level sustainability risk of the supplier, and the industry‐level sustainability risk of the buying firm all affect the magnitude of the investors' reaction. Conversely, the severity of the incident does not predict the magnitude of the stock price reaction.</jats:p>",

Various events in recent years have shown just how pervasive their impact is on global supply chains. This has led to a clear shift in priorities. Whereas supply chain management was primarily a cost issue in the past, today companies are focusing strongly on resilience and supply chain security. Because it is clear: the complexity of the framework conditions for global supply chains will not disappear. In this context, digitalisation and data collaboration offer the potential to break down existing silos in supply chain management and design a networked, overarching optimum that strengthens companies’ resilience, improves supply security and increases profitability. This paper shows the opportunities that end-to-end data collaborations in supply chains offer for value creation. The author explains how the largest mill-independent materials distributor and service provider in the Western world, thyssenkrupp Materials Services, is using its expertise in materials distribution to create digital services for greater transparency in the supply chain. The focus is on developments such as the forward sensing digital platform and the potential of data use and exchange for managing the dynamic processes of supply chains such as the bullwhip effect. In addition to practical use cases, the author also shares the role customer orientation plays, the impact digital tools can have on the use of materials and the lessons they have learned from dealing with supply chain data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The Oxford English Dictionary defines resilience as the ability to recover and bounce back after significantly pressing life events with long-lasting impact. The past three years have been among the most turbulent since the Great Depression of the 1900s. But in a more connected world, where socioeconomic conditions are co-dependent on a global supply chain, the way companies look at disruptions has to be different. Come what may, supply chains must be well oiled to keep the intricately connected cogs of the global machinery running. And for that organisations must be prepared to anticipate and tackle issues that come their way or seek out opportunities that make them less vulnerable to supply chain upsets. In other words, they must work on being more resilient than ever before. This paper takes a deep dive into how continuous global adversity has affected organisations and their supply chains and how they can learn from these events to be prepared yet agile for the way ahead.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper explores the nexus of supply chain management (SCM) challenges and explains both the impact of recent global trends and the long-standing susceptibilities in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The paper also discusses how these supply chain challenges exacerbate difficulties in procuring infrastructure investment projects. Finally, the paper summarises the practical solutions the Bank is pursuing through its procurement practices as an entry point for addressing supply chain management constraints. Supply chain disruptions had global repercussions in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and still present potential risks given on-going economic and geopolitical uncertainties. These challenges have come on top of long-standing supply chain difficulties in logistically complicated remote markets such as the Pacific Islands. Businesses operating in that environment contend with high logistics costs and transport expenses, which can be further exacerbated by volatile fuel prices. For contractors undertaking transportation works, there are added risks such as volatility in commodity markets for raw materials such as steel. Mobilisation costs to the Pacific Islands are also high, especially when contractors must transport equipment, goods, and potentially labour from abroad. This is on top of the significant risk of adverse weather events, with works being highly susceptible to flooding and extreme weather due to their location near coastlines. This high risk is difficult to insure, and bidders often struggle to obtain adequate insurance for their projects. Ultimately, the combination of supply chain issues, localised risks and small contract values have contributed to price escalation and weak market response to works procurements in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). The weak market response also reflects a tightening supplier market, as construction companies focus on more attractive projects within the large pipeline of domestic infrastructure projects in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. The World Bank and borrowers (client countries) are addressing this challenge through procurement approaches intended to make projects more attractive to bidders. Outreach on the consolidated pipeline of infrastructure projects in PICs highlights the opportunity for repeat business; a sequence of projects in the same location helps offset high mobilisation costs. Similarly, the Bank informs bidders of opportunities for local subcontracting or joint ventures, which can offset mobilisation costs and facilitate access to local labour. Tenders can also make greater use of rated criteria, which place emphasis on past performance, quality and sustainability factors. Finally, greater use of phased approaches and provisional sums can help to spread price risk more effectively over long duration contracts where clear information on future costs is not available. In the context of global uncertainty, this can offset price risk for outyear items.</jats:p>"

Digitization is increasingly acknowledged as a facilitative approach toward achieving that target. Researchers commonly acknowledge the necessity for more empirical studies to explore digitalization's potential to improve supply chain resilience and efficiency in unstable circumstances. This study proposes a theoretical framework that explains the influence of supply chain digitalization on the resilience of supply chains and performance. The proposed relationships were confirmed through a survey conducted with 315 construction companies in Pakistan. The findings provide insights into how digitization and supply chain resilience can enhance the efficiency of supply chain performance. Furthermore, the findings confirm resilience's partial positive mediating role in the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance. Supply chain digitalization can enhance cost-effectiveness, information, communication efficiency, and supply chain resilience, improving performance during crises. This study contributes to the existing research on supply chain digitalization and resilience by using dynamic capability to establish their association. The research findings offer valuable insights for companies to enhance supply chain resilience through digitalization.</jats:p>"

In the present research, a hybrid Bayesian-optimized Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, which accurately forecasts backorder risk within SCM, has been developed. The methodology employed encompasses the creation of a mathematical classification model and utilises diverse machine learning algorithms to predict the risks associated with backorders in a supply chain.

Private sector engagement in public health supply chains increases market competitivity, improves efficiency and allows for cost reduction, while enabling ministries of health to focus on their core competencies and become stewards of their supply chain operations. The paper highlights best practices on strategic outsourcing for contracting entities and third-party logistics (3PL) to minimise risk. Strategic outsourcing has become increasingly common across LMIC contexts as emerging economies take advantage of private sector growth; however, outsourcing does not automatically mean increased efficiency or transparency, unless it is done properly. Recommended best practices include ensuring transparent and fair competition; understanding market capabilities and geographical constraints, as well as available infrastructure; setting up key performance indicators; improving service agility; and creating the best distribution network for higher efficiency. The paper also presents three case studies, including lessons learned and results from strategic outsourcing in Zambia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Hotel supply chain management (SCM) refers to the material service that takes a hotel as the core object. At present, the main method is centralized SCM, which uses integer programming or mixed integer programming to establish and solve the allocation management of various resources among hotels in the supply chain. In this article, based on ant colony algorithm (ACA), the hotel SCM mode is studied and optimized. The research shows that the convergence path is A-S4-M3-L3-D1-R1-T. Therefore, the optimal partner combination meeting the requirements of the supply chain is S4, M3, L3, D1 and R1. The experiment shows that the max-min ACA is effective to solve the problem of partner selection in hotel supply chain. By using enterprise management technology, information technology, network technology and SCM technology under ACA, the effective rules and control of information flow, logistics, capital flow, business flow and value flow in the whole supply chain can be achieved, and the maximum benefit of the whole hotel supply chain can be realized.</p>",

Firstly, an analysis is conducted on the supply chain information of the fruit and vegetable industry, where traceability codes and product information from various stages of the supply chain are organized and extracted. Next, a trusted traceability optimization model is established based on blockchain technology. Finally, an information traceability system for the VFSC is implemented using Hyperledger fabric, and an improved Kafka load balancing algorithm is proposed to enhance message transmission efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the multi-chain traceability model proposed outperforms traditional single-chain blockchain models in terms of query efficiency when the number of data records exceeds 1000. After 10000 data records are deployed on the blockchain, the efficiency of the multi-chain model is improved by over 90% compared to the traditional single-chain model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern logistics requires companies which implement ease of access, quick information processing, and security conditions in their enterprises. The foundation of this transformation lies in transportation processes that prioritize customer demands for reduced transit times, product availability, and efficient delivery. Modern systems encompass transportation exchanges, as well as tools like TMS (Transportation Management Systems), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), and Truck &amp; Tracing systems. These systems enable logistics professionals to navigate the entire logistics process chain. In the present day, companies are adopting a project management approach to develop innovative solutions for their operations. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI) market research, project management practitioners widely embrace agile principles as an effective project management technique. By utilizing TMS, ERP, warehouse control systems, and other automated planning, organizing, and control tools for logistics activities, businesses can drive operational improvements. In the future, businesses will establish global networks that leverage cyber-physical systems encompassing machinery, warehouse systems, and production facilities. This research aims to explore how companies are implementing new agile approaches in their logistics and supply chain services, as well as the impact of logistics 4.0 and logistics 5.0 on businesses and customer service. In this research, more samples from the industries are examined and a comprehensive literature review regarding logistics and supply chain are presented. </jats:p>",

While supply chain analysts had predicted a disruption to the flow of commodities across all sectors, curiosity and concern led us to study the effect of disruptions such as Covid-19 on the supply chain of essential commodities in Africa precisely Lagos, Nigeria. The two types of data sources utilized were; the primary source and secondary sources of data. The data collected was collated and analysed using 2016 Microsoft excel sheet and Statistical Products and Services Solution (SPSS 25.0.0.0) for data analysis. The interview with pharmaceuticals company representative, suggested hiccups in the distribution of vaccines by a major pharmaceutical company to their respective customers. The Covid-19 situation and the necessary lockdown in Lagos state caused a slight disruption in the availability and distribution of essential commodities across the state, the major issues were the lack of a means of accessing transportation to health care facilities and the increment in the price of medicines. While most pharmaceuticals and health service delivery points were not prepared to curb the impact of the emergency situation. In this regard, pharmaceutical companies should ensure flexibility in supply chain by creating supply chain emergency plans, the government should look into establishing a drug bank for essential commodities in the state, while last mile service deliveries should employ the use of telemedicine and patient home delivery services.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to assess how sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) influences sustainable supply chain ambidexterity (SCA) to achieve environmental performance (EP) for textile sector of an under developed economy such as Pakistan, besides exploring whether top management commitment (TMC) moderates the relationship between SSCM and EP. This study collected survey data from 240 exporters in the textile sector. It employed the PLS-SEM (Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling) technique to evaluate the hypothesized relationships. This study found that SSCM positively, directly and indirectly, impacted EP. SCA partially mediated the correlation between SSCM and EP. Additionally, TMC moderated the relationship between SSCM and SCA. TMC had a direct and positive effect on SCA. The insights into how SSCM influences SCA to achieve EP for textile sector in an emerging economy like Pakistan provides an original value. Moreover, the novelty of this study is further reinforced by the coverage of the newfound mechanism, where TMC moderates the relationship between SSCM and SCA, directly and positively enhancing SCA.

However, little is known about cities’ vulnerability to climate-related food supply shocks. Here, using data-driven and network-based approaches, we determine the vulnerability of cities in the United States to domestic drought-related food shocks. Our vulnerability framework integrates key traits—resilience, exposure, and sensitivity to disruption—of a social-ecological system’s response to hazard. We find that vulnerability varies considerably across cities. It tends to be high for western cities because of both high supply chain exposure to water stress and high urban food insecurity. Using the 2012–2013 U.S. drought as a case study, we show that high-vulnerability cities are associated with more extreme food shocks and greater food supply losses than low-vulnerability cities. Our vulnerability framework can help inform climate adaptation interventions for food system security in urban-rural interactions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>In this research, multivariate statistical analysis was performed to assess the water quality of 4 important drinking water sources in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. For this, nineteen water quality parameters (WQP) were applied twice a year, for the period 2013-2018, to assess water quality from different sources. The evaluation was conducted on tree water surface (SWS) and one groundwater source (GWS), separately. Analysis of outliers, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and the Ward method were carried out to identify the quality of water from different sources. There were higher coefficients of variation for metals, color, turbidity, and total phosphorus. The multivariate analysis pointed out that variables with the highest correlation and grouping in the springs indicate the movement of soil particles into water bodies and their degradation, due to the lack of protection in the areas of these relevant sources of supply.</p>"

However, there is limited research on how to improve the performance of socially responsible supply chains. This study innovatively chooses a dual perspective, i.e., companies and farmers in contract farming, the dominant model of socially responsible supply chains in Chinese agriculture, as the research object. Furthermore, it examines the role of social capital on the performance of socially responsible supply chains, as well as the moderating role of supply chain transparency, in order to find out how to improve the stakeholder performance. The empirical results found that the factors affecting socially responsible supply chain performance differed between the dual perspectives. From the firm’s perspective, all three dimensions of social capital (shared values, communication and reciprocity) have a significant positive effect on socially responsible supply chain performance (income increase), while supply chain transparency only positively moderates between communication and income increase. From the farmers’ perspective, only reciprocity and shared values had a significant positive effect on income increase; interestingly, supply chain transparency negatively moderated the relationship between reciprocity and income increase. This study expands the role of social capital theory, and the dual perspective examination provides insights for performance improvement of companies and farmers in socially responsible supply chains, as well as guidance for promoting sustainable social development.</jats:p>"

In recent years, major disruption risk events haveemerged, disrupting complex SCNs. Since a global SCN is the aggregation of several sub-SCNs in terms of industries and countries (regions) and is temporally changing in its topological characteristics, robustness toward risk should be analysed by the community in consideration of its temporality. In this study, we aim (i) to propose a method to generate temporal SCNs of multiple communities, (ii) to evaluate the robustness of each SCN against error and attack risks, and (iii) to identify the topological features that influence the robustness of SCNs using real transaction data between firms. As a result, eight SCNs weredetected based on industries and countries, and the size of these SCNsincreased over time. The average shortest path length and degree distribution have similar impacts on each SCN, while the cluster structure diverges among SCNs. Regarding robustness against error and attack risk, unlike in existing studies, the SCNs are significantly partitioned at the initial firm removal rate. Only for attack risk, percolation transition was found at approximately 10% removal of firms. The relationship between robustness indicators and topological features is identified by panel data analysis, and we find that the significant topological features affecting robustness differ by type of risk.</jats:p>"

The second purpose is to put forth a conceptual framework for the GSCM that is sustainable in the event of future turbulence similar to that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. With regard to the issues raised, the article posits the following questions. Is there, perhaps, a sustainable post-COVID-19 pandemic GSCM? Can the COVID-19 pandemic-related international logistics system (GSC) turbulences be predicted with certainty using these sustainable post-COVID-19 pandemic GSCM concepts?

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Maritime ports represent an important ecosystem for pollutant emissions and, taking into account the ongoing energy transition, need to adopt new solutions to mitigate current emission levels. These emissions are partially avoidable if ships and vessels docked at the port use electric energy to feed their internal power needs instead of using their internal combustion engines. In Europe, there is an ongoing discussion on including such emissions in the European Emissions Trading System which will represent added costs for maritime operators. Onshore Power Supply systems can contribute to the ongoing energy transition by allowing the use of electric power to feed docked ships. As a first step to contribute to the development of Onshore Power Supply solutions, it is necessary to evaluate the added power needs that these systems would represent for the port. This paper presents a methodology that allows port operators to verify, straightforwardly and transparently, their power needs for Onshore Power Supply applications. The methodology is based on the historical data of docked ships at the port or quay level and provides an energy analysis of each type of vessel to determine the power to be installed at the port so that it is possible to supply energy to different types of ships and vessels simultaneously. Additionally, the implemented methodology provides economic and technical decision support factors by comparing the fuel costs with electric power costs, assessing the potential for this transition to Onshore Power Supply. The methodology is validated using a real case study for the port of Lisbon and obtained results demonstrate the potential for the installation of Onshore Power Supply in medium to large-dimension maritime ports.</jats:p>"

The August 2023 wildfires on the\nisland of Maui, Hawaii, USA, have highlighted weaknesses at this\nintersection. We analyze this extreme case to support disaster-response\nlessons for water utilities and to guide further research and policy.\nFirst, emergency water releases were not available in a timely manner.\nSecond, fire and wind toppled power lines, causing power outages that\ninhibited pumping water. Third, many structures were a total loss\ndespite water doused on them, consuming valuable water. Finally, water\nwas lost through damaged premise plumbing in burned structures, further\nreducing system pressure. These conditions emphasize that water\nutilities need to access emergency water supplies quickly, establish\nreliable backup electricity, coordinate with firefighters on priority\nwater uses, and shut valves in burned areas to preserve water. While\nfurther research will certainly follow, we present these early lessons\nas starting points.</jats:p>"

We also assess how other socio-demographic and climatic conditions may influence water use and water rates decisions across municipalities. Besides investigating the potential determinants of water demand, the paper also looks at several supply-side variables and the income gap to address the endogeneity of water block prices.

The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods, droughts, and heatwaves) have hurt lives, displaced communities, destroyed logistics networks, disrupted the flow of goods and services, and caused delays, capacity failures, and immense costs. This study presents a strategic approach we term “Climate-Change Resilient, Sustainable Supply Chain Risk Management” (CCR-SSCRM) to address CC risks in supply chain management (SCM) pervading today’s business world. This approach ensures supply chain sustainability by balancing the quadruple bottom line pillars of economy, environment, society, and culture. A sustainable supply chain analytics perspective was employed to support these goals, along with a systematic literature network analysis of 699 publications (2003–2022) from the SCOPUS database. The analysis revealed a growing interest in CC and supply chain risk management, emphasizing the need for CCR-SSCRM as a theoretical guiding framework. The findings and recommendations may help to guide researchers, policymakers, and businesses. We provide insights on constructing and managing sustainable SCs that account for the accelerating impacts of CC, emphasizing the importance of a proactive and comprehensive approach to supply chain risk management in the face of CC. We then offer directions for future research on CCR-SSCRM and conclude by underlining the urgency of interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of climate considerations into SCM for enhanced resilience and sustainability.</jats:p>"

The article examines the peculiarities of the method of determining fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances of engines of vehicles with gasoline and gas supply systems, which are equipped with a thermal preparation system with a phase transition thermal accumulator. The analysis of methods for estimating fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances of engines, taking into account the formation in the operating conditions of thermal preparation, was performed. An algorithm for determining and evaluating individual criteria for ensuring the thermal preparation of a transport engine in operating conditions has been developed. The method of calculating fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances in the exhaust gases of vehicles with engines converted to work on gas fuel, equipped with a phase transition heat accumulator, specifically in the processes of pre-startup and post-startup thermal preparation, has been improved. As a result of the implementation of the developed method for determining the fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances of vehicle engines with gasoline and gas supply systems, the possibility of determining a significant reduction in the operating conditions of the time parameters of the thermal preparation (warm-up) of the vehicle engine and reducing the fuel consumption (gasoline / gas) for warm-up was confirmed.</jats:p>"

The cessation of tourism activities has an impact on weakening the competence of trained tourism human resources, which has led to a decrease in competitiveness. As a result, it is difficult for Bali’s tourism industry to restart its activities immediately. The situation is not only detrimental to the tourism industry in Bali, but also has a negative impact on the resilience of Indonesian tourism as a whole. The main goal of Bali’s economic recovery program is to prepare its economy so that its growth can accelerate at the end of the Covid-19 pandemic and return to its pre-pandemic level by 2024. The recovery of the tourism sector also means the recovery of Bali’s economy. Although not yet optimal, tourism actors at the moment must prepare themselves to capture the momentum of tourism opening and global tourism trends, including new normal conditions, so that Bali can compete with other tourism destinations in the world. Therefore, a strategy is needed to improve the resilience of tourism actors from the supply side towards the transformation of Bali’s economy which is targeted to create higher economic growth in the long term at 7.7 percent by 2045.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked interesting discussions among government officials, public health practitioners, and scholars on how to maintain the security of the global pharmaceutical supply chain and how to decrease dependency on countries such as China. This article discusses the experiences and initial findings of tracing global pharmaceutical supply chains through pharmaceutical trade fairs and events at multiple locations. I argue that the reasons behind antibiotic supply shortages are multifold. Although the geographical concentration of the production of key raw materials and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in China is considered the main reason for the unstable and disrupted supply chain, it is also important to recognize that the same forces that have driven Western pharmaceutical companies to shift some of their less profitable manufacturing lines to China are also challenging Chinese pharmaceutical companies to adjust and reorient their strategies. As such, antibiotics are facing a conundrum in which the governance of excessive use is complicated by a shortage problem that hampers access to essential drugs.</jats:p>"

The results show that carbon tax is advantageous in driving economic growth. Different government subsidies stimulate consumption leading to profit growth. The carbon market is easier to implement and control but is still in its infancy and needs to be supported by relevant policies. Manufacturers and retailers in different industrial supply chains have different preferences when it comes to different subsidies, and the right subsidies can lead to higher social welfare and economic efficiency.</jats:p>"

Methods: The electronic control system controlled the gas supply and the spark plug ignition. A low pressure injection valve was set in the inlet pipe to form a lean mixture while a high pressure injection valve was placed in the subsidiary chamber to create a rich mixture, which was then ignited and injected into the main combustor, where the lean mixture was subsequently ignited again to achieve stratified combustion. Results: The test results showed that steady ignition is feasible in the system and verified the impact of the shape of the main combustor on HC, the impact of channel diameter on NOX production, and the impact of the ratios of high-pressure gas and low-pressure gas on HC and NOX. The combustion conditions of high-pressure gas and low-pressure gas in the engine combustor vary greatly. Our results signify that the shape of the main combustor has a great impact on the performance of the engine, that is, a shorter propagation distance can reduce the generation of HC. Conclusion: The best ignition advance angle under different conditions was determined using a spark ignition natural gas engine. The ratios of high-pressure gas and low-pressure gas greatly impact the performance and emission of the engine. The reduced diameter of the channels between the main and subsidiary combustors can enhance the stratification and facilitate the secondary ignition.</jats:p>"

Our study helps to alleviate this issue by examining food fraud risk management in the Asia–Pacific honey supply chain. We conducted interviews about existing food fraud risk management practices. We then used the Gioia method to generate a framework of these management practices, which expanded the “Six Ts” framework by adding a seventh dimension of Tolerance to this extant framework. Next, we empirically examined this novel Seven Ts framework. We found that managers treat many of these risk management practice dimensions as substitutes rather than complements. Our findings and managerial guidance are practically relevant for food companies. Lastly, we believe that, by implementing some of these suggestions theoretically generated and empirically validated by our framework, food supply chains may become more sustainable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plasma generation by means of electrical discharge requires specialized power supply systems. The applicability of plasma for various plasma processes depends on its parameters, and these in turn depend on the parameters of the power supply systems. Arc plasma can be unstable, generating a lot of electromagnetic interference and overvoltage and overcurrent. The power system of a plasma reactor must guarantee good plasma control characteristics, be immune to disturbances and ensure good cooperation with the power grid. The article analyzes the cooperation of a three-phase plasma reactor, with gliding arc discharge, with a power supply system of a new type. This system integrates an AC/DC/AC converter with a five-column transformer of special design in a single device. Using the properties of magnetic circuits, it was possible to integrate the functions of ignition and sustaining the burning of the discharge in the reactor in a single transformer. Proper design of the transformer is crucial to achieve good cooperation of the AC/DC/AC converter with both the plasma reactor and the power supply network. The presented power supply design shows a number of positive features predisposing it to powering arc plasma reactors.</jats:p>"

A Web‐based survey questionnaire was used for the data collection process. The research framework and the derived hypotheses were tested by structural equation modeling. Data were gathered from a sample of 314 participants who are working in manufacturing‐sector enterprises. The targeted respondents were categorized as either managers (IT, engineers, production, operations, logistics, sales, purchasing, etc.), supervisors (IT/technical/operational workers, etc.) in medium and large‐sized enterprises (MLEs) in developing countries (Jordan, Lebanon, King Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Emirates, Egypt, Oman, Kuwait, and Turkey). The findings of this research indicate that RFID technology usage directly affects the integration with supply chain global positioning information system (SCGPIS) and SCP. Furthermore, SCGPIS achieves enhancing information sharing among supply chain partners, which in turn leads to enhancing SCP. This research paper offers empirical evidence for using RFID technology within the planning‐resources of manufacturing enterprises' context for enhancing their SCP.</jats:p>",

We chose Gangnan Reservoir Basin in the Taihang Mountains as the research area. First, we evaluated the supply and demand of water supply services using the InVEST model and statistical methods. Then, ecosystem service flows were calculated based on river networks and altitude. Finally, the supply and demand pattern of water supply services based on ecosystem service flows was analyzed. The results showed the following. (1) The total supply and demand of water supply services in Gangnan Reservoir Basin were 8.18 × 108 m3 and 3.52 × 108 m3, respectively. (2) At the sub-basin scale, the minimum flow of both static and dynamic water supply services was the same, and the mean was significantly different. The maximum flow was also significantly different. Static water supply service flows were not significantly correlated with altitude, whereas dynamic water supply service flows were significantly correlated with altitude. (3) The demand area in the supply and demand pattern of water supply services based on dynamic ecosystem service flows was notably less than that based on static ecosystem service flows. The supply and demand patterns of water supply services defined the actual water shortage area, the area that pays for ecosystem services, and the areas of ecosystem service ecological compensation, providing a scientific basis for the safe and rational utilization of water resources in mountainous areas.</jats:p>"

We formulate the problem as a Stackelberg-Nash model and investigate the optimal strategies of the online lead time and prices. We further analyze the impacts of online lead time sensitivity and perishability of fresh agricultural products on supply chain operation strategies and profits. Our analysis reveals that: (1) Products with high perishability require shorter online lead time, resulting in a higher online retail price, while the profits of farmer and e-commerce platform decrease due to the increased costs. Meanwhile, higher online price would make some customers to switch to offline purchase, and the offline retailer can get higher profits. (2) The increasing sensitivity of consumers to online lead time tends to push the online retail prices lower, which in turn leads to lower profits of farmer and e-commerce platform. (3) When the online lead time has a small impact on the offline channel, as consumers become more sensitive to the online lead time, offline retailer’s profit decreases due to the reduced offline demand, while the offline prices might be higher or lower.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we analyze the contribution of countries/regions and sectors to the greening process from 2011 to 2021. We find some evidence of GSC greening over the period as the ratio of renewable energy in total transferred energy increased from 4.2% to 7.6%. Emerging economies that have advanced rapidly in energy transition are gradually overtaking developed countries in their contribution to GSC greening. Sectors with a higher electrification rate are main contributors to GSC greening led by significant inter-sectoral spillovers from the heavy industry and business services. However, transfer of embodied renewable energy by high-income developed countries is concentrated in other high-income countries raising concerns of limited access by low-income developing countries and the amelioration of global energy welfare inequality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Building customer-oriented supply chain is a critical strategy that businesses adopt to gain competitive advantage and increase customer satisfaction. This approach requires focusing on customer demands and needs. The 4R approach (responsiveness, resilience, reliability and realignment) developed to build a customer-oriented supply chain provides a solid foundation for the development of the strategy in this context. Businesses can increase customer satisfaction with the ability to respond to rapidly changing demands. Durability and reliability emphasize the ability of supply chains to cope with unexpected challenges, while business process reorganization increases operational efficiency. Similarly, the 4C approach (coordination, collaboration, capability and connection) developed to create customer-oriented supply chains encourages integration throughout the entire supply chain. Coordination and cooperation between businesses ensures efficient information sharing and resource management. Therefore, it aims to create an efficient and flexible structure by connecting all components of the supply chain.   In this study, 4R and 4C approaches, which are developed to gain competitive advantage and create flexible and efficient supply chains that are compatible with customer needs, will be presented with examples from the literature. These approaches are essential for successful competition in today's dynamic business environment.</jats:p>"

This paper mainly analyzes the current sodium ion battery structure, materials, and working principle, compared with other batteries' advantages and disadvantages and future development direction. The second part introduces sodium-ion batteries' anode and cathode materials, as well as the current mainstream materials, composition, and comparison between different mainstream materials. Sodium-ion battery is a relatively advanced battery in modern life, and its advantages are significantly greater than the lithium battery that is now used in life, especially in electric vehicles.</jats:p>"

Hinterland ecosystem services are vital for rapidly urbanizing areas, and the people who live within them. The ecosystem services used up in Mekelle city are provided from the adjacent hinterlands. The current situation indicates that the hinterland ecosystem services supply sources and willingness to pay for its sustainable provision of ecosystem services remain unknown. This study was conducted to provide policy decision making and achieve an improved understanding of the causal relationships between the urban residents' willingness-to pay and hinterland ecosystem services sources. Household survey with 384 urban residents from seven Mekelle’s sub-cities was conducted. The study applied Heckman’s two stage model using STATA to analyze the factors affecting the residents’ WTP. To study hinterland ecosystem services satellite images were used and were analysed using ERDAS imagine 15 and ArcGIS 10.5.1. The results showed that 91.7% of the surveyed respondents are willing to pay for hinterland ecosystem services supply and had an average WTP of 2.21 USD per month. This could additionally enhance the perceptions of urban residents on ecosystem services. The factors that significantly influence WTP include variables M1(years of stay in Mekelle city), M2(Sex), occupation(M9), income (M10), family size(M11), water quantity (M12), water reliability(M13) and ecosystem services value recognition(M15).With regard to payout levels, the influencing factors include M1(Years of stay in Mekelle city), M2(sex), M9(Occupation), M10(Monthly income of your household), M11(Family size), M12(Water quantity), M13(Water reliability) and M15(Ecosystem services value recognition) are significantly related to WTP and payout levels. The results of this empirical study could help policy makers to understand better the ways to enhance ecosystem services supply for urban areas from hinterland ecosystem services and to identify effective policy instruments.</p>"

Integration of NTD commodities into the national health system supply chain is central to the integrated approach; however, there is minimal evidence on enablers and barriers. Drawing on qualitative evaluation data, we illustrate that perceived benefits and strengths to integrating NTD commodities into the supply chain include leveraged storage and management capacities capitalized at lower system levels; the political will to integrate based on cost-saving and capacity strengthening potential and positive progress integrating paper-based reporting tools. Challenges remain, specifically the risk of reliance on donor funding; difficulty in accessing commodities due to bureaucratic bottlenecks; lack of inclusion of NTD commodities within electronic data tools and poor coordination leading to an inability to meet demand. Collectively, the negative consequences of ineffective integration of NTD commodities into the supply chain has a detrimental impact on health workers (including community health workers) unable to deliver the quality of care to patients.

The essence of the supply chain optimization category was studied, the problem areas with which it is connected were systematized in terms of such components as stocks, risks, demand, expectations. The phases of supply chain optimization, which include design, planning and execution stages, are developed and graphically presented. The need to track key indicators of the supply chain is established and the most informative of them are displayed, namely: picking and packing time, cash-to-cash time cycle, inventory turnover, gross return on investment, delivery timeliness indicator, delivery terms and reasons for returns. A parallel has been drawn between theoretical developments and the practice of their implementation on the device of Ukraine in the conditions of a pandemic and war. Measures that have a positive effect on the optimization of the supply chain using innovative warehouse and routing technologies have been identified.

Subsequently, through the use of focus group discussions, the feasibility of a patent pool strategy within the supply chain was explored. Finally, a strategy framework was proposed for Project-based patent pool licensing, focusing on the top 15 projects with the highest count of 5,579 patents. The results indicated that adopting this strategy framework for supply chain manufacturer patents can result in higher commercial patent value.</jats:p>"

In this endeavor, the author would adopt a qualitative research approach, focusing on narrative analysis of various news articles and studies on the impact of pandemics on supply chains. The data for this study would be mostly obtained through internet searches, focusing on a combination of various news websites and empirical studies obtained from Google Scholar's database. Accordingly, the results of this study indicate that the problem in the graphic card supply chain was mainly caused by the mistaken predictions of the graphic card producers that caused them to reduce their inventories in the face of rising consumer demands, which is caused mainly by the inability of the producers to switch their suppliers due to the centralized and small nature of the producers in the industry.</jats:p>"

Our paper looks at three core elements of the problems: measurement of the links that expose supply chains to disruptions, the nature of the shocks that cause the disruptions, and the criteria for policy to mitigate the impact of disruptions. Utilizing global input-output data, we show that the US exposure to foreign suppliers, and particularly to China, is \"hidden\" in the sense that it is much larger than what conventional trade data suggest. However, at the macro level, exposure remains relatively modest, given that over 80 percent of US industrial inputs are sourced domestically. We argue that many recent shocks to supply chains have been systemic rather than idiosyncratic. Moreover, systemic shocks are likely to arise from climate change, geoeconomic tensions, and digital disruptions. Our principal conclusion is that the concerns regarding supply chain disruptions, and policies to address them, should focus on individual products rather than the whole manufacturing sector.</jats:p>",

With the improvement of case performance and miniaturization requirements, heat dissipation becomes one of the important factors to be considered in the design process. First,The existing small electronic thermal design methods focus on heat dissipation structure or heat source layout optimization,and ignores on-load test for modeling analysis. Second,The selected power module has on-load power consumption, resulting in relatively low calorific value and the effectiveness of thermal design cannot be verified. Third, The thermal lacks Intelligent monitoring and feedback control mechanism. In order to solve these problems, this paper designs a kind of heat dissipation case with intelligent temperature control based on high-power and high-density power supply array. Based on the extremely miniaturization design principle, we adopt the composite heat dissipation mode based on conduction and supplemented by forced air cooling . The case is made of magnesium and aluminum alloy with a perforated design. Finally, we compare and analyze with the existing cooling design. The results show that the case is smaller in volume, and the cooling performance parameters are slightly better than the existing case. Under the condition of high-density and high-power design, The output power of the whole system is not less than 10kw and the lowest packing-level density is not less than 47w/cm2 with high reliability, portability and practicability. It also provides technical support and prototype support for the standardized design of similar power arrays.</jats:p>"

This could not be more evident than in the global effort to eradicate forced labour from supply chains by 2030, which has resulted in a plethora of regulations, some with mandatory reporting obligations and others with simple due diligence requirements. This paper outlines a strategy to develop a comprehensive alignment across an organisation’s supply chain, encompassing recommended forced labour initiatives that will meet or exceed applicable legislative mandates. The paper’s focus is specifically on the USA Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), because it requires a unique approach that immediately affects any company shipping to the US. UFLPA authorises the US Customs and Border (CBP) agency to stop, seize and/or detain a shipment at the border and hold indefinitely until the US importer of record (IOR) can clearly and concisely demonstrate the shipment has not been made through forced labour, wholly or in part thereof. The impact of this legislation and CBP’s initiative has affected US importers and their foreign suppliers, with 3,605 shipments seized, detained or destroyed in 2022 alone. UFLPA enforcement is making more of an impression than most penalties associated with other legislation seeking the same outcome.</jats:p>"

Today, the reported mean water production for the cities, on average, is about 300 l/capita/d, including drinking and industrial water supplies. The territory of Albania has an uneven distribution of very heterogeneous aquifers conditioning often the difficulty of municipal water supply solutions. In this article, are analyzed and classified the hydrogeological aspects of the water supply sources of the settlements, which are summarized in five groups: (a) wells in alluvial intergranular aquifers; (b) karst springs; (c) wells in karst aquifers; (d) springs in fissured rocks; and (e) mixed water sources. For each group of the water supply sources, the main concerns regarding the quantity and quality problems are analyzed, facilitated by the description of a variety of representative examples of different situations. Based on the gained experience, important recommendations are given for the better understanding of hydrogeological aspects of water supply systems, related to the river water recharge areas, the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers, and the high vulnerability of karst aquifers, as well as transboundary aquifers. However, the main problem of public water supply of Albania remains the poor management of water supply systems, which is reflected in the significant water losses, as well as the low public awareness of requests for sustainable use.</jats:p>"

But both in Ukraine and around the world, the war is also increasing vulnerability to climate change, proliferating security risks, complicating efforts on decarbonization and hindering multilateral climate action.  Ukraine already faced challenges in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Damage wrought on the country’s environment and infrastructure by the war has only made these challenges harder to overcome. Meanwhile, the war has led to unprecedented volatility in global food prices, increasing hunger and deprivation in other parts of the world. It has also upended global energy politics, with short-term decisions by policymakers increasing the risk of new carbon emissions being locked in for the long term.  This research paper explores the potential consequences of Russia’s war for climate action, food supply and energy security, both for Ukraine and globally.

A backorder can only be successful if the supplier can be relied upon to provide the out-of-stock product when required or if the consumer is prepared to wait for the product without becoming impatient. So, to avoid uncertain circumstances and lessen the loss, it is important to know which goods are more likely to be back-ordered ahead of time so that appropriate measures can be taken. This work presents a backorder predictive model based on an imbalanced historical dataset obtained from an online source. The data has undergone sampling techniques, various Machine Learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics. After Random Undersampling (RUS), Random Forest (RF) achieved the highest accuracy of 99.328% while an accuracy of 98.917% was obtained from Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, which was highest after applying Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). XGBoost has outperformed other models with highest ROC-AUC score of 94.55% and 95.93% for oversampled and undersampled data respectively. In this paper, we made a visualization of the attributes of the dataset, then applied and analyzed Machine Learning algorithms to predict the backorder.</jats:p>"

The calculations were made on the basis of a commonly used model of an induction machine. The difference from many papers is that the parameters of the equivalent circuit of each motor were precisely determined in terms of power losses in the motor. The load capacity of the motors was made dependent on the load power losses in the rotor cage. These losses were determined on the basis of short-circuit measurements of motors, made for frequencies equal to harmonic frequencies. Measurements and calculations were made for low-voltage squirrel-cage motors with rated powers of 4–65 kW and various efficiency classes. Calculations have shown that the calculated derating curves do not match the curves given in IEC 60034-17 and NEMA MG1. The differences are up to 15% for IE1 and IE2 motors and more than 50% for IE3 motors.</jats:p>"

This system with integrated BIM, IoT, and GIS modules was applied in a new manufacturing company within its first five years. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin platform.

The primary objective is to reduce adversarial negative impacts on the environment, particularly those stemming from consumption of energy and water. Embracing sustainable business practices is increasingly essential for organizations and in addressing pressing global challenges. Based on 439 valid responses obtained through cross-sectional research from Turkish manufacturing firms, and combining practice-based view and organizational information processing theory, this study examines the effect of SSCP on economic performance (EP). The mediating roles of social performance (SP) and environmental performance (ENP) were examined. The moderating role of Industry 4.0 was further explored with regard to the aforementioned links. The results revealed that SSCP has a positive effect on EP. SSCP has positive effects on SP and ENP. SP and ENP have positive effects on EP. The relationship between SSCP and EP is partially mediated by both SP and ENP. Further, it was discovered that in firms with a high level of Industry 4.0 technologies usage, the impact of SSCP on ENP was stronger, and in firms with high level of Industry 4.0, the impact of SSCP on EP was also stronger. The findings offer valuable insights for research, as well as for managers, supply chain practitioners, and policymakers, in developing an integrated strategic and effective approach that promotes sustainable operations by using improved understanding of Industry 4.0, which also yields better economic outcomes.</jats:p>"

Many businesses have wondered how the arrival of AI will affect planning, organization, optimization, and logistics in the context of SCM. Information symmetry is very important here, as maintaining consistency between output and the supply chain is aided by processing and drawing insights from big data. We consider continuous (production) and discontinuous (supply chain) data to satisfy delivery needs to solve the shortage problem. Despite a surplus of output, this article addresses the voluptuous deficiency problem in supply chain administration. This research serves as an overview of AI for SCM practitioners. The report then moves into an in-depth analysis of the most recent studies on and applications of AI in the supply chain industry. This work introduces a novel approach, Incessant Data Processing (IDP), for handling harmonized data on both ends, which should reduce the risk of incorrect results. This processing technique detects shifts in the data stream and uses them to predict future suppressions of demand. Federated learning gathers and analyzes information at several points in the supply chain and is used to spot the shifts. The learning model is educated to forecast further supply chain actions in response to spikes and dips in demand. The entire procedure is simulated using IoT calculations and collected data. An improved prediction accuracy of 9.93%, a reduced analysis time of 9.19%, a reduced data error of 9.77%, and increased alterations of 10.62% are the results of the suggested method.</jats:p>"

This amounts to about 3300 ZAR per month is spent on energy supply using grid electricity. Grid electricity in South Africa is supplied by a huge governmental organisation at about R3..00 per kWhr, including taxes. Statistical analyses indicate that the current increase of the cost of grid electricity in South Africa is about 60% per annum. Solar energy irradiation levels in South Africa are about 850 W/m2 on average in summer. This study shows that by utilising a hybrid combination of renewable energies, such as combining PV supply with solar thermal energy absorbers, converting thermal energy to electricity, and also using petroleum gas and wind turbine energy supply systems as supplements, could reduce the current cost of electricity per household in South Africa to about half of the national grid supply prize, i.e about R1.50 per kWh. The study also shows that water provides as a most viable medium to store energy overnight, instead of using expensive battery technology to perform such functions. Our research also show that Photo-Voltaic (PV) only technology can offer as viable second alternative, provided a large initial capital outlay can be made. The cost of this type of electricity utilised, capitalized over 20 years, is around 2.80 ZAR.</p>"

Data for extractable resources of scandium were found and evaluated by application of estimated yields. The feasible extractable resource is about 6.1 million ton, and with present technology, about 676,000 ton scandium appear as potentially extractable. The potential for scandium extraction is about 1,500 ton/year at present, but only about 45 ton per year was produced in 2022. With improved extraction and access yields, production could be increased to about 450 ton per year, and the scandium resource would increase to about 1.5 million ton. The investigation suggests that there will be an increased demand for scandium metal in the future, but that it is limited by the high price and the lack of a properly functioning market and by a lack of production infrastructure. The scandium market show signs of being disorganized and unstructured. Modelling of future scandium production was done using the WORLD7 integrated assessment model, after development of a scandium module. Simulations show that the price will remain relatively high, but lower than in the past. The most uncertain factor for predicting the price is the size of the demand. The main limitation for making scandium metal is high energy costs and low extraction yields.</p>"

This paper examines the decarbonization potential of hydrogen for the heating industry. Worldwide, 99% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, because hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources remains prohibitively expensive compared with its conventional counterpart. However, due to the expansion of renewable energy sources and the current energy crisis of conventional energy sources, hydrogen from renewable energy sources is becoming more and more economical. To optimize the efficiency of green hydrogen production and make it more price-competitive, the author simulates a hydrogen production plant consisting of a photovoltaic plant, a power grid, hydrogen storage, an electrolyser, a natural gas purchase option, a district heating plant and households. Using the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm from deep reinforcement learning, the plant is designed to optimize itself by simulating different production scenarios and deriving strategies. The connected district heating plant is used to map how hydrogen can be optimally used for heat supply. A demonstrable outcome of this paper is that the utilization of deep deterministic policy gradient, over the course of a full year, can result in a competitive production of hydrogen derived from renewable or stored energy sources for the heating industry as a natural gas substitute.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper explores the impact of delayed retirement policy initiation on Chinas labor supply by means of data analysis and policy research. It is found that the impact of the delayed retirement policy on Chinas labor supply is mainly fourfold. First, at the short-term level, it leads to a greater labor supply than demand. Second, at the long-term level, it can alleviate part of the labor shortage caused by aging. Third, it can promote the accumulation and full utilization of labor capital. Finally, delaying retirement may cause the crowding out of labor jobs for young people. This shows that the impact of delayed retirement policy on Chinas labor supply is both positive and negative. A reasonable retirement policy can ensure a reasonable supply of labor force in the long run, thus ensuring economic development.</jats:p>"

This paper demonstrates above mentioned scenario in the context of supply chain management (SCM). Despite enduring a series of disruptions, including the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, notably the situation between Ukraine and Russia, the Bangladeshi economy has displayed remarkable resilience. In the fiscal year 2019-20, there was a significant decline in GDP growth, dropping from 7.88 percent in the pre-pandemic year to 3.45 percent. However, there was a notable resurgence in GDP growth, surging to 6.94 percent in FY 2020-21 and further rising to 7.10 percent in FY 2021-22. Unfortunately, the economic growth for FY 2022-23 has been impeded by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of an economy is a composite of contributions from three key sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. As the economic landscape evolves, the significance of the agriculture sector diminishes, while the industrial sector gains prominence. This research is developed based on primary and secondary data sources, encompassing online databases, journals, review papers, and more. The primary data collection includes a comprehensive survey questionnaire completed by 207 respondents from 24 industrial sectors in Bangladesh. The study addresses multiple challenges faced by warehouse operations and offers recommendations for best practices and a strategic way forward in the global arena for Bangladesh, where priorities such as achieving net-zero emissions, sustainability, and the adoption of lean warehouse operations are paramount. Furthermore, the study advocates for the implementation of the Integrated Supply Chain Performance Measurement (ISCPM) model, along with its ten attributes, as an integral component of adopting global best practices for practitioners, which would unlock further research to develop this sector.</jats:p>"

However, replacing ammonia currently produced using fossil fuels will not be immediate. To this end, we develop a supply chain transition model, which first optimizes the design and hourly operation of new renewable ammonia facilities to minimize production costs and then optimizes the annual installation timing, production scale, and location of these new renewable facilities along with ammonia transportation to meet county resolution demands. The objective is to augment and eventually replace conventional ammonia market imports in an economically competitive manner. We performed a case study for Minnesota's ammonia supply chain and found that a full transition to in‐state renewable production by 2032 is optimal. This is incentivized by the U.S. federal government's clean hydrogen production credits. This transition results in 99 % reduction in carbon intensity along with stable supply costs below $475 per metric tonne. New renewable production facilities are an order of magnitude smaller than existing conventional plants. They use both wind and solar resources and operate dynamically to minimize expensive battery and hydrogen storage capacities.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of machine learning strategies for predictive maintenance within the framework of supply chain management. Traditional procedures of maintenance often cause inefficiencies and interruptions in the supply chain as a result of unanticipated breakdowns of various pieces of equipment. It is possible to greatly improve both the reliability and performance of supply chain operations via the use of predictive maintenance approaches. This article starts out by giving an overview of predictive maintenance and the role that it plays in supply chain management. The issues that are presented by unanticipated equipment failures and the cascade consequences that these failures have on the supply chain are discussed. In the context of predictive maintenance, a number of different techniques to machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning, are analyzed and discussed. In addition to this, the study digs into data-gathering strategies, discussing topics such as sensor data, past maintenance records, and external influences that might influence the health of equipment. In addition, the article discusses the implementation issues that are associated with installing predictive maintenance systems in supply chain environments. Some of these challenges include data quality and integration, real-time decision-making, cost concerns, and others. This paper investigates the role that edge computing and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices play in making data gathering, analysis, and preventative maintenance more efficient.</jats:p>"

The development of realistic supply chain designs that work effectively in the presence of disturbances in a stochastic environment and incorporate sustainability factors, is a complex challenge being investigated in recent years. However, the inclusion of a methodological structured framework to evaluate environmental impacts constitutes a knowledge gap in the literature on supply chain design. This study developed a model for sustainable supply chain design, integrating Life Cycle Assessment and based on a robust optimization approach. The study follows a 4-stage methodology beginning with data collection and the execution of a Life Cycle Assessment. Then, the deterministic modeling is proposed, concluding with a robust model. A bi-objective model is proposed to maximize utility and minimize environmental impact based on demand scenarios. The model was validated with real data from a medium-sized enterprise that produces antibacterial gel, generating as a result, different configuration alternatives for the supply chain to transport the products and raw materials between its elements. The conclusions of this work highlight the importance of including sustainability factors during supply chain design, the consequences and costs of its inclusion, as well as the priority actions that promote sustainable designs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Zinc consumption growth is driven by urbanization and industrialization primarily in developing economies through the galvanization of steel and die casting with end use in the construction, automobile, and machinery parts industries. While global consumption will increase from 13.6Mt in 2022 to 19.8Mt in 2050, growth will slow to 1.2% through structural change in global consumption patterns and decreasing zinc intensities in first use and end use products. To meet this growth in demand, refined zinc supply and mine supply production will need to increase. In the short term, refined zinc capacity at smelters can increase by improvements in utilization rates, and we forecast this to be sufficient until the end of the decade. Later, demand will have to be met with new capacity coming online. The requirement for new zinc mine supply by 2032 is expected to reach 5.6Mt and will necessitate a healthy project pipeline and available finance to construct it. Whilst there is no shortage of projects that could step in, the average lead time from exploration to construction is 14 years and dependent on a variety of risk factors. Recent junior and development company financing has shown strong activity since late 2020 and the size of funding is loosely correlated to the stage of development at which the project is currently in. This suggests that right now, zinc projects are of interest to investors irrespective of which stage of development they are in. Project capital intensities have been in-creasing from their historical average and competitiveness of projects remains linked to their envisaged cash (C1) operating cost. Geology affects a mine’s cashflow in various ways. Projects coming into production have been more polymetallic in nature in recent years, which tends to help to reduce cashflow risk through diversification. Geology also impacts concentrate quality which has implications for product marketing and therefore future revenue. For SedEx, Irish-type and MVT deposits, concentrates typically produced are sought after products by smelters around the World.</jats:p>",

Employing regression discontinuity design and French administrative income data, I find that restricting family allowance eligibility criteria decreases fertility among the richest households. The results also highlight that receiving half the amount of the allowances or none leads to an increase in both male and female labor supply through an increase in overtime work. The implied change in earned income, due to an increase in weekly working hours, is found to be comparable to the euro value reduction in benefits. Auxiliary regression analyses show that the fertility decline reflects a decrease in the probability of having an additional child for parents rather than in the probability of becoming parents for households without children.</jats:p>",

However, many factors decide the implementation of Supply Chain Management results, from the legal provisions and market status at the macro aspect to the executive philosophy of the manager at the micro level. As a result, this essay will specifically study whether different Social and Economic Perspectives will influence the result of Supply Chain Management benefits enterprises. Although a variety of relevant researches have shown the advantages of applying Supply Chain Management for enterprises, there is still a bias that is easy to be ignored, which is from different Social and Economic perspectives. Therefore, the goal of this essay is to find whether companies using Supply Chain Finance from different Social Economic Perspectives will still be benefited. Based on literature analysis, the main research method of this essay is to analyze and compare the examples of using Supply Chain Management to bring results under a different social and economic market system. For different firms in different social and economic perspectives, Supply Chain Management has its existence significance. Although the implement Supply Chain Management will have some risks, its benefits are more meaningful for the enterprises and market operation.</jats:p>"

The agglomeration of green components enhances and supports the business activities to practice green supply chain more effectively. Utilizing sustainable packaging materials in logistics is a step towards promoting business eco sustainability.  This research work attempts to develop a hybrid decision making model by integrating techniques of fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This research work proposes a decision-making method of IDOCRIW (Integrated Determination of Objective Criteria Weights) under fuzzy environment with linguistic representations to determine the criterion weights of material selection and applies the RL method of Q learning in ranking the packaging materials for promoting green sustainability. The proposed fuzzy based MCDM method resolves the problems of conflict of uncertainty. The ranking results obtained using this method are compared with the non-integrated MCDM method. The proposed combined model shall be discussed under various other extended fuzzy representations. The decision-making problem on optimal selection of packaging materials addressed in this research work benefits the business decision makers to make right choices. This hybrid model will certainly make the logistic environment more robust and also it will upscale the smart framework of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The formerly prevailing paradigm of the absolute superiority of free trade in the global food market is changing in favour of re-localization after vulnerabilities were exposed by the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent disorder in the global food market. Re-localization of food production could also have a positive impact on the environment, public health and sustainable local development. This paper analyses the trends and current conditions in the Croatian food market regarding the potential economic benefits of re-localization of food production. The purpose of the paper is to estimate the economic benefits of food re-localization in Croatia. The method of input–output analysis is applied to test hypotheses. Direct, indirect and induced effects of re-localization of food production are estimated and the results compared with other countries. The results confirm previous findings that re-localization of food production could stimulate the domestic economy. The multipliers estimated for Croatian agricultural and food production do not deviate significantly from the results published for other economies. Output multipliers related to the Croatian food sector are slightly lower than those estimated for new European Union members, while multipliers for the Croatian agriculture sector are in line with those estimated for the same group of countries. It is found that expenditures on domestic food products induce significantly larger economic effects in Croatia than expenditures on imported food. Import substitution and re-localization would also positively affect public finances. Re-localizing 10% of imports of agri-food products could increase the Croatian GDP by 0.32%. The employment effects would be even larger since labour intensity in the food and agriculture sectors is high.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plasma generation by means of electrical discharge requires specialized power supply systems. The applicability of plasma for various plasma processes depends on its parameters, and these, in turn, depend on the parameters of power supply systems. Arc plasma can be unstable, generating a lot of electromagnetic interference, overvoltage and overcurrent. The power system of a plasma reactor must guarantee good plasma control characteristics, be immune to disturbances and ensure good cooperation with the power grid. This article analyzes the cooperation of a three-phase plasma reactor, with a gliding arc discharge and a power supply system of a new type. This system integrates an AC/DC/AC converter and a five-column transformer with a special design in a single device. Using the properties of magnetic circuits, it is possible to integrate the functions of ignition and sustaining the burning of the discharge in the reactor in a single transformer. The proper design of the transformer is crucial to achieve the good cooperation of the AC/DC/AC converter with both the plasma reactor and the power supply network. The presented power supply design shows a number of positive features, predisposing it to powering arc plasma reactors.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted in order to develop a real-time framework for simulating soil–water balance in the root zone, crop growth curve and irrigation planning of rapeseed cultivation in Henan Province, China during a cropping season from March to October 2022. Simulation of production functions with field information calibration at daily time step was developed to accurately estimate the simulation of crop growth and soil water balance. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is incorporated as an efficient tool to evaluate the water productivity as objective function in a self-organizing framework. Choosing the appropriate planting date for rapeseed cultivation at the beginning of the growing season was evaluated to increase the use of precipitation for canopy cover growth and thus reduce irrigation water consumption. The results showed that the proposed model increased water productivity by 23% as the objective function, and evaporation from the soil surface decreased by 16%. The maximum difference between the irrigation depth in the optimal and existing strategies was 41 mm in the germination stages until the seed-filling stage, which caused a decrease in final biomass and plant transpiration.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the impact of service spillovers on emission reduction and channel decisions in a two-echelon supply chain,in which the supplier is a Stackelberg leader and the retailer is a follower.By comparing the equilibrium outcomes of the single-channel and dual-channel supply chain in a setting with and without retail services, we observe that the supplier prefers to encroach on the market when services that retail locations provide largely spillover to and benefit the direct sales channel. Contrary to popular belief, a higher degree of service spillovers is beneficial for the retailer to get more returns under the dual-channel structure, whereas supplier encroachment will lead to a decline in the service level if the spillover degree is relatively low. In addition, the emission reduction level of products under supplier encroachment is always higher than that employed in the single-channel structure if consumers have both low-carbon preference and high degree of service sensitivity. Furthermore, we extend the equilibrium decisions under a carbon cap-and-trade (CCT) mechanism; the results fully verify the above conclusions. Interestingly, the implementation of a carbon price not only motivates carbon emission abatement and supplier encroachment, but also helps achieve a win-win outcome for supply chain members when service spillovers happen.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to analyze enterprise supply chain management. The supply chain involves most of the products in our lives. The paper starts by presenting an overview of supply chain and the importance of it. This paper chooses Apple as an example to analyze supply chain management. Apple is the world's leading high-tech company, which can offer me some experience. The supply chain was not pioneered by Apple, but they do a good job. In the supply chain, part of the enterprise's business is external, which reduces costs and improves production efficiency. Apple is consumer-oriented. Some businesses are external and so on, which makes it a win-win situation for him and his partners. But there are also some problems in Apple's supply chain management, such as excessive exploitation of downstream suppliers and neglect of employee rights and interests. Then this paper discusses how they make changes in order to improve supply management. Finally, we summarize how to effectively manage supply chains in businesses. Apple needs to pay attention to the low-end market, strengthen the supervision of suppliers, reduce the exploitation of suppliers, and truly protect the rights and interests of those suppliers' employees. In addition, it should shorten and optimize the supply chain to make the company's operations more stable.</jats:p>"

Due to the phenomenon of declining financial performance and the phenomenon of outsourcing, a system is needed which is a synergy between SCM and risk management, that is Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). This study aims to further explore the supply chain risks that occur in state-owned construction companies in Indonesia by developing a system that can control risk and play an important role in Vendor Trust, Contractor-Vendor Relationship and Top Management Involvement to measure company performance. The data collection was carried out using a survey method using questionnaires and interviews. Respondents were selected using the purposive sampling method, that experts on Indonesian BUMN construction projects using the Smart PLS analysis method. The results of the study concluded that Vendor Trust has no effect on Supply Chain Risk Management. This is related to the existence of Law No.2 of 2017 reinforced by Minister of BUMN No.08 of 2019 which regulates the readiness of database infrastructure and Vendor criteria. Based on this regulation, a Vendor Management System was created that applies ratings, sanctions and Blacklists to Vendors, if there are errors or even a shortage of Vendor expertise documents, Unverified will occur and the impact on billing to contractors will be hampered so that trust can increase mutually beneficial relationships in long-term partnerships hard to do. Contractor-Vendor Relationship and Top management Involvement influence SCRM. Vendor trust, Contractor-Vendor Relationship and Top Management Involvement influence company performance after being mediated by Supply Chain Risk Management.</jats:p>"

On the basis of the relationship between water and energy, this article took tourist areas as an example to analyze the geographical and spatial distribution characteristics of ecotourism attractions. A comparative analysis was conducted between the experimental group's tourist areas planned using GIS (geographic information system) and the control group's tourist areas planned using traditional planning. It was found that the average ecological and economic income of the experimental group within 1 year was about 1.2661 million yuan, which was higher than the average ecological and economic income of the control group within 1 year. This indicated that using GIS geospatial technology for reasonable planning of tourist areas is important for improving the overall ecological and economic income of tourist areas. This article used this research to explore the importance of rational planning of the ecological economy. Building a good ecological economic structure in tourism development plays an important role in reducing water and energy consumption to promote sustainable development of the tourism industry.</jats:p>",

The study analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict in Ukraine on logistics supply chains, considering environmental, social, and security concerns. The research questions focus on identifying the main changes and assessing their implications for commercial, military, and humanitarian logistics. The prolongation of the conflict in Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia have been found to have a significant impact on logistics capabilities, perceptions of the structure of supply chains and the risks arising from this. The impact of these events is also producing third-country poverty and dehumanizing the UN SDG goals. On the other hand, improvements in NATO troop readiness and weaponry have been noted. The study highlights the need for further research to investigate specific threats for different types of supply chains and to consider the complex and evolving nature of the issue. Ultimately, this research provides insights into the challenges and opportunities facing logistics capabilities in the context of ongoing geopolitical and environmental changes.</jats:p>",

The results of this research showed that the ANN model with DC and RMSE of 0.98 and 0.09025 mm/day, respectively, is more accurate compared to the ACO (with DC = 0.65 and RMSE = 1.45 mm/day) and PSO (with DC = 0.23 and RMSE = 1.60 mm/day) models in the verification stage in estimating daily ET images. The ACO model compared to the PSO model is more accurate in estimating ET images with DC of 0.65 and 0.23 in the verification step, respectively. While removing half of the training data, the accuracy of the PSO model surpasses the ACO model with DC of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively. Also, the ANN model is more accurate than the other two models in estimating ET, both when considering all the data and half of the training data (with DC = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.09 mm/day).</jats:p>",

The results show that the optimal order quantity of retailers is low in equilibrium, which leads to the service level of supply chain is less than 50% and the lead time of supply chain is too long. Encouraging retailers to increase order quantity is the key to improve supply chain service level and reduce supply chain lead time. Reducing the lead time and reducing the cost can not only enable retailers to increase the order quantity, improve the service level of the supply chain to the market demand, but also enable suppliers to reduce the order lead time and improve the response speed of the supply chain to the market demand.</jats:p>"

Facts have proved that China's problem is that the supply cannot change with the changing demand, that is, the lack of effective supply capacity leads to a large number of \"demand spillovers\", leading to a serious outflow of consumption capacity. To solve these structural problems, people must make efforts from the supply side and find the right position in the world supply market. In other words, Chinese government must take improving the supply side structure as the main direction of attack, and realize the leap from the low level of supply and demand balance to the high level of supply and demand balance. Among them, the company system plays a vital role in the company's survival and supply-side structural reform. In 1993, after 30 years of double-digit growth, South Korea ranked among the \"four Asian dragons\" from the poorest country in the world, and its per capita income rose from 82 to 8449 dollars. In this process, all countries in the world clearly believe that the supply-side structural reform of the Jin Yongsan government is indispensable. At present, some problems faced by Chinese companies are also unprecedented. The reform of China's company law is not simply a change of departmental rules, but more importantly, it can improve the competitiveness of the country and social reform and development through the revision of the company law. In this case, this paper uses the methods of comparative study and case analysis to analyze the common problems of the company system, in order to deepen the supply-side reform of the system and promote the comprehensive modernization of the company law.</jats:p>"

Over time the integration of uncertain aspects has continuously gained importance for managerial decision-making. Among these, the industry of yogurt products is one of the most challenging industries. In this study, we investigate the problem of production and distribution planning, scheduling, and routing in the yogurt industry supply chain network. The problem is a multi-product, single plant, multi-distribution center, multi-period, and multi-transportation track. A mixed-integer non- linear programming (MINLP) model is presented to minimize the total costs, including production, setup, overtime, unmet demand, and transportation. Besides, a robust fuzzy programming approach is applied to the problem under uncertainty. A meta-heuristic approach based on the Genetic algorithm was developed to solve the problem. In addition, the required modifications to make GA applicable are the problem mentioned. Tested experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm has an average gap of less than 0.4 percent from the optimal solution within a reasonable time. A real-world case is considered, and the proposed GA method compared to CPLEX and the results show the effectiveness of the model and the average objective function had approximately a 10% improvement.</jats:p>"

In response to the current problems of water scarcity and severe water pollution, this article will study the key points of urban environmental design development based on ecological concepts. This article will also use ecological concepts to divide water function zones based on different pollution-carrying capacities in different regions, which can be mainly divided into two levels. In the experimental analysis section, the Xiongan New Area will be analyzed. This article randomly selected three regions in the Xiongan New Area and studied the utilization rate of various types of water in these regions. The pollution capacity and main water resources of each region in the functional area were planned and designed.

This situation causes problems in ordering raw materials so that ordering costs and costs for storage will not be optimal. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of applying the EOQ method to the total cost of raw material inventory at PT. XY. Raw material inventory costs can be minimized by applying the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) method. This method can show the economic order quantity, optimal purchase frequency, time to reorder/ROP (Re-Order Point), and the amount of safety stock. Data collection was carried out using documentation techniques related to observation inventory documents and interviews with several informants, for data analysis using EOQ by calculating total inventory cost, ROP, reorder frequency and safety stock. The results of calculations and data analysis using the EOQ method show that the total cost of inventory is lower than the company's actual method.</jats:p>"

Currently, research related to blockchain-enabled supply chain finance in China primarily focuses on three aspects: the underlying mechanisms of blockchain-enabled supply chain finance (including decentralization  and consensus mechanisms, distributed storage, tamper resistance, and anti-denial features, as well as smart contracts), the positive effects of blockchain-enabled supply chain finance (including comprehensive effects, credit transmission, risk management) and the application scenarios of blockchain-enabled supply chain finance, and the impact mechanisms of blockchain on supply chain finance gaming behaviors (including the influence of blockchain on supply chain finance decision-making, risk assessment, and the supply chain financial system). Overall, research in China on the positive effects of blockchain-enabled supply chain finance (such as cost and benefit analysis, micro-level efficiency) is relatively limited. Additionally, studies on the factors affecting the adoption of blockchain in supply chain finance and the behavior of banks and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in blockchain adoption within supply chain finance are relatively scarce. Given the backdrop of financial technology, further research is needed to deepen our understanding of various aspects related to blockchain-enabled supply chain finance in China.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Identifying the mechanism through which changes in land use and land cover (LULC) modulate hydrological flows is vital for water resource planning and management. To examine the impact of LULC change on the hydrology of the Gaborone Dam catchment within the upper Limpopo basin, where Notwane river is the major river within the catchment, three LULC maps for the years 1997, 2008, and 2017 were established based on a mosaic of Landsat 5 for 1997 and 2008 and Landsat 8 for 2017. The 10 m-resolution Version 200 ESA World Land Cover Map for 2021 is used as a ground truth to train the random forest (RF) classifier to identify land cover classes from Landsat 8 imageries of 2021 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. The overall accuracy/kappa coefficient of the RF classifier is 0.99/0.99 for the training and 0.73/0.68 for the validation data sets, which indicate excellent and substantial agreements with the ground truth, respectively. With this confidence in the LULC classification, the impact of LULC change on the hydrological flow within the catchment was estimated by employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and indicator of hydrological alteration (IHA). The SWAT model calibration and validation were first performed, and the ability of the model to capture the observed stream flow was found to be good. The LULC maps from Landsat images during the 1997–2017 period show a decrease in forests and shrubland in contrast to an increase in pasture land. The expansion of pasture and cropland and the reduction in forests and shrubland led to a decline in the amount of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Furthermore, the LULC change also caused a reduction in low flow during dry periods and an increase in high flow during the rainy season. The findings clearly demonstrate that LULC changes can affect the water table by altering soil water recharge capacity. The study highlighted the importance of LULC for catchment water resource management through land use planning to regulate the water level in the Gaborone Dam against the impact of climate change and growing water demands by the city of Gaborone due to population growth.</jats:p>"

Using descriptive decomposition methods and a shift-share design, the study shows that, put together, supply and demand factors can account for most of the rise of FLFP over the entire period, led by increases in women’s education, declining fertility, and shifts in the occupational structure of the workforce. However, there is unexplained variation in the 1990s, when FLFP spiked.</jats:p>",

Under these circumstances, maintaining equity in the allocation of water becomes a significant challenge. When building an intermittent water distribution system, it is important to provide a minimum level of supply that is acceptable as well as water supply equity. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed for the optimal design of an intermittent water distribution network (WDN). Network resilience is taken as a measure of reliability (In), while the uniformity coefficient (CU) is taken as a measure of equity in the water supply. Maximizing network resilience, uniformity coefficient, and minimization of cost of the network are considered as the objectives in the multi-objective optimization model. Pressure-driven analysis (PDA) is used for the hydraulic simulation of the network. The NSGA-II model is applied and demonstrated over two water distribution networks taken from the literature. The results indicate that reliability and equity in WDNs can be accomplished to a reasonable extent with minimal cost.</jats:p>"

However, the seafood supply system is facing multiple contemporary global challenges that threaten its resilience as well as food security, livelihoods and ecological wellbeing. This opinion piece discusses the drivers of transformative change impacting seafood supply chains, with a particular focus on the UK, but the strategies described can be applied to many similarly developed countries. To address the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, escalating energy costs, climate change, risk management processes, and to ensure food security and resilience, active policy interventions are needed. Three key policy actions that policymakers can focus on are (i) sustainable seafood models, such as regenerative seafood systems and the circular economy, to improve both environmental and human health outcomes and the likelihood of meeting Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) promote local seafood as part of national food security to strengthen supply chains, support local communities, and enhance traceability and transparency; and, (iii) promote diversification in seafood sourcing and distribution to reduce pressure on critical stocks and increase the flexibility of food systems, while ensuring social and ecological protection. Building a more resilient and sustainable food system requires a holistic and integrated approach, alongside proactive collaboration, to address the multiple, complex, and long-term challenges facing the wider food system.</jats:p>",

The quality control demands at different stages of the manufacturing supply chain cycle have been ignored in traditional process quality control methods. To solve this issue, this paper takes the three-cylinder engine balance shaft system as the research object, and builds a process quality control model for the three-cylinder engine balance shaft system oriented to the manufacturing supply chain. The metagraph theory is introduced, and parts suppliers in the manufacturing supply chain, product process quality attributes, supply chain revenue function, and other key elements are defined. By constructing the revenue function of the three-cylinder engine balance shaft system process quality control model, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by taking the process quality control of one certain three-cylinder engine balance shaft system as a verification example. The results show that, with other conditions unchanged, the application of this method can increase the overall profit of the manufacturing supply chain by 100% at the stage of preparation before product machining, and more than 8% at the stage of product performance evaluation. The proposed method of process quality control based on the metagraph theory provides a theoretical basis for building an information sharing platform of product process quality, and effectively reduces the machining cost for product improvement and upgrading in the manufacturing supply chain.</jats:p>"

Technicians were questioned about the presence and severity of disorders throughout the whole body during the sterilization procedure. The survey was sent to the Central Sterilize Supply Department of 33 centers in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand.\nResults\n The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in various body regions was assessed among technicians at the time of questioning (86.0%), during the week (64.2%), and over one year (59.2%). Workers who had been central sterile supply technicians for over 30 years were factored into the assessment of musculoskeletal disorders (OR 8.710, 95% CI 1.444–6.287). CSSTs were also significantly associated with more than ten years of employment (OR 7.859, 95% CI 1.299–5.008). Day shifts (OR 19.196, 95% CI 0.123–0.459), heavy load handling (OR 70.089, 95% CI 10.756-153.554), lifting of instruments (OR 2.007, 95% CI 1.401–5.516), transporting equipment or carts (OR 2.986, 95% CI 1.890–7.273), pushing equipment or carts (OR 9.194, 95% CI 1.401–5.516), carrying instruments (OR 5.584, 95% CI 1.126–4.268), and uncomfortable postures (OR 7.652, 95% CI 1.383–7.570) were factors influencing the causality of musculoskeletal disorders.\nConclusions\n These findings suggest that it would be beneficial to promote intervention programs for CSSTs based on the participatory ergonomic (PE) approach and coping methods for musculoskeletal illnesses.</jats:p>"

Suppliers, with uncertain yield, announce wholesale prices, while retailers must decide which suppliers to link to based on their wholesale prices. Subsequently, retailers compete with each other in Cournot fashion to sell the acquired supply to consumers. We find that in equilibrium retailers concentrate their links among too few suppliers, that is, there is insufficient diversification of the supply base. We find that either reduction in supply variance or increase in mean supply, increases a supplier's profit. However, these two ways of improving service have qualitatively different effects on welfare: improvement of the expected yield by a supplier makes everyone better off, whereas change in the variance of the yield impacts system members differently.</jats:p>",

As a result, a model for evaluating the economic management performance of mining firms at the new performance level must be established. This paper suggests an assessment model for the economic management of mining firms against the backdrop of supply-side reform in light of this. This study reasonably incorporated financial and non-financial performance indicators, constructed the Economic Management Performance (EMP) evaluation index system of mining enterprises, and created an economic management performance evaluation model of mining enterprises based on the BP neural network and analytic hierarchy process. The study selected the relevant data of five mining companies A, B, C, D, and E from 2017 to 2022 as the research object, verified the effectiveness of the model, and analyzed the performance evaluation results of the companies. The research results show that the model constructed in this study can evaluate the economic management performance level of enterprises within a reasonable range (the mean relative error is 1.98%). Since 2017, the comprehensive performance level of these five mining companies has gradually declined. But thanks to the supply-side reform, the comprehensive performance has gradually recovered after 2022 and among the five mining companies, company A has always been at the performance level way ahead. Overall, the model developed in this research has strong operability and practicability and can be utilized more effectively to forecast the mining industry’s potential for future growth.</jats:p>",

The study's relevance is caused by the fact that periodic port blockades do not allow Ukraine to carry out reliable exports of agricultural products along classical routes. Therefore, there was a need to find new alternatives for exporting agricultural commodities, primarily grain. The study aims to substantiate, describe, structure, and mathematically formalize proposed delivery options and choose the best. The research justifies picking supply chains using automobile and railway transport from Ukraine to the European Union countries. According to three proposed technologies, grain cargoes are exported in batches using containers. The advisability is justified for using each considered delivery option regarding technological aspects. Mathematical modeling, particularly regression analysis, is used to design supply chains. In this case, selecting the best technology is confirmed by corresponding calculations according to designed regression models. The presented option for supplying agricultural commodities is the safest and most reliable but more expensive. However, such logistics will be an excellent solution to reduce the negative consequences of a possible food crisis for the global economy.</jats:p>"

Comparing the same insurer’s requests submitted for the same policy at the same time to different state regulators, we find that they are 13% more likely to be approved and receive 4% more of the requested amount after an election year. Over time, regulatory pushback on premium increase requests leads to persistently lower cash reserves and increases the probability of company dropout. An insurer who receives one-standard-deviation less of their requested increase is 20% more likely to leave the market next year.</jats:p>",

The efficiency of using renewable energy sources is described depending on the climate, geographical location and method of energy production. The relevance of this topic is caused by increasingly high environmental requirements for production. Moreover, decentralization with the use of unconventional sources allows the energy system to be more flexible in an autonomous mode, taking into account the time of day, the intensity of solar, wind and hydropower. The use of renewable energy sources is also possible in combination with solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. Combined systems are very convenient for power supply of small objects. These can be settlements remote from centralized power supply, autonomous industrial facilities, peasant farms, livestock farms. One of the energy supply options is more suitable for the northern region of the country with a long cold period and the presence of large coal reserves, there is an opportunity for the consumer to receive gas, as well as heat and electric energy when using coal as a feedstock, a kind of local gas network. The second method will ensure the disposal of animal waste and organic waste. Keywords: alternative energy sources, biogas, gaseous fuel, coal processing, autonomous power supply.\"</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain is an important tool for any economic individual to obtain sustainable development and maintain core competitiveness, and it is also the guarantee of coordinating supply and demand in economic development and financial goods market transactions. Under the new situation of global economic development, most enterprises use more effi-cient and perfect processes to make their supply chain run efficiently in order to maintain competitiveness. On the basis of their respective divisions of labor, different enterprises have formed a pattern of mutual dependence, connection, and common development. The traditional competition among individual enterprises has gradually evolved into a compe-tition among different components of the supply chain. On the basis of perfect economic market, the supply chain further integrates various economic subjects and their activities in series, and refines the individual and overall layout in the economic cycle. This paper fo-cuses on the importance and role of supply chains in the new global economic development situation, specifically on how supply chains can promote and improve the development of economies, enterprises, and individuals. As well as the important coordination and promo-tion role of the supply chain in the whole market's resource processing and circulation in the process of economic development, the relevant research is carried out by means of inves-tigation, data collection, and consultation. After a series of studies, we have come to the conclusion that the supply chain plays an irreplaceable role and has significant significance in economic development and enterprise development in the global market and plays an important coordinating and helping role in the development of different industries.</jats:p>"

The central sites of circulation that enable this very movement of goods, however, remain understudied. Container ports in particular are key nodes where the thread of global supply chains gathers. A comparative ethnographic analysis of container ports is put forward in order to ground supply chains and logistics in particular socio-cultural histories, material infrastructures, political ecologies, and the politics of labour. We move from Singapore to Hamburg, through Algeciras up to Rotterdam and back down to Pireaus in order to show potential pathways to study the complex web of interconnections we refer to as the global supply chain, with a specific focus on labour and chokepoints in relation to multi-sited and scaled disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Alcohol counterfeiting, which negatively affects people’s lives in terms of economic, health, and social aspects, is one of the crucial problems that arise in many countries. For this reason, information should be made visible and traceable in all current flows of manufactured products from the raw material supplier to the retailer. In this study, a blockchain-based system architecture is proposed to ensure the traceability of raki (an anise-flavored Turkish drink), which is heavily counterfeited in Turkey. The information that adds value to the product is recorded in blocks in the blockchain, which is the building block of the system architecture, and this recorded information can be viewed by the relevant stakeholders. Product traceability is carried out with two smart contracts. With the Asset Registration Smart Contract (ARSC), assets are identified in the digital layer and the lot ID is assigned to the assets. The security of these smart contracts is ensured by storing recorded information in the blockchain, where it cannot be deleted or changed. Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain platform, is used in the proposed architecture. In addition, QR codes integrated into the system act as a bridge between the physical and digital layers, directing consumers to the blockchain layer for traceability. Thus, the consumer will be able to see all the stages of the product that have transparently reached him and will be able to notice any counterfeiting event that may occur. In this context, it is foreseen that the proposed architecture will prevent raki counterfeiting as much as possible and provide transparency and traceability in all processes from raw material to bottle. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper is arranged as follows. In Sec.  1 , the problem is defined, the solution for the problem is explained, information is given about the technologies proposed for the solution, and current studies on the subject are discussed. In Sec.  2 , the system architecture created for traceability is explained in detail. Section  3 describes the results. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article describes new approaches to creating an autonomous compact system with automatic control for hemodialysis. It is proposed to organize a closed circuit for cleaning the dialysis solution using an electrolytic regenerator as a function of the concentration of urea in it. The functional diagram of the created system is presented and described. To power the regenerator, ensure thermal stabilization of the solution, and power auxiliary electronic and electrical equipment, a multi-channel power supply and control system for the hemodialysis machine based on high-frequency magnetic amplifiers has been developed and researched. The advantages of power switches based on high-frequency magnetic amplifiers in comparison with transistor switches, including in the construction of controlled power sources, are given. The principle of operation of the voltage regulator on high-frequency magnetic amplifiers is described. Theoretical and experimental oscillograms are given. Photographs of the experimental unit as well as an industrial sample of the multi-channel power supply and control system of the hemodialysis machine are provided. Their main technical characteristics are given. Conclusions to the conducted work are formulated. Carrying out the regeneration of the dialysis solution significantly reduces its costs – 2 liters of solution, which is suitable for use for 6 months, is enough for the operation of the device. Existing hemodialysis machines are a stationary open system using a single-use dialysis solution at a rate of up to 35 l/h, which ties the machine to stationary clinical conditions. Introducing feedback on the concentration of urea in the dialysis solution allows you to automate the blood purification procedure, as well as automatically complete hemodialysis at the necessary time, and also eliminates the dependence of the device on the conditions of the hospital.</jats:p>"

To effectively address these risks, firms must develop robust strategies for risk management. The focal point of this study was the examination of supplier risk management practices and their influence on the performance of supply chains within the healthcare sector in Kenya. Employing a descriptive survey research design, the study targeted a pool of 102 respondents, ultimately drawing a sample of 81 staff members from four county referral hospitals in western Kenya. Data collection was carried out using closed-ended questionnaires, ensuring a methodically sound approach. To validate the research instrument, content validity was rigorously assessed, and the reliability of the instrument was established through the application of Cronbach's alpha test. Subsequently, the collected data underwent comprehensive analysis, utilizing descriptive statistics in the form of frequency and percentage calculations. Additionally, inferential analysis was conducted, employing a simple linear regression model to determine the relationship between supplier risk management practices and supply chain performance in the health sector. The study's findings revealed a substantial and positive correlation between supplier risk management practices and supply chain performance, as indicated by the coefficient results (β = 0.521, t = 7.256, p&lt; 0.05). Consequently, the null hypothesis was rejected, affirming that supplier risk management practices wield a considerable influence on the performance of the supply chain within the Kenyan health sector. These findings hold the potential to enhance our understanding of supplier management, offering valuable insights for managers within the health sector. Notably, the study emphasizes the crucial role that supplier risk management techniques like risk identification, risk assessment, and dual sourcing play in improving the performance of the supply chain. Furthermore, these findings may serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, offering essential information that can inform the formulation and revision of policies related to supply chain management within the healthcare sector.</jats:p>"

This means that individuals with disabilities now have access to a multitude of employment opportunities and can even own their own homes. However, it is crucial for government stakeholders and authorities to develop a plan to improve housing for people with disabilities to better prepare them for homeownership. To achieve this, the housing industry must be more adaptable to accommodate the unique needs of people with disabilities. Additionally, the government needs to create a housing policy that is suitable for all demographics, including individuals with disabilities. People with disabilities are primarily concerned with having access to housing that adheres to regulations and accommodates their needs, which ultimately improves their quality of life. This study focuses on the priorities of the disabled community in Kedah, specifically in terms of pricing, location, legality, and house design. Three respondents from the disabled population in Kedah participated in this study through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. The study focuses explicitly on physical disability. The results of this research highlight the importance of price, location, legislation, house design, and the challenges associated with homeownership for individuals with disabilities.

The results of the study show that although the TTI program has a clear basis, cartel practices emerge due to the domination of actors in rice marketing and laxity in implementing policies. The TTI program creates shorter supply chains, but cartel practices still exist. This research reveals that cartel practices arise from the implementation of the TTI program which is controlled by certain parties with strong control. Obstacles in bookkeeping and supply management also influenced the emergence of cartels. Cartel practices arise not because of regulations, but because of their implementation which tends to be abused by cartel actors.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes an algorithm for predicting the health status of pumps that integrates multiple monitoring variables. Initially, the original dataset is classified using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method. Next, principal component dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the dimensionality of the classified dataset. Finally, a long and short term memory neural network is employed to construct the association model between monitoring data and equipment health. The proposed algorithm takes into account the correlation between variables and the negative impacts of long-term dependence on the prediction results. It is capable of predicting abnormal working conditions, which has been experimentally verified in the Xiasha Pumping Station located in Hangzhou. The algorithm was compared with LR, SVM, and RNN algorithms, and it was found that the proposed algorithm achieved the highest prediction accuracy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Companies increasingly view soil degradation in their supply chains as a commercial risk. They have applied sustainability standards to manage environmental risks stemming from suppliers’ farming operations. To examine the application of supply chain sustainability standards in soil protection, we combined global data on existing sustainability standards and their use in the food retail industry, a key sector in agrifood supply chains, with a case study in a medium-sized European country, to explore companies' options and views. Soil quality is a priority objective in retail sector sustainability efforts: 41 % of the investigated companies apply some soil-relevant standard. But the standards lack specific and comprehensive criteria. Compliance typically requires that farmers are aware of soil damage risks and implement some mitigation measures; however, no measurable thresholds are usually assigned. This stands in contrast to some other provisions in a number of standards, such as deforestation criteria. There are two probable causes of this difference: Companies and certification bodies have prioritised other environmental challenges (e.g., pesticide use, biodiversity loss in tropical biomes) over soil degradation. Also, there are practical constraints to the useful standardisation of soil sustainability. Effective soil sustainability provisions will require measurable, controllable, and scalable multidimensional interventions and compliance metrics. Often, these are not yet available. The development of necessary practical tools is a priority for future research. In a case study, we developed a set of standards applicable in temperate European farming practice and adapted to the needs of food retailers. Based on discussion with the industry, farmers, and soil experts, the standard is based on specific commodities rather than production units and compliance with specific agronomic practices as opposed to direct measurements of soil quality.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of globalization, the development and management of operations related to products and services are becoming more complex, stakeholders are demanding and aware of the challenges of sustainability along the supply chain. One of them is the clothing industry which is a global industry that provides basic human needs and is one of the industrial sectors that has an impact on the environment and society. To address the risk and opportunity issues of sustainability from an industry and value chain perspective, apply the concept of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This study aims to design an instrument in the form of a minimum standard to measure supplier performance and analyze it. Using a qualitative analysis method resulting from due diligence on suppliers with a total of 77 question points consisting of 23 questions on the environmental dimension, 23 questions on the social dimension related to employment, and 26 questions related to governance. The results show that 3 suppliers are at the High-performance level, 4 companies are in the Medium-performance category, 5 are companies with low performance and 1 company is in the very low category. By categorizing the highest total gain of ESG, namely 100%, and the lowest score of 34.62%. This value indicates the level of compliance with the minimum standards set. Recommendations for Further Research An even number of due diligence is carried out for categories in the fashion industry (clothing, hats, bags, footwear). The aspects and weights of each of these sustainability aspects can be re-analyzed if used for other types of industries outside the fashion industry.</jats:p>"

However, most SMEs were not able to utilize effective leadership to enhance their resilience and navigate the crisis successfully. This study aims to examine the relevance of the Full-Range Leadership Model in understanding the relationship between leadership styles and business sustainability, in the context of operations and supply chain management. The study used a cross-sectional survey approach with a purposive sampling technique to collect data from 214 SMEs in Malaysia. The findings of this study suggest that transformational and transactional leadership styles are significant and positive factors that contribute to business sustainability. On the other hand, laissez-faire leadership is a significant and negative factor that hinders the development of business sustainability and resilience. Therefore, SMEs should incorporate and leverage different leadership styles to strengthen their resilience in the post-pandemic work economy. This study has important implications for SMEs to improve their sustainability and resilience in the face of future crises. By adopting effective leadership styles, SMEs can improve their resilience, build their capacity to adapt to changes and enhance their long-term sustainability</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, there are a large number of territories in the Republic of Kazakhstan that are not connected to centralized networks. Power supply of facilities in such territories is a complex task, the solution of which requires significant material costs. Reliable power supply means long-term uninterrupted power supply of consumers with electricity of the required quality. The most functionally completed autonomous power supply system (SES) of the \"small\" electric power industry is the integrated system of guaranteed power supply (KSGEP). The article discusses the provision of reliable power supply to a specific consumer - it is possible only on the basis of a systematic approach to the organization of power supply. To ensure the normal operation of the DES-UPS system (uninterruptible power supply), the power of the DES (diesel power plant) must exceed the power of the UPS. The degree of this excess depends on many factors determined by both the properties of the generator and the diesel engine, and the characteristics of the UPS. The analysis of the problem of matching DES and UPS was identified and revealed, which served as the basis for the development of a methodology for calculating power and selecting DES for working with UPS. A comprehensive system approach to the design, organization, maintenance and operation of autonomous power supply systems of the \"small\" electric power industry is given, which is the key to their reliable functioning, reliable power supply to consumers.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, the implication of deep learning procedures has been described as a vital tool for the optimization of supply chain firms’ transportation operations, among others. Concerning the indexes of transportation operations of supply chain firms, it has been found that the contribution of big data analytics could be crucial to their optimization. Due to big data analytics’ variety and availability, supply chain firms should investigate their impact on their key transportation indexes in their effort to comprehend the variation of the referred indexes. The authors proceeded with the gathering of the required big data analytics from the most established supply chain firms’ websites, based on their (ROPA), revenue growth, and inventory turn values, and performed correlation and linear regression analyses to extract valuable insights for the next stages of the research. Then, these insights, in the form of statistical coefficients, were inserted into the development of a Hybrid Model (Agent-Based and System Dynamics modeling), with the application of the feedforward neural network (FNN) method for the estimation of specific agents’ behavioral analytical metrics, to produce accurate simulations of the selected key performance transportation indexes of supply chain firms. An increase in the number of website visitors to supply chain firms leads to a 60% enhancement of their key transportation performance indexes, mostly related to transportation expenditure. Moreover, it has been found that increased supply chain firms’ website visibility tends to decrease all of the selected transportation performance indexes (TPIs) by an average amount of 87.7%. The implications of the research outcomes highlight the role of increased website visibility and search engine ranking as a cost-efficient means for reducing specific transportation costs (Freight Expenditure, Inferred Rates, and Truckload Line Haul), thus achieving enhanced operational efficiency and transportation capacity.</jats:p>"

This article presents an in-depth analysis of these voluntary industry-specific corporate social responsibility guidelines. The article also unfolds the less visible processes in which a Chinese industry association proactively engages with the dynamics of multi-level governance of corporate social responsibility in global mineral supply chains. While focusing on the rising role of the CCCMC, the article takes a ‘multi-level and actor-centred’ approach to understand the development of corporate social responsibility standards in the global economy. The article finds that CCCMC guidelines are inspired by and infused with pre-existing corporate social responsibility standards, especially international standards. Furthermore, it showcases the CCCMC’s continuing follow-up measures to implement the guidelines and increase recognition from other actors in global mineral supply chains. In particular, the article finds that the CCCMC has taken substantive measures to formulate and implement applicable labour standards in global mineral supply chains. </jats:p>",

The existing related research mainly addresses the influence of factors such as government regulation, consumer behavior characteristics, and node enterprise behavior on green supply chain decision making. While these studies provide excellent ideas, the impact of network externalities on both green manufacturing and green marketing strategies is often disregarded. This paper uses evolutionary game theory to construct a utility function based on network externalities and consumer green preferences. The Stackelberg game is used to analyze the revenue function of supply chain members under different strategies, showing that under different strategies, network externalities and consumer green preferences have different effects on revenue in the supply chain. To understand the influence of network externalities on green supply chain strategy choices, the evolutionary game model is used. This model allows analyzing the evolutionary stable strategies of manufacturers’ green manufacturing and retailers’ green marketing. The mechanism underlying the influence of network externalities and consumer green preferences on green supply chain decision making is demonstrated. This helps to explain the green strategy decisions of upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology is a feasible choice for secure information sharing in a supply chain network. Despite the fact that maintaining security at all levels of the blockchain is difficult, cryptographic methods are commonly used in existing works. Effective supply chain management (SCM) offers various benefits to organizations, such as enhanced customer satisfaction, increased operational efficiency, competitive advantage, and cost reduction. Potential SCM for agricultural and food supply chains needs distributors, coordination and collaboration among farmers, retailers, and stakeholders. The use of technology like Block Chain (BC), sensors, and data analytics, can boost traceability and visibility, decrease waste, and ensure safety and quality throughout the supply chain. Therefore, this study develops a Hunger Games Search Optimization with Deep Learning Model for Sustainable agricultural and food Supply Chain Management (HGSODL-ASCM) technique. The fundamental goal of the HGSODL-ASCM technique is to improve decision-making processes for agricultural and food commodity production and storage in order to optimise revenue. In the provided HGSODL-ASCM technique, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model is built to determine the amount of productivity and storage required to maximise profit. In order to boost the performance of the Bi-LSTM classification process, the HGSO algorithm has been utilized in this work. The presented HGSODL-ASCM technique can independently achieve the SCM policies via interaction with complicated and adaptive environments. A brief set of simulations were performed to ensure the improved performance of the HGSODL-ASCM technique. The simulation results demonstrated how superior the HGSODL-ASCM method is to other methods already in use.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the domestic markets for palm oil and palm kernel oil remain substantial despite improvements in export quantities. Various industries, including cooking oil refineries, specialty fats, shortening, margarine, bath soaps, and oleochemicals, present potential markets for palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). The palm oil industry encompasses four related subsectors, namely growers, millers, refiners, and oleochemicals, forming an integrated value chain from upstream to downstream. The current focus on environmental, economic, and social sustainability drives companies to adopt internal green activities and expand their efforts toward sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Implementing SSCM practices is often seen as economically beneficial, as research has demonstrated their positive impact on corporate performance from a resource perspective. Many green management applications are utilized in the palm oil industry. This study examines and highlights existing sustainable management practices across the entire palm oil supply chain, focusing on producing high-quality palm oil. This study utilized a systematic review methodology. A total of 62 articles were analyzed, which involved an extensive review of the relevant literature to identify research trends, gaps, and issues. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by expanding the theory of organizational readiness to prepare globally competitive palm oil products. The research findings hold practical significance for practitioners and academics by providing a comprehensive road map for implementing green management applications at the organizational level in the palm oil industry’s upstream-to-downstream chain.</jats:p>"

This work investigated the interannual variability of the nationwide electric power supply from PV systems in Japan. Objectives of this study were twofold: one was the quantification of the annual variability of the nationwide PV power supply. The other was identifying the causes of the variability. However, the time span of available observation data on the PV power supply is inadequate to evaluate its variability, as PV systems have been rapidly installed in recent years. We used simulation to bypass this limitation. Due to the lack of available information for modeling, a hybrid modeling approach, combining a parametric model, and estimating parameters by fitting the model to observations, was employed. Nationwide PV power supply simulations were performed using historical weather data for 30 years, from 1991–2020. The long-term simulation data enabled us to quantify the interannual variability of the nationwide PV power generation. The annual variability measured with the range from the minimum to the maximum was approximately 9% of the mean. The variability for each month was less than 30% of the monthly mean for every month except for July when it was approximately 40%. An increasing trend in the annual mean PV power supply was observed over the 30 years, with an increase of 0.16% per year of the mean over the whole period. We found that the variations in sea surface temperature (SST) in the Tropics are factors contributing to the variability of nationwide PV power supply. Specifically, the variation in SST in the tropical Indian Ocean is one of the possible driving factors of the annual variability. The framework proposed in this study can provide valuable information for assessing solar energy resources on an interannual scale.</jats:p>",

Currently, this dividend is slipping away, and many in the PRC are very concerned. Against this background, I set out to examine the contributions of various dimensions of the PRC’s changing WAPS and its impact on economic growth. I show that between 1982 and 2015 the increase in WAPS was offset by a decline in the labor force participation rate, resulting in a very limited increase in the quantity of the labor supply. I then estimate the association between regional variations in economic growth and changes in factors such as population size, WAPS, migration, and education. The results lend little support to the view that an expanding WAPS played a major role in the PRC’s economic growth over this period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Marine buoys need to operate in high sea areas far from land for a long time. Therefore, how to provide a long-term power supply for the buoy system is critical to be addressed. Photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems are the most commonly used power supply method for marine buoys. Due to the limitations of the buoy structure and considering the rotation of the buoy in the ocean, most of the PV modules are placed in a four-sided enclosure. The output performance of the PV power supply system in this placement is affected by the tilt angle produced by waves. However, there are few relevant studies on the actual power generation performance of PV power supply systems for marine buoys, and there is a lack of methods for power generation performance analysis. In order to meet the power requirements of the marine buoy, a large design margin must be left. It increases the cost of marine buoys. In this paper, second-order Stokes waves are used to simulate waves of different levels by varying the wave height and frequency. The motion characteristics of the marine buoy are analyzed using ANSYS-AQWA under calm-rippled, smooth, slight, and moderate conditions. Combined with the tilted surface irradiance calculation model to get the variation law of solar radiation of PV modules under dynamic conditions, the effect of different tilt angle PV modules on the output of PV system under dynamic conditions was also studied. The experiments show that for every 5° increase in the tilt angle of the PV modules the output power of the system decreases by 3% on average. As the tilt angle of the PV modules increases, the impact on the system output performance is more pronounced. The output power decreased by 69.5% when the PV modules were tilted at an angle of 90°, and the PV system electrical parameters were similarly affected. By comparing the influence of different tilt angles on the power supply performance of PV modules, we optimize the design of the PV power supply system of the buoy. This enables the designers to maximize the use of limited area and space while reducing the cost and extending the power supply time and service life of the buoy.</jats:p>"

At the same time, with the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, global technological nationalism has risen rapidly and is spreading. In the context of most countries advocating localization and strategic autonomy of global supply chains, Part of countries have taken opposite measures. They use technological containment as their main means. Linking supply chains to national security. As an excuse to impose sanctions on China or cut off its supply chain to the semiconductor industry. Resulting in technological decoupling between China and the United States. It also affects the global production and supply chain layout of multinational companies.

Unlike existing articles, the proposed economic order-quantity model considers periodically varying random demand rates of deteriorating items together with partially back-ordered shortages in the face of those random disruptions. This study computes the global concavity to execute the exemplary aspect for the optimal base-stock level under a slew of cost components and a fixed cycle length. Regarding the optimal pricing-related policies, this study proposes that cement retailers should stock from nearby supplier points. Unlike existing articles, we find that changes to either the unit-holding cost or the unit-lost sales cost have hardly any determining effect on the long-run profitability of retailers. When supply-side disruptions are more likely to occur during peak seasons, this study advocates for a planned capacity addition and higher base-stock levels of cement bags.</jats:p>"

This is realized by maintaining optimal value of reliability indicators and high quality of power supply. The validation is carried out using analyzes and tests of quality of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) for increased number of powered frequency converters. It has been proven that the effective use and reduction of energy consumption can be achieved thanks to the unique technological features of the employed electrical devices. This enables a normal operation of the system with decreased power and adequate control of energy processes. The problem of predicting power losses under changing conditions in a decentralized electrical network has been solved based on the theory of electromagnetic compatibility. The influence of the mains mode parameters and the indices of instantaneous distortion of current and voltage waveforms caused by the operation of converters on the resonance phenomena in power supply systems were investigated. Recommendations were developed for the selection of proper parameters of compensators for 6-10 kV and 0.4-0.66 kV circuits based on the analysis of the optimization problem when minimizing active power losses. Results of our findings may aid parties involved in designing and maintaining power networks in various applications, such as mines, etc.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Suppliers are increasingly involved in innovation activities that contribute to a firm’s product quality and introduce risks to firms’ quality control, leading to quality failures and recalls. This quality trade-off suggests the possibility of a nonlinear relationship between supplier innovation and product recalls, which is the focus of this research. Recall literature focuses on firms’ internal drivers of recalls, whereas anecdotal evidence increasingly points to the role of external drivers, such as suppliers. We contribute to the literature by examining supplier innovation as an external driver leading to recalls via quality and risk spillovers. Methodology/results: We collect and assemble a unique panel data set of consumer product recalls from firms and their supply bases (i.e., first tier suppliers). We estimate econometric models to examine the nonlinear relationship between supply base innovation, measured by research and development (R&amp;D) intensity of the supply bases, and the likelihood of product recalls. We find a quadratic (i.e., U-shaped) relationship between the probability of recalls and supply base R&amp;D intensity. We also find that this nonlinear relationship is critically related to three specific sources of risk: radicalness of supplier innovation, technological distance between firms and their suppliers, and complexity of supply base. Managerial implications: Our findings suggest that firms should be mindful of the quality trade-offs in encouraging supplier innovation to reduce product recalls. Further, to minimize recall risks, firms should better evaluate and manage the risks associated with external supplier knowledge that is novel and different and closely work with global suppliers to reduce coordination challenges in knowledge transfer and integration. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.1213 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The breeding supply chain has expanded with genomic technology to include basic research scientists and applied genomicists along with traditional plant breeders and farmers. Genomicists have focused on identifying specific DNA sequences or quantitative trait loci (QTL) that can be used as molecular markers. However, the use of molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) by breeders in their programs requires the identified QTL to be reliably correlated with agronomically desirable traits. Replication research is critical for reducing the risk associated with the adoption of new marker-based (or QTL-based) selection strategies, but the applied scientists doing genomics research often do not have the incentives to do replication and other research required to verify the reliability of markers. The misalignment of incentives in the breeding supply chain can curtail the development of the projected advances in food production by genomics research. Using a sample of 24 genomic journals, we found more highly ranked journals tend to favor new research on identifying new QTL over replication research on previously identified QTL. Given that breeders will tend to adopt only those markers perceived to be reliable, the implicit lack of incentives for basic and applied genomic scientists to undertake replication research can impede agricultural innovation.</jats:p>"

So, as the efficient functioning of the supply chain in any company contributes to the growth of its competitiveness and profitability, the meaning of supply chains takes on a new connotation in the changed conditions for managing business processes. The RFID system, as a technology that is implemented by more and more companies, today occupies a significant place in the agenda of every competitive company. Although this means that companies follow technological innovations, one of the reasons why this technology penetrates increasingly, mainly, is that these labels are becoming cheaper and cheaper, but the implementation of this type of technology is simpler, faster and easier to use, which, of course, is an advantage compared to other technological inventions. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize how the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Device) technology can improve business processes in the Supply Chain Management (SCM). Business processes, through digitalization, acquire a completely different dimension in the new virtual world, following the new conditions from a completely different perspective. This paper presents a brief explanation of Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) integration in Supply Chain Management using literature review and analytical research approach. For the purposes of this paper, a review was made and secondary data was found in order to identify the benefits of this type of technology and to emphasize the need for its use.</jats:p>"

Power supply of facilities in such territories is a complex task, the solution of which requires significant material costs. Reliable power supply means long-term uninterrupted power supply of consumers with electricity of the required quality. The most functionally completed autonomous power supply system (SES) of the \"small\" electric power industry is the integrated system of guaranteed power supply (KSGEP). The article discusses the provision of reliable power supply to a specific consumer - it is possible only on the basis of a systematic approach to the organization of power supply. To ensure the normal operation of the DES-UPS system (uninterruptible power supply), the power of the DES (diesel power plant) must exceed the power of the UPS. The degree of this excess depends on many factors determined by both the properties of the generator and the diesel engine, and the characteristics of the UPS. The analysis of the problem of matching DES and UPS was identified and revealed, which served as the basis for the development of a methodology for calculating power and selecting DES for working with UPS. A comprehensive system approach to the design, organization, maintenance and operation of autonomous power supply systems of the \"small\" electric power industry is given, which is the key to their reliable functioning, reliable power supply to consumers.</jats:p>"

There are several objectives associated with the DMA's design that are contingent upon the network parameters that are affected by its formation. Two previous studies considered DMA design as a three-objective problem (operational cost, average pressure and water age) and a four-objective problem (design cost, pressure deviation, resilience index (RI) and demand shortfall) for pumped and gravity networks, respectively. The problems were addressed through the implementation of a multi-phase DMA design methodology using the NSGA-II and NSGA-III optimisation tools, respectively. The present work builds upon previous research by simultaneously considering five objectives in DMA design (i.e. design cost, operational cost, RI, average pressure and water age) using the NSGA-III optimisation tool in pumped water networks. In this extended approach, the pump's role in meeting nodal demands eliminates the necessity of including demand shortfall as one of the objectives. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on two benchmark networks, demonstrating its capability to identify DMA alternatives and provide solutions based on user preferences. Finally, the obtained results are compared with the previous study's findings.</jats:p>",

However, due to various reasons, there are many loopholes in the protection of these building equipment. This paper examines the development of building equipment in Shanghai during the Northern Warlord Period, using water supply, drainage, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as examples. Through historical context analysis, it summarizes this development from a social-spatial perspective, infers the reasons behind it, and analyzes the importance of preserving such equipment, considering both past and present viewpoints. In this research, the importance of protecting historical building equipment is emphasized, which aims to give people a deeper understanding of their cultural value, and suggests that scholars conduct more practical research on their protection.</jats:p>"

This includes, for example, space communications stations, some radio relay communication systems, radar stations, data transmission systems and others. The characteristics of radio wave propagation are studied by using electromagnetic waves separated by circular orthogonal polarization in radiomonitoring and radiocontrol systems. Compared to other antenna types, circularly polarized antennas, such as rings, have superior design simplicity and excellent electrodynamics properties.&#x0D;\nObjective. The objective of this study is to analyse the characteristics and application of directional microstrip couplers for supplying power to ring antennas.&#x0D;\nMethod. To better the performance of microstrip ring antennas, the reasons for their limited operating frequency range are analysed. These causes include the frequency-dependent parameters of the coupler, errors in calculating the directional coupler circuit, and radiation from asymmetric strip lines. To understand how supply lines, affect antenna characteristics, correlations between radiation fields determined in both its coordinate system and that of the primary axis are taken into account.&#x0D;\nResults. An analysis of the dependence graphs of the main characteristics of ring microstrip antennas with intricate power supply circuits for directional couplers and comparison with similar characteristics for simple circuits revealed that the shape of the radiation pattern in the higher radiation hemisphere became symmetrical about the axis, especially when symmetrically supplying the ring with branch-line couplers. The frequency band has also widened, at which there was an acceptable degree of deviation in the ellipticity coefficient from unity.&#x0D;\nConclusions. The simulation results of microstrip ring antennas with power lines connected to directional couplers of different types showed that supplying the ring antenna with electricity via the directional coupler ensures circular polarization for the emitted electromagnetic waves. Additionally, the range of operating frequencies where there is only a small discrepancy in ellipticity coefficient remains at an acceptable level of –3 dB is quite broad. By utilizing directional branch-line couplers to power a ring antenna, it is possible to simultaneously emit both right and left circularly polarized waves with the same antenna.</jats:p>"

This ground elevation may result in a reduction in head losses with hydraulic grade pressure. As a result, the precision of the measured data used to observe ground elevations is critical to decrease the error of these losses and apply an accurate local reference. It's critical to comprehend the implications of using Geographic Information System (GIS) application technology for water distribution network models to evaluate the hydraulic grade head with Iraqi Geodetic Reference. These GIS input data are based on an analysis of the relationship between selected spatial data resolution and the precision of the expected hydraulic head for selected stations with a distribution network. This research aims to review the literature and try to track the conversion of geodetic references and datums to accurately identify the hydraulic pressure for the selected locations of the water supply network.

To ensure the safe and stable operation of a port grid system, this paper proposes a risk decision method for a transmission system in a market environment based on interval number and cumulative prospect theory. Based on the constructed risk evaluation index system of a port shore power supply system, a risk decision model based on cumulative prospect theory and an improved gray target risk model (CPT-IGT) are constructed considering the uncertainty and ambiguity of the index attributes and weight information as well as the risk attitude held by decision-makers; these models are developed with improved interval gray number and cumulative prospect theory. Finally, a case study applied to the risk decision of a port shore power supply system verified the reasonableness and effectiveness of the method. The results show that the proposed method has some advantages in dealing with language terms, representing language uncertainty, and reflecting risk decisions in different environments. The research can provide a theoretical basis for the risk assessment of a port power system in the future and provide suggestions for the green growth of the port.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Qualcomm, the largest cellphone chipmaker in the world, had adopted a cross-licensing agreement with its clients, downstream cellphone manufacturers. It requires cellphone manufacturers to allow each other to use their patents for free. This cross-licensing practice has received considerable scrutiny and attention around the world. We study the impacts of cross-licensing in a supply chain in which an upstream supplier requires its downstream competing manufacturers to cross-license, where they are asymmetric in their innovation capabilities. Methodology/results: We build a stylized model of a supply chain consisting of one supplier and two competing manufacturers and conduct game-theoretic analysis. We find that the supplier always prefers adopting cross-licensing ex post after manufacturers’ investments are sunk, but it may prefer committing to no cross-licensing ex ante. Specifically, the supplier should commit to not using cross-licensing if the inferior manufacturer’s cost of innovation is high or the effectiveness of cross-licensing is high. Furthermore, cross-licensing may increase innovation, the superior manufacturer’s profit, and social welfare under certain conditions. Interestingly, when the superior manufacturer’s cost advantage is intermediate, the inferior manufacturer’s innovation level first increases and then decreases in the effectiveness of cross-licensing. In addition, the inferior manufacturer’s profit also first increases and then decreases as the effectiveness level of cross-licensing increases. The cross-licensing policy benefits consumers when its effectiveness level is low and the superior manufacturer’s innovation cost is either high or low. Managerial implications: Our results provide guidance on when a supplier should adopt the cross-licensing strategy. For policy makers, our findings show that cross-licensing can be beneficial for consumers and the society. In particular, to increase social welfare, policy makers may consider encouraging cross-licensing with low effectiveness level when the superior manufacturer’s innovation cost is either low or high. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This research is supported by Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [Grant 2022B1515020027]. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2019.0477 . </jats:p>",

The study adopted a positivist research philosophy and the correlational research design. The population of this study is made up of all the agricultural producers in South-East Nigeria. The exact population of agricultural producers in the South-East Geopolitical Zone is unknown, hence the Cochran’s formula was used to arrive at a sample size of 384 agricultural producers. The 384 agricultural producers were drawn from the five (5) states in the South-East Geopolitical Zone. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain data from the respondents. The data collected were analyzed statistically while the Pearson Product Moment Correlation (r) was used to test the hypotheses. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) was computed using SPSS 23.0 version. The findings revealed that internal integration has significant relationship with sales growth of agricultural producers. The study also found a significant relationship between internal integration and market share growth of agricultural producers. A significant relationship was reported between supplier integration and sales growth of agricultural producers. The study also confirmed a significant relationship between supplier integration and market share growth of agricultural producers. The study equally found a significant relationship between customer integration and sales growth of agricultural producers. The study also discovered a significant relationship between customer integration and market share growth of agricultural producers. Based on these findings, it was concluded that supply chain integration is a significant predictor of marketing success of agricultural producers in South- East Nigeria. In line with the findings and conclusion, it was recommended that agricultural producers and marketers should embrace supply chain integration as it would enable them achieve marketing success.</jats:p>"

They can also minimize the risk of flooding during the rainy season. The present study assesses the accumulated knowledge of these combined systems based on a systematic review of the literature restricted to academic sources. The review revealed knowledge gaps that must be resolved to better assess the optimum combination of rainwater and greywater recovery, how this affects the need for the treatment of the recovered water, its final quality, potential options for reuse, water economy, and the environmental and economic performance of the system. Further empirical studies are required to determine the most adequate design configuration for these systems, considering their multiple objectives, technological perspectives, and in particular, their potential for improving environmental shortcomings. There is a clear need for widespread use of low-impact technologies to ensure the most effective possible results. Water recovery systems will become increasingly important as a means of tackling the challenges of water supplies in the urban landscape, which are being exacerbated by climate change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Indonesia is one of the countries in Southeast Asia with a high GDP. However, Indonesia's logistic performance is not very impressive, ranking 46th out of 160 countries with an index of 3.15, still falling behind Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. This phenomenon could be attributed to a lack of supply chain configuration. Supply chain management involves how firms manage their resources as inputs, which are then processed to become products or outputs. Furthermore, in the field of strategic management, researchers have noted that firms in emerging countries are increasingly moving away from strategic management accounting (SMA), primarily due to its high cost and the need for experts to conduct SMA. However, it's worth noting that SMA includes supply chain configuration as a means to reduce costs and improve efficiency. SMA is not just about managing costs; it also focuses on enhancing performance from the customer's perspective, emphasizing Customer Value. Customer Value is a technique for boosting a firm's performance by strengthening customer relationships. Given the limited research in emerging countries, especially in Indonesia, this topic warrants further investigation. This research aims to analyze the effects of strategic management accounting, supply chain performance, and Customer Value on a firm's financial performance. Using a quantitative approach (SEM-PLS), 100 samples from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Kota Bogor were tested. The results indicate that strategic management accounting has a negative effect on Firm Financial Performance, while Supply Chain Performance and Customer Value have positive effects on Firm Financial Performance.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of generating extra income from recycling of tomatoes waste generated along the FTSC, and to analyze the impact of that extra income on reducing income inequality among the FTSC actors. Data were collected from 136 greenhouse tomato producers, 60 wholesalers, 18 exporters, 120 domestic retailers, 22 overseas retailers, and 3 recycling facilities in Türkiye. Marketing cost, absolute marketing margin, relative marketing margin and net profit margin were used to economically analyze the FTSCs. Research results showed that the net profit share of the producers decreased with the increasing number of intermediaries. Additionally, revenue generated from composting and recycling of product loss and wastes increased the welfare of greenhouse producers more than the other supply chain actors. When taking into account the revenue generated from composting and recycling of wastes, the net profit of the producers increased by 9.85% at first FTSC, while it increased by 8.29% and 9.21% in the second and third FTSCs, respectively, compared to the prevailing conditions. The retailers were benefitted more from the extra revenue generated via composting and recycling of wastes compared to the wholesalers and exporters. However, the income gain of the domestic retailers and wholesalers from recycling was more when compared to the overseas ones. Close cooperation between producers, wholesalers, exporters, retailers, and recycling facilities is essential for the effective implementation of waste recycling initiatives. Organizing training and education programs focused on waste management can increase the extra income that producers and active intermediaries in FTSCs can generate from composting and recycling of tomato wastes. Offering financial incentives, grants, or subsidies can encourage producers and other actors within the supply chain to adopt waste recycling practices. Continuous research and innovation are crucial in identifying and developing new technologies, processes, and strategies to minimize food loss and waste. Introducing fair-trade practices may help to balance the income distribution among FTSC actors.</jats:p>"

The research method is modeling and simulation of a supply chain system based on nonlinear system dynamics theory. The complexity analysis includes the stability analysis of the decision system, the path of the system into chaos, the change of entropy of the system and the performance in chaos system. Our findings indicate that the optimal government subsidy in the cooperative model is lower than that in the non-cooperative model. Consumer surplus is the main reason for the subsidy difference between the two models. In comparison with the cooperative supply chain, the stability of the non-cooperative supply chain is more easily affected by government subsidies. Further, the market is more likely to enter chaos due to improper adjustment of the new products’ inventory with cooperative behavior in the supply chain of new products. When the system enters chaos, the new product supply chain’s profit in the cooperative system is more likely to be far lower than the equilibrium profit. This study provides a theoretical reference for supply chain inventory management and government subsidy remanufacturer decision-making from the perspective of dynamic systems science.</jats:p>"

The relocated supplier also experiences more analyst following and institutional ownership that are in common with the customer and is more likely to issue equity than debt.

This synthesis aims to surmount the limitations of conventional optimization methods. Through rigorous experimentation on real-world supply chain scenarios, our approach demonstrates substantial efficiency gains and enhanced solution quality in comparison to classical methods. The implications are far- reaching, promising substantial cost reductions, streamlined resource allocation, and sustainability improvements for industries relying on supply chain management. Our study contributes to the burgeoning field of quantum machine learning and offers immediate value to supply chain professionals grappling with complexity.

Specifically, the dry region, which is the portion of the liner above the Top Dead Center (TDC) of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), needs proper lubrication to reduce wear and to maintain sustainability. However, the mechanisms by which oil is distributed to such region have not been investigated. This paper presents the first attempt to understand dry region lubrication by means of the oil-gas interaction below the top ring gap through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"htmlview paragraph\"&gt;An optical engine with 2D Laser Induced Fluorescence (2D-LIF) technique was applied to visualize the oil flow below the top ring gap. It was observed that the two vortices downstream the top ring gap can cause oil bridging towards the liner, providing lubrication to the ring-liner interface. On the modeling side, a 3D machine learning model was developed to predict the vortex flow pattern for different pressure boundary conditions. It was found that the size and the strength of the vortex grows with increasing ratio of the upstream and downstream pressure. The combination of modeling and experimental results identified that oil bridged towards the liner by vortex is the major contributing factor to dry region lubrication.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid growth of illicit supply chains during and after the Covid-19 pandemic reveals a need for effectively combating and preventing the cross-border movement of contraband, including but not limited to counterfeit goods. A proactive approach by companies along with public stakeholders, such as government agencies and individual consumers, toward disrupting illicit supply chains operating across borders is especially important during moments of global crisis when consumers are more susceptible to unknowingly purchasing substandard counterfeit products such as respirators. While marketplaces, platforms, and other legitimate businesses have worked to prevent movement of counterfeits and illicit goods through their services, the high adaptability and sophistication of counterfeiters requires more preventative and multistakeholder approaches. \n\nThis article outlines a multidisciplinary and multilayered approach to detecting and disrupting illicit supply chains of counterfeit personal protective equipment (PPE) with a focus on respirators. It utilizes research conducted for a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant on Covid-19 related crime, including the advertising and sale of counterfeit respirators. One layer examines online content as seen by the end user and the activity of vendors or sellers used to advertise and sell counterfeit products. The research is also informed by data on the information, financial, and physical flows of counterfeit respirators obtained through a public-private partnership with George Mason University’s Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center (TraCCC-GMU) and 3M, one of the largest manufacturers of respirators in the world. The article examines an important and relatively recent trend - how emerging technological shifts in the marketplace are affecting global security. \n\nResearch from the TraCCC-GMU and 3M partnership, including a data sharing agreement, revealed that counterfeiters constantly change their modus operandi to continue selling illicit goods with impunity, facilitating illicit activity with the use and abuse of legitimate companies such as ecommerce marketplaces and social media. The article presents an overview of the current state of counterfeit supply chains and provides concrete policy recommendations on how legitimate companies can move beyond just removing listings but must also actively prevent these transnational crimes through innovative multidisciplinary approaches, advanced data analytics, and public awareness campaigns. The research also seeks to connect the dots to broader policy implications in terms of the legitimate economy and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Buy-one-get-one (BOGO) promotions have become popular. With BOGO, the first unit is sold for the regular price, and the second unit is discounted. We analyze BOGO in manufacturer–retailer supply chains. We identify conditions under which BOGO outperforms price reduction (PR) and everyday low price (EDLP) policies. We find that, for some products, whether consumers stockpile or not, if BOGO and PR have the same market size, BOGO has a larger retailer profit and the same or larger manufacturer profit because BOGO induces more consumers to buy and consume two units. When consumers stockpile, the retailer sets prices to prevent such behavior, and the retailer’s share of supply chain profits is largest under BOGO, whereas consumer surplus with BOGO is smaller than PR. We also find that BOGO reduces double marginalization. When PR expands market size more than BOGO, BOGO’s effectiveness diminishes. When consumers stockpile without increasing consumption and/or production cost is high, EDLP is best. Our results are robust to multiperiod with single-promotion-period settings. A large number of regular-price periods following a promotion period increases stockpiling, which erodes the retailer’s profit and favors EDLP. If promotions are offered for consecutive periods, a larger number of promotion periods increases PR’s efficacy relative to BOGO. Time-inconsistent consumers increase stockpiling and make PR outperform BOGO. Heterogeneous consumers’ holding cost and marginal utility prevent retailers from perfectly discriminating among consumers who make profit-reducing choices.

The effective functioning of the system of providing material resources is influenced by the timeliness and completeness of the financing of the needs of comprehensive provision of troops (forces). The reform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine envisages the introduction of electronic accounting systems for material and technical resources by NATO supply classes, bringing the volume of indestructible stockpiles of material resources in line with the real needs for these resources. In order to achieve strategic goals and fulfill the main tasks defined by the Strategic Defense Bulletin of Ukraine and the State Program for the Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, planned phased work is underway to implement reforms aimed at developing a single effective logistics system according to NATO standards, capable of providing effective support to all components of the defense forces , who, in the established order and under the conditions determined by the legislation of Ukraine, are involved in the implementation of the task of defense of the state as part of the defense forces. In addition, the experience of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the defense forces in the conditions of armed aggression by the Russian Federation indicates the need to create a system of providing material and technical means, works and services as a component of the system of providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other components of the defense forces during the joint performance of tasks with defense of the state. After all, the organization of the material support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in practice showed that the existing system of rear, technical and medical support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine turned out to be limited in its ability to perform tasks during mobilization and operational deployment, as well as directly in the interests of the use of groups of troops (forces), therefore its functioning, both in peacetime and in a special period, needs drastic changes.</jats:p>",

As numerous restaurants and food service companies closed their doors amidst the public health crisis, millions of employees across this important – and large – part of the American economy found themselves jobless. This research seeks to uncover the sizeable impacts of the pandemic on employment trends and job insecurity in the restaurant and food service sector using longitudinal data from the United States Census Bureau. Through exploration of overall pre- and post-pandemic income trends, employment disparities across job categories in the restaurant business, and volatile metrics such as turnover and outmigration, combined into a new metric, the “Churn Rate” in occupations, the researchers offer insight into the changing trajectory of food culture and what it truly means to “dine out.” Future economic implications – for the food service value chain overall and for consumers - are summarily explored and suggestions for further research are offered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Purpose\nSupplying off-grid facilities such as astronomical observatories with renewable energy-based systems (RES) instead of diesel generators can considerably reduce their environmental impact. However, RES require oversized capacities to counter intermittency and comply with reliability requirements, hence shifting the environmental impact from operation to construction phase. We assess whether 100% RES scenarios are favorable from an environmental point of view, and discuss the trade-offs in systems with backup fossil generators versus 100% renewable ones.\nMethods\nIn this comparative life cycle assessment (LCA), we study various RES supply systems to power a new telescope in the Atacama desert, Chile. We compare six setups, including 100% RES scenarios, namely photovoltaics (PV) with batteries and hydrogen energy storage; high-renewable scenarios, with fossil fuel power generation next to RES and storage; and a system combining PV with diesel generation. We base system sizing on a techno-economical optimization for the start of operation in 2030. Foreground data stem from recent life cycle inventories of RES components and 2030 electricity mix assumptions of production places. We assess environmental impact in the categories climate change, mineral resource depletion and water use.\nResults and discussion\nWe find that 100% RES and high-renewable scenarios result in emissions of 0.077-0.115kg CO2e/kWh supplied, compared to 0.917kg CO2e/kWh in the reference case with solely diesel generation. 100% RES scenarios have a lower CO2e impact than high-renewable scenarios. However, the latter lower the mineral resource depletion and water use by about 27% compared to 100% RES scenarios. Applying hybrid energy storage systems increases the water use impact, while reducing the mineral resource depletion.\nConclusions\nNone of the six energy systems we compared was clearly the best in all environmental impacts considered. Trade-offs must be taken when choosing an energy system to supply the prospective off-grid telescope in Chile. We find high-renewable systems with some fossil generation as the better option regarding power reliability, mineral resource depletion and water use, while inducing slightly higher greenhouse gas emissions than the 100% RES scenarios.\nAs remote research facilities and off-grid settlements today are mainly supplied by fossil fuels, we expect to motivate more multifaceted decisions for implementing larger shares of RES for these areas. To advance the LCA community in the field of energy systems, we should strive to incorporate temporal and regional realities into our life cycle inventories. To ease the path for upcoming studies, we publish this work’s inventories as detailed activity level datasets.</p>"

There are at least several ways to do this - from increasing the scope of a company's operations to looking for weak links within the company, thus optimising the costs incurred. It so happens, however, that it is not internal conditions that shape the business entity, but external influences over which one does not always have control. It then remains to adapt to the new reality and, as far as possible, reduce its negative impact. The aim of the study was to analyse the disruptions created within supply chains and their impact on the transport company. The problem discussed referred to the issue of opportunity cost - in particular the cost of lost opportunities and benefits, in order to then propose changes and actions to reduce the adverse effects from external influences. Based on the research conducted, it can be concluded that disruptions in supply chains affect companies' opportunity costs (1). By identifying and analysing disruptions, several options for minimising opportunity costs can be identified (2). Considering the disruptions in supply chains under the impact of the global crises, the following are cited as the most relevant: disruptions related to on-time delivery, limited opportunities to hire new drivers and opportunities to acquire a new set of vehicles (3). These disruptions prevented the surveyed entity from expanding its operations and thus impacted on its opportunity costs.</jats:p>"

Optimizing the phase of the beginning of fuel supply – the advance angle of fuel injection (AAFI) shows the possibility of a significant improvement in fuel efficiency and toxicity of diesel exhaust gases. To assess the effect of the AAFI on the diesel locomotive performance, its experimental studies were carried out. The object of bench tests was a diesel generator set of type 1-PDG4D with the specified diesel and with a traction generator MPT-84/39. During the tests, the dependencies of diesel indicators on the AAFI were obtained. The necessity of optimizing the values of the AAFI in accordance with the engine operating mode is confirmed. Optimized values of the AAFI are obtained in the modes of diesel characteristics. The toxicity indicators of diesel exhaust gases and fuel efficiency with optimized characteristics of the AAFI are determined.</jats:p>",

Ecological regeneration risk factors include frequent changes in natural environments, imperfect interpretation of natural systems by humans, and a lack of knowledge on past successes and shortcomings. The Internet of Things (IoT) uses in environmental monitoring are varied: environmental protection, extreme weather monitoring, water safety, conservation of endangered species, and commercial farming. In this paper, artificial intelligence-based environmental decision restoration framework (AI-EDRF) has been proposed to strengthen the continuously evolving natural systems; people are deficient about natural systems and the insufficient knowledge about past achievements and failures. The biological terrestrial collective analysis is introduced to improve natural systems is rapidly evolving, and people are inadequately aware of natural systems. Stochastic water quality analysis is integrated with AI-EDRF to boost past achievements and failures. IoT-enabled smart energy management is an effective approach to provide cost-effective, efficient energy distribution and technologies are used in connection with sustainable, renewable energy sources. The computational analysis is executed based on accuracy, performance ratio, reaction time, and data deployment to verify the developed framework's reliability.</jats:p>",

It is the basis of many different products, including rice flour, rice bread, noodles, rice vinegar, and others. Therefore, the rice supply chain has garnered increasing attention due to the high demand for food safety. Furthermore, malpractices in the rice supply chain can impact farmers by generating low revenues despite their great efforts in rice cultivation. In addition, they would cause governments to suffer significant economic losses due to the high cost of importing rice crops from other countries during the off-season. These issues derive from the lack of reliability, trust, transparency, traceability, and security in the rice supply chain. In this research, we propose a secure, trusted, reliable, and transparent framework based on a Blockchain for rice crop supply chain’s traceability from farm to fork. A new crypto token, the Rice Coin (RC), is introduced to keep a record of all transactions between the stakeholders of the rice supply chain. Moreover, the proposed framework includes an economic model and a crypto wallet and introduces an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the RC. Based on smart contracts, a transaction processing system was developed for the transparency and traceability of rice crops, including the conversion of the RC to fiat currency. Furthermore, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is proposed in this research to store encrypted data of companies, retailers, and farmers, so to increase data security, transparency, and availability. In the end, the experimental results showed a better performance of the proposed framework compared to already available supply chain solutions in terms of transaction verification time, transaction average gas cost, and new block latency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates smart grid energy supply forecasting and economic operation management, with a focus on building an efficient energy supply prediction model. Four datasets were selected for training, and a Snake Optimizer (SO) algorithm-optimized Bigru-Attention model was proposed to construct a comprehensive and efficient prediction model, aiming to enhance the reliability, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of the power system. The research process includes data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. Data preprocessing ensures data quality and suitability. In the model training phase, the Snake Optimizer (SO) algorithm-optimized Bigru-Attention model combines time series, spatial features, and optimization features to build a comprehensive prediction model. The model evaluation phase calculates metrics such as prediction error, accuracy, and stability, and also examines the model’s training time, inference time, number of parameters, and computational complexity to assess its efficiency and scalability. The contribution of this research lies in proposing the Snake Optimizer (SO) algorithm-optimized Bigru-Attention model and constructing an efficient comprehensive prediction model. The results indicate that the Snake Optimizer (SO) algorithm exhibits significant advantages and contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of the experimental process. The model holds promising applications in the field of energy supply forecasting and provides robust support for the stable operation and optimized economic management of smart grids. Moreover, this study has positive social and economic implications for the development of smart grids and sustainable energy utilization.</jats:p>"

To explore the optimal operation strategies for retailers in TSC and BSP, we develop the vertically differentiated model to describe the channel competition and derive optimal decisions for two retailers. Then, the BSP's comparative advantage and the value of blockchain technology are analyzed. Next, we examine how blockchain quality disclosure and network externalities affect channel competition, as well as the impact of government policies. We find that (i) a higher quality improvement in BSP will simultaneously increase both retail prices and retailers’ profit under some circumstances. Meanwhile, the counterfeit sold in the TSC and channel switching hassle in the BSP make retailers’ products less competitive and reduce profits, respectively. (ii) Being a BSP retailer is not necessarily better, as blockchain's effect on product quality and consumer experience determines market share and profitability. Whether consumers can benefit from blockchain depends on the basic value of the BSP product and the aggregate level of consumer utility from the BSP. (iii) Blockchain‐based quality disclosures and network externalities might not always benefit BSPs, they could increase BSP retailers’ costs or increase competition in the market. (iv) The strict supervision policy reduces the TSC retailer's profit and product quality. Meanwhile, the technology subsidy policy contributes to the development of the BSP, but the BSP retailer needs to be wary of uncontrolled price increases due to policy spillover effects.</jats:p>",

Evaporation and transpiration, sensitivity coefficient of water tension, cultivation costs, product price and water allocated to plants are among the main sources of uncertainty in the simulation process. This study was conducted to estimate the fluctuations of the response due to the uncertainty of four parameters of soil moisture, water provided for cultivation, cost of cultivation during the growing season, and coefficient of sensitivity to drought. In the concept of water and food nexus, two basic factors, including increasing economic productivity and achieving maximum product production, are known as decision criteria. Therefore, mathematical modeling of net income and the ratio of actual and potential yield production has been prepared according to the four uncertain input variables of the problem. The proposed model has used a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm to estimate the best values of non-deterministic variables. The results of the uncertainty analysis showed that the range of changes in performance and net profit compared to the coefficient of sensitivity to water stress has different ranges and mechanisms and knowing the nature of each helps to improve the responses.</jats:p>",

A new hybrid solution is described that allows controlling the power of semiconductors by switches (ON/OFF mode) or as a linear device. The approach avoids over-design of the power supply and makes it possible to implement new low power solutions constituting a novel design by joining a continuous match between the ON/OFF mode and the linear control of the power semiconductor devices.</jats:p>"

The corrected errors are used to construct the gray-weighted Markov chain model, and the arithmetic tests and example data analysis are conducted for the model. In terms of the model accuracy, it was improved by 12.75%, 9.28%, and 7.98% compared with the ARIMA model, ES model, and W-Markov model, respectively. From the perception of supply-demand matching, four demands are in low perception, and three demands are in high perception. This indicates that the use of the gray-Markov chain model can effectively realize the analysis of rural tourism supply and demand matching and also provides theoretical support for rural tourism to realize the supply and demand matching with tourists.</jats:p>",

The consumption pattern of the agro-industrial community has changed over the past ten years. Previously, consumers’ preference for purchasing food and beverages was 38.9%, but this reduced to 36.7% in 2018. Due to shifting customer demand trends, this consumption issue is one that the environment outside the organization is to blame for. The supply chain management plan is one of the environmental concerns the organization has considered in its strategy. In the food and beverage agro-industry in Malang City, this study aims to ascertain the impact of ecological factors on supply chain management strategies and the existence of mediating variables, specifically internal factors that have an indirect relationship between external factors and supply chain management strategies. With a path coefficient of 0.212 0.688 and a P-value of &lt;0.001, the WarpPLS SEM analysis method produced results that showed both internal and external factors had an impact on the supply chain management strategy despite internal factors having a more minor effect than external factors. To sustain client loyalty, internal variables must continue to match customer demand when there is an increase in the number of customers.

The application of circular economy concepts to supply chains creates resilient supply chains by reducing dependence on external inputs and outputs to help business cope with unforeseen disasters. The resilient supply chain is enhanced by applying the \"3R\" principle of value recapture in the circular economy model, i.e. reduce, reuse and recycle, and also by drawing on economic models such as platform economy and sharing economy. The paper references are taken from academic databases such as Google Scholar, as well as online materials such as official websites and news websites, and publications such as Supply Chain Guide.</jats:p>"

As the industry continues to expand there is a growing need to adopt sustainable practices in the supply chain to minimize negative impact on the environment and society and ensure viability. The present research aims at examining the supply chain management practices of the two leading dairy firms -Amul and Danone. The study relies primarily on secondary sources like peer-reviewed journals, authentic websites and reports. A case study-based approach has predominantly been used to compare two leading firms in the dairy industry with respect to sustainable practices across the supply chain. Key aspects such as the scale of dairy production, technology adoption, pricing, traditional supply chain management, artificial intelligence in sustainable supply chains and logistics management in select dairy firms have been critically reviewed for comparison purposes. The study identified the various problems and challenges being faced by the Indian dairy industry. The study found that Amul and Danone both have focused on sustainable and green practices. However, Danone’s ability to incorporate and enable technology has helped in improving efficiency across the supply chain making the chain sustainable. On the other hand, Amul lacked the adaptation of emerging technologies across its supply chain. The study suggested the exploration of artificial intelligence that might help in achieving a sustainable supply chain in Indian dairy firms.\n</jats:p>"

Owing to the non-linearity and complexity of the real-world IEEE optimal power flow (OPF) in modern power system issues and like the existing algorithms, the SDO optimizer necessitates some enhancement to satisfy the required OPF characteristics integrating hybrid wind and solar powers. Thus, a SDO variant namely leader supply-demand-based optimization (LSDO) is proposed in this research. The LSDO is suggested to improve the exploration based on the simultaneous crossover and mutation mechanisms and thereby reduce the probability of trapping in local optima. The LSDO effectiveness has been first tested on 23 benchmark functions and has been assessed through a comparison with well-regarded state-of-the-art competitors. Afterward, Three well-known constrained IEEE 30, 57, and 118-bus test systems incorporating both wind and solar power sources were investigated in order to authenticate the performance of the LSDO considering a constraint handling technique called superiority of feasible solutions (SF). The statistical outcomes reveal that the LSDO offers promising competitive results not only for its first version but also for the other competitors.</jats:p>"

This study assessed the performance of the water supply system in Muke Turi town, Oromia, Ethiopia. The Water Geospatial Engineering Modeling System (WaterGEMS) model was used for hydraulic analysis of the distribution network. The water losses were determined by different indicators including non-revenue water (NRW), losses per pipe connection (LPC), losses per main pipe length (LMPL), unavoidable annual real losses (UARL), and infrastructure leakage index (ILI). The water supply coverage of the town was found as 43.34%, which is considerably low. From the hydraulic analysis, the velocity of flow in 54.2% of the pipe and pressure at 60% of the nodes were found within the recommended ranges. The NRW was estimated at 37.61%, which is above the acceptable limit. Of which, the real losses are the major ones with 37.14%. Moreover, the LPC and LMPL were found to be 298 l/d and 29,709 l/km/d, respectively, which are again above the recommended limits. Based on ILI, the annual real losses were estimated to be 4.31 times the UARL. Finally, it was concluded that access to water in the town is inadequate which is exacerbated by high losses.</jats:p>",

However, the effects of γ-PGA on soil NH3 volatilization, soil nitrogen pool, and crop growth have been rarely studied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of γ-PGA on NH3 volatilization, soil mineral nitrogen content, and soybean seed productivity. We conducted an incubation experiment and a pot experiment using two different textured soils (sandy soil and sandy loam soil) with four γ-PGA application rates (0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5%, w/w). The results showed that the application of γ-PGA decreased the peak value of NH3 volatilization and cumulative NH3 emission through the incubation experiment. Cumulative NH3 volatilization decreased with increasing γ-PGA application amount. The addition of γ-PGA to sandy soil and sandy loam soil increased soil N content by 17–63% and 7–33%, respectively. Based on pot experimental results and principal component analysis, we recommend the optimal rates of γ-PGA application were 0.3% (w/w) in sandy soil and 0.1% (w/w) in sandy loam soil. This study provides a theoretical basis for the addition of γ-PGA as a promising strategy to reduce NH3 volatilization and increase soil nitrogen content.</jats:p>",

Considering the low frequency and non-repeatability of these disruption events makes it impossible to collect data to obtain their probabilities. In this study, supply disruptions were regarded as uncertain events; supply chain uncertain disruption risk is defined and quantified based on the uncertainty theory, in which uncertain disruptions are characterized by the belief degree on account of expert estimation with duality, i.e., symmetry. Optimization models were constructed with the objective of minimizing expected carbon emissions and costs, which optimizes the selection of suppliers with uncertain disruptions, and the assignment of manufacturers and customers. The properties of the model were analyzed, and the models were solved separately using different methods according to different decision criteria. Finally, the validity of the proposed models and algorithm were verified using a real case study of a glass manufacturing company. The findings exhibit promising insights for designing a sustainable and resilient supply chain network in an uncertain environment.</jats:p>"

When patients present with finger injuries, there is often damage to the vascular nerve bundles, which requires subsequent reconstruction. It is unknown if repairing a unilaterally injured artery affects patients’ recovery in a well-perfused finger. This retrospective cohort study compares the clinical outcomes of 11 patients with one-vessel supply (mean age 48.3 years; 7 males, 4 females) to 14 patients with two-vessel supply (mean age 44.5 years; 8 males, 6 females). The patient outcomes were assessed using patient questionnaires (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version (EQ-5D-5L), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS)) and a clinical examination of hand function and imaging of circulatory efficiency. No significant changes were observed in the DASH, EQ-5D-5L, and EQ-VAS questionnaires. Clinical evaluation of hand function, measured by cold sensitivity, two-point discrimination, pain numerical analog scale, and grip strength also revealed no significant differences between cohorts. Blood flow measurements using thermal imaging revealed no effects on circulation in the affected digit. Collectively, the study finds reconstruction is not absolutely necessary when there is one intact digital artery as it is sufficient for healing and functional outcomes. We recommend finger artery reconstruction when both digital arteries are injured or if an immediate tension-free suture is possible.</jats:p>"

In the Netherlands, food supply chain actors are already working towards making better use of agri-food surpluses to improve food security and resource efficiency. By analysing the experiences of these actors, this study aims to identify the current state of the sector and highlight barriers and enablers of successful food waste valorisation. Based on a phenomenological analysis of 16 in-depth unstructured interviews with participants from the Netherlands, we empirically demonstrate that supply chain actors involved in food waste valorisation consider local embedding, societal perception, and food safety to be important aspects of their work. They often grapple with legislative and logistical uncertainties and face various ethical dilemmas such as having to pay for products that were once considered waste. Building on these findings, we propose that experienced professionals with a penchant for sustainability can play the role of ‘transition brokers’ as the food system moves towards a circular way of operating. We also posit that private standards and voluntary agreements could be a way for the sector to better manage the various bottlenecks that are characteristic of food waste valorisation endeavours.</jats:p>"

This has led to an expanding body of research focused on studying these challenges. Hence, there is a growing need for a comprehensive review that summarizes the current studies, identifies their limitations, and provides essential advancements to support scholars in the field. To overcome these limitations, this research aims to provide insights into managing uncertainties in BSCs. The review utilizes the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, identifying 205 papers for analysis. This study encompasses three key tasks: first, it analyses the general information of the shortlisted papers. Second, it discusses existing methodologies and their limitations in addressing uncertainties. Lastly, it identifies critical research gaps and potential future directions. One notable gap involves the underutilization of machine learning techniques, which show potential for risk identification, resilient planning, demand prediction, and parameter estimations in BSCs but have received limited attention. Another area for investigation is the potential of agent-based simulation, which can contribute to analysing resilient policies, evaluating resilience, predicting parameters, and assessing the impact of emerging technologies on BSC resilience in the twenty-first century. Additionally, the study identifies the omission of various realistic assumptions, such as backward flow, lateral transshipments, and ripple effects in BSC. This study highlights the complexity of managing uncertainties in BSCs and emphasizes the need for further research and attention. It contributes to policymakers’ understanding of uncertain sources and suitable approaches while inspiring researchers to address limitations and generate breakthrough ideas in managing BSC uncertainties.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research analyses the feasibility of supplying a large size desalination energy demand by marine renewables. The case study is Las Palmas III seawater desalination plant, the largest desalination plant in the Canary Islands (Spain), which is located in the northeast of the island of Gran Canaria. Its average daily water production is 62,614 m³/day, consuming a total of 90,669.52 MWh/year. A constant energy production is needed for the optimal plant operation which raises the possibility of using different renewable technologies in order to reduce the energy fluctuations. In this case, the sea and its wind and wave energy resources are key technologies for supplying desalination plants near the coast. For this reason, different configurations have been simulated combining both technologies and analyzing their pairing in hourly terms to achieve a more stable energy production. The proposed methodology contemplates the identification of the hotspot for the technologies location in terms of environmental constraints and resource assessment (both wind and waves). The subsequent selection of the wind turbine and the wave converter and the energy coverage evaluation. Results tried to establish if the combination of offshore wind and wave energy improves the demand coverage in overall terms and in terms of seasonal match.</jats:p>"

Due to the advancement of industry and technology, the needs of human beings are constantly changing and the process of supplying goods and services becomes more complex. Reasoning competition and profit maximization, the manufacturing sector creates severe environmental problems and social problems as well. Under this scenario, conducting research has begun on how manufacturing should take place while conserving the environment. Accordingly, previous literature confirms that green supply chain management is the appropriate solution for overcoming environmental issues.Although several research studies have been conducted to examine this relationship, moderating effects of various pressures on this relationship have not been investigated within the Sri Lankan context. Therefore, this research aims to identify the impact of green supply chain management practices on firms’ triple-bottom-line performance and also examine the moderating effects of regulatory pressure on this relationship. A hundred large-scale manufacturing companies were selected as the sample through the purposive sampling method. Moreover, a questionnaire survey was employed for the data collection, and data was analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis using PLS-SEM software. Findings indicate that significant positive relationship between green supply chain management practices and triple bottom line performance i.e., environmental, economic, and social. Moreover, findings accentuate that regulation pressure moderates the relationship of green supply chain management practices only with environmental and social performances. This explored knowledge will encourage practitioners to implement green practices within their supply chains and it enables the country to achieve sustainable goals.</jats:p>"

A bilevel design and pricing model is proposed to capture the dynamic decision process between a biofuel producer as a Stackelberg leader and farmers as Stackelberg followers. The bilevel optimization model is transformed into a tractable single-level formulation by using optimality constraints. Other unique characteristics of our problem at hand include the incorporation of the harvesting time and frequency decisions in the biomass supply chain network design problem for the first time and consideration of the uncertainty in switchgrass yield in a robust optimization setting to take into account the risk-averse behavior of the farmers (suppliers). To efficiently solve the model, we propose a Benders decomposition algorithm enhanced by surrogate constraints, strengthened Benders cuts, and in-out cut loop stabilization. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the branch-and-cut approach of CPLEX in terms of run times and gaps. We conduct a case study with data from Texas to validate the capabilities of our mathematical model and solution approach.

However, a supply chain that can adapt and react to the current scenario gives them some control over these ambiguous circumstances. These characteristics of sensing disturbances or threats and giving appropriate responses can be improved with the implementation of blockchain‐enabled technologies and can prove critical to the success of supply chain resilience and sustainability. This study has identified 21 blockchain technology‐enabled critical success factors for supply chain resilience and sustainability and grey theory is used to address the limitation of data availability. This study incorporates the combination of the Grey‐DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method to investigate the impact of critical success factors and to obtain the cause/effect relationship. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of obtained results. The findings indicate that internal integration is the most crucial causal factor, as it initiates the effects of many other critical success factors. Whereas Standardized Data Management, followed by Smart Ordering tops the effect group. As blockchain technology is still in its early stages of development, this study will encourage researchers and industry practitioners to strive for greater efficiency and effectiveness in their supply chain practices and to enhance the resilience and sustainability of their supply chains.</jats:p>",

The evaluation is done through the analysis of long-term occurrence characteristics of dry years, as well as the analysis of the water supply system including the daily based rainfall-runoff analysis and reservoir operation. This study considers the Boryeong Dam basin in Korea as a study basin. Summarizing the results is as follows. First, the future rainfall data show that the occurrence frequency of dry years is similar to the observed, but the occurrence frequency of consecutive multi-year dry years is far smaller than the observed. Second, the future rainfall data result in no or far less water supply shortages. This is mainly due to the fact that the Boryeong Dam has the ability to overcome the one-year drought and the future rainfall data contain far fewer multi-year droughts. However, these results clearly indicate the problems of the future rainfall data, especially in the long-term persistence of rainfall. It is thus disappointing that these future climate rainfall data may not be used to evaluate the water supply system in the future, at least in the Boryeong Dam basin.</jats:p>",

Though all sectors are putting their efforts into coping with the problems associated with the energy crisis, one of the many ways is to reduce distribution losses, particularly in the gas sector. The loss impacts include methane escaping to the environment to affect ozone, direct financial loss, non-availability of gas to the domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors, public safety hazards and indirect environmental impacts. There is a dire need to improve the natural gas distribution system, which has its own insight problems to be addressed. This work aims to investigate leakages in domestic, commercial and industrial gas distribution lines with different times, volumes and pressures using a pressure profiling technique. As a result of this investigation, around 293 million cubic feet (MMCF) of natural gas is saved, which is enough volume to feed approximately 16,000 domestic consumers for 365 days. The same energy content is equivalent to 21 million pounds of coal, which emits 64 million pounds of carbon dioxide, whereas natural gas would have 50% less CO2 emissions, and that is apart from the tangible pollution and waste associated with the use of coal.</jats:p>"

The agricultural data ecosystem (ADE) serves as a crucial socio-technical infrastructure, aggregating diverse data from various platforms and, thus, advertising sustainable agriculture and digitalization. Establishing trustworthy data sharing and exchange in agro-food value chains involves socioeconomic and technological elements addressed by the agricultural data space (ADS) and its trust principles. This paper outlines key challenges to data sharing in agro-food chains impeding ADE establishment based on the review of 27 studies in scientific literature. Challenges mainly arise from stakeholders’ mistrust in the data-sharing process, inadequate data access and use policies, and unclear data ownership agreements. In the ADE context, interoperability is a particularly challenging topic for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the system. Considering these challenges and data space principles and building blocks, we propose a set of design principles for ADS design and implementation that aim to mitigate the adverse impact of these challenges and facilitate agricultural data sharing and exchange.</jats:p>"

However, the environmental assessment of emerging technologies for producing bioplastic from seaweed remains challenging due to the difficulties in modeling future seaweed supply and demand. Within the consequential approach to life cycle assessment, an increase in demand for seaweed is met by the marginal suppliers in the market: those that are not constrained in their capacity to increase supply in response to an increase in demand. Current methods to identify marginal suppliers are however based on quantitative information and do not consider qualitative aspects and uncertainties inherent in the study of emerging technologies. This study, therefore, proposes and tests the use of quantitative storytelling to identify marginal suppliers. The results show that there are two main groups of countries that are expected to be the marginal suppliers of brown seaweed for different reasons. Asian countries are currently the main brown seaweed suppliers and are expected to keep increasing and be marginal suppliers in the future. However, these countries have well‐established brown seaweed aquaculture and their growth is expected to be steady. On the other hand, brown seaweed suppliers in Northern Europe and North America are still emerging but are expected to grow faster in the future due to their production capacity and technological development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Zinc is the fourth most consumed metal globally and its corrosion resistance properties contribute significantly to the longevity, reliability, and sustainability of construction and infrastructure projects, vehicle manufacturing, and green technologies. By extending the lifespan of these assets and promoting durability, zinc supports the goals of the green transition by reducing resource consumption, minimizing waste, and enhancing overall environmental performance. Four broad ore deposit types account for over 90% of global zinc production and known resources. These are, in order of importance, shale-hosted massive sulphide (‘VHMS’) deposits, volcanogenic massive sulphide (‘VMS’) deposits, carbonate replacement (‘CRD’) deposits, and Irish-type / Mississippi-valley type (‘IT’ / ‘MVT’) deposits. Each ore deposit type contains a relatively small number of world-class ore deposits which are characterized by their large size, high-grades, and economic viability. These world class deposits represent the most significant de-posits within their respective deposit types and generally attract substantial attention and investment from mining and exploration companies. The Irish Midlands basin is a globally significant area for zinc exploration and mining and discoveries over the past 60 years have demonstrated its potential to generate world-class deposits. One notable example is the Navan de-posit, which is one of the largest known Irish-Type/Mississippi Valley-Type (IT / MVT) deposits in the world. Navan has been a prolific producer of zinc and lead ores for the past 45 years, contributing significantly to the mineral wealth and economic development of the region. Irish-type deposits, such as Navan and Lisheen/Galmoy, have the advantage of being metallurgically straightforward and of producing clean concentrates with minimal impurities. Such clean concentrates are highly sought after by zinc smelters worldwide, as they allow for efficient blending with other zinc concentrates of lower quality. After decades of mineral exploration, the potential for new discoveries in the Irish Midlands basin still remains high. The metal endowment of the basin and quality of its deposits, coupled with advances in exploration technologies, such as seismics, make it an attractive exploration play. Large areas of the basin also remain relatively underexplored, particularly under cover rock sequences, such as the Tober Colleen Formation (the lowermost part of the “Calp”). Indeed, the combination of accumulated geological knowledge, technological advancements, and on-going exploration programmes greatly enhances the likelihood of new and exciting mineral discoveries in the Irish Midlands basin in the coming years. In summary, the Irish Midlands basin's track record of discoveries and the characteristics of Irish-type deposits, including their size, grade and concentrate quality, reinforce the basin's significance in global zinc exploration and mining. Production of zinc from the Irish Midlands basin also contributes to the European Union’s (EU) mineral self-sufficiency objectives and sustainability agenda thereby enhancing resource security, reducing carbon emissions, and fostering a more sustainable and resilient mineral supply chain within the EU.</jats:p>",

Based on this, this paper proposes and constructs a risk control model of financial big data analysis based on collaborative filtering algorithm. The purpose of this study is to realize the resource integration of supply chain enterprises and optimize the logistics chain, financial chain and information chain through the analysis of financial big data based on collaborative filtering algorithm, provide quality services for supply chain enterprises and good support for solving the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to verify the feasibility of the model, an experimental analysis is carried out. The experimental results show that this model has good scalability and operability, and the algorithm itself also has good scalability. The results of empirical analysis further verify that the design method in this paper has a good recommendation effect in terms of matching degree and user satisfaction. Compared with other risk control models, it is more practical and feasible. This research has certain practical significance for the financial management of supply chain enterprises. </jats:p>",

The relevance of the study is due to the need to preserve the memory of the participants in the war and the inhabitants of the home front, to study from other methodological positions the features of survival and existence in the years of the most difficult trials of the middle of the 20th century. The practical significance of the study is expressed in the possibility of using its results in the reconstruction of the regional history of everyday life during the Great Patriotic War. The methodological potential of the study is revealed in the possibility of using its material at the level of a higher educational institution, when conducting classes in the history of Russia. The scientific novelty lies in the study, based on archival materials, sources of personal origin, of the features of catering, behavior patterns, domestic and labor daily practices of Soviet society during the Great Patriotic War, taking into account the specifics of the Stavropol region.  The results of the study indicate that the food supply, organized in the form of a rationing system during the war, provided only the nutritional needs of only a small part of the population of Stavropol. The majority, the inhabitants of the village, were self-sufficient and survived thanks to their personal plots of land. In the daily existence of residents, especially young people, a constant “sign” of the war years was malnutrition, eating various surrogates, hunger, massive in some areas of the region, led to all sorts of deviations, often - theft, severely punished by the state law enforcement machine.</jats:p>",

Italian companies operating in this field were identified and economically characterized using the Chamber of Commerce’s Register of Companies. A qualitative web content analysis was then conducted to extract information about the marketed products, mushroom species, and retail channels, as well as the adopted certifications. The obtained data were quantitatively analyzed through descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis. The Italian market is concentrated in northern areas of the country, and the limited company size indicates fragmentation at the production level, which led to Italy not being competitive enough and, thus, heavily rely on imports. Production is limited to less than 10 species, and innovative mushroom-based products, such as burgers, have shown a limited presence on the market, although they are gaining market share online. The novelty of growing kits highlights the potential to use food production waste to create fungal substrates. Investments in training new mushroom growers and studying new formulations and new fungal species are needed; these investments could allow greater market differentiation and be a good opportunity to promote local economies and create new job opportunities, thus meeting the requirements for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

This paper constructs a resources integration theory, which classifies agricultural resources into six types and measures their correlation with food and grain supply capacity using grey correlation analysis. The results show that, during 2002-2020, among the factor resources, the highest correlation with food and grain was technology; among the related industry resources, the highest correlation with food was rural roads, and with grain was agricultural machinery; among the demand resources, the highest correlation was domestic market; among the six types of resources, the highest correlation was government resources; and the static correlation evaluation indices of agricultural resources with food and grain supply capacity were 0.8312 and 0.8090, respectively, indicating a compare match. Based on the results, this paper argues that the Chinese agri-food system is matched with agricultural resources, but still needs to be improved to achieve a high match. Opportunity resources, foreign investment, and international markets are disadvantageous resources because China has insufficient ability to stably utilize foreign resources. China’s proposal of a \"big food view\" is conducive to reducing dependence on factor resources, especially cultivated land and water resources.</jats:p>"

This study has been conducted to simulate the trading and non-trading policies in the Particle Swarm Optimization framework for estimating the optimal economic values of agricultural water in Jilin province, northeastern China. Fuzzy solutions have been also calculated by definition of the feasible domain for water availability and permits. A generalized extreme value function was incorporated into the problem to predict the rainfall amounts with a 25-year return period. The results showed that determining the agricultural pattern using a trading policy with the aim of benefiting from the water will reduce the water demand in the study area. The trading policy can lead to a more efficient allocation of released water and reduce water scarcity, but it can eliminate some plants from the cropping pattern by reducing the water level. As a result, trading policy can be effective in the short term, especially in drought conditions due to insufficient water supply.</jats:p>",

This study aims to develop an approach towards examining the state and building a framework for examining the OHCSCM in rural areas. The study develops a framework by integrating various theories and methodologies like stakeholders' theory, critical success factor (CSF) theory, triple bottom line theory, fuzzy set theory, evidential reasoning approach, and scenario analysis for identifying the dynamism among the CSFs. The developed framework helps prioritize the CSFs based on environmental, economic, and social perspectives. Further, the model helps create scenarios for decision‐makers to improve the understanding of the CSFs influencing OHCSCM and achieve sustainability. The study reveals that infrastructure development, security and privacy of data, and use of predictive tools are the top factors that need immediate attention. By recognizing the interdependencies and interactions between these factors, managers can develop a more comprehensive and integrated approach to OHCSCM in rural areas. This understanding enables them to identify potential bottlenecks, streamline processes, and optimize resource allocation, ultimately saving valuable time and resources for achieving sustainability in the online healthcare supply chain in rural areas.</jats:p>",

However, to achieve digitally driven growth, service-based manufacturing requires a shift away from the traditional upstream and downstream hierarchy toward a collaborative model. In this study, service-oriented manufacturing companies in the packaging and printing industries are selected as case studies to examine the relationship between supply chain concentration, digital transformation, and corporate competitive advantage from the perspectives of power control and equilibrium. The results show that a high supply chain concentration harms firms’ competitive advantage, especially when power is unevenly distributed. Moreover, digital transformation plays a moderating role in this relationship, suggesting that it is possible to improve firms’ competitiveness and further equalize the power balance by applying digital technologies to supply chain processes. The study revealed significant heterogeneity within the group of companies in terms of ownership type, dual management roles, and company size.

The findings support the proposed model and reveal a positive effect of total dynamic capabilities and the four dynamic capabilities (i.e., collaboration, integration, agility, and reconfiguration) on the operational performance of hotel food supply chains through the mediating role of supply chain resilience. The results affirm that supply chain resilience mediates the relationship between dynamic capabilities (in total) and operational performance. Furthermore, the results show that environmental uncertainty moderates the above linkage, whereas disruption orientation does not do that. With the extension of DCV, our findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the dynamic capabilities contributing to the development of hotel food supply chain performance.

The analysis considers cocoa production from the farm level to the processing of cocoa beans into bars in three stages for 1 kg of dark chocolate: the farm maintenance and harvesting stage; post-harvesting stage; and processing stage. At the farm maintenance and harvesting stage, the significant contributions are 72.5% of total abiotic depletion (AD), 47.2% of total global warming (GW), 80.2% of total eutrophication (EU). The significant contributions at the post-harvesting are 31.2% of total AD, 51.8% of total GW, 83% of total EU, 26.4% of total ozone layer depletion (ODP), 20.1% of total cumulative energy demand (CED) and non-renewable fossil (NRF), and 36.9% of total CED renewable biomass (RB). And at the processing stage, the significant contributions are 20.5% of total AD, 15% of total GW, 4% of total ODP, 13.1% of total acidification (AC), 12% of total EU, 10% of total fossil resource scarcity (FRS), and 1.6% of total CED NRF.

This challenge is more pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa, where about 597 million people (43%) lack access to electricity. To address the challenge many countries are investing in electricity supply infrastructure projects such as transmission and distribution lines and power plants. Implementation of such projects is however faced with various challenges resulting in failure to achieve the intended objectives. Scholars have proposed solutions to address these challenges but available literature indicates the issue of quality planning in projects has not been exhaustively addressed. The main objective of this study was to assess the influence of quality planning on project success among electricity supply infrastructure projects in Kenya. The study was anchored on the Deming cycle and the Iron Triangle theories. A descriptive study design was employed in this research.  The study population was drawn from the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company staff, which implements electricity transmission projects in Kenya. A stratified sampling method coupled with Yamane’s formula was employed to identify the sample size of 80 among the staff. 63 responses from the surveyed staff were obtained and used for the analysis translating to a 78.75% response rate. The findings showed that the study accepted the alternative hypothesis and concluded that there is a significant and positive influence of quality planning on project success.

This vastness impacts business competitiveness since it adds complexity and can difficult securing traceability, chain of custody, and transparency. The authors propose that assuring chain of custody and traceability via blockchain allows organizations to demonstrate product provenance, integrity, and compliance. This work proposes that to effect true traceability the more complete approach is to connect both the supply chain actors (SCAs) and products identifications using digital certificates. A blockchain is used to manage the traceability of products and validation of the identities. Importing, verifying, and storing the certificates uses an off-chain data storage solution for products certificates. To create, validate the certificates, and setup the chain of trust, a public key infrastructure (PKI) was designed as part of the proposal. The results were architectural artifacts, including an Ethereum smart contract and a PKI-based certificate authentication system.</jats:p>",

Penghasilan terbesar yang didapatkan oleh perusahaan ini adalah berasal dari penjualan produk infus dengan tipe D5, NS, dan RL. Biasanya informasi mengenai permintaan konsumen terhadap suatu produk relatif stabil dari waktu ke waktu, namun permintaan dari toko ke penyalur (ritel) menuju ke pabrik jauh lebih fluktuatif dibandingkan dengan pola permintaan dari konsumen. Permintaan yang relatif stabil di tingkat pelanggan akhir berubah menjadi fluktuatif di bagian hulu supply chain dan semakin ke hulu peningkatan tersebut semakin besar yang disebut juga dengan bullwhip effect. Hasil yang diperoleh dari penelitian ini diantaranya bahwa error terkecil terdapat pada metode peramalan Holt’s Winter dengan parameter Level sebesar 0,5, Trend sebesar 0,2 dan Seasonal sebesar 0,6. Fenomena bullwhip effect pada data historis dapat diminimisasi dan dihilangkan dengan penerapan metode Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) pada manufaktur dan setiap cabang distributor. Berdasarkan peramalan permintaan dan penentuan kebijakan jumlah pemesanan, maka didapatkan perkiraan nilai bullwhip effect yang terjadi setelah penggunaan VMI pada rantai pasok yakni 0,47036 pada level manufaktur, kemudian untuk level distributor dari masing - masing cabang adalah 0,713480715; 0,717343114; 0,669206602; dan 0,639086924. Berdasarkan perhitungan tersebut diperoleh bahwa persediaan pada manufaktur dapat memenuhi kebutuhan dari masing – masing pelaku rantai pasok. Hal ini dapat diterapkan apabila terdapat kolaborasi aktif antar pelaku rantai pasok dengan melakukan pengendalian persediaan dan peramalan permintaan yang tepat.. </jats:p>"

This development brings many benefits to the economy, society, and human resources in each country but also causes a large number of concerns related to the environment since traditional logistics activities in the supply chain have been releasing a significant amount of emissions. For that reason, many solutions have been proposed to deal with these environmental pollution problems. Among these, three promising solutions are expected to completely solve environmental problems in every supply chain: (i) Application of blockchain in the supply chain, (ii) Use of renewable energy and alternative fuels, and (iii) Design of a closed supply chain. However, it seems to lack a comprehensive study of these solutions aiming to overcome the drawbacks of traditional logistics. Indeed, this work focuses on analyzing and evaluating the three above-mentioned solutions and the impacts of each solution on solving problems related to traditional logistics. More importantly, this work also identifies critical factors and challenges such as policies, laws, awareness, and risks that are found to be remarkable difficulties in the shifting progress of traditional logistics to green logistics. Finally, directions for developing and deploying green solutions to the logistics, supply chain, and shipping sectors toward decarbonization strategies and net-zero goals are discussed in detail.</jats:p>",

It is proven that hot-deposited zinc can effectively protect steel surfaces for 20 to 120 years. However, in centralized hot water supply (CHWS) systems, the period of protective action can decrease to two to three years, with further damage to the zinc layer and the appearance of fistulas. In order to counteract adverse factors, it is necessary to take into account the operating mode and design features of the system, the properties of the coating, and the environment in which the pipes operate. In this article, the main attention is paid to the study of the behavior of zinc coating. The protective properties and corrosion rate of zinc coating in tap water were evaluated. It was established that the protective effect of zinc is effectively manifested in the ratio of the protected area to the unprotected, as SZn/SFe ≥ 9:1. The influence of iron-containing sediment, when it accumulates in the pipes of a CHWS system, on the corrosion rate of the zinc coating was studied. It was also noted that the corrosion rates of the new zinc coating and uncoated steel pipe measured in short-term tests differed slightly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross-shareholding is increasingly used in supply chains to improve strategic synergy between companies. However, regulations on cross-ownership within green supply chains are still in their early stages of development. Cross-ownership affects both the government’s pricing strategy and its carbon reduction policies. Additionally, the cross-shareholding structure impacts the profitability of the supply chain by introducing power dynamics between manufacturers and retailers. When cross-shareholding regulations and models are implemented, manufacturers and retailers within the supply chain exhibit more substantial reductions in their carbon footprint and experience increased profits, particularly in decentralized supply chains when cross ownership surpasses a specific threshold. The adoption of cross-shareholding profit-sharing agreements could enhance the performance of green supply chains. This article synthesizes the views of scholars on cross shareholding in the supply chain. It uses analytical methods to evaluate the role of the negotiation process, trade credit, and cross-shareholding in the supply chain. The article uses jurisprudence to recommend a cross shareholding policy in the Philippines to enhance supply chain efficiency. It uses the “Stackelberg Leadership Model” to analyze the impact of cross-shareholding on two levels of the supply chain, offering recommendations for future implementation to improve supply chain efficiency. The article recommends that the Philippines’ supply chain policy include mechanisms to encourage new companies to join the existing cross-ownership network, capitalize on the impact of cross-shareholding on supply chain assessment, and develop ways to use equity ratio and trade credit. These recommendations aim to refine policy and legislation in the Philippines to effectively utilize trade credit, equity ratios, and cross-shareholdings in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options of reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.</jats:p>"

The first trimester of 2022 shows an increased demand for potato chips. Therefore, efficient performance is needed to support production recovery and business performance by increasing supply chain institutional efficiency. This research aimed to analyze the efficiency performance value and the sub-variables input with the most influence on supplier efficiency performance. This research used the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model CCR-I Dual with input sub-variables (i.e., cash-to-cash-cycle-time, lead time, and flexibility) and output sub-variables (i.e., percentage of conformance quality standards, order fulfilment, and delivery performance). The analysis was carried out on the flow of suppliers to potato chip MSMEs. The results show that 8 decision-making units (DMUs) were inefficient (55.56% and 33.33%), and 1 DMU was in efficient condition (100% green), namely is DMU 6.

Water discharge variability and sediment transport are important factors influencing bedrock river processes. However, little work has focused on the sensitivity of hillslope sediment supply to precipitation events and its implications on river evolution in tectonically active landscapes. We model the temporal variability of water discharge and the sensitivity of sediment supply to precipitation events as rivers evolve to equilibrium over 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> model years. We explore how coupling sediment supply sensitivity with discharge variability influences rates and timing of river incision across climate regimes. We find that sediment supply sensitivity strongly impacts which water discharge events are the most important in driving river incision and modulates channel morphology. High sediment supply sensitivity focuses sediment delivery into the largest river discharge events, decreasing rates of bedrock incision during floods by orders of magnitude as rivers are inundated with new sediment that buries bedrock. The results show that the use of river incision models in which incision rates increase monotonically with increasing river discharge may not accurately capture bedrock river dynamics in all landscapes, particularly in steep landslide prone landscapes. From our modeling results, we hypothesize the presence of an upper discharge threshold for river incision at which storms transition from being incisional to depositional. Our work illustrates that sediment supply sensitivity must be accounted for to predict river evolution in dynamic landscapes. Our results have important implications for interpreting and predicting climatic and tectonic controls on landscape morphology and evolution.</jats:p>",

The relevance of the national and economic problem of the quality of material and technical support of agro-industrial production is substantiated. It is claimed that the fore-casting of quantitative and qualitative indicators of the technical condition indirectly affects the technologies used in the fields, in particular in the Poltava region. The results of statistical analysis of qualitative and quantitative indicators of purchased and registered tractors, which are reflected in the single register for keeping automated rec-ords of tractors of the agricultural machinery registration department of the Main Department of the State Production and Consumer Service in Poltava region for the period from 2018 to 2023, are given. The trends and dynamics of replacing tractors in the region's farms are given and substantiated, and ways of improving the organizational and technical mechanisms for providing tractors to enterprises and individuals of the Poltava region are recommended, taking into account the current challenges caused by the state of war. The organizational, technical and economic mechanisms for updating the tractor fleet of enterprises and private owners - individuals of the Poltava region have been determined. There is a sharp reduction in the dynamics of the number of purchased and registered tractors and tractor equipment in 2022. The beginning of the war led to a sharp reduction of purchased and registered tractors and tractor equipment by more than two times. Studying the dynamics of the ratio of the use of foreign tractors and tractors of domestic production is no less a painful topic for the state. We have a negative trend towards a significant relative increase in the tractor market of the Poltava region of foreign-made tractors and tractor equipment. A situa-tion arose when the number of foreign tractor models in 2022 and most of 2023 exceeded the registration actions for domestically produced tractors by almost three times. The fact that the absence or insufficient number of domestic manufacturers of agricultural machinery, including tractors, leads to export dependence of the market is statistically confirmed. The consequence of this is a significant increase in prices for spare parts and tracts of foreign production</jats:p>"

Drawing upon the resource-based view theory, we empirically tested our model using a sample of 331 hotel and resort managers, and a quantitative approach was used. The results revealed that BCT adoption mediates the relationship between SSCS and SCA. They further explain that DT significantly moderates the relationship between the SSCS and BCT adoption, whereas SSCP significantly moderates the relationship between the BCT adoption and SCA. All research objectives are successfully obtained. As a result, firms must not only adopt sustainable strategies, but also adopt advanced technologies and transformative practices in order to maintain a competitive advantage in today’s dynamic market landscape. The findings of this study hold significant implications for both theory and practice, providing strategic insights for organizations seeking to improve their competitive positioning by embracing sustainable strategies and technologies.</jats:p>"

Communication costs explain why intensification of international supply chains during the last 4 decades has occurred primarily within regional value chains (RVCs), centered on East Asia, Europe, and North America. Initially responding to demand from automobile and electronics firms to connect their European and Chinese supply chains with shorter and more reliable freight services than maritime shipping, the Eurasian rail Landbridge established in the 2010s was the first major overland link between RVCs. The Eurasian Landbridge was resilient through deteriorating EU-Russia relations after 2014 and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020–21. However, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and inclusion of the Russian rail company in western sanctions in February/March 2022, traffic along the main Landbridge routes stalled. This paper analyzes the evolution of the Landbridge as an exercise in choice of connectivity for Eurasian supply chains, the response of supply chain managers to the closure of routes in 2022, and the role of public policy in creating reliable alternatives.</jats:p>",

Academia and industry are beginning to introduce clean renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power into data centers to reduce operating costs and environmental damage by building new green data centers. To solve this problem, this study considers the use of waste heat for refrigeration while taking natural gas power generation into account, and introduces wind energy as a green energy source. On the premise of considering the response level of data centers, the two resources are combined and deployed to improve resource utilization and reduce energy consumption costs. Aiming at the instability of wind power generation, a particle swarm energy scheduling optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing algorithm was proposed by combining simulated annealing algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. The research shows that, considering the response level of data centers, the use of natural gas and wind energy as the main energy supply can effectively reduce the overall energy consumption of data centers.</jats:p>"

It investigates the role of Green Supply Chain Management in mediating the link between environmental orientation and company performance. The review will begin with a thorough discussion of theoretical concepts of environmental orientation and Green Supply Chain Management. It will then investigate the relationship between environmental orientation and Green Supply Chain Management, as well as how it influences business performance. Heading on, it is more likely to investigate the impact of outside environmental focus on firm environmental selection, monitoring, and collaboration, followed by the impact of internal environmental orientation on these three components of Green Supply Chain Management. An investigation on the effect of environmental selection, monitoring, and collaboration on firms' sustainability performance will be reviewed. On the other hand, it will assess the mediating role of Green Supply Chain Management on the relationship between environmental orientation and firm performance. It will additionally look at the mediating role of environmental selection, monitoring, and collaboration on the relationship between external and internal environmental orientation and firm performance. The moderating effect of corporate environmental reactiveness on the link between environmental orientation and Green Supply Chain Management is an essential part of this paper, whereas, exploring the role of government regulation and consumer sensitivity in shaping the link between environmental orientation and Green Supply Chain Management will also be reviewed. It will then investigate the effect of Electronic Transaction Levy (E-Levy) on the impact of Green Supply Chain Management on firm performance. Studies have demonstrated that Green Environmental Orientation has a positive influence on Green Supply Chain Management procedures, which results in sustainable business performance</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Generation Z is the workforce generation for the next 20 years and poses a problem for some industries. One of these is the pharmaceutical sector of pharmacies, which performs the important task of providing medicines and related advice. The shortage of skilled workers in pharmacies is not a new problem and was already recognised in the 1990s, but due to the generative characteristics of the members of Generation Z, it poses a new challenge. Pharmacies need the next generation and must also adapt to demands of Generation Z, which, however, does not seem ready for this in many areas due to the structure and processes of pharmacy services. Pharmacies have undergone some changes in their areas of service delivery and some have already gone relatively far digital and are planning with part-time models. Nevertheless, there is still a shortage, which shows that pharmacy is not a preferred career field of the generation. For the personnel management of pharmacies, it is necessary to find the parameters that appeal to the representatives of the generation and adapt them to the personnel search. In this paper, the Big Five personality traits and the behavioural economics of Generation Z will be compared with the requirements of the pharmacy profession in order to determine some parameters.</jats:p>",

To answer this question, we examine how college costs affect the labor supply of mothers and fathers by exploiting the roll-out of nine generous state merit aid programs in the United States from 1993 to 2004, which made college more affordable. Mothers of college-age children decreased their annual hours of work after the introduction of these state-wide programs, while fathers did not adjust their labor supply. Mothers of college-going children were entirely responsible for the decline in hours of work, where mothers of children who did not go to college experienced no change in hours of work. The decline in labor supply was mainly due to adjustments among high-income, married, more educated, and white mothers, whose labor supply was more elastic to college costs.</jats:p>",

We use institutional theory (IT) and the resource based view (RBV) of the firm to address this gap, developing a framework showing how a proactive technology-driven approach to supply chain risk management, combining both external with internal factors, can result in competitive advantage. We validate the framework through analysis of quantitative data collected via a survey of 218 firms in the manufacturing and logistics industry sectors in India. We specifically focus on the technologies of track-and-trace (T&amp;T) and big data analytics (BDA). Our findings show that firms investing in T&amp;T/BDA technologies can gain operational benefits in terms of uninterrupted information processing, reduced time disruptions and uninterrupted supply, which in turn gives them competitive advantage. We add further novelty to our study by demonstrating the moderating influences of organisational culture and flexibility on the relationship between the technological capabilities and the operational benefits.</jats:p>",

How social capital enhances the perception of the buyer supplier relationship and their understanding while sharing both ways information inflow &amp; outflow. This change in the perception and how it effects the performance of the supply chain. Also, how social capital plays its role in order to resolve this perceptual difference. With the help of literature review, the buildup of theoretical model and hypothesis was developed. Using the data from 150 respondents collected from many different Pakistani industry manufacturers especially in supply chains and people relate with service industry. For analysis we used structural equation modelling. All of the social capital facets are significant with relation to information inflow, however, with relation to information outflow, structural capital, and performance of the supply chain are not significant. It clearly shows that buyers are more efficient in collection of information, but more reluctant in sharing back (information outflow) with the suppliers. With our results, it shows that buyers should maintain strong social capital and should rely on sharing more information within organization and outside with suppliers, this will enhance, trust, efficacy and will promote performance of the supply chain. Paper develops a framework to test the effect of social capital dimensions on overall supply chain performance where information flow is used as a mechanism facilitating the supply chain performance. This framework has never been tested before. Contribution of the studies and future research has been discussed.</jats:p>"

We describe a new online teaching game, the FloraPark simulation (“the flower game” at https://flower.gamespots.net/ ), based on real-life events in the international fresh-cut flower supply chains, for students to learn supply chain collaboration via contracts in a setting of multiple supply chains competing in the same market. Students play trading partners in the flower supply chains and experiment with the push, pull, and advanced purchasing discount contracts by negotiating wholesale prices and quantities to achieve the conflicting objectives of (1) collaboration to beat other supply chains, and (2) bargaining to protect their own interests from their trading partners. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/ited.2022.0035 . </jats:p>",

These processes often rely on sophisticated data analytics to inform the design of a company’s category management strategy, such as its supply network design, its supplier relationship management, and its supplier performance management. Therefore, data analytics skills are crucial for PSM professionals. To foster these skills, we developed an innovative approach for teaching students how to use data analytics tools and techniques in PSM through the use of a teaching case called “Savingtools.” This case, developed in collaboration with a company undergoing a PSM transformation, illustrates the value of data‐driven category management in PSM. The case further demonstrates the principles and tools related to PSM data management, spend analysis, and classification, and allows for in‐depth data analysis, including visualizations. Our approach has been shown to effectively enhance student learning and comprehension, and we believe that it prepares future supply chain leaders while advancing PSM pedagogy.</jats:p>",

This study provides a novel analysis of the impact of “different types of living costs” on the demand and supply of the textile industry of Pakistan. It used the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model to analyze the impact of the shocks in cost of living on textile industry demand and supply using monthly data from July 2008 to June 2020. The study's findings suggest that rising energy, housing, clothing, and footwear cost weaken demand for the textile sector, mostly through lower purchasing power. While education costs diminish supply, food costs raise producer price index, and transportation costs have no effect. Our findings contribute to the body of knowledge and give vital information on which types of living costs affect the textile sector and which might lead to improvement.

Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We conducted a 2-stage study.

Similarly, there are various financial, strategy-related, supply chain-related, technology-related, and user-related barriers. The findings also show that supply chain-related drivers (eg, increased transparency, traceability, and collaboration with suppliers) are the strongest drivers, while financial barriers (eg, high implementation costs and difficulties in building a business case) are the biggest barriers to overcome.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The findings of this study add to the limited literature regarding IoT in the health care supply chain by empirically identifying the most important drivers and barriers to IoT implementation.

This paper conducts an empirical test using panel data from cities in China. We find that: (a) environmental decentralization significantly improves the supply efficiency of environmental public services (ESE). It's mainly because of the increased capacity for green technology innovation and urban environmental infrastructure development brought about by environmental decentralization. (b) Environmental decentralization will improve the ESE more effectively in regions with the central government acting as a binding force, high environmental preferences, governance capacity of local governments, and pollutant emission intensity. (c) Higher promotion incentives for officials may distort the pollution control effect of environmental decentralization and inhibit the ESE. Appropriate central government transfer payments can better utilize the positive role of environmental decentralization. </jats:p>"

Heightened public attention on perceived supply chain failures has exerted pressure on governments to intervene in firm-level operations to assure supply of essential or strategic goods. This paper argues that the narrative is founded on false premises. In particular, three supply chain myths have emerged in public and academic discourse: (i) lean management has gone too far and exacerbated disruptions in global supply chains; (ii) efficient supply chains are less resilient; and (iii) foreign supply makes supply chains less resilient. We argue that these beliefs are not adequately supported by evidence. They can displace analysis to negatively impact policy and actually diminish resilience. Drawing upon IB and supply chain management research, we investigate the root causes of perceived market failures. Recommendations are for an evidence-based debate on current events and policies.</jats:p>",

The sample is collected from a wide range of facilities, namely hotels, hospitals, private clinics, rehabilitation centres and nursing homes. Kendall’s tau-b correlation statistics and logistic regression models are employed to detect the driving forces on the formation of attitudes towards health tourism investments. Current research regarding health tourism in Greece is rather limited. In addition, the majority of relevant international studies examines factors shaping the demand side. The present study utilizes a sample from the supply side, thus of stakeholders in related sectors and can enhance our knowledge about their stances towards health tourism investments and the factors shaping these stances.</jats:p>"

The preferential provision of medicines was carried out by the economic and sta- tistical analysis of data from Smolensk department of health and completed by an assessment of infrastructure availability of medicinal support. Results. There was an increase financing for program of medical support 2.32 times over the past 7 years. The number of prescriptions increased equally the number of ben- eficiaries who did not refuse a set of social services (1.05 times). The rate for one pa- tient was stable and tended to increase. The actual costs for one person increased (2.47 times) and exceeded state’s standards. The number of points of sale is grow- ing and leading to the increase of availability of medicines. There was a decrease of infrastructure burden with an increase of financial burden on 1 pharmacy. Conclusion. The growth financing with decrease in the number of beneficiaries, including those who retained the right of the preferential provision, with a decrease in the population, can be explained by an increase in costs for each citizen per month. This fact may indicate that there are patients with chronic diseases in the system. The decrease in those who refuse drugaccess program allows to think about insig- nificant returning of citizens to the system. However, a sufficient number of those who replaces medicines into cash, the discrepancy between the standard and the actual costs of treatment for one person indicate problems associated with incom- plete coverage of the need of medicines and require to revise approaches of system in region. Transferring the purchase of expensive drugs for treatment of rare (orphan) diseases including spinal muscular atrophy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo- binuria, Fabry disease and a defect in the complement system to the state level can reduce the burden on the regional budget.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the evolving economic landscape, Industry 4.0 emphasizes strategic planning and operational progress for large enterprises. This transformation relies on smart robotization technologies like AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) and AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots) for reducing transportation time, thereby reducing energy costs per unit of production, increasing energy efficiency, as well as replacing combustible-fuel-powered tools with electric ones. A number of concerns arise with their introduction into the production cycle. This research aims to provide a methodical basis for averting substantial mistakes when executing projects centered around the incorporation of AGVs/AMRs into in-house logistics systems. The FMEA method and empirical analysis were employed to achieve a more accurate risk assessment. APIS and MS Excel softwares were chosen. We investigated the potential hazards related to the incorporation of mobile robotic solutions and identified both external and internal threats. To streamline and improve project efficiency, a risk management algorithm for high-tech projects is presented in the paper. Integrating FMEA into projects implementing robotic technologies can lead to significant enhancements in risk reduction, and therefore cost savings, efficiency, safety, and quality, while fostering a culture of collaboration and problem solving. The research contributes to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within the field of interest.</jats:p>"

While research communities acknowledge the scarcity of publications in this domain, the number of related papers has surged by 122%.

Consequently, a gap in systematic reviews focusing on transparency within this domain is evident. To fill this gap, our study aims to synthesise existing research on transparency in apparel and textile supply chains. To this end, we have structured our study into four research clusters derived from author-generated keywords in a carefully curated Scopus dataset. Furthermore, our study explores how transparency has evolved in textile and apparel supply chains, supported by these four clusters, which cover the following themes: 1) Sustainable approaches for transparency, 2) Supply chain perspective in transparency, 3) Implementing traceability for transparency and 4) Information transparency. Considering the insights gleaned from this comprehensive review, our study offers valuable insights and delineates potential directions for future research endeavours. These avenues for exploration can improve transparency in textile and apparel supply chains towards greater advancement and scholarly innovation.</jats:p>"

The sources of these artifacts were Guadalupe Victoria and Zaragoza-Oyameles in Puebla, Pico de Orizaba in Veracruz, Sierra de Pachuca in Hidalgo, and Paredón in Puebla. The majority of the artifacts came from the first three sources, which are closest to the site. San Francisco Toxpan was into the trade route from the Central Highlands to the Gulf Coast but with limited influence from major cities like Teotihuacan or Cantona. The independence of these cultures likely allowed for the development of a local lithic industry, facilitating trade through the Jamapa-Cotaxtla basin. The intricate process of obtaining obsidian for the residents of Toxpan becomes evident when considering the diverse sources of these materials.</jats:p>"

How and by what means, can B2B companies in the IoT and nanotechnology sector, using rare metals, engage downstream actors to address sustainable challenges in the supply chain? To answer this question, we first define the terms related to rare metals and their challenges; we then review the different methods of customer and consumer engagement proposed in the literature. Secondly, through interviews with companies in the Internet of Things sector and with consumers we analyze the downstream actors' engagement in the context of rare metals through integration methods. The results propose a mapping of the different methods that enable engagement for sustainability objectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traceability of the pharmaceutical products across a supply chain creates an environment that provides visibility of the product status from plant to patient.  The supply chain is the trade journey products make to consumers or retail stores (e.g. pharmacy store, patented drug store, medical store etc.,) via a network of producers, manufacturers, distributors, transporters and vendors taking that product from creation to delivery. Some of the key benefits of introducing traceability in the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector besides securing the supply chain includes an increment in the quality of data to support pharmacovigilance, decrease in the presence of substandard and falsified (SF) medications and ultimately ensuring patient safety. The drug distribution system in Nigeria is largely undefined and there have been in-country efforts to sanitize it. One such effort has produced a national policy document referred to as the Nigeria Pharmaceutical Traceability Strategy which stipulates the plan to achieve supply chain visibility, prevent infiltration of the SFs and strengthen existing regulatory and legal frameworks in Nigeria using GS1 global standards. The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and other drug regulatory agencies in Africa jointly signed a Call to Action during the 2nd GS1 African Healthcare Conference held in Lagos, Nigeria on September 16-20, 2019 to demonstrate commitment to pursue pharmaceutical traceability by adopting global supply chain standards. This article focuses on how NAFDAC in collaboration with GS1 Nigeria, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and other partners have implemented traceability as a public sector pilot for the COVID-19 vaccines received in Nigeria from March 2021 to December 2021.  This included the serialization of COVID-19 vaccines that were received without serial numbers that uniquely identify the secondary packing of the COVID-19 vaccines. The lessons learned from the pilot would be used to support development and dissemination of tracebility regulation, publish guidelines for traceability implementation, and engage stakeholders meaningfully as Nigeria implements full track and trace of pharmaceutical products.</jats:p>"

A new algorithm, adapted from stratified turbulence (Lam <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>J. Fluid Mech.</jats:italic>, vol. 923, 2021, A31) to rotating turbulence, permits to separate the three-dimensional velocity field into three parts: inertial waves (IWs), eddies and a geostrophic mode (GM). It uses the space–time properties of waves and their advection by the GM to filter the IWs from the rest of the motion. We obtain balance equations for the separate energies of waves, eddies and the GM. Their mutual interactions are evaluated and analysed via Sankey diagrams that provide a global picture of energy exchanges. When the flow is forced at large scale, it mainly feeds the wave part and the multiple interactions lead to energy dissipation in eddy and GM motion. We also show that, in addition to the wave/wave interaction that feeds the GM, corresponding to different mechanisms described in the literature, other non-documented interactions feed it, as the eddy/wave interaction or the eddy/eddy interaction at moderate <jats:inline-formula>\n\t      <jats:alternatives>\n\t\t<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mime-subtype=\"png\" xlink:href=\"S0022112023006444_inline2.png\"/>\n\t\t<jats:tex-math>$\\textit {Re}_I$</jats:tex-math>\n\t      </jats:alternatives>\n\t    </jats:inline-formula>. We propose a scale-by-scale analysis of the transfer to the GM: we show that transfers from wave or eddy occur at large scale, that they either inject or remove energy, and that this occurs with or without direct cascade depending on the kind of interaction, wave/wave, eddy/wave or eddy/eddy. The self-interaction of the GM is an inverse cascade for its horizontal component, shaping it into a very large-scale flow.</jats:p>",

Determining these coefficients can be expensive and time-consuming. The main objective of this study is to determine the most relevant pipe characteristics and locations to best determine chlorine decay coefficients in a WDS. This article aims to evaluate various scenarios of kb and kw values and compare them to measured data in a full-scale WDS. The most accurate scenario is also compared with the lowest-cost scenario to identify the most effective information needed to determine these coefficients, in terms of location within the WDS and pipe characteristics (age, diameter, and material). Results showed that the scenario with the highest kw and kb values corresponds best to the field-measured data. Moreover, determining specific kinetic coefficients was shown to be more accurate for gray cast iron pipes, pipes installed in a period before 1960, and vulnerable zones for residual chlorine decay.</jats:p>",

This study estimates global mercury supply and demand from 2010 to 2050, by region, and projects excess mercury based on recent trends and consideration of impacts of the Convention. The analysis notes a downward trend in both supply and demand, but the supply of mercury from primary mining has not decreased as much as initially expected, while mercury recovery from by-products of nonferrous production has not yet been implemented extensively. Under a business-as-usual projection, there is excess supply until a shortage appears around 2030, but a surplus returns after 2035, and there is a projected excess supply of 59 tons annually in 2050. Relying on the level of mercury recovery in the nonferrous sector, global cumulative stock of excess mercury is projected at 14,439–20,943 tons in 2050.</jats:p>",

It enables IoT devices to collaboratively learn without exposing their raw data, ensuring data privacy. However, federated learning faces the threats of local data tampering and upload process attacks. This paper proposes an innovative framework that leverages Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology to address the data security and privacy challenges in federated learning for IoT supply chain management. Our framework achieves the security of local data computation and the tampering resistance of data update uploads using TEE and the blockchain. We adopt Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGXs) as the specific implementation of TEE, which can guarantee the secure execution of local models on SGX-enabled processors. We also use consortium blockchain technology to build a verification network and consensus mechanism, ensuring the security and tamper resistance of the data upload and aggregation process. Finally, each cluster can obtain the aggregated parameters from the blockchain. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we conducted several experiments with different numbers of participants and different datasets and validated the effectiveness of our scheme. We tested the final global model obtained from federated training on a test dataset and found that increasing both the number of iterations and the number of participants improves its accuracy. For instance, it reaches 94% accuracy with one participant and five iterations and 98.5% accuracy with ten participants and thirty iterations.</jats:p>"

To capture the time‐evolving dynamics of infrastructure pathways, DU Pathways<jats:sub><jats:italic>ERAS</jats:italic></jats:sub> features new tools to measure the adaptive capacity of pathway policies and evaluate time‐evolving vulnerability. We demonstrate our framework on a six‐utility water supply partnership seeking to develop cooperative infrastructure investment pathways in the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our results indicate that commonly employed framings of robustness can have large and unintended adverse consequences for regional partnerships. Results further illustrate that regional and individual vulnerabilities are highly interdependent and emphasize the need to limit counterparty risks through carefully designed cooperative agreements. Beyond the Research Triangle, these results are broadly applicable to cooperative water supply infrastructure investment and management globally.</jats:p>",

Unmanaged overlaps endanger the effectiveness of IOs. Inter-organizational cooperation can mitigate such negative consequences. However, a novel dataset reveals that not all overlapping IOs cooperate with each other and the institutionalization of cooperation agreements varies. Why do some but not all overlapping IOs opt for cooperation agreements, and why do their designs vary? The analysis of a demand–supply–restraint model shows that increased exposure to overlaps creates a demand for IOs to reach cooperation agreements and for their strong institutionalization. States respond more favourable to the supply of cooperation agreements when they are used to international cooperation and internal authority-delegation. The restraint component underscores that IOs are less inclined to cooperate when ideological differences and power differentials between them are greater and that IOs choose highly institutionalized cooperation agreements when their ideological differences are limited.</jats:p>",

The statistical tests (Shapiro–Wilk W and Anderson–Darling A) of the chemical data of over 100 groundwater samples of the study area indicate the non-parametric nature of the distribution. High concentrations of F− and NO3− ions above drinking water permissible limits were present in 12% and 28% of samples, respectively. Similarly, Cl– ion, and total hardness were higher while Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ ions were marginally higher compared to drinking water limits. Kruskal–Wallis (ANOVA) test results indicate that seasonal variations are not very significant among chemical species. Based on irrigation water quality indicators, groundwater samples fall under the excellent to doubtful category during premonsoon and permissible to unsuitable category during postmonsoon season. These inferences were verified by using the Entropy Water Quality Index (EWQI). The spatial contours of the EWQI values clearly suggest that the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater is greater in the northern parts of the study area. Optimizing fertilizer application and effluent treatment can improve the groundwater quality thereby achieving sustainable groundwater management in this region.</jats:p>",

Scombroid poisoning is a less studied occurrence despite the consumption of fish products. This study was formulated to evaluate at which stage of the supply chain the increase in the histamine content of dried anchovies (Stolephorus commersonnii) occurs. The study showed that histamine substances and Staphylococcus aureus were detected at all stages along the supply chain. It was also found that the concentration of histamine generally increased from the fisherman to the processors and retailers. Post-hoc analysis using the Fisher test showed no significant difference in the histamine content of dried anchovies from the processing centers (=54.07 mg/kg) and retailers (=67.63 mg/kg) but significantly higher than the raw anchovies (=8.29 mg/kg). For S. aureus, it remains low at &lt;10 colony-forming units (CFU/g). The aerobic plate count supports this conclusion with a 90.29% increase from the processing center to the retailers. However, it is still significant as a source of histamine formation influenced by water activity and salt content. A correlation between salt content and water activity with histamine content was identified with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8357. It is recommended to review the processing method to control salt content and the handling and storage in the retailers, as they showed the highest potential for histamine-forming bacteria growth, leading to an increase in histamine levels in dried anchovies.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the estimation of medium- and long-term ripple effects is based on the assumption of mobility in production factors.\r\nResults: The analysis confirms that implementation of the IPEF could lower South Korea's food import prices and diversify the supply chain, providing advantages. However, it also highlights a drawback in which the self-sufficiency rate may decrease if non-tariff barriers are completely eliminated.\r\nConclusions: The government should actively engage in IPEF negotiations while requiring a more sophisticated approach in order to adjust non-tariff barriers to an appropriate level.</jats:p>",

Recent findings suggest that the dauer larva of <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic> may utilize external ethanol as an energy source to extend their lifespan. It was shown that while ethanol may serve as an effectively infinite source of energy, some toxic compounds accumulating as byproducts of its metabolism may lead to the damage of mitochondria and thus limit the lifespan of larvae. A minimal mathematical model was proposed to explain the connection between the lifespan of a dauer larva and its ethanol metabolism. To explore theoretically if it is possible to extend even further the lifespan of dauer larvae, we incorporated two natural mechanisms describing the recovery of damaged mitochondria and elimination of toxic compounds, which were previously omitted in the model. Numerical simulations of the revised model suggested that while the ethanol concentration is constant, the lifespan still stays limited. However, if ethanol is supplied periodically, with a suitable frequency and amplitude, the dauer could survive as long as we observe the system. Analytical methods further help to explain how feeding frequency and amplitude affect lifespan extension. Based on the comparison of the model with experimental data for fixed ethanol concentration, we proposed the range of feeding protocols that could lead to even longer dauer survival and it can be tested experimentally.</jats:p>"

Dalam rangka pemenuhan kebutuhan energi di suatu daerah diperlukan adanya studi proyeksi kebutuhan energi. Proyeksi kebutuhan energi adalah suatu pemodelan matematis dalam memperkirakan suatu kebutuhan energi pada daerah tertentu, kemudian kebutuhan energi tersebut dibandingkan dengan suplai energi agar terciptanya keseimbangan suplai dan permintaan energi. Proyeksi kebutuhan energi juga merupakan salah satu langkah suatu daerah dalam menyusun dan mempertimbangkan kebijakan ataupun aturan yang berkaitan dengan pengelolaan dan pemanfaatan energi. Proses proyeksi kebutuhan energi dapat dilakukan dengan berbagai metode seperti: metode trendline, metode end-use, dan metode ekonometri. Ketiga metode tersebut adalah metode yang paling sesuai dengan proses pemodelan proyeksi kebutuhan energi. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mengetahui supply, and demand energi yang berada di Kota Semarang. Pemodelan yang dilakukan dalam studi kasus ini adalah Business as Usual (BaU) yang mana merupakan sebuah skenario dasar untuk menentukan supply, and demand energi, dan studi kasus ini memodelkan kebutuhan energi Kota Semarang dari Tahun 2020-2030.

This report documents which companies, from which countries, are supplying which types of surveillance technology to African governments. Without this missing detail, it is impossible to adequately design measures to mitigate and overcome illegal surveillance and violations of human rights. Since the turn of the century, we have witnessed a digitalisation of surveillance that has enabled the algorithmic automation of surveillance at a scale not previously imaginable. Surveillance of citizens was once a labour and time-intensive process. This provided a practical limit to the scope and depth of state surveillance. The digitalisation of telephony has made it possible to automate the search for keywords across all mobile and internet communications. For the first time, state surveillance agencies can do two things: (a) conduct mass surveillance of all citizens’ communications, and (b) micro-target individuals for in-depth surveillance that draws together in real-time data from mobile calls, short message service (SMS), internet messaging, global positioning system (GPS) location, and financial transactions. This report was produced by qualitative analysis of open-source data in the public domain. The information presented is drawn from a diverse range of sources, including open government data sets, export licence portals, procurement notices, civil society databases of surveillance contracts, press releases from surveillance companies, academic articles, reports, and media coverage. The research is organised using a typology of five categories of surveillance technology. We did not set out to detail every technology available, every company, or every supply contract. Instead, we document the main companies and countries selling digital surveillance technologies to African governments. Rather than focus on the technical functionality distinguishing each product offering, we highlight five of the most important types of surveillance technology: internet interception, mobile interception, social media surveillance, ‘safe city’ technologies for the surveillance of public spaces, and biometric identification technologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we aim to explore the operational performance of a green closed-loop supply chain under random events. A green closed-loop supply chain model based on generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN) is built using the Petri nets theory. According to the isomorphic relationship between GSPN and continuous-time Markov chains, the relevant Markov model is converted from GSPN, and the steady-state probability of the model is then calculated. Finally, the model is analyzed from the aspects of time performance and operation efficiency of each link. Compared to previous studies, this paper finds that: when the whole green closed-loop supply chain system reaches a dynamic equilibrium state, the product has a steady-state probability at all stages, and thus the overall operational performance of the system can be obtained; compared with the recycling of waste products, the green product takes a longer time in the production and distribution stages; since marketing, packaging processing, market feedback, and market demand formulation account for a high level of utilization throughout the life cycle of green products, decision makers need to focus on the supervision and management of these links. Managers of green closed-loop supply chain systems need to adjust their decision-making strategies in a timely manner according to the performance level of the system in the steady state to realize the efficient operation of the system. This paper not only provides theoretical support for the improvement of the operational efficiency of green closed-loop supply chain system, but also provides new ideas for the research of green closed-loop supply chain operation mode.</jats:p>"

Finding that bamboo biochar manufactured under a slow pyrolysis process \"b\" (Bb) had the best performance. Subsequently, Bb was evaluated with three different granulometries, and it was found that the effective size with the best performance was the finest (0.6–1.18 mm). Subsequently, this biochar was compared with conventional filter materials such as gravel, sand and anthracite, using different types of water (raw, flocculated and settled) and at different filtration rates (120 and 240 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/d), and it was found that the filter material with the best performance was precisely biochar, with average removal efficiencies of 64.37% turbidity and 45.08% colour for raw water; 93.9% turbidity and 90.75% colour for flocculated water, and 80.79% turbidity and 69.03% colour for settled water. The efficiency using simple beds of sand, biochar, anthracite and gravel at the rate of 180 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/d was 75.9% copper, 90.72% aluminium, 95.7% iron, 10.9% nitrates, 94.3% total coliforms and 88.9% fecal coliforms. The efficiencies achieved by biochar were higher compared to those of conventional filter materials. It was also found that biochar contributes to improving the performance of sand and anthracite in mixed beds. Additionally, it was possible to demonstrate that the volume of washing water required for the biochar is lower compared to the other filter beds. Finally, it is recommended to carry out more tests for the purification of water with biochars from rural areas affected by the mining and oil exploitation, as well as the purification of seawater with biochars from coastal areas with residues from dry forests and organic residues from municipalities.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"

In response to issues such as outdated personnel awareness, severe WES waste, and low resource utilization in current WES governance, this article optimized and monitored relevant governance methods for the rural WES environment to improve the sustainable utilization of WES. This article analyzed the main types of WES and studied the monitoring and governance methods of WES governance. This article used the projection pursuit model to evaluate the governance methods of WES comprehensively and proposed corresponding strategies for optimal utilization to improve the utilization rate of WES. The WES utilization rate and rural sewage treatment capacity after optimization measures were higher than those before optimization measures. The utilization rate of WES after the optimization strategy was 15.4% higher than before, and the rural pollution treatment capacity was 17.8% higher than before the optimization strategy. Improving investment in water pollution technology and environmental infrastructure in rural areas is important and positive in improving rural WES governance and sustainable utilization.</jats:p>",

We consider the power supply system (PSS) of the district, which is characterised by power supply from general-purpose power grids, as well as having its own generation of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES). Such a local electric power system (LES) under certain conditions can be operated as an independent balanced electrical facility. For optimal operation of the LES under these conditions, it is necessary to predict its power consumption schedules. The proposed macromodelling method allows to develop deterministic models of power consumption with the required accuracy on the basis of retrospective information without the use of data preprocessing procedures. The solution to the problem of forecasting electricity consumption schedules is simplified by using only basic or deterministic characteristics in the construction of the model.

Three policy areas are identified. First, encouraging FDI and better governance are important drivers of GVC participation through vertical and horizontal linkages. Second, promoting production capacity through industrial policies that aim at learning by exporting and internet connectivity can help diversify African GVC, which is heavily concentrated in the commodity sector, towards the manufacturing and services sectors with higher value‐added. Finally, there is a need to increase the downstreamness of Africa's participation in GVC, not only because it moves Africa towards sectors with high value‐added but also because it would make Africa's production more environmentally sustainable.</jats:p>",

This method consists of three interrelated submodels, respectively, the building fragility analysis model of the main subsystem CPB, the water supply network (WSN) hydraulic simulation analysis model of the secondary subsystem WSN, and the probability‐cloud model. The proposed method can be used to predict the seismic robustness of hierarchical systems. The computational methodology uses a joint probabilistic model combined with building fragility analysis and WSN hydraulic simulation analysis to evaluate the robustness of CPB coupled with WSN. Due to the uncertainty in robustness analysis, a probabilistic‐cloud model procedure considering the uncertainty in seismic robustness is proposed. The procedure enables a qualitative and quantitative integrated analysis of the robustness of CBP coupled with WSN. Finally, a community with 1406 buildings in China is simulated to illustrate the method. The research outcomes can provide a useful reference for the seismic robustness analysis of CBP coupled with WSN.</jats:p>",

Sixteen critical drivers were considered through a rigorous literature review and fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) for construction contracting firms. Then, selected drivers were used to analyze established construction contracting firms using a grey relational analysis (GRA) technique. The results highlight that construction contracting firms (CCFs) considered the drivers of sustainable use of resources, energy and eco‐efficiency, and environmental impact assessment; stakeholder engagement and social impact; and supply chain collaboration dimensions need to be improved for enhancing the sustainability of PDSCs. This study's contribution is twofold: It quantifies the identified set of critical drivers relevant to SPDSCs; it offers the CCFs a practical toolkit for sustainable project deliverables.</jats:p>",

In particular, when generating a subgeneration, the utilization of existing samples is low and the number of individuals is high. Therefore, surrogate-based optimization has been developed, which greatly reduces the number of individuals in the subgeneration and the cost of optimization. In complex air supply scenarios, single-objective optimization results may not be comprehensive; therefore, this paper developed a double-objective air supply optimization method based on the Kriging surrogate model and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms-II. And it proposed the infill criteria based on clustering to advance the Pareto Frontier. The method was validated with an inverse prediction case, and in particular, the problems when based on 3D steady-state simulations were analyzed. The results showed that the method can quickly achieve an approximate prediction of the boundary conditions (when predictions were made based on experimental data, the number of simulations was 82 and the average error was 6.8%). Finally, the method was used to optimize the air supply parameters of a dual-aisle, single-row cabin, with only 118 samples used in the optimization process. The Pareto set suggested that an airflow organization with dual circulation may be optimal.</jats:p>"

Surprisingly, very little scientific research on DL has been conducted for this purpose. As a result, this study looks into the prospect of automating construction warehouse management by employing CNN for object detection and counting. During the initial investigation, 23 studies out of 26 used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and object detection. Secondly, a model was developed and compared its accuracy to that of human counting and discovered that the model outperformed people. Industry professionals were interviewed to discuss the findings. Industry professionals highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of using such an automated system in construction warehouses. In conclusion, this study shows that the CNN base model outperforms people in counting materials, and the proposed automated inventory management system has significant industry potential.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\n\n\nThis study examines the complicated relationships between sustainable supply chain practices, resilience, employee involvement, top management support, and sustainable textile performance in Pakistan. Purposive sampling selected 283 supply chain specialists for data collecting. This study investigated sustainable supply chain management dynamics in a given sector and area. The study's main value is confirming Sustainable Supply Chain Management's fundamentals. This study proves that sustainable supply chain methods improve performance. The Pakistani textile sector recognizes the growing importance of sustainability in supply chain operations to maintain competitiveness and address social challenges, following global trends. Additionally, supply chain resilience is a key intermediary variable in this study. Sustainable supply chain practices improve an organization’s resilience to disruptions and adaptability to changing environmental conditions, as shown in this statement. Supply chain resilience as a mediator improves sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) theory. It underlines that sustainability requires understanding mechanisms as well as consequences. Employee involvement moderates the debate, as shown in this study. This study found that engaged employees boost the favorable effects of sustainable supply chain strategies on overall sustainable performance. This supports the current trend of employee-led sustainability efforts, where motivated and engaged people drive organizational sustainability. The study found no indication that top management support moderates. This suggests that leadership's impact is contextual, requiring context-specific sustainable supply chain management strategies. This study challenges conventional wisdom and advocates for further research into top management support in sustainable supply chains. The study's practical findings are crucial for Pakistan's textile and related industries. The paper emphasizes the need of prioritizing sustainable supply chain practices, developing resilience, engaging employees at all levels in sustainability projects, and providing leadership support in the right context. The above practical principles reflect the changing sustainability landscape and provide a strategy for firms seeking economic success and environmental and social responsibility. A study in Pakistan's textile industry adds empirical evidence to Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) theory. This emphasizes the importance of industry-specific details and corporate cultures in sustainability initiatives. In conclusion, these results spur a greener future in textiles and global supply chain management.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

Most of the literature on the optimization problem of transportation in supply chain networks (SCNs) considers fixed costs (FCs). Although most researchers have used fixed costs in supply chain design, none have studied their impact on optimal supply chain design. The design of the network can change when we take fixed costs into optimization. However, in the practical application of this problem, it is important to study the effect of FCs. This paper examines the impact of the fixed cost’s increase as well as the variable cost on the optimization of a two-stage SCN. To do so, two mathematical models for mixed-integer nonlinear programming were developed. The first model optimizes fixed and variable costs in addition to the opening cost, whereas the second model only optimizes variable and opening costs. To evaluate the effect of considering the FC on the optimization supply chain problem, four groups of instances were randomly generated and solved using Lingo. The results of the two models are compared using the average percentage deviation. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of changes in opening and variable costs on the considered optimization problem. The computational results and the sensitivity analysis show that the first model with minimized FC outperforms the second model, which does not consider the FC in minimization and FC affects the optimization.</jats:p>"

With the country's increasing urbanization and economic growth, waste generation has risen significantly, posing environmental and social challenges. This paper explores the concept of sustainable waste management in Malaysia and proposes leveraging supply chain solutions as a pathway towards a greener future. The study examines the current waste management practices, their limitations, and the potential environmental impacts. It highlights the need for integrated and innovative approaches encompassing the entire waste management supply chain, from collection to disposal. By adopting sustainable supply chain practices, such as waste segregation, recycling, and waste-to-energy conversion, Malaysia can achieve more efficient resource utilization, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize landfill usage. Furthermore, the paper addresses the role of government policies, private sector engagement, and public awareness in fostering a successful transition towards sustainable waste management. The findings and recommendations presented in this study contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop a comprehensive and eco-friendly waste management system in Malaysia and serve as a model for other developing nations facing similar challenges.</jats:p>"

The aim of the study is to study the place and role of the Russian economy in the process of forming the world fuel and energy balance. An analysis of the data on the production and consumption of fuel and energy resources by Russia emphasized that the country occupies a leading position in terms of reserves, production volumes, consumption and exports of global fuel and energy resources, while the efficiency of energy consumption in the country is significantly behind the world average, which negatively affects the internal economic processes taking place in the country and requires the search for solutions to increase the level of energy efficiency. Research analyzes analyzes the volume of thermal energy consumption in Russia in comparison with the global scale, as a result it was revealed that the annual volume of thermal energy consumption in Russia is 11 times more than, for example, in Germany, 12.5 times more than in the USA, 12.7 times more than in Kazakhstan, which underlines the significant contribution of the heat supply industry to the lag in the level of energy efficiency of the Russian economy from the indicators of most countries. Analysis of the statistical data of average temperatures in various countries of the world, as well as the federal districts of the country, revealed the influence of the climatic factor on the volume of thermal energy consumption in Russia, which determines the impossibility of excluding the consumption of thermal energy to maintain the functioning of the Russian economy. The main result of the study is the revealed high role of the Russian economy in shaping the global fuel and energy balance, as well as the need to increase the level of energy efficiency of fuel and energy consumption. The materials suggest the improvement of alternative replacement models for consumed primary and secondary fuel and energy resources. As an energy replacement resource, it is proposed to use electric energy in the system of combined district heating of industrial areas. The use of electric boilers makes it possible to increase the energy efficiency of integrated energy supply, enhance the environmental friendliness of heat supply, and reduce the cost of the economy for centralized heat supply of individual territories.</jats:p>"

However, it is essential to minimize unfair water distribution in this method by defining a proper strategy. This study utilized the EPANET pressure-dependent hydraulic analysis and the gray wolf optimization algorithm to achieve maximum volumetric reliability under different scenarios in a district of the Hamedan urban water distribution network in Iran. The volumetric reliability of the network was evaluated in the IWS condition regardless of justice constraints, with the justice constraint, and by considering the leakage in the IWS network with the justice constraint. The first scenario demonstrated that the reliability decreased by an average of 4.6% for every meter of water level reduction in the tank. The second scenario revealed that the objective function was negligibly affected by the variation of the justice constraint; however, fluctuation of the water level in the tank significantly affected the volumetric reliability. In the third scenario, the objective function value was significantly impacted by leakage, ranging from 0 to 0.3 (representing the absence and presence of leakage in 30% of the nodes, respectively), resulting in an average decrease of about 17%.</jats:p>",

A logistic system that has shown promise is one utilizing a network of supply depots. This study calculated the cost to produce a stream of size‐reduced herbaceous biomass (i.e., switchgrass) for five theoretical depots in the Piedmont province. Three depots were located in south central Virginia and two in north central North Carolina. A logistics system with a 20‐bale handling unit was used for load‐out operations at 199 theoretical satellite storage locations (SSLs) within a 48 km radius of each depot location. The distribution of potential production fields and the transportation distance from SSLs to the depots were determined with spatial and network analyses. Based on an analysis of potential land cover available for feedstock production, the annual capacity per depot ranged from 80 839 to 170 830 Mg, resulting in a total annual capacity of 555 195 Mg for all five depots. Cost to deliver feedstock for 24/7 operation, 48 weeks per year ranged from 46.03 to 62.86 USD Mg<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sup>1</jats:sup> annual capacity. At the low end, these costs were: SSL operation (22%), truck (29%), receiving facility (26%), and debaling‐size‐reduction (23%). The principle economy‐of‐scale factors were the receiving facility and debaling‐size‐reduction costs. To minimize per‐Mg cost, depot capacity should be chosen such that equipment can be operated as close to 80% of design capacity as possible.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impounding surface waters in reservoirs is a major mechanism for providing water for human consumption, including potable water, hydroelectric power, and industrial uses. Building reservoirs incurs environmental and social costs, and therefore safeguarding their effectiveness and longevity is a concern of clear public interest. One factor that affects the longevity of reservoirs is sedimentation, a process exacerbated by land use conversion in upstream watershed areas. Despite the economic importance of preventing sedimentation in existing reservoirs, few consumers are aware of the natural features that provide sediment retention services and the relevance of their conservation in their daily lives. Moreover, managing for landscape level sediment retention services is challenging due to a lack of clarity regarding supply and demand flows that transcend watershed boundaries and jurisdictions. Our study seeks to bridge these gaps by characterizing the flow of sediment retention services to reservoirs and link these services to the specific consumers that benefit using a socio-ecological network (SEN) framing. We conducted this study on the island of Puerto Rico (PR), the population of which is heavily reliant on reservoirs as a primary water resource, while experiencing severe and chronic reservoir sedimentation problems. Our study models avoided sediment export, and the costs were averted thanks to this service. We characterized protection as opposed to vulnerability of these sediment retention services by estimating the proportion of natural areas under some form of legal conservation status and the level of landscape fragmentation. We frame these services as an SEN by using water distribution lines as links to estimate the number of beneficiaries and their location relative to the reservoir’s water source. Our results identify watersheds with conservation needs, their beneficiaries, and where within those watersheds to prioritize conservation efforts to safeguard access to clean water in PR. More broadly, our study provides a model case study for establishing supply and demand service flows of water purification services and demonstrating the utility of mapping socio-ecological networks of service flows in order to justify conservation policies based on ecosystem services.</jats:p>"

Specifically, roadside grass clippings were chosen, based on their logistical optimization potential, direct feasibility, locality, biomass potential, and economic valorization value. The main objective is to determine how this secondary flow can be brought to the “factory gate”—through road transport and inland shipping—and at what cost per unit. To this end, various scenarios were developed for a case study in East Flanders, considering multiple combinations of first collection points, secondary collection points, and processing points. The result is a generically applicable Excel-based tool that combines these variations with a solution considering both inland waterways and road transport. These scenarios become valuable in applying the tool for grass clippings and optimizing this value chain located in East Flanders. The results show that reducing the number of collection points is favorable for the utilization of inland waterways, as it reduces costs related to transshipment. Nevertheless, unimodal road transport is still the most cost-effective method for transporting this secondary material stream from the collection point to the processing point. Consequently, a lower weight and a higher density will lead to lower costs, which eventually bottom out, due to regulations and conditions that must be met.</jats:p>"

Coliform bacteria, including Escherichia coli, serve as key indicators of water contamination and the potential presence of harmful pathogens. Accurate and reliable detection and enumeration of coliforms in drinking water are essential for monitoring water quality and implementing appropriate interventions. This review article provides an overview of various traditional culture-based methods and rapid molecular methods employed for the analysis of coliforms in drinking water, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and advancements. Culture-based methods such as multiple-tube fermentation (most probable number) and membrane filtration techniques have long been used as standard methods for coliform detection. The emerging molecular-based approaches, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR, and nucleic acid sequencing offer improved sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. This comprehensive review provides a valuable resource for researchers, water quality professionals, and policymakers engaged in the detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water. It offers an up-to-date understanding of different methods, their advancements, and the potential integration of novel technologies. By critically evaluating these approaches, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts toward ensuring safe drinking water for all.</jats:p>",

This involves first securing the acceptance of local communities and conflict parties, which can be achieved through a deep understanding of both political and customary structures, with a focus on respecting key engagement leaders. Sustainability also plays a crucial role, and NGOs must maintain a secure stock of energy and provide greater initiative for on-the-ground managers to meet the expressed needs of beneficiary populations and involve them from the planning stage onwards.

To address the concern, this paper proposes a coordinative control strategy for offshore oil and gas platforms with floating wind power integrated. A saturated filter controller is applied to decompose the wind power fluctuation and smooth it with energy storage and a gas/oil turbine generator. A feedforward control unit is embedded into the controller to compensate for the wind power variation caused by the floating foundation. The proposed strategy is validated using a model extracted from a real offshore oil and gas platform. The result shows that the proposed strategy can validly eliminate the impact of wind power volatility.</jats:p>",

The main aim of this article is to study I5.0 technologies in supply chains when these are affected by disruptive phenomena such as those created by wars, climate change or pandemics. A systematic literature review methodology was conducted to understand the present knowledge connected with this theme. This study summarises 194 research articles from the period 2009 to 2022 to understand the present knowledge connected with this theme. The research findings show a significant gap related to the adoption of I5.0 technologies to prevent or overcome supply chain disruptions. 194 articles, including journal and review articles, were identified in the literature. The study provides a novel and insightful concept related to I5.0 within the context of supply chain disruptions. The potential applications of I5.0 and Industry 4.0 are elaborately discussed in three areas, namely: (1) disruptions in supply chains due to pandemics; (2) disruptions in supply chains due to war; and (3) disruptions in supply chains due to climate change. Finally, this study highlights research implications and proposes future research avenues that will contribute to further exploring the adoption of I5.0 technologies to prevent, manage and overcome disruptions in supply chains.</jats:p>",

This study combines cattle transit records (GTA in Portuguese) with rural property boundaries (CAR in Portuguese) to map these zones in the Brazilian Amazon. It evaluates the influence of Zero-Deforestation Cattle Agreements (CA) and explores the overlap between CA and non−CA slaughterhouse supply zones. Results reveal that CA slaughterhouse supply zones significantly impact forest preservation and cover a large area equivalent to entire municipalities. Over two-thirds of the study region, including most non-protected areas, falls within these zones. There is a high degree of overlap (95%) with non−CA supply zones, indicating competition for suppliers and limited expansion potential for CA. Direct and indirect suppliers are located nearby, with approximately 80% of indirect suppliers within 100 km of direct suppliers. Consequently, supply zones for both types of suppliers largely overlap. These findings demonstrate that assessing slaughterhouse deforestation risk for the entire supply chain in our study region can be achieved by mapping only the direct suppliers. This research provides valuable insights into cattle concentration, the effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments, and the need for sustainable practices in the slaughterhouse industry.</jats:p>"

As a unique self‐maintained and biocompatible 3D scaffold, the recently reported self‐feeding hydrogels with enzyme‐empowered degradation capacity have shown high biological performance in vitro and in vivo. To take advantage of all features of both PL and self‐feeding hydrogels, here UV responsive laminaran‐methacrylate (LamMA) and PL‐methacrylate (PLMA) derivatives plus glucoamylase (GA), which significantly improve the overall features of a 3D system, is coupled. This self‐sustaining hybrid hydrogel emerges as a unique scaffold due to the sustained delivery of glucose produced via enzymatic degradation of laminaran while granting the release of growth factors through the presence of PL. This biomaterial is applied to fabricate high‐throughput freestanding microgels with controlled geometric shapes. Furthermore, this multicomponent hybrid hydrogel is successfully implemented as the first reported glucose supplier bioink to manufacture intricate and precisely defined cell‐laden structures using a support matrix. Finally, such hydrogels are utilized as a proof of concept to serve as 3D in vitro cancer models, with the aim of recapitulating the tumor microenvironment.</jats:p>",

Other blood services have a variety of policies in place to ensure the virological safety of blood components, ranging from an indefinite ban on MSM, to a defined period of exclusion, or to an individualised risk assessment that is not based on gender or sexual orientation. Justification of these policies should be based on scientific evidence including assessment of lengths of virological window periods, infectious disease epidemiology within donor populations and donation screening assay sensitivities. Developments in molecular technology and assays which can detect both antibodies and antigens in the very early stages of infection have significantly reduced the risk in most developed countries. However, the increasing usage of pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV infection after possible high‐risk sexual contact within the UK blood donor population has been recently noted. It has brought with it new diagnostic challenges within blood screening, notably possible non‐detection of HIV RNA and serological markers following PrEP use despite potential infectivity. The use of other testing strategies such as detection of HIV DNA and screening for non‐declared PrEP usage should be investigated further.</jats:p>",

Three aspects of design, risk assessment, and regulations were reviewed to determine if there is a source of pressure higher than the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of the supply tank that could cause fires, explosions, and overpressure. In the case of the design review, all 17 overpressure scenarios described in API Standard 521, i.e., pressure-relieving and depressuring systems, were reviewed, and there was no overpressure scenario above the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP). Then, the risk assessment, i.e., the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique, was used, and as a result of reviewing all possible risk situations, we can state that there were no overpressure scenarios that can exceed the design pressure of the supply tank; thus, we decided that the installation of a PSV on top of the supply tank is unnecessary. Finally, accident prevention measures against overpressure, such as the KS B 6750-3 system design and the Korean Industrial Standard, were reviewed from a legal point of view. It was confirmed that the hazardous chemical supply system for the semiconductor industry designed in this study has several protective functions to prevent fires, explosions, and overpressure. As a result of reviewing the above three aspects, it can be said that there is no need to install a pressure safety valve in a pressure vessel storing hazardous chemicals.</jats:p>"

The obtained results showed that SPAD and LAI decreased significantly under drought stress, and leaf senescence had already started in the early vegetative stage. The amount of top dressing applied at V6 and V12 phenophases did not increase yield due to the low amount of rainfall. The 120 kg N ha−1 base fertiliser proved to be optimal. The suitability of SPAD and LAI for maize yield estimation was modelled by regression analysis.

Although carbon emissions are dominated by the power, industry, transport, and building sectors, the plastics sector is responsible for a significant 4.5% of global emissions and is the fastest-growing material production sector. This study seeks to identify the economic and carbon-reduction potential of the greening of plastic supply chains compared to existing carbon-reduction regimes. Utilizing literature review, lifecycle analysis and multicriteria analysis cognizant of cost, carbon-reduction potential, quality, and recyclability, this paper identifies the performance of virgin, recycled, and bioplastics under a number of scenarios. We find that recycled plastics offer a low-cost carbon-reduction potential; however, concerns about perceived quality remain. While no single plastic type or source can satisfy all criteria, the satisfaction of manufacturer and end user concerns is critical to reducing CO2 via plastic supply-chain greening and the move away from crude-oil-based plastics. The reallocation of subsidies from less effective carbon-reduction policies toward supply-chain greening may offer benefits and stimulate the emergence of a quality control system to overcome manufacturer and user concerns.</jats:p>"

This systematic review describes the prevalence of parental supply of alcohol, as reported in the international literature. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020218754). We searched seven online databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and Public Health Database) and grey literature from January 2011 to December 2022 and assessed the risk of bias with the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. Among 58 articles included in narrative synthesis from 29 unique datasets, there was substantial variation in the definition and measurement of parental supply of alcohol. Overall prevalence rates ranged from 7.0 to 60.0% for minor-report samples, and from 24.0 to 48.0% for parent-report samples. Data indicate that parental supply prevalence is generally proportionately higher for older minors or later-stage students, for girls, and has increased over time among minors who report drinking. Literature on the prevalence of parental supply of alcohol is robust in quantity but inconsistent in quality and reported prevalence. Greater consistency in defining and measuring parental supply is needed to better inform health promotion initiatives aimed at increasing parents’ awareness.</jats:p>",

Production and distribution arrangements were established considering four coffee-producing regions, three ports of origin in Brazil, four destination ports, seven roasting plants, and fifteen consumption centers, all distributed throughout the American territory. Environmental and economic performances regarding global warming potential (GWP) and costs were determined for a life cycle approach. The results indicate that coffee cultivation has the most significant contributions to the GWP of the arrangements. The transport of the product by road also plays an essential role, especially if extensive distances are covered during the port–roaster–consumer center journey in the United States. The analysis showed differences of 2.0 kg CO2eq and US$8.00 per ton of coffee between the best and worst arrangements, which can be considered significant when projected to the Brazilian annual coffee export scale. In the environmental limit condition, the optimization can lead to non-trivial results compared to the real market. The model conceived for the MOO can be improved to reproduce more realistic conditions by incorporating producer and consumer markets, inserting uncertainties.</jats:p>"

Magnetic field can be quickly generated by the fast output current to control the balance of plasma vertical displacement. In order to improve the output current speed of EAST fast control power supply and its ability to resist external disturbance, an improved discrete integral sliding mode control method combining gray prediction and variable gain sliding mode observer is proposed. A sliding mode disturbance observer is used to observe the total disturbance on the load side, and feedforward compensation control is performed on the total disturbance. To further suppress chattering and accelerate convergence speed, a high‐order term is added to the traditional discrete exponential reach law, and a gain adaptive observer is designed to adaptively adjust the observer gain based on the observed current error and the tracking current error. In the current sampling process, an improved gray prediction structure is added, and the original current sequence of gray prediction is improved based on the principle of new information priority, improving the accuracy of predicted current, compensating for the inherent delay in digital control, and further improving the output current response speed. Simulation and experimental verification show that the proposed disturbance suppression improved discrete integral sliding mode fast current tracking control strategy has faster output current response speed and strong antidisturbance performance.</jats:p>",

In this regard, we seek to examine the optimization of existing hubs in terms of the capacity of the new hubs and location of the hubs, with the aim of reducing the cost of coverage to reduce the cost and maximizing the level of green hubs. To this end, the economic benefits of the measures were carried out: the establishment of a new hub, the removal of the previous or current hub, the increase and decrease of the capacity of the hubs. Eventually a new structure of hubs was introduced where the location and capacity of some hubs have changed, but in contrast, the amount of demand coverage has increased.</jats:p>"

Emergence of new technologies coupled with variable customer demand and uncertain pandemic has fueled the disruptions across the supply chain ecosystem. To cater the unanticipated disruptions, supply chains of every business has to be circular and sustainable and construction industry is no exception to this. The present study concentrates on identifying the major performance indicators of resilient Construction Supply Chain (CSC) and prioritize the most significant ones. Fuzzy–Decision Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to reveal the influential relationship of performance indicators on the resilience level in CSCs. Further, a strategy map is prepared to highlight the organizational strategy and cause‐effect approach. The findings from study revealed that maintaining appropriate security level, strong collaboration among supply chain partners, efficient supply chain designs, ability to detect discrepancies, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities, and conservation of resources to facilitate sustainable operations are the top seven performance indicators that are evident in the causal group for sustainable CSC. In the effect group, prominent performance indicators are flexibility, financial strength, and efficient allocation of resources. The study adds on to the existing literature by identifying and analyzing significant performance indicators for establishing resilient, sustainable and circular practices in the construction industry.</jats:p>",

Exploring the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for shoot and grain Zn accumulation would help to develop new barley cultivars with greater Zn accumulation efficiency. In this study, two glasshouse experiments were conducted by growing plants under adequate and low Zn supply. From the preliminary screening of ten barley cultivars, Sahara (0.05 mg/pot) and Yerong (0.06 mg/pot) showed the lowest change in shoot Zn accumulation, while Franklin (0.16 mg/pot) had the highest change due to changes in Zn supply for plant growth. Therefore, the double haploid (DH) population derived from Yerong × Franklin was selected to identify QTL for shoot mineral accumulation and biomass production. A major QTL hotspot was detected on chromosome 2H between 31.91 and 73.12 cM encoding genes for regulating shoot mineral accumulations of Zn, Fe, Ca, K and P, and the biomass. Further investigation demonstrated 16 potential candidate genes for mineral accumulation, in addition to a single candidate gene for shoot biomass in the identified QTL region. This study provides a useful resource for enhancing nutritional quality and yield potential in future barley breeding programs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Induction motors (IMs) are widely used in industrial applications due to their advantages over other motor types. However, the efficiency and lifespan of IMs can be significantly impacted by operating conditions, especially Unbalanced Supply Voltages (USV), which are common in industrial plants. Detecting and accurately assessing the severity of USV in real-time is crucial to prevent major breakdowns and enhance reliability and safety in industrial facilities. This paper presented a reliable method for precise online detection of USV by monitoring a relevant indicator, denominated by negative voltage factor (NVF), which, in turn, is obtained using the voltage symmetrical components. On the other hand, impedance estimation proves to be fundamental to understand the behavior of motors and identify possible problems. IM impedance affects its performance, namely torque, power factor and efficiency. Furthermore, as the presence of faults or abnormalities is manifested by the modification of the IM impedance, its estimation is particularly useful in this context. This paper proposed two machine learning (ML) models, the first one estimated the IM stator phase impedance, and the second one detected USV conditions. Therefore, the first ML model was capable of estimating the IM phases impedances using just the phase currents with no need for extra sensors, as the currents were used to control the IM. The second ML model required both phase currents and voltages to estimate NVF. The proposed approach used a combination of a Regressor Decision Tree (DTR) model with the Short Time Least Squares Prony (STLSP) technique. The STLSP algorithm was used to create the datasets that will be used in the training and testing phase of the DTR model, being crucial in the creation of both features and targets. After the training phase, the STLSP technique was again used on completely new data to obtain the DTR model inputs, from which the ML models can estimate desired physical quantities (phases impedance or NVF).</jats:p>"

The results of the evaluation of the indicators of the muscle tissue of sharptooth catfish grown using modern technology in the Moscow region in 2021–2022 are presented to determine the possibility of using this raw material as the main component for the production of fish multicomponent pate. The objects of the study were live individuals of the African sharptooth catfish and fish carcasses. The results of the study allowed us to establish the biological features of the growth and development of individual structures of the sharptooth catfish grown in a closed water supply cycle in the Moscow region. The most intensive growth (up to 75%) of muscle tissue (fillet), which is of commercial interest to the consumer, is observed during the puberty of the African catfish. The maximum concentrations in muscle tissue of protein (above 18%), fat (above 11%), ash (more than 4%) were observed in fish with a body weight of 1000 g. The rich amino acid composition of the protein of the muscle tissue of the sharptooth catfish allows it to be characterized as a valuable raw material for food production, including fish multicomponent pate.</jats:p>",

Environmentally conscious strategies and operations result in lower costs, improved reputation, increased customer loyalty, and increased market opportunities driven by environmentally conscious consumers. Sustainable business conduct requires green training programmes to enhance employees’ environmental awareness. This study examines the effects of green training on sustainable business advantage using the literature and empirical analysis. This study also examines how green supply chain practices mediate this association. Green supply chain practices include environmentally friendly procurement, production, transportation, and disposal methods. Green recruitment involves selecting and hiring people who understand environmental issues and are committed to sustainability. This method integrates eco-friendly staff. A total of 583 Saudi manufacturing contract workers were studied. IBM SPSS Amos was used to analyse the data from model testing. Green training improves sustainable business advantage, according to the study. The study suggests that green supply chain practices mediate this relationship. Green training improves operational efficiency, resource use, and environmental performance. Green training can be applied to green supply chain practices, resulting in measurable and sustainable results. This study examines green training, recruitment, sustainable business advantage, and green supply chain practices to improve sustainability management understanding. These insights help organisations align their strategies with environmental sustainability, giving them a competitive edge in the 21st century’s ever-changing business environment.</jats:p>"

Companies are looking to enhance their environmental performance by using sustainable supply chain management practices. The effect of supply chains on the environment cannot be understated. Numerous studies have been conducted investigating different facets of supply chain practices.  However, research on sustainable supply chain management frameworks is fragmented, providing little or no guidance to practitioners. Thus, there is still a need for the provision of a comprehensive framework for optimizing the environmental impact of production and distribution processes. The overall objective of this study was to identify existing frameworks and propose a framework to guide practitioners and academics.  A systematic literature review and meta-analytical methodology were applied. The analysis considered 92 articles. The study specifically used content analysis. A comprehensive sustainable supply chain management framework was developed from the eight practices that were derived and categorized. Emerging sustainable supply chain management practices such as green procurement, reverse logistics and cooperative with customers have been included in the framework. This sustainable supply chain management framework provides a guide to supply chain managers about which practices to focus on.  Future research should study the barriers of implementing sustainable supply chain management practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fasting during the month of Ramadan is one of the five fundamental principles of Islam, and it is obligatory for healthy Muslim adults and adolescents. During the fasting month, Muslims usually have two meals a day, suhur (before dawn) and iftar (after dusk). However, diabetic patients may face difficulties when fasting, so it is important for medical staff to educate them on safe fasting practices. Prolonged strict fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, but with proper knowledge, careful planning, and medication adjustment, diabetic Muslim patients can fast during Ramadan. For this review, a literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar until May 2023. Articles other than the English language were excluded. Current strategies for managing blood sugar levels during Ramadan include a combination of patient education on nutrition, regular monitoring of blood glucose, medications, and insulin therapy. Insulin therapy can be continued during fasting if properly titrated to the patients’ needs, and finger prick blood sugar levels should be assessed regularly. If certain symptoms such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, dehydration, or acute illness occur, or blood glucose levels become too high (&gt; 300 mg/dL) or too low (&gt; 70 mg/dL), the fast should be broken. New insulin formulations such as pegylated insulin and medications like tirzepatide, a dual agonist of gastric-inhibitory peptideand glucagonlike-peptide 1 receptors, have shown promise in managing blood sugar levels during Ramadan. Non-insulin-dependent medications like sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 inhibitors, including the Food and Drug Administration-approved ertugliflozin, are also being used to provide additional cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes. </jats:p>"

Methods. The analytical research involved a theory of random processes adapted to the real conditions. For the purpose, results of experimental measurements have been applied obtained under the conditions of active iron ore enterprises using underground procedures of the raw materials mining. Methods of random functions (i.e. elements of correlation theory) have helped identify the basic input and output parameters characterizing rather completely electric supply consumption as a stochastic process to develop a control algorithm for the process.        Findings. A mathematical model of an electric supply/consumption complex as a stochastic process has been developed to assess its features as well as its levels of influence on the economic operational indices of electric power system of under-ground mining enterprises. Formation of the algorithm to control distribution of electric power flows among consumers of the analyzed types of iron ore enterprises took into consideration stochastic nature of the mentioned complex activity.        Originality. The procedure of electric supply/consumption by underground iron ore enterprises has been analyzed in the format of process of a stochastic process of their operation. For the first time, the synthesized mathematical model has been built; both average and disperse stochastic characteristics of electric consumption capacity have been identified; average period of electric energy consumption as a stationary random function during the specified time has been determined; and average number of electric consumption peaks for the interval has been defined as well as average duration of their surges. Analysis of the electric supply/consumption process as a stochastic process has helped solve a problem of the peak influence on the modes of electric energy consumption by receivers of the enterprises, i.e. the random function crossing the specified electric consumption level.        Practical implications. According to the available computing formats, a calculation procedure of the operation parameters of electric supply/consumption is of insufficient accuracy since average values are applied and stochastic nature of the process is ignored, which is typical for the analyzed mining enterprises. The abovementioned restricts the possibility to develop adequate system to control the electric power process in terms of the types of mining enterprises and specificity of their operational technology. The developed methods of electric supply/consumption functioning dynamics as a stochastic process help expand its use while forming and making efficient managerial decisions in the context of the analyzed process.</jats:p>",

As the main force of carbon emissions in China, thermal power industry is bound to become the focus of attention in China’s low-carbon development strategy and energy conservation and emission reduction. Moreover, with the marketization of the power industry, the state has joined the market competition at the power generation sectors and the power sale sectors, and implemented the “opening the middle of the two pipes.” Therefore, the coverage of influence of carbon emissions and carbon investment behavior of power generation companies is not limited to itself, but will also be extended to the supply chain level. Based on the above background, this paper evaluates the scientific rationality of low-carbon investment projects of thermal power enterprises from the perspective of low-carbon supply chain, which not only can help enterprises achieve a win–win situation of economic and environmental benefits, but also contribute to the carbon emission reduction of the entire supply chain, thereby promoting China’s entire social and economic energy conservation and emission reduction work.</jats:p>"

Limited research has been conducted on the design of emergency regional food supply chains (ERFSC) and its labor demand forecasting under government-mandated interventions. This paper applies emergency supply chain management theory to analyze the business processes of the ERFSC and proposes a multi-level ERFSC network tailored to different risk levels. Additionally, a food demand forecasting model and a mathematical model for stochastic labor demand planning are constructed based on the development trend of regional epidemics. An empirical analysis is presented using Huaguoyuan, Guiyang, China, as an example. The results demonstrate that the proposed ERFSC design and its labor demand forecasting model can achieve secure supply and accurate distribution of necessities in regions with different risk levels. These findings have important policy and research implications for the government and practitioners to take interventions and actions to ensure food supply for residents in the context of city closure or silent management.

The article is devoted to the study of the organization of preferential drug provi- sion for outpatient patients with coronavirus infection in the Republic of Tatarstan and the analysis of the range of medicines dispensed under preferential prescrip- tions in pharmacies in Kazan. Methods. The initial data of the study were regulatory legal acts of the federal level, as well as those developed and approved by the Government and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan. The objects in this study were the primary accounting documents for the release of medicines under preferential prescriptions of large pharmacies of the state unitary enterprise «Medical Equipment and Pharmacy of Tatarstan» in Kazan – pharma- cies No. 1, 2, 3, 4 (conditional numbering) located in different administrative dis- tricts. Statistical and analytical analysis methods using Microsoft Excel were used for data processing. Results. The paper examines the interaction of structures and orders regulating the proce- dure for providing outpatient medical care, preferential drug provision to citizens. The analysis of medicines released under preferential prescriptions for 4 large pharmacies in Kazan was carried out. The most frequently prescribed medications by attached polyclinics in the period 2020-2022 were studied.; the structure of medicines purchased and released to pharmacies during the specified period ac- cording to the criteria: source of financing (federal, regional budget), as well as the organization of the competitive procurement system by source of financing, indi- cating the authorized representative for the organization of the competition (the organizers were the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, which purchased medicines at the expense of the federal budget budget, and the purchase of medicines from the regional bud- get was carried out by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan). The total number of prescriptions dispensed, the amount and the average cost of 1 prescrip- tion were selectively analyzed. Conclusion. The study showed that in a short time the country has done a lot of work to overcome the pandemic of coronavirus infection: Temporary methodological rec- ommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation “Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)” have been de- veloped, as well as an algorithm for preferential drug provision for outpatient pa- tients with coronavirus infection and interaction with medical organizations that timely, in the course of changing the situation with coronavirus infection, they were rebuilt to solve the task. A retrospective analysis of the system of preferential drug provision for patients with coronavirus infection showed that the healthcare system has gained a lot of experience in creating an algorithm to combat a sudden pandemic, mobility of response to a changing situation, which allowed us to work out effective approaches to providing medicines to the population in the condi- tions of a pandemic and that the experience gained will certainly be used in the future.</jats:p>",

This paper aimed to analyze the efficiency of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and provided a prospective benchmark with the potato chips industry as a study case. Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) estimated future input and output values to obtain prospective benchmarks and be added to the DEA formula later. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods were used to measure SSCM performance. The results showed that 17 of 20 Decision-Making Units (DMUs) were efficient (score 1). The other 3 DMUs were classified and got an efficiency score of 0.965, 0.955, and 0.995. In future estimates calculation, the efficiency score of one of the inefficient DMUs has changed to 1, while the other two got the scores of 0.996 and 0.980. The limitation of this research mainly comes from the scope of assessment, which is limited to the supply chain’s downstream sector and assesses only a limited number of MSMEs in a particular region. SSCM efficiency measurement variables were adjusted to be assessed and applied to MSMEs. PERT was also beneficial to gain future estimates of the assessment scope.</jats:p>",

The necessity and possibility of using the frequency-regulated electric drive of pumping units in the networks of centralized heat supply, in the mode of their operation of quantitative and qualitative regulation of the coolant supply, is well-founded. The frequency control parameters were calculated on the basis of technical data related to the operating mode, where the flow rate of the coolant changes according to the hydraulic load typical for HVAC applications defined by the European Union Regulation, as well as the technical data of the pump, frequency converter and electric motors provided by the manufacturers. The definition of parameters concerns the operation of pumping units in a typical operating cycle characteristic of district heating networks, which involves operation with a reduced load for a long time. The results were obtained that correspond to the range of the speed of rotation of the electric drive, its power, torque, coolant supply and hydraulic pressure of the pump in a real typical network of centralized heat supply. The practical significance of the obtained results is that they can be used for the modernization of the electric drive of pumping units of the centralized heat supply network, which until now are operated with non-regulated electric drives based on an asynchronous motor with a short-circuited rotor and throttle regulation of the coolant supply.</jats:p>"

These differences were observed in terms of the total number of content titles and the distribution of content by country or region. The supply of Korean content also varied significantly among different OTT platforms, Netflix was standing out as a significant provider of the latest Korean content. This study confirmed the reality of Korean content that is inevitably dependent on the operational strategies of global OTTs, and suggested that in order for Korean content to truly secure global competitiveness, it is necessary to diversify overseas distribution centered on domestic platforms and foster a sustainable creative ecosystem.</jats:p>",

To heighten the efficiency of energy transfer for mobile heating, this research introduces the innovative concept of modular storage and transportation. This concept is brought to life through the development of a meticulously designed modular mobile phase-change energy storage compartment system. Employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD), an in-depth exploration into the performance of the modular M-TES container and the adapted phase-change material (PCM) is conducted. By implementing fin arrangements on the inner wall of the heat storage module, a remarkable upsurge in the liquid phase-transition rate of the phase-change material is achieved in comparison to the design lacking fins—this improvement approximating around 30%. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the augmentation in heat transfer gradually recedes with the proliferation of fins or an escalation in their height. Moreover, the integration of expanded graphite into erythritol emerges as profoundly effective in amplifying the thermal conductivity of the PCM. Notably, with the addition of a 15.2% volume fraction of expanded graphite to erythritol, the duration of heat storage experiences a drastic reduction to nearly 10% of its original duration, thereby signifying a momentous advancement in thermal performance.</jats:p>"

The findings are detected in all three major financing markets—equities, syndicated loans, and public debt. Difference‐in‐differences tests allow us to draw a causal interpretation of our main findings, which also holds in several robustness tests. Our findings suggest that increased cross‐border financing reflects greater ability to access global financial markets, due to enhanced firm visibility and investor attention, as well as operational forces that arise when establishing new global supply chain partnerships. Specifically, we provide evidence that firms that are small, held less by institutional investors, and followed by fewer analysts have more benefits in cross‐border financing from the formation of the global supply chain. Our findings have important implications for firms attempting to integrate into the global supply chain network. More broadly, our findings suggest that the information generated by operational activities can have significant effects on subsequent financing activities. </jats:p>",

Then, we get some conclusions through theoretical and numerical analysis. The lower the commission rate charged by online platform, the less the e-tailer likes the marketplace mode. The best action of the suppliers is also related to this commission. The lower the commission rate, the more the suppliers tend to choose the marketplace mode. And their best action is different under different sales scenarios. If the two suppliers adopt different modes, the one who chooses the marketplace mode will have more advantage. We also get an interesting conclusion that when suppliers make the same choice, the commission does not affect their competition and decision-making.</jats:p>",

The paper delves into the significance of sustainable materials in the context of current global environmental concerns. It outlines the benefits of their integration in supply chains. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper identifies the environmental, social, and economic advantages of incorporating sustainable materials, including reduced carbon footprints, resource conservation, waste reduction, enhanced brand reputation, and long-term resilience. However, the paper acknowledges that integrating sustainable materials is not without challenges. It highlights barriers such as higher costs, limited availability, resistance to change, and regulatory complexities that organizations must navigate. The paper presents an array of strategic approaches that organizations can adopt to overcome these challenges and effectively integrate sustainable materials. Strategies discussed include green procurement, life cycle assessment, circular economy principles, collaboration with suppliers, eco-design, certification, pilot programs, and education. Furthermore, the paper addresses the critical role of tools and technologies in assessing the environmental impact of supply chains. It explores carbon footprint calculators, environmental management systems, life cycle assessment methodologies, traceability technologies, and other digital solutions that enable data-driven decision-making, risk mitigation, and process optimization. The importance of these tools in promoting transparency, accountability, and innovation is emphasized. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating sustainable materials for positive environmental impact and highlight the broader implications for responsible resource management. The paper concludes by proposing areas for further research, including circular economy implementation, technological integration, multi-tier supply chain impacts, consumer behavior, and advocating for continued efforts to promote sustainable practices in supply chain management. In a world grappling with environmental challenges, this paper contributes to the discourse surrounding sustainable materials' pivotal role in reshaping supply chains for a more sustainable future.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Sustainable Materials, Supply Chain Management, Environmental Impact, Carbon Footprint, Circular Economy, Green Procurement, Traceability Technologies, Sustainability Tools.</jats:p>"

To quantitatively estimate the risk of power system operation under extreme rainfall, a multi-scenario stochastic risk assessment method was proposed. First, a scenario generation scheme considering waterlogged faults of power facilities was constructed based on the storm water management model (SWMM) and the extreme learning machine method. These scenarios were merged with several typical scenario sets for further processing. The outage of power facilities will induce power flow transfer which may consequently lead to transmission lines’ thermal limit violation. Semi-invariant and Gram–Charlier level expansion methods were adopted to analytically depict the probability density function and cumulative probability function of each line’s power flow. The optimal solution was performed by a particle swarm algorithm to obtain proper load curtailment at each bus, and consequently, the violation probability of line thermal violations can be controlled within an allowable range. The volume of load curtailment as well as their importance were considered to quantitatively assess the risk of power supply security under extreme precipitation scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified in case studies based on the Southeast Australia Power System. Simulation results indicated that the risk of load shedding in extreme precipitation scenarios can be quantitatively estimated, and the overload probability of lines can be controlled within the allowable range through the proposed optimal load shedding scheme.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the advent of Industry 4.0, blockchain is one of the emerging technologies that can be used in multiple fields, especially in supply chain networks, where it is considered a sustainable concept technology. Because of its decentralization, reliability, transparency, consistency, and traceability, blockchain can challenge existing conventional models in supply chain scenarios. Therefore, this study proposes a framework that integrates the technology of Blockchain 3.0 (Hyperledger Fabric) into the tea supply chain. The concept of data traceability driven by blockchain technology consists of documenting the tea supply chain system, in which the cultivation, processing, and retailing of tea leaves are documented, and optimizing the existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms. The ECDSA algorithm is used to confirm the identity among the entities located in the Hyperledger Fabric channel, and IPFS technology is introduced to store tea traceability data to solve the problem of data increment in the tea production process. Only the hash value and traceability code of the traceability data are stored in the block. We analyze the relationship between the number of transactions and latency, and we can see the latency time of both write and read transactions. The system tested write transactions and read transactions with a minimum write speed of 0.97 s and a maximum of 6.26 s and a minimum read speed of 0.1 s and a maximum of 4.62 s via Caliper analysis. The experimental results show that the performance analysis sounds good. This study uses distributed theory and service-oriented thinking in its specific application to the tea supply chain system model and takes each entity through a B2B connection to achieve anti-counterfeit traceability in the tea supply chain of a regulatory nature.</jats:p>"

Taking the Loess Plateau of Northern Shaanxi as an example, this study utilizes InVEST to assess the ecosystem services of water yield and habitat quality. The optimal solutions for the combination of these two services are calculated on the basis of the Pareto principle. The production possibility frontier curves for the two services are fitted, and the services’ supply efficiency is measured. Furthermore, this study employs ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression to analyze the dominant factors affecting supply efficiency. The results comprise the following findings: (1) There are eighteen solutions representing the optimal combinations between the two services. (2) The supply efficiency of the two services increases from northwest to southeast in spatial distribution. (3) The dominant factors vary among different zones of supply efficiency. Population, hydrology, and gross domestic product (GDP) are the dominant factors in the general-efficiency, sub-low-efficiency, and low-efficiency supply zones, respectively. Hydrology, NDVI, and GDP are the dominant factors in the sub-high-efficiency supply zone, while GDP, terrain, and population are the dominant factors in the high-efficiency supply zone. In conclusion, this paper proposes recommendations for reducing trade-offs and enhancing supply efficiency between ecosystem services. These include dynamic supervising for the high-efficiency supply zone, moderate greening in the sub-high-efficiency supply zone, stabilizing the population in the general-efficiency supply zone, and reducing development intensity in low- and sub-low-efficiency zones. The study reveals the potential and approaches for improving the supply of ecosystem services and offers guidance for formulating ecological protection plans.</jats:p>"

This method offers advantages over traditional soil-based approaches and has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize controlled agriculture. The review aimed to offer a summary of technological advancements and industrialization patterns in systems supplying circulating nutrient solutions. An intelligent nutrient management system enhances plant growth and productivity. The utilization of a circulating hydroponic cultivation setup can reduce environmental pollution and lower production expenses. As a result, circulating nutrient solution management systems are gaining global popularity, such as in the Netherlands, circular hydroponic cultivation has been advanced to over 95%. A limitation of circulation-type nutrient solution cultivation is the potential transmission and rapid formulation of pathogens during the recycling of discharged nutrient solutions. Addressing this concern, filtration and sterilization processes can offer viable solutions. To accelerate hydroponic farming, an integrated approach could be pursued, strengthen nutrient circulation management technology. This approach could aid in the implementation of such systems in countries like the Republic of Korea, where adoption of circulating hydroponic systems remains under 5%. The trend of technological advancement and industrial growth has been conducted through patent analysis and resources that have subsequently lead the way for the advancement of extensive hydroponic farming establishments. The cyclic hydroponic cultivation in the Republic of Korea was introduced in 2010, and based on the patent information, this endeavor gained momentum from 2020 onward. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the considerable potential of circulating nutrient solution supply systems as viable approaches for promoting sustainable and efficient food production. As a result, forthcoming research and innovation need to be tailored to the local context and prioritize user-centered methodologies, ultimately facilitating the integration and establishment of hydroponic systems in the Republic of Korea.</jats:p>",

The supply chain performance in PT XYZ was good yet only the POF matrix gives an unfavorable result compared to the brancmark from a similar company. Commonly in running operation of production, PT XYZ has several steps of supply chain that only involve suppliers, PT XYZ and direct to customer. The result showed from the measurement of matrix: level 1 is POF=88.36%, OFCT=44 days, and CTCCT=51 days. In level 2, PT XYZ conducted all activities in planning process (P1-P5), executing (S2, M1, M2, M3, D2, D3 and DR1) and enabling. On the mapping of level 2 obtained that the result of deliver process have the lowest performance and analysis in level 3 should be conducted to explain the deliver process in more detail.</jats:p>"

In such a framework, trusted traceability and accountability can be reliably and securely managed by means of blockchain-based solutions. Unfortunately, blockchain cannot guarantee the provenance and accuracy of the stored information. To overcome such a limitation, this paper proposes a secure solution to strongly rely on the tracking information of the physical assets in the supply chain. The proposed solution exploits Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to provide required cryptographic primitives through a Near-Field Communication (NFC) connection. In our approach, each transfer of the assets is authenticated, verified, and recorded in the blockchain through the HSM. Transaction entries are signed, thus providing a guarantee of ownership and authenticity. The proposed infrastructure has been subject of an exhaustive security analysis and proved resilient against counterfeiting attempts, stakeholder repudiations, and misleading information.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been extensive research on the strategic choice between supply chain centralization and decentralization. However, most research assumes complete centralization or complete decentralization but omits the commonly adopted supply chain structure of partial centralization. With partial centralization, a firm owns a portion, but not all, of its partner. To help fill this research gap, in this paper, we make a major contribution by explicitly analyzing partial centralization in a supply chain where a durable‐good manufacturer owns a portion of its downstream retailer. We start with a two‐period model and derive analytical equilibrium outcomes of the supply chain and its members under complete centralization, complete decentralization, and partial centralization. First, our analysis reveals that partial centralization with an appropriate portion of ownership can yield the desirable product sales pattern over periods and alleviate the time‐inconsistency problem in selling durable goods. As a result, partial centralization can become the equilibrium structure for a durable‐good supply chain. Second, the manufacturer's optimal ownership level in the retailer decreases in the product durability and decision horizon length, implying that complete decentralization is more likely to be the supply chain structure in equilibrium for higher product durability and longer decision horizon. Third, our extended analyses demonstrate the robustness of the main results with backward partial centralization. Moreover, partial centralization outperforms conventional strategies such as two‐part tariffs that can coordinate a supply chain but not fully solve the time‐inconsistency problem associated with durable goods. </jats:p>",

In the present study, drinking water was sampled from the six areas of Tehran in summer (August 2020), autumn (November 2020), winter (February 2021), and spring (May 2021) to evaluate natural and synthetic estrogen hormones (estrone (E1), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2)). The samples were transferred to the laboratory and the solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was used to extract the hormones, and the type and amount of hormones were examined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. According to the results, the highest concentrations were related to E1 and E2 compounds at 1.96 and 2.13 ng/L, respectively, in summer and autumn (device detection limit = 0.5 ng/L). In addition, concentrations of compounds E1 and E2 were lower than the detection limit in spring and winter in all samples, and compounds E3 and EE2 were not identified in any samples or seasons. Commonly, the concentration of steroid hormones increased in the dry seasons (summer and autumn), while in the spring and winter concentrations were less than the device detection limit because of rainfall.</jats:p>",

The government provides low-carbon subsidies to low-carbon manufacturing enterprises to promote the formation of a green supply chain. To better encourage the development of the green supply chain by determining government subsidies and platform authentication fees, this paper constructs a Stackelberg game model that consists of a supplier and a manufacturer, and solves the optimal decisions of each entity using the backward induction method. This study uses the matching method to analyze the payoff matrix for supply chain members when choosing between low-carbon and traditional production. After introducing the online trading platform, the impact of the platform on the profit of supply chain members is studied, considering whether the authentication service provided by the platform is completely accurate. The results show that (1) in the green supply chain, there is a relationship between the enterprises’ profit and the level of emissions reduction, which increases first and then decreases. (2) The online trading platform is conducive to achieving green supply chain coordination. The government can pay fewer subsidies to prompt the formation of a green supply chain and the optimal emissions reduction level of the enterprise is higher. (3) When the authentication mechanism of the platform is imperfect, the authentication fee of the platform and the subsidy coefficient of the government need to be set within a reasonable range to avoid the enterprise adopting traditional production pretending to be the low-carbon type. This study contributes to research on the green supply chain and provides insights into pricing strategies for governments and platforms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Modular integrated construction (MiC) becomes a promising solution to improve production efficiency in the construction industry. However, the off‐site production and on‐site installation processes of MiC pose challenges to collaboration efficiency among the multiple stakeholders involved, including subcontractors, contractors, and consumers. These challenges stem from information dispersion, which impedes effective collaboration and communication. Such problems can be solved by introducing a blockchain‐based cyber‐physical service platform, which can facilitate information sharing and collaboration across the supply chain. In this paper, we study the impacts of MiC and blockchain technology on construction supply chains and reveal several important insights. First, we find that there exists a first‐mover advantage in the traditional construction supply chain, where subcontractors engage in a sequential game, and the subcontractor who produces first obtains more profit than the counterparts. Moreover, the contractor's ability to increase profits by reducing the unit cost of construction time is limited, but it can improve the effectiveness of the time gap due to early delivery. Second, we show that MiC should not be introduced if it significantly reduces collaboration efficiency in the supply chain. Interestingly, increasing the unit cost of construction for subcontractors can actually result in greater profits for all members of the supply chain. Regarding adopting blockchain technology, our findings suggest that supply chain members generally hold similar attitudes. Specifically, when the value of blockchain in improving collaboration efficiency is below a certain threshold, its adoption may not be beneficial, despite its potential to enable rapid production and early delivery.</jats:p>",

The main sourc- es of pollution of the Dnipro Reservoir are discharge of wastewater into the river without proper treatment; uncontrolled discharges of wastewater; non-compliance with the regime in bank strips and water-protection zones; and bank erosion. Health-risk assessment includes four main stages: hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-effect assessment, and risk characterization. We determined that according to all parameters – except BSK5, HSC, and suspended matter – the water meets the regulation standards of the Hygienic Water-Quality Standards of Water Bodies to Meet the Drinking, Household and Other Needs of Population, but does not reach the upper limit of the 1st quality class according to DSTU 4808:2007. Also, the average annual values were significantly above the minimum values of the examined parameters. There was a decrease in the level of BOD5 at the checkpoints in the city of Dnipro, indicating invasion of the watercourse (points 4 and 5) by substances that inhibit biochemical processes. The same parameter decreased at the checkpoint where the River leaves the city limits and further downstream, suggesting an influx of organic compounds. The oxygen content was observed to decline in the part of the watercourse located in the city (points 4 – 8) and increase in the middle and lower parts of the reservoir. There was also seen a trend of growth of sulfates, nitrogen compounds, phosphates, synthetic surfactants and COD at the control checkpoints located within the city of Dnipro. As a result of the risk assessment of the impact of anthropogenic activities of the Dnipro agglomeration on the Dnipro Reservoir, we determined that nitrites, nitrates and phosphates and suspended solids are the priority substances in the list. This can impose negative impacts on the health, causing mutagenic and carcinogenic effects, and enhance the eutrophication of the surface water. The Dnipro agglomeration has been causing a negative ecological impact on the Dnipro Reservoir, increasing the risk value from 0.999999206 (checkpoint 3, before the city of Kamianske) to 0.999999924 (checkpoint 6, where the River leaves the city limits).\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the oxidation of biomass derivatives is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is designed as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a ≈2.00‐fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1 % vs. 30.7 %). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50 times and 2.54 times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass‐to‐chemical conversion.</jats:p>",

Its geographic location and semi-arid environment posed unique challenges to the development of its water supply infrastructure. Multi-scalar historical and archeological analyses, reveal how the city coped with the challenges of water scarcity and distribution over time, illustrating the evolution of water management practices, and the ways in which infrastructure and governance systems evolved to meet changing needs and priorities. Historical analysis maps the changes in urban water infrastructure (cisterns, ditches, sewers, artesian wells, and reservoirs) using a systematic documentation review of the Denver newspaper citations between 1860 and 1929. This is corroborated through contextual investigation and archeological excavations. Taken together, the research demonstrates how the residents of early Denver were forced to continually seek new water sources for distribution even after other provisional priorities such as sewage management and flood control were initiated. </jats:p>",

The coupling relationship between tourism economic benefits and ecological environment (EE) was studied, and the systemic evaluation index system of Shandong tourism economy and EE was constructed. The range method and entropy method were used to calculate indicator weights, thereby constructing a coupled collaborative model between the tourism economy and the EE. Based on the relationship between tourism economic benefits and EE, research has been conducted on the transformation methods of agricultural water resources in EE construction to improve tourism economic benefits. With the continuous improvement of the EE index, the coupling degree between the tourism economic index and the EE index in many cities in Shandong Province has improved, and the tourism economic benefits have greatly improved.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the release of volatiles (both gas and bio‐oil) from lignin was strengthened in this sealable system when the temperature rose, and therefore less char was left.

Furthermore, the formation of CO and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the employed pyrolyzer benefited from not only the thermal evolution of feedstock, but also the interactions between char residues and generated gas components. Meanwhile, because of the hydrogen self‐supply, compounds in bio‐oil were enriched and only nine species were detected, which were all phenolic compounds. Vanillic acid was dominant, and its relative content was up to 38.86% for Alcell organosolv lignin and 34.41% for soda alkali lignin. This illustrates that highly selective production of phenolic compounds from lignin pyrolysis can be achieved by self‐supplying hydrogen from pyrolysis gas.</jats:p>",

Here, an improved Buck converter is proposed for high‐frequency and high‐step‐down‐ratio APS application. With the control method based on energy extraction, the proposed topology can achieve an ultra‐low equivalent duty cycle. Thus, a high step‐down ratio can be achieved under a high switching frequency. Moreover, the proposed structure can be applied on several types of the main power stage through the power switch sharing technique. Finally, the prototype with the switching frequency of 1 MHz and the step‐down ratio of 18:1 is verified by the experimental results.</jats:p>",

We find that comparing with the risk-neutral decentralized decision, the increase of manufacturer’s risk tolerance attitude can narrow the gap between the supply chain profit and the centralized decision, but it will further reduce the carbon emission reduction level. The increase of risk tolerance of the manufacturer and carbon tax will narrow the stable region of the system. Under this situation, the manufacturer should carefully adjust parameters to prevent the system from losing stability, especially the adjustment parameters for carbon emission reduction level. When the system is in a chaotic state, the increase of carbon tax rate makes the system show more complex dynamic characteristics. Under the chaotic state, it is difficult for the manufacturer to make correct price decision and carbon emission reduction strategy for the next period, which damages its profit, but increases the profit of the retailer and the supply chain. Finally, the carbon emission reduction cost-sharing contract is proposed to improve the carbon emission reduction level and the supply chain efficiency, achieving Pareto improvement. The stability region of the system is larger than that in the centralized decision situation, but the increase of the cost sharing coefficient will reduce the stability of the system in the decentralized decision-making situation.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have conducted a multidimensional and comprehensive assessment of the influences on accessibility from the different perspectives of supply and demand. To address this, our study centred on the mountainous Chongqing region and established a comprehensive research framework examining the spatial pattern of accessibility of urban green spaces and its correlation with physical geographical elements and socioeconomic factors. We reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of urban green space accessibility by using Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area and network analysis methods and further observe the spatial clustering features utilising hotspot analysis. The ordinary least squares (OLS) model and the spatial lag model were used to evaluate the physical geographical and socioeconomic disparities. Our findings reveal explicit blind spots in urban green space accessibility, primarily within the 30 min travel threshold in the city’s marginal area. A discernible supply–demand imbalance existed in the urban core, constituted by implicit blind spots. Furthermore, we identified that the relationship between urban green space accessibility and elevation under different methods is not always consistently significant over space because spatial heterogeneity may exist. Most concerningly, the study found inequities in urban green space accessibility, particularly impacting vulnerable demographics such as the elderly and lower-income groups. These results can inform urban planners and policymakers about the blind spots of urban green space accessibility and sufficiently consider the physical and socioeconomic heterogeneity of the space to determine where and how to implement inclusive urban greening policies or planning schemes. It is also of great significance in increasing awareness of vulnerable groups and preventing environmental inequality.</jats:p>"

This power supply comprises three stages; each can deliver a voltage pulse up to 300 V. The advantage of this power supply is the possibility of tailoring a pulse waveform on the cathode with several voltage levels. This e-HiPIMS can operate in the standard HiPIMS mode (s-HiPIMS) and multipulse HiPIMS mode. Each voltage sequence is independently managed regarding the width, delay, and voltage level. They can all be synchronized, giving the s-HiPIMS, or shifted in time and added to each other. Hence, the idea is to favor a specific ion population compared to others, according to the process needs and the targeted application. A beneficial example used a three-pulse sequence with different voltage levels. The influence of the temporal behavior on the plasma parameters, namely, currents and electron energy, has been studied for each pulse sequence. The results show that the discharge current stays within the same order of magnitude as in the standard HiPIMS. The reference current level can be obtained quickly, adding a short over-pulse, even if its voltage level is relatively low. Furthermore, measurements by the Langmuir probe reveal that a maximum electron density is obtained at 0.2 and 0.6 Pa of argon for a configuration that adds two distinguished voltage-pulse sequences, one between 5 and 15 μs and the other between 20 and 40 μs. It comes out that this e-HiPIMS sequence significantly increases the electron density.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, reverse osmosis water desalination has developed rapidly and has become the most competitive and widely used technology in the world. The number of desalination plants is increasing rapidly as freshwater needs increase. Various membrane technologies have been developed and improved, including nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO), whose desalination costs have been relatively reduced. Therefore, this work proposes an experimental study for a small desalination unit based on RO generated by renewable energy, which is mainly suitable for arid regions or desert areas that do not have electricity and water and can be applied for emergency treatment to meet strong freshwater resource needs. In this study, to meet the drinking water demand, a reverse osmosis desalination system is designed and evaluated in order to improve and optimize its operation. This system has a daily capacity of 2 m3. We used brackish groundwater, which has been characterized as reference water, to produce synthetic water for different salinities until seawater. The analysis is based on data obtained from experiments carried out in the standalone RO pilot designed for the production of fresh water. For this purpose, we conducted relevant experiments to examine the influence of applied pressure, salt concentration and temperature on the RO membrane performance. The effects of different factors that affect the energy consumption in the RO desalination process were analyzed, and those with significant influence were explored. The effectiveness of RO desalination coupled with a photovoltaic (PV) energy system is shown. We found the recovery rate for system operation to be 32%. An optimization study is presented for the operation of an autonomous RO desalination system powered by photovoltaic panels. The energy produced by the PV system was used to feed two pumps forthe production of drinking waterwithanRO membrane, under the conditions of the town of Bou-Ismail. As results, a 3 kWp PV system was installed based on the energy demand. The design data have shown that a 3 kWp PV system can power a 1.8 W RO load given the Bou-Ismail climate. Energy consumption in the case study under Bou-Ismail weather conditions were analyzed. The desalination of brackish water at a TDS value of 5 g/L requires an energy of about 1.5 kWh/m3. Using seawater at a TDS value of 35 g/L, this value increases to 5.6 kWh/m3. The results showed that the optimal recovery rate for system operation was determined to be 32% for a feedwater salinity of 35 g/L, and 80% for a feedwater salinity of 1 g/L.</jats:p>"

Their joint actions and motivations interact to determine what is sold, to whom, and at which price; these actions are shaped by interpersonal relationships and cultural norms. Understanding these dynamics is useful for crafting equitable and impactful policies and program interventions that leverage, rather than oppose, market actors’ initial motivations. This paper examines this process of “making a market” through a case study of vendors and consumers in Birnin Kebbi, Nigeria. It answers four interrelated research questions through a series of in-depth interviews with consumers (n = 47) and vendors (n = 37) using methods drawn from focused ethnography. The results demonstrate that market transactions are influenced by a complex interaction of vendors’ norms on competition and collaboration, consumers’ needs for credit amid unpredictable prices and restrictive gender norms, and a “moral economy” that appears to guide market actors’ behavior. Based on this, it is suggested that the conceptualization of which characteristics shape consumer choices within food environments should be broadened to include factors such as credit access and bargaining ability, and the trusted interpersonal relationships that enable them.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Spatter formation at melt pool swellings at the keyhole rear wall is a major issue for laser deep penetration welding at speeds beyond 8 m/min. A gas nozzle directed towards the keyhole, that supplies shielding gas locally, is advantageous in reducing spatter formation due to its simple utilization. However, the relationship between local gas flow, laser spot size, and the resulting effects on spatter formation at high welding speeds up to 16 m/min are not yet fully understood. Methods. The high-alloy steel AISI 304 (1.4301/X5CrNi18-10) was welded with laser spot sizes of 300 μm and 600 μm while using a specially designed gas nozzle directed to the keyhole. Constant welding depth was ensured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Spatter formation was evaluated by precision weighing of samples. Subsequent processing of high-speed images was used to evaluate spatter quantity, size, and velocity. The keyhole oscillation was determined by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Tracking the formation of melt pool swellings at the keyhole rear wall provided information on the upward melt flow velocity. Results. The local gas flow enabled a significant reduction in the number of spatters and loss of mass for both laser spot sizes and indicated an effect on surface tension by shielding the processing zone from the ambient atmosphere. The laser spot size affected the upward melt flow velocity and spatter velocity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A smart ultrasound scanner plays an important role in the transition to point-of-care imaging. DC–DC bipolar converters are essential in the generation of the ultrasound burst signal as they power the piezoelectric transducer. The conventional bipolar converter has minimal output gain and high-voltage stress, and the longer duty cycle on the semiconductors produces high conduction losses and reduces the efficiency of the system. The transmitter supply voltage is minimal, necessitating the use of high-gain bipolar converters. This proposed study is concerned with the development of an improved high-output voltage gain symmetric bipolar DC–DC converter topology which may be suitable for applications such as powering a smart ultrasound scanner transmitter. The proposed converter combines the conventional single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC) with a voltage multiplier cell (VMC) to improve voltage gain, transistor duty cycle, efficiency, and reliability. The present study describes the working principle of the proposed converter. The analysis of the voltage gain is carried out in continuous current mode (CCM) and discontinuous current mode (DCM), taking into account the nonidealities of the device. The simulation of the proposed system is carried out in the numerical environment Matlab/Simulink in order to verify its characteristics. A prototype model is realized and the experimental study presented validates the theoretical arguments and simulations. Due to the advantages of continuous input current, self-balancing bipolar outputs, and small component size, the proposed converter is a suitable choice for smart ultrasound transmitters.</jats:p>"

DWSS are globally used to provide safe drinking water in urban and rural settings, and their design cost is critical for water authorities, especially in low-income countries. In this study, the optimal of the specific consumption value is carried out in Burkina Faso (West Africa). The methodology adopted a statistical analysis of operational data collected on 40 DWSS systems in Burkina Faso, further completed by a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of determinants of the water demand and cluster identification and analysis through Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). The results show that the actual consumption is lower than the common estimate used in sizing. Statistical analysis revealed that actual specific consumption is affected by various parameters, the most relevant of which are the reliance on alternative resources, the presence of waterways and the local climate seasonality. The average actual specific consumption is estimated at 3.83 ± 3.43 L/people/day. Finally, a decision tree for the choice of suitable specific consumption value as a function of the physical settings of a given area is proposed for optimal sizing of DDWS systems in Burkina Faso.</jats:p>"

Indeed, hot water systems, showers, and air-conditioning systems can be contaminated by Legionella, which grows at 25–42 °C. Studies have shown that in Sardinia, especially during the summer months, the water circulation in the hotels’ pipes is exposed to extremely high temperatures. As a result, this study was conducted to assess the colonization of hotel water systems by Legionella in Sardinia, concerning a recent EU directive 2020/2184 for drinking water with a limit of 1000 CFU /L. Methods. A total of 112 accommodation facilities were analyzed, of which 61.3% were found to be colonized with Legionella, and out of a total of 807 samples, 32.5% were positive for Legionella presence. The results showed a higher number of positive samples in the summer season. This was also associated with the higher concentration presence of &gt;1000 CFU/L in the samples. Consequently, this study confirms that local hotel operators should improve their water safety and prevention plans, especially in spring and summer.</jats:p>"

Existing sustainability communication approaches encounter limitations such as a lack of standardised frameworks, information overload, greenwashing, and an absence of transparent reporting. These challenges hinder their effectiveness and reliability in communicating sustainability efforts and commitments to businesses and consumers in a food chain. Blockchain technology, with its transparent, traceable, verifiable, and immutable features, offers a promising solution to address these limitations and facilitate effective sustainability communication. This paper explores the benefits of applying blockchain traceability to enhance sustainability communication in food supply chains. Using the system architecture approach, this paper proposes a high-level architectural framework, which can navigate the design and development of a blockchain-enabled solution for food sustainability communication. To assist with the translation of the architectural framework into a tailored solution, this paper further presents an action design pathway and discusses the design considerations around organisation, technology, governance, cost, and the user interface. The discussions and insights offered by this study can guide system developers and business analysts in the design and development of industry-oriented solutions, helping them make informed decisions before and during the design process. This paper contributes to advancing and expanding blockchain applications with a particular focus on sustainability communication in food supply chains.</jats:p>"

The specific objectives are: identification and characterization of companies operating in automotive supply chains, defining changes in the automotive industry during the pandemic, showing the types of disruptions in supply chains and ways to counteract these unfavorable situations. Companies from the automotive industry operating in Poland were selected for the research purposefully. Using the random selection method, 500 companies from the automotive industry were selected for the study, which constituted a large research sample. According to estimates, there were about 2,000 in Poland. companies strictly focused on the automotive industry and several thousand with indirect connections, e.g. car repair shops. The data sources were surveys conducted in June 2023 among 500 enterprises in the form of a direct telephone interview. The main disruptions and problems in the supply chain were longer order execution times, increased costs of transport, storage and labour, as well as limited timeliness of deliveries. However, as a rule, disruptions lasted up to 1 year. One in ten enterprises declared that the disturbances are still ongoing. Half of the enterprises did not experience support from their partners in the supply chain. Despite this, 60% of enterprises did not seek or use alternative suppliers or buyers. The same share of enterprises made operational decisions during the pandemic, while ¼ made strategic decisions. The pandemic also did not affect radical changes in supply chains, such as resigning from Asian suppliers in favor of European ones.\n\n\nKeywords: Supply chains, COVID-19 pandemic, automotive industry.</jats:p>",

However, due to the complex nonlinear relationship between the water level of the front pool of the pumping station and the influencing factors, the prediction of the water level is still inaccurate and untimely. Backpropagation (BP) neural network, improved particle swarm optimization-BP neural network (PSO-BP), support vector machine regression (SVR), and improved PSO-SVR were used to construct 4-h and 8-h ahead prediction models for pumping station prestation water levels. Mean absolute error, mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R correlation coefficient were used as prediction evaluation metrics. This method is applied in the Baliwan Pumping Station, the highest pumping station in the South-to-North Water Diversion Eastern Route Project (SNWDERP). The results showed that the MSE, RMSE, and MAPE of the improved PSO-BP model were smaller than other models, whereas the R correlation coefficient was larger, confirming its high prediction accuracy.

The empirical results showed that both price fluctuations and Internet penetration affect people’s demand for green food, which in turn affects the development of the green food industry. The inhibitory effect of price fluctuation on green food industry is more obvious in the early stage of green food industry development, and Internet penetration always significantly promotes the development of green food industry. Moreover, the Internet penetration can effectively mitigate the negative impact of price fluctuation on the green food industry, and the impact becomes more significant with the increase of Internet penetration.

It has a small number of farmers, but they are major cocoa producers for cocoa manufacturing in the country. The cocoa supply chain in Thailand includes farmers, collectors, community enterprises, manufacturing, and exporters. The farmers are upstream in the cocoa supply chain. They have less negotiation power in the chain, causing limited distribution channels. The farmer sells cocoa beans through collectors or maybe intermediaries. Selling prices depend on cocoa pricing in the world market. Therefore, they need help increasing selling prices. However, another way to improve their revenue from cocoa planting is the increasing efficiency of their operations. This paper aims to study the waste in the cocoa supply chain. The area of study is Nan province in Thailand. The farmers of community enterprises in the Nan province of North Thailand, collectors, and manufacturers were selected as the sample frame. Farmers' data was collected through the questionnaire, and 66 community enterprise members were selected with purposive sampling. One collector and one manufacturer were interviewed through semi-structured interviews. Finally, a value stream mapping tool was used to analyze the manufacturing process. The value stream mapping analysis results found as follows. The value added activity (VA) count for 42.42% of all activities, taking 89.70% of all time in one cocoa's value chain cycle. However, as a result, it found that the number of necessary but non-value added (NNVA) for 48.48% and using time was 3.12% of the total time. non-value-added (NVA) activities in 9.09% of all activities. Therefore, dropping out of NVA activities and reducing the time of NNVA activities will increase the cycle speed of cocoa's supply chain.\n\n\nKeywords: Value stream mapping, Cocoa Supply Chain, Lean.</jats:p>",

The country, however, is not excused from water crises such as floods and water shortages. According to the National Water Services Commission (SPAN) data, Malaysia water consumption in year 2021 is 201 LCD and may encounter a water shortage crisis if the situation is not improved in the future. Rainwater harvesting (RWHS) has great potential in tackling water shortages. It can also combat water scarcity holistically and reduce dependency on treated water from dam reservoirs. RWHS is a sustainable alternative to tackle water crises with minimal environmental impact. Currently RWHS used for non-potable purposes like cleaning, toilet flushing, and irrigation. Due to the nature of the catchment area, there are several ways in which contaminants can enter the rainwater system and compromise the water quality. Elements such as topography, weather, and pollution sources, have a direct impact on the quality of rainwater that is collected and stored. In addition to the non-potable uses, RWH has been used for potable water in countries such as Australia and Bangladesh, but the total number of uses is still very small. For potable use, regular monitoring is required because it poses a health risk due to the presence of chemical, physical, and microbiological contaminants. If the water quality parameters meet the acceptable levels of water supply, harvested rainwater could be used for drinking purposes in many countries in the future. To ensure consistently good water quality, it is essential to establish standard operating procedures and maintenance schedules based on water safety plan approaches for both household and institutional users. This paper aims to review existing management guidelines and explore potential technologies for rainwater harvesting in buildings across Malaysia.</jats:p>",

In 2021, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed and demonstrated a system for testing power takeoffs (PTO) with a low-speed, high-torque dynamometer and a grid-tied high-power DC power source and sink before field deployment. The hydraulic dynamometer allows for the simulation of PTO actuation from wave motion and is capable of a wide range of wave periods and heights which are represented as various speeds and torques from the dynamometer. The high-power bidirectional power supply allows for hardware in the loop and controller in the loop testing to be conducted on WEC power electronics.

This study was carried out to provide the first data on the entomofauna and the ecological status of the water in Gagnoa's Drébot Lake. Sampling took place in February 2023 at 22 stations. Aquatic insects were collected using a turbid net (2.5 m2 of surface area sampled) and a Van Veen bucket (0.3 m2 of sediment per sample). Physico-chemical parameters were measured using a multiparameter. Spatial variations in physico-chemistry indicate that only transparency and depth varied significantly between sampling stations on Drébot Lake. The inventory revealed 317 insect individuals divided into 31 taxa, 19 families and 4 orders. The order Diptera (9 taxa) is the most diverse and the most abundant (141 individuals).Species richness is higher on the banks (28 taxa) than in open water (2 taxa).Predatory organisms dominate the trophic structure of the lake's insect population.The insect population was not very diversified, but balanced.

Despite the ubiquity and severity of these impacts, groundwater research has primarily focused on economic policy instruments for sustainable management or the quantification of groundwater depletion, rather than assessing the impacts of management decisions. In particular, how definitions of groundwater sustainability shape the fate of resource users remains unexplored. Here, we examine one of the world’s largest-scale environmental sustainability reforms, the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), and estimate the impact of sustainability definitions proposed in groundwater sustainability plans (GSPs) on well failure. We show that locally-proposed sustainability criteria are consistent with business as usual groundwater level decline, and if reached, could impact over 9000 domestic wells and around 1000 public supply wells. These findings highlight the necessity of careful and critical evaluation of locally-developed sustainability definitions and their implementation to prevent detrimental impacts, such as threats to household and municipal water supply.</jats:p>"

A resilient supply chain optimization model is developed based on a combination of proactive and reactive defense strategies, including manufacturer’s raw material mitigation inventory, preference for temporary distribution center locations, and product design changes, with the objective of obtaining maximum expected profit. The proposed stochastic planning model with demand uncertainty is approximated as a mixed integer linear programming model using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), sample average approximation (SAA), and scenario reduction (SR) methods. In addition, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) is also developed to determine the approximate optimal solution. The algorithm ensures the feasibility of the solution and improves the solving efficiency through specific heuristic repair strategies. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the application and advantages of the proposed disruption recovery model and approach. The experimental results show that the proposed resilient supply chain optimization model can effectively reduce the recovery cost of manufacturers after disruption, and the proposed approach performs well in dealing with related problems.</jats:p>"

This paper considers technology spillovers among manufacturers and develops a global supply chain network equilibrium model. Firstly, the optimal decision-making behaviors of manufacturers, retailers, and demand markets are characterized separately. Secondly, based on the variational inequality theory, the optimal decision-making behaviors of global supply chain members are transformed. Finally, the model is solved and analyzed using the Euler algorithm. The primary objective is to explore the impact of research and development (R&amp;D) subsidies and intellectual property protection (IPP) strategies on manufacturers’ research and development technological levels. Furthermore, the study delves into their effects on the production and transactions of the global supply chain network and social welfare. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) Technology spillovers have a positive effect on the technological level achieved by manufacturers through research and development investment and social welfare. However, intense technological competition may harm manufacturers’ profits. (2) Under the symmetric subsidy policy, higher subsidies may lead to a decrease in social welfare. (3) Under symmetric intellectual property protection policies, increasing the intensity of intellectual property protection benefits manufacturers but is detrimental to retailers and social welfare. However, under an asymmetric intellectual property protection strategy, implementing high-intensity intellectual property protection by high-technology countries is advantageous for retailers and social welfare. This conclusion has contributed to the technical research and development and production operation decision making of global supply chain members, as well as government policy formulation, and has also provided a new perspective for theoretical research in the field of global supply networks.</jats:p>"

Begging success of nestlings of different quality (i.e., body size) would also depend on food availability, and we here explore the effect of experimental food supply in begging success of nestlings and in provisioning of female hoopoes (Upupa epops), a species with extreme hatching asynchrony and nestlings size hierarchy. We video-recorded food allocation of females, begging success of nestlings of different size, and the social context (i.e., the size category of the other nestlings that were begging for food) during periods when experimental food supply was or was not available in the same nests. We found that when experimental food supplementation was present, begging success of the intermediate, but not that of large or small-sized nestlings, increased. The experiment, however, did not affect the feeding preferences of females toward nestlings of different size. Moreover, when small nestlings were the only ones that were begging for food, their begging success decreased in the experimental period, and females used supplemented prey to feed themselves. Those results, on one hand, confirm the importance of food availability for the begging success of nestlings of particular sizes and, on the other, indicate that females prefer to use extra food for their own rather than for the smallest nestlings. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining the detected experimental effects and the adaptive and nonadaptive explanations of mothers ignoring the small nestlings.</jats:p>",

Systems development life cycle by John Zachman, who explains seven steps for systems development by Hay (1997), which include: strategy, analysis, reactance theory, design, construction, documentation, transition and production. Objectives: This research aims to determine whether PADs affect the AA of EAA for SCM. In addition, the impact of the systems development life cycle is determined by the following factors: communication and common language, commitment, governance, scope and purpose, business-oriented and approach. Methodology: To provide statistical analysis of diagnostic tests and data analysis, a quantitative research design was adopted. A stratified random sample was considered for two parameters: information technology users, resource optimizers, risk takers, customer-centric approaches, and malleability. The sample was compressed to 310. For the first estimation, the linear regression model using IBM SPSS software version 26 was used. Results: The results showed that PADs have a negative impact on the AA of EAA as indicated by the negative-slope linear regression. However, personal perspectives such as techie, determinism, romanticism, and scepticism result in a negative bias. Findings: These results cannot be extrapolated to all SME owners and managers as they act on the basis of different characteristics such as: Information system components, internet connectivity and contextual information technology. Nonetheless, the modus operandi for mitigating negativity includes: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, social factors, system complexity, and social factors.\n\n\nKeywords: perceived attitudes and disquiets, enterprise application architecture, supply chain management, actual adoption, small and medium enterprises.</jats:p>",

In this context, the most successful companies have developed an integrated view of the Supply Chain to improve its efficiency. The realization of these objectives is achieved through adopting Supply Chain management methods and tools appropriate to their operations, with a view to continuous improvement through data analysis and forecasting. The difficulty lies in intercepting and organising data from disparate sources, multiple data sets provide incomplete information that inaccurately represents the performance and service levels received by suppliers and offered to customers, caused by the competitive nature of different companies in wanting to keep their information confidential. For this reason, this work proposes an ontological Supply Chain model with a governance element that enables the information exchange, preventing misreporting behaviour by different companies and optimising the parameters of the entire Supply Chain. In addition to the definition of all major incoming and outgoing information flows that characterise the relationships and performance of the Supply Chain actors as individual elements and as a whole.</jats:p>",

Large pelagic tunicates, for example, are likely to be favored over other types of macrozooplankton due to their filter‐feeding mode, which gives them access to small preys thought to be less affected by climate change than larger preys. In this study, we provide model‐based estimate of potential community changes in macrozooplankton composition and estimate for the first time their effects on benthic food supply and on the ocean carbon cycle under two 21st‐century climate‐change scenarios. Forced with output from an Earth System Model climate projections, our ocean biogeochemical model simulates a large reduction in macrozooplankton biomass in response to anthropogenic climate change, but shows that gelatinous macrozooplankton are less affected than nongelatinous macrozooplankton, with global biomass declines estimated at −2.8% and −3.5%, respectively, for every 1°C of warming. The inclusion of gelatinous macrozooplankon in our ocean biogeochemical model has a limited effect on anthropogenic carbon uptake in the 21st century, but impacts the projected decline in particulate organic matter fluxes in the deep ocean. In subtropical oligotrophic gyres, where gelatinous zooplankton dominate macrozooplankton, the decline in the amount of organic matter reaching the seafloor is reduced by a factor of 2 when gelatinous macrozooplankton are considered (−17.5% vs. −29.7% when gelatinous macrozooplankton are not considered, all for 2100 under RCP8.5). The shift to gelatinous macrozooplankton in the future ocean therefore buffers the decline in deep carbon fluxes and should be taken into account when assessing potential changes in deep carbon storage and the risks that deep ecosystems may face when confronted with a decline in their food source.</jats:p>",

The ability of the supply chain to provide safe food within a reasonable time after such a food safety threat or shock can be investigated with the concept of resilience using food safety as an indicator. Resilience is then defined as the food safety performance deviation due to the shock and takes both the severity of the shock as well as the time to fully recover or reach a new equilibrium into account. This study developed a stochastic simulation model to evaluate the resilience of the Dutch pork supply chain to dioxin contamination in the feed. The resilience of the supply chain as well as the potential costs associated with the contamination are compared between several monitoring strategies with the aim to determine the optimal control points for dioxin monitoring. Model results show that collecting and analyzing samples at more than one control point along the pork supply chain, in particular at feed mills and fat melting facilities, resulted in the highest resilience and the lowest costs after a shock. This model and these results can be used by public and private decision makers to make proactive and informed decisions on the monitoring strategies to control dioxins in the pork supply chain that result in optimal resilience to a dioxin crises.</jats:p>",

Our results show that no matter in bank or government-enterprise guarantee financing model, we can find the conditions for full coordination of the supply chain with any contract. However, in the government enterprise guarantee financing model, when a farmer has bankrupt risk in a low-yield season and no bankrupt risk in a high-yield season, the revenue-sharing contract can simultaneously make the supply chain fully coordinated and achieve Pareto improvement to maximize the profits of the entire supply chain and achieve a win-win situation.

The study applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) and radar chart to find out the disparity in awareness of economic student groups. The findings show that a minority of the economic students are aware main components of GSCM and sustainability and the important role of GSCM and sustainability in the future. There are significant differences in perception of various economic students (IB/BA, HM and MC) about GSCM and sustainability. The MC student body has the greatest level of consciousness of economic, environmental, and social issues. The energy of today's young people is crucial to the success of environmental programs tomorrow. The idea that sustainable environmental practices are beneficial for business is gaining traction.

Under the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, the communication technologies that support FTSs act as platforms for mass access to information with limited security. However, the integrity of the collected data is not immune to security attacks. This paper proposes a point-to-point information transmission path with no edges or access boundaries (no intermediaries) to transmit data with integrity. This route is possible thanks to the architectural articulation of a hardware device (sensor BIoTS) at the perception layer, with the Blockchain architecture at the application layer. This pairing makes an ecosystem with the ability to trace and certify in parallel the products, the supply chain processes, and the data recorded in it possible. The design of the security testing ecosystem is based on the theoretical and technical principles of cybersecurity. It is executed through mathematical models that define the probability of attacks’ success against the transmitted data’s integrity. The security tests performed allow for establishing that this BIoTS information transmission route is unlikely to suffer from transmission vulnerabilities and that it is not prone to security attacks against integrity. This work paves the way toward fully integrating Blockchain technology in dedicated IoT architectures.</jats:p>"

Methodology: This research examines five GSCM factors—internal environmental management, green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and environmental education—and three sustainability performance characteristics (economic, environmental, and social performance). Exploratory trials and a literature review on GSCM and sustainability performance lead to this model. Using a questionnaire, 534 participants provided primary data. Based on a structural equation model, SPSS and AMOS 22.0 analysed the data quantitatively and descriptively (SEM). Findings: GSCM affects sustainability performance differently. Green procurement affects economic, environmental, and social performance. Internal environmental management impacts environmental and social performance. Environmental education affects solely social performance. Green production and distribution do not affect sustainability. The results showed that universities must prioritise five areas—internal environmental management, green procurement, green production, green distribution, and environmental education—for the long-term development of the economy, environment, and society. Originality/Value: GSCM's impact on sustainability performance has been studied, however economic scholars don't know how it affects a company's sustainability. Economics majors will become entrepreneurs who grasp their role in company and economic progress. Economic students must understand the value of corporate social responsibility, community involvement, and environmentally responsible production to help firms, communities, and ecosystems succeed.\n\n\nKeywords: Economic student, green supply chain management, sustainability.</jats:p>",

Various resilience capabilities have been emphasized in the literature; however, limited research has linked them to resilience phases and cultural value orientations. Moreover, preparedness and adaption phases have hardly been studied. To address these gaps, we adopted middle‐range theory to investigate agri‐food supply chain (AFSC) resilience to the COVID‐19 crisis in a cross‐country setting. Data were collected from interviews with AFSC practitioners from China and Spain, followed by thematic and comparative analyses. The results indicate that frequently discussed resilience capabilities, such as collaboration, redundancy, flexibility, leadership, and innovation, were implemented across the preparedness, response and recovery, and adaption phases; however, successful AFSC recovery also depends on each country's cultural value orientations. A hierarchical cultural orientation generates sense‐making and collectiveness and further leads to synergy across all AFSC stakeholders, thereby contributing to AFSC response and recovery. Under an egalitarianism cultural orientation that places self‐interest ahead of group goals, organizations are encouraged to make decisions based on their own situational understanding, which contributes to their response and recovery. This study also provides theoretical contributions and managerial and policy implications.</jats:p>",

The performance of this system was examined using potato-process wastewater as a source of energy and nutrients (K, P, N) and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) as a hydroponic plant. The results showed that based on dry weight, the leaves of Allium tuberosum grew 142% more in the MFC-Hyp than those of the plant in the Hyp without the MFC, in a 49-day run. The mass fluxes of K, P, and NO3−-N from the MFC to the Hyp through the ceramic membrane were 4.18 ± 0.70, 3.78 ± 1.90, and 2.04 ± 0.98 µg s−1m−2, respectively. It was apparent that the diffusion of nutrients from wastewater in the MFC enhanced the plant growth in the Hyp. The MFC-Hyp in the presence of A. tuberosum produced the maximum power density of 130.2 ± 45.4 mW m−2. The findings of this study suggest that the MFC-Hyp system has great potential to be a “carbon-neutral” technology that could be transformed into an important part of a diversified worldwide energy–water–food supply system.</jats:p>"

The findings of the study revealed low supply levels of physical, human, and financial resources for implementing inclusive education in secondary schools. The extent of inclusive education implementation was also found to be low. The study further indicated that the supply of physical, human, and financial resources collectively affected policy implementation, with physical resources having a greater impact.

The main purpose of this paper is to design a two-echelon supply chain in a multi-cycle state and in conditions of demand uncertainty. The task includes determining the number and location of distribution centers, planning capacity for active distribution centers, and determining the amount of shipments between different levels so that the total costs of the chain are minimized. Uncertainty is applied through discrete scenarios in the model and the problem is formulated by multi-stage stochastic programming method in the form of a mixed integer linear model. The results acquired using two indicators called VMS and VSS demonstrated that modeling the supply chain design problem with the multi-stage stochastic approach can result in significant costs reduction. Plus, utilizing mathematical expectation can generate misleading results, therefore resulting in the development of supply chain designs incapable of satisfying demand due to its overlooked limitations.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a promising and proper data collaboration in the supply chain is of tremendous significance. Thus, the study’s main objective is to provide multiple objective programming models under uncertain conditions to assess the performance of suppliers. To meet that aim, a case study for the reliability assessment of the presented model is carried out. That section is associated with supply chain visibility (SCV). Likewise, the likelihood of unpredicted and undesirable incidents involving supply chain risk (SCR) is taken into consideration. The intimate relation between visibility and risk of the supply chain is deemed efficient for the performance of the supply chain. Incoherence in maximization and minimization of SCR and SCV and other factors, including costs, capacity, or demand, necessitates multiple objective programming models to assess suppliers’ performance to accomplish the before-mentioned aims. The study’s results indicate the high reliability of the proposed model. Besides, the numeral results reveal that decision-makers in selecting suppliers mainly decrease SCR and then attempt to enhance SCV. In conclusion, the provided model in the study can be a desirable model for analyzing and estimating supplier performance with SCR and SCV simultaneously.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain risk and uncertainty are critical factors that impact coal mining operations. Risks can arise from various sources such as natural disasters, supplier disruptions, market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and geopolitical uncertainties (Marzouk et al., 2022; Pettersen-Sobczyk, 2018). Managing these risks involves identifying, assessing, and implementing measures to mitigate and minimize potential losses. Uncertainties, on the other hand, stem from the lack of predictability or knowledge about future events and outcomes. They represent a level of unpredictability and the potential for surprises or unexpected events that can impact the supply chain. Overcoming uncertainties requires a resilient supply chain capable of preparing for unexpected events, responding to disruptions, and recovering from them while maintaining operational continuity (Adobor, 2020; Gunasekaran et al., 2015). Resilience capability allows a company to restore its operations to their original or desired state after being disturbed (Chowdhury &amp; Quaddus, 2017). However, despite the abundance of literature proposing resilience frameworks in supply chain management, their application within the context of coal mining remains relatively limited (Agrawal &amp; Pingle, 2020; Belhadi et al., 2022). Existing research in the field of coal mining has primarily focused on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and production optimization, with limited attention given to the concept of resilience. Therefore, this research aims to address this gap by developing a comprehensive resilience framework specifically tailored to the mining supply chain, with a focus on coal mining company. By incorporating the unique characteristics and challenges of the mining industry, such as geological uncertainties, complex extraction processes, and environmental regulations, this framework will provide valuable insights and strategies for enhancing the resilience capabilities of coal mining company.\n\n\nKeywords: Supply chain resilience, Coal mining, Disruptioin, Risk mitigation, Systematic literature review</jats:p>",

The power fault waveform patterns are initially analyzed based on the circuit's THD, current ripple value, and RMS value. The inductor current signals in different fault modes are then utilized to extract and construct time–frequency fusion fault features of the APFC power supply. Finally, these feature quantities are downscaled and optimized using the RF algorithm. The SOA‐KELM model of the APFC converter is proposed, and the feature vectors under different fault modes are used to classify and diagnose faults, achieving hard and soft fault detection of the converter. The experiments show that the method achieves 100% accuracy for hard fault diagnosis and 96.36% accuracy for soft fault diagnosis of the converter, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Remanufacturing is one of the ways forward for product recovery initiatives and for maintaining sufficient production flow to satisfy customer demand by providing high-quality goods with a combination of new and return parts through a circular economy. Recently, manufacturers have been progressively incorporating remanufacturing processes, making their supply chains vulnerable to disruptions. One of the main disruptions that occurs in remanufacturing systems is the shortage of spare parts supply, which results in unexpected delays in the remanufacturing process and could eventually result in a possible loss of sales. In the event of such potential disruptions, remanufacturing facilities must manage their supply chains in an effective and optimal manner such that the negative impact of disruptions to their business can be minimised. In this study, a two-stage production–inventory system was analysed by developing a cost-minimisation model that focuses on the recovery schedule after the occurrence of a disruption in sourcing spare parts for a remanufacturer’s production cycle. The developed model was solved using the branch-and-bound algorithm, where the experimental results demonstrated that the model provides effective solutions. Through numerical experiments, results indicated that the optimal recovery schedule and the number of recovery cycles are considerably dependent on the disruption time, lost sales and backorder costs. A sensitivity analysis showed that the lost sales option seems to be more effective than the backorder sales option in optimising the system’s overall cost due to unmet demand, which becomes lost sales when serviceable items are reduced, thereby shortening recovery time. Furthermore, a case study revealed that a manufacturer’s response to disruption is highly influenced by the spare part costs and overall recovery costs as well as the supplier’s readiness level. The proposed model could assist managers in deciding the optimal production strategy whilst providing interesting managerial insights into vital spare parts recovery issues when disruption strikes.</jats:p>"

As a result of the conducted analytical research, various types of influence of military operations on the water supply system of Ukraine were revealed. An increase in the level of surface water pollution has been established, in particular due to sunken military facilities and emissions of chemical substances as a result of shelling. Several impacts have been identified as potential threats, including flooding due to damage to dams, threats related to nuclear power plants, incidents of periodic flooding of underground mines, possible detonation of chlorine tanks in the area of wastewater treatment plants, and sea mine explosions in the Danube Delta. The results of the conducted research revealed that the quality of drinking water in the water supply systems of some settlements of Ukraine does not meet the hygienic requirements in terms of bacteriological, sanitary-chemical and radiation indicators. High concentrations of metals and their compounds entering the tissues of the body in the form of an aqueous solution pose a particular danger to the health of the population&#x0D;\nConclusion.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of an increase in P supply level on the agronomic, phenological, and physiological performance of two common bean breeding lines grown in acidic soil, with low fertility and under high temperature conditions, in a screenhouse. A randomized complete block (RCB) design was used under a factorial arrangement (five levels of P × 2 genotypes) for a total of 10 treatments with four replications. The factors considered in the experiment were: (i) five P supply levels (kg ha−1): four levels of P0, P15, P30, and P45 through the application of rock phosphate (RP), and one P level supplied through the application of organic matter (PSOM) corresponding to 25 kg P ha−1 (P25); and (ii) two advanced bean lines (BFS 10 and SEF10). Both bean lines were grown under the combined stress conditions of high temperatures (day and night maximum temperatures of 42.5 °C/31.1 °C, respectively) and acidic soil. By increasing the supply of P, a significant effect was found, indicating an increase in the growth and development of different vegetative organs, as well as physiological efficiency in photosynthesis and photosynthate remobilization, which resulted in higher grain yield in both bean lines evaluated (BFS 10 and SEF10). The adaptive responses of the two bean lines were found to be related to phenological adjustments (days to flowering and physiological maturity; stomatal development), as well as to heat dissipation strategies in the form of heat (NPQ) or unregulated energy (qN) that contributed to greater agronomic performance. We found that, to some extent, increased P supply alleviated the negative effects of high temperature on the growth and development of the reproductive organs of bean lines. Both bean lines (BFS 10 and SEF 10) showed adaptive attributes suited to the combined stress conditions of high temperature and acidic soil, and these two lines can serve as useful parents in a bean breeding program to develop multiple stress tolerant cultivars.</jats:p>"

In this context, the aim of this study is to assess the quality of water used for human consumption in the rural area of Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil. The study also examines the sanitation conditions that could lead to potential health risks for the population residing in these areas, due to water contamination. As a result, alternative collective supply solutions (ACS) and individual supply solutions (AIS) were analyzed, starting from water collection to storage at households. A total of 10 sampling points were used, comprising 5 cisterns and 5 water trucks. The physical and chemical analyses included: free and combined residual chlorine (FRC), turbidity, color, pH, electrical conductivity, and the presence of total coliforms and Escherichia coli. Subsequently, a product and process risk analysis was conducted using the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method, which enabled the identification and evaluation of key failure risks and their effects. The physicochemical and microbiological results demonstrated that the waters were unsuitable for human consumption at all collection points. Furthermore, the main hazards identified for the product (water), following the classification of risk priority levels, were the presence of E. coli, the presence of total coliforms, low concentration of FRC, high apparent color, and for the process, the absence of rechlorination in the water consumption reservoir. Ultimately, it was possible to diagnose the non-compliance of the waters from alternative supply solutions with Ministry of Health Ordinance No. 888 of 2021. Additionally, the risk analysis proved to be a highly efficient method for this supply method, successfully pinpointing the main vulnerabilities of these waters to contamination.</jats:p>"

Blockchain has the potential to improve the traceability and authenticity of the data provenance of wine products, increase consumer trust, and reduce fraud and errors. With these goals in mind, this study identifies the main research questions pertinent to the value proposition and competitive advantage of blockchain technology in the wine value chain and key players involved in the authentication and value chain recording. The PRISMA methodology was adopted to identify, screen and select only the relevant studies that were included in the analysis. This study also addresses the limitations and challenges for adoption, such as high implementation cost and lack of competences, and the need for standardized protocols and regulations. Finally, this systematic literature review includes an analysis of reports of blockchain applications in the wine sector and outlines the recommendations for future research to further explore the potential of blockchain-based solutions that could benefit all stakeholders across the wine value chain.</jats:p>"

The institutional and environmental factors influencing the clashes, associated effects on foodstuffs supply and demand, and the relevance of management options including modern cattle ranching were explored with the use of the descriptive research approach. The study employed well-structured questionnaire to collect data from 582 farmers in villages across the States. Findings of the study indicated that the farmers-herders clashes involving conflicts over land, water resources, and grazing continue to have significant effect on foodstuffs supply and demand in Nigeria. These have affected agricultural activities and the overall food production system in Nigeria. Addressing these clashes requires a holistic and multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration among government agencies, local communities, civil society organisations, and international partner through careful planning, community engagement, and focus on sustainability to ensure long-term benefits for both food production and economic development. The study therefore recommends Government active adoption of a bottom-top approach to policy decisions that facilitate dialogue and mediation between farmers and herders through engagement of community leaders, religious figures, and local authorities to hold the clashes at bay and sustainably increase foodstuffs supply and demand in Nigeria.

This included personal protective equipment for medical professionals and the general public. To address these shortages, online ‘maker communities’ emerged, aiming to develop and locally manufacture critical products. While some organized efforts existed, the majority of initiatives originated from individuals and groups on platforms like Thingiverse. This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of Thingiverse, one of the largest maker community websites, to examine the pandemic’s effects. Our findings reveal a surge in community output during the initial lockdown periods in major contributing nations (primarily those in the Western Hemisphere), followed by a subsequent decline. Additionally, throughout 2020, pandemic-related products dominated uploads and interactions during this period. Based on these observations, we propose recommendations to expedite the community’s ability to support local, national and international responses to future disasters.</jats:p>",

Although the current pathway to the target considers an increase in aviation demand following the COVID‐19 pandemic, emissions can be offset by the introduction of future technologies such as electric and hydrogen aircraft and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, the commercialization of these future technologies is uncertain. In this study, we explore the feasible pathways for achieving the 2050 target in Japan. Specifically, we compare non‐future technology pathways, such as improving fuel efficiency and controlling flight distance and aircraft lifespan, with future technology pathways, such as introducing SAF. The results showed that the non‐future technology pathway would require up to 27% suppression of cumulative flight distances by 2050 relative to the predicted flight distance if only improving fuel efficiency and controlling flight distance and aircraft lifetimes. Minimizing the cumulative cost of the target achievement is contingent upon maximizing fuel efficiency and aircraft life extension. Additionally, the target achievement requires switching domestic flights to railway transport and limiting international flights for leisure, as well as increasing fares by up to 48% to compensate for sale declines. If future technologies are not fully implemented, substantial social change will be required to achieve the target.</jats:p>",

However, the growth of solar electricity is creating both increased material demands and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from silicon and PV manufacturing (also referred to as embodied GHG emissions of solar electricity). Here we analyze the silicon and solar PV supply chain for the United States (U.S.) market and find that the embodied GHG emissions of solar PV panel materials (such as silicon), manufacture, logistics, and installation in the U.S. given the current supply chain are 36 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e kWh<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of solar electricity generated. Eighty-five percent of the embodied GHG emissions are from PV panel production processes in China and other Asia–Pacific countries. Moving the silicon and PV manufacturing to the U.S. would reduce the embodied GHG emissions of solar electricity by 16% from its current level, primarily because of the lower GHG emission intensity of the U.S. electrical grid and the lower GHG emissions for aluminum electrolysis in North America. Future scenario analysis shows that by 2030, with the U.S. PV domestic supply chain and its decarbonized grid electricity and aluminum production, as well as improving PV conversion efficiency, the embodied GHG emissions of solar electricity in the U.S. will be reduced to 21 g CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e kWh<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p>",

Given the above shortcomings, this paper proposes an improved carbon emission flow model considering electric vehicle charging fluctuations and hybrid power transactions. The model first considers different transaction modes, allocates the network loss to both sides of power generation, and forms a lossless network, realizing the decoupling of the bilateral transaction mode, pool transaction mode, and network loss and then calculating the day-ahead network’s carbon emission. Then, the changes in different transaction modes caused by the fluctuation in electric vehicle charging under different transaction modes are analyzed and the nodes of ‘spontaneous change’ are found to form a day-ahead intra-day deviation network and calculate its carbon emission flow. Finally, the calculation results are combined to obtain an improved power system carbon emission flow considering electric vehicle charging fluctuations and transaction modes. In this paper, the 33-node system is used for verification.</jats:p>"

Seasonal variation of self-supply water quality remains a key evidence gap in Indonesia and elsewhere; therefore, this study investigated the associations between seasonality and faecal contamination of groundwater self-supply in the Indonesian cities of Bekasi and Metro. The study demonstrated mixed results in terms of associations between seasonality and microbial water quality. McNemar's test showed that high concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) (≥100 MPN per 100 mL) were significantly more likely during the wet season than during the dry season in Bekasi (p = 0.050), but not in Metro (p = 0.694). There was no statistically significant association between the season and the presence of E. coli in self-supply sources for both study sites, nor was there a significant association between the season and the presence of high concentrations of E. coli at the point-of-use. At both study sites, presence and high concentrations of E. coli during the dry season significantly increased the risk of contamination in the wet season, but the predictive power was weak. Regular water quality testing complemented by sanitary inspection is required to understand the contamination risks of self-supply sources.</jats:p>",

SMEs are beginning to adopt such technologies for their competitive advantages and the required sustainability in the manufacturing supply chain. AICs may help in accomplishing supply chain visibility (SCV) to enhance sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). Innovation capability (IC) is also due to disruptive technologies being adopted by SMEs. The present research investigates the role of AICs in SCV and IC, which lead to SSCP, by employing structural equation modeling (SEM). An empirical study based on dynamic capability (DC) theory was carried out using 246 responses, and later Smart PLS-4.0 was used for SEM. The analysis revealed that AICs positively influence SCV and IC to support SSCP. SCV and IC also partially mediate the relationship between the adoption of AICs and SSCP.</jats:p>"

Both soil type and aggregate structure affect the P sorption capacity of soil; thus, determining soil P supply and leaching characteristics. However, the mechanism of their interactions on soil P sorption and leaching at an aggregate level remains unclear. We classified soil aggregates from red soils and limestone soils in a subtropical forest via wet-sieving and carried out P isothermal sorption experiments. The P sorption maximum (Qm), P sorption strength (KL, KF), P sorption index (PSI) and maximum buffer capacity (MBC) were obtained by fitting to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. Moreover, different P fractions were determined to estimate the degree of P sorption saturation (DPS) of aggregates. The results showed that the Qm of the two soils were similar, but the sorption strength (KL, KF) and MBC of the limestone soil were higher than those of the red soil. Higher contents of free iron (Fe) oxide and amorphous aluminum (Al) oxide in the limestone soil may enhance the P sorption capacity and, thus, reduce P availability, resulting in a higher total P retention capacity than in the red soil. A higher content of complex Fe in red soil may reduce P sorption and, therefore, play a role in maintaining the supply capacity of soil-available P. The 0.25–0.5 mm aggregates of the two soils had the largest MBC among all aggregate sizes, and their P sorption and buffering capacity were stronger than other aggregates. The DPS of different aggregate sizes were all low, indicating that the soils of subtropical forests were in a state of P deficiency; thus, the risk of P leaching was low. The &lt;0.1 mm aggregate in red soil had relatively high DPS and significantly lower PSI than the other aggregate sizes, indicating that it was more prone to P leaching.

As a source of raw material for soy sauce, the industry ensures that the black soybean supply chain is sustainable and can meet production requirements in quality and quantity. This research aims to trace the product and supply chain of sustainable black soybeans as raw materials for soy sauce. The selection of data sources or informants in this study in Indonesia comprised 122 farmer groups that assisted or collaborated with cooperatives that sent black soybeans to be used as raw materials for making soy sauce; 1 field assistant; and 4 cooperatives that collaborated with the industry. The data collection techniques used in this study were observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The types of documentation were research notes based on interview guides, research photos, and official institutional documents. The data analysis method used in this study was a qualitative approach with the help of QSR NVivo version 12 Plus software. The results of this study show that traceability in production is necessary to maintain safety, quality, and sustainability. Product traceability requires a monitoring system and regulations established by the industry that all stakeholders must follow, starting with farmer groups and cooperatives that supply raw materials to the industry. A good monitoring system places employees from the industry as agricultural assistants. As such, it will also determine the sustainability of the economic, social, environmental, technological, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions. Traceability in the production of black soybeans used as raw materials for making soy sauce, namely those of the Mallika variety that are round/whole and unbroken, will be accepted by the industry. The process carried out by farmer groups from planting to harvesting black soybeans is controlled by agricultural assistants and follows regulations set by the industry. The cooperative lends black soybean seeds to grade-A-seed-quality farmer groups. The farmer group repays the loan at harvest time and returns it to the cooperative in cash sums of 10,000 IDR/kg.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advent of the novel coronavirus, also called COVID-19, caused widespread disruptions worldwide. This unprecedented health crisis led to major disruptions in supply chain networks; therefore, innovative strategies and capabilities have the potential to alleviate its impacts. Considering this situation, this study examined how COVID-19 impacted management innovation, the information processing capability, business model innovation, knowledge management capability, and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) in Pakistan. To test hypotheses, data were collected from companies in Pakistan engaged in supply chain management or supply chain departments within manufacturing companies, and investigations were carried out employing structural equation modeling. Based on empirical results, COVID-19 outbreaks negatively impacted SSCP, but not management innovation, information processing capability, business model innovation, or the knowledge management capability. Additionally, COVID-19 and SSCP are mediated by management innovation, the processing capability, business model innovation, and the knowledge management capability. By underlining the significance of the resource-based view, dynamic capability, and organizational information processing theories, this research contributes to the body of knowledge on sustainable supply chains. The conceptual model presented in this research may be used in supply chain (SC) and logistics management to reduce COVID-19 disruptions in SC operations and boost profitability during a pandemic.</jats:p>"

Researching the driving mechanism of multi-level indicators of urbanization on the supply and demand of ESs can enhance our understanding of the ecological and environmental impacts of urbanization. This study investigates the driving mechanisms underlying the relationship between urbanization and the supply–demand dynamics of ecosystem services (ESs) in the Yangtze River Middle Reaches Urban Agglomeration (YRMRUA). First, we assessed the variation in the key ESs (food production, carbon storage, and culture service) from 2000 to 2019 at both city and provincial levels. Second, ES demand and the supply–demand index (SDI) were calculated utilizing socioeconomic indicators. The Geographical Detector model was applied to analyze the individual and combined effects of urbanization on the supply and SDI of ESs. The results showed that an increase in areas of supply and demand was unbalanced in the YRMRUA from 2000 to 2019, with a predominant concentration observed in the provincial capital cities. Scale urbanization exhibits the most substantial influence on the SDI, with a q-value of 0.6, while land urbanization exerts the most pronounced effect on ES supply, with a q-value of 0.7. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the combined effect of urbanization on ESs surpasses the individual effect, with q-values exceeding 0.5. The interaction between scale urbanization and other indicators has the greatest impact on the SDI of carbon storage. Population and economic urbanization exhibit a more substantial impact on food production and cultural service compared to other primary indicators. Simultaneously, the joint effects of secondary indicators between per capita living area and per capita road area have a greater impact on ES supply than other secondary indicators. These findings illustrate that urbanization indicators are not independent of each other, but have a combined effect. Furthermore, the urbanization process in the YRMRUA has exhibited a gradual deceleration, leading to a diminishing influence on ESs. This study can contribute to the comprehension of urbanization and ESs when dealing with the conflict between urban development and ecological sustainability.</jats:p>"

It provides time series of electricity demand and supply from wind, solar photovoltaic and hydropower, and can be used for recent trends analysis, seasonal outlooks or the assessment of climate change impacts on energy mixes in the long term. This article introduces this service and the resulting dataset, with a focus on the design and validation of the energy conversion models, based on ENTSO‐E energy data and the ERA5 climate reanalysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The degree of coordination between the supply and demand for urban green spaces serves as a vital metric for evaluating urban ecological development and the well-being of residents. An essential principle in assessing this coordination is the precise quantification of both the demand and supply of green spaces, as well as the differential representation of their spatiotemporal structures. This study utilizes the entropy weight method (EWM) and principal component analysis (PCA) to comprehensively measure supply indicators for green space quantity and quality in the central urban area of Shenyang, China. To establish reliable and quantifiable demand indicators, mobile signaling spatial-temporal data are corrected by incorporating static population cross-sectional data. The Gaussian two-step floating catchment area method (Ga2SFCA) is employed to calculate the accessibility of green spaces in each community with ArcGIS 10.2 software, while the Gini coefficient is utilized to assess the equity of green space distribution within the study area. This study employs location entropy to determine the levels of supply and demand for green spaces in each subdistrict. Furthermore, the priority of community-scale green space regulation is accurately determined by balancing vulnerable areas of green space supply and replenishing green space resources for the ageing population. The findings suggest a Gini coefficient of 0.58 for the supply and demand of green spaces in Shenyang’s central metropolitan region, indicating a relatively low level of equalization in overall green space allocation. Based on location entropy, the classification of supply and demand at the street level yields the following outcomes: balanced areas comprise 21.98%, imbalanced areas account for 26.37%, and highly imbalanced regions represent 51.65%. After eliminating the balanced regions, the distribution of the elderly population is factored in, highlighting the spatial distribution and proportions of communities with distinct regulatory priorities: Level 1 (S1) constitutes 7.4%, Level 2 (S2) accounts for 60.9%, and Level 3 (S3) represents 31.7%. Notably, the communities in the S1 category exhibit spatial distribution characteristics of aggregation within the inner ring and the northern parts of the third ring. This precise identification of areas requiring urgent regulation and the spatial distribution of typical communities can provide reliable suggestions for prioritizing green space planning in an age-friendly city.</jats:p>"

Recent research has shown that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithms, in particularly data driven Bayesian Network (BN) models, are very suitable as a tool to predict future food fraud and hence allowing food producers to take proper actions to avoid that such problems occur. Such models become even more powerful when data can be used from all actors in the supply chain, but data sharing is hampered by different interests, data security and data privacy. Federated learning (FL) may circumvent these issues as demonstrated in various areas of the life sciences. In this research, we demonstrate the potential of the FL technology for food fraud using a data driven BN, integrating data from different data owners without the data leaving the database of the data owners. To this end, a framework was constructed consisting of three geographically different data stations hosting different datasets on food fraud. Using this framework, a BN algorithm was implemented that was trained on the data of different data stations while the data remained at its physical location abiding by privacy principles. We demonstrated the applicability of the federated BN in food fraud and anticipate that such framework may support stakeholders in the food supply chain for better decision-making regarding food fraud control while still preserving the privacy and confidentiality nature of these data.</jats:p>"

However, if the DO is implemented in regional DES, uncertainties are emerged caused by the complex interest interaction between the seller and the buyer groups formed by the biogas plant and the DES’s dispatching center, thus making the development trend of DO unknown. In this context, this study explored the diffusion law of DO in regional DES by establishing a mathematical model based on an evolutionary game between the two major stakeholders, during which the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) was deduced for understanding their strategy selections, and then the dynamic diffusion trend was simulated by the system dynamics via a case example. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of parameters is carried out and the optimal policy instruments are proposed according to the main influencing factors. The study revealed that when the DES can realize monetized returns from socio-environmental benefits, the adoption of DO becomes more feasible. Importantly, the revenue generated from electricity sales, by the dispatching center when they do not utilize biogas, emerged as the most critical parameter influencing the ultimate outcomes. The limitations of this research and modeling are discussed to lay a foundation for further improvement.</jats:p>"

In Burkina Faso and Mali, we worked in 24 primary health care centers per country, whereas in Nigeria and Palestine, we focused on 26 primary schools per country. Facilities were eligible if they were not connected to a functioning water source but were deemed accessible to the implementation partners. Moreover, health care centers were eligible if they had a maternity ward and ≥5 employees, and schools if they had ≤7000 students studying in grades 5 to 7. We used covariate-constrained randomization to assign intervention facilities that received a hardware, management and monitoring support, and behavior change. Control facilities will receive the same or improved intervention after endline data collection. To evaluate the intervention, at baseline and endline, we used a self-reported survey, structured handwashing observations, and hand-rinse samples. At follow-up, hand-rinse samples were dropped. Starting from the intervention implementation, we collected longitudinal data on hygiene-related health conditions and absenteeism. We also collected qualitative data with focus group discussions and interviews. Data were analyzed descriptively and with random effect regression models with the random effect at a cluster level. The primary outcome for health centers is the handwashing rate, defined as the number of times health care workers performed good handwashing practice with soap or alcohol-based handrub at one of the World Health Organization 5 moments for hand hygiene, divided by the number of moments for hand hygiene that presented themselves during the patient interaction within an hour of observation.

Considering big-data marketing, we examine the sales mode selection in a platform-based supply chain based on the strategic interaction between the business mode decision and store brand decision. By continuous dynamic game theory, the strategies and performance under different modes are solved. We find that given the store brand (SB) decision, the business mode adopted by the manufacturer depends only on the commission rate, which is high for reselling and low for agency selling. Given the business mode, under reselling, whether the platform introduces SB depends only on the brand preference, i.e., SB is introduced when the preference for NB is low. While under agency, he introduces SB in the general or relatively passive situation, depending both on the commission rate and the brand preference. In addition, four equilibrium sales modes are obtained based on the strategic interaction. In order to achieve a win-win-win situation in profitability among the manufacturer, the platform and the platform-based supply chain, the manufacturer should adopt agency selling and the platform forgoes introducing SB when both the commission rates and NB preference are low.</jats:p>",

A field experiment was conducted during the 2021 peanut growing season at Urumqi, Xinjiang, in Northwestern China, to evaluate the effects of different water and nitrogen treatments on the growth, yield, and water and nitrogen utilization of peanuts. In field experiments, we set up three irrigation levels (irrigation water quotas of 22.5, 30, and 37.5 mm, respectively, for W1, W2, and W3), two nitrogen application levels (77.5 and 110 kg·ha−1, recorded as N1 and N2), and a control treatment (W2N0) that did not include the application of nitrogen. The results showed that nitrogen application enhanced the growth, physiological indexes, yield, and water use efficiency of the W1, W2, and W3 treatments when the irrigation volume remained the same. In comparison with no nitrogen application (W2N0), the peanut growth, physiological indexes, yield, and water use efficiency improved with increasing irrigation amounts in the N1 and N2 treatments. With an increase in the irrigation volume, the water use efficiency grew; the W3N2 treatment had the highest water use efficiency, which was 1.32 kg·m−3. The total water consumption and reproductive-stage water consumption of the peanuts in all treatments increased with the irrigation volume, and a high yield was achieved at 402.57 mm, which was 5.2974 Mg·ha−1. In the W1, W2, and W3 treatments, the nitrogen partial factor productivity significantly decreased as the nitrogen application increased, with the nitrogen partial factor productivity in the W3N1 treatment being the highest, at 60.61 kg·kg−1. A comprehensive evaluation based on principal component analysis assigned W3N2 the higher score. These findings suggest that irrigation water quotas of 37.5 mm should be coupled with 110 kg·ha−1 nitrogen applications for peanuts using drip irrigation in mulch film in Xinjiang.</jats:p>"

After analyzing archival data that did not enter scientific circulation, it was found that until mid-1960, a number of difficulties arose in the system of equipping the population of Kentau.First of all, emphasis was placed on the development of production based on raw materials, and domestic and social problems of the population were pushed to later places. In the daily life of the townspeople, the practice of sewing clothes with their own hands, making household furniture necessary for life, and building individual housing on their own has become widespread. Only after the \"Temirtau incident\", which shook the Soviet Union, the tense domestic problems of the newly emerging industrial cities in the country were positively resolved and began to be equipped according to a centralized system. In the period from 1970 to 1987, the production capacity of the main city – forming enterprise-the Aschysai polymetallic plant increased, turning from a cost-effective enterprise into a \"profitable\" one. Every year, the increase in wages and incomes of workers working in production facilities led to an increase in the well-being of the population.

Ғылыми айналымға енбеген мұрағаттық деректерді талдай келе, 1960 жылдың ортасына дейін Кентау қаласы тұрғындарын жабдықтау жүйесінде бірқатар қиындықтар туындағаны анықталды. Бірінші кезекте шикізатқа негізделген өндірісті дамытуға баса мән беріліп, халықтың тұрмыстық және әлеуметтік мәселелері кейінгі орындарға ығыстырылды. Қала тұрғындарының күнделікті өмірінде өз қолдарымен киім-кешек тігу, тұрмысқа қажетті үй жиһаздарын жасау, өз күшімен жеке тұрғын үй салу тәжірибесі кең тарады.

Анализируя архивные данные, не вошедшие в научный оборот, установлено, что до середины 1960 года в системе снабжения населения города Кентау возник ряд трудностей. Особое внимание уделялось развитию сырьевых производств, на последующие места выдвигались бытовые и социальные проблемы населения. В повседневной жизни горожан широко распространена практика пошива одежды своими руками, изготовления домашней мебели и др. Только после «Темиртауского события», потрясшего вес Советский Союз, напряженные бытовые проблемы вновь возводимых индустриальных городов страны, стали решаться положительно. В период с 1970 по 1987 год производственные мощности главного градообразующего предприятия – Ащысайского полиметаллического завода увеличились, превратившись из рентабельного предприятия в \"прибыльное\". С каждым годом повышение заработной платы и доходов работников, занятых на производственных объектах, приводило к росту благосостояния населения.

The fixing of costs during the early design stage, leads to the necessity of a precise evaluation of the systems efficiency within this phase. Conducting statistic-based calculations can be inadequate due to the time-dependent behavior of the battery. Moreover, idealized temporal data is often utilized for the design of battery supported ships. Therefore, this paper discusses the consequential inaccuracies using statistical or smoothed data. But also examines the potential of an advanced in-house developed statistical approach. For the examination, an internal developed method for dimensioning hybrid ship power systems is used. The paper shows that conducting statistical calculations lead to incorrect modeling of battery behavior, while smoothed power time-series can result in an overestimation of the battery lifetime (up to 21% less charge cycles). </jats:p>",

During the baseline period (dry season before the 2015 Gorkha earthquake), the average water consumption was 91 litre/capita/day (LPCD) but there was a regional disparity in water consumption, ranging from 16 to 158 LPCD. The statistical analysis indicated that households using many water sources consumed more water regardless of the supply area even in an emergency. In addition, households with many family members used less water per person. During emergencies, households participating in the local community were found to consume more water than households not participating in the community, especially when the water being used was managed by the community.</jats:p>",

Today, the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation uses mainly imported fossil fuels for heat generation, most of which (with the exception of coal and wood in some places) are delivered from other regions of Russia, which is associated with great financial difficulties and complicated logistics of fuel delivery to consumers. On the example of Teriberka settlement, located in the Murmansk region on the coast of the Barents Sea, it is shown that one of the solutions to these problems can be the use of wind turbines for heat supply needs together with the local boiler house, operating on organic fuel. The main effect from the use of wind power plants is expressed in the reduction of the boiler house participation in covering the heating load schedule of Teriberka settlement by 7580% and, accordingly, by the same amount in saving fossil fuel consumed at the boiler house, as well as in reducing the negative impact on the natural environment.</jats:p>"

To improve the accuracy of the identification of crop diseases under conditions of limited computing resources, such as in mobile and edge computing, we propose an improved lightweight MobileNetV2 crop disease identification model. In this study, MobileNetV2 is used as the backbone network for the application of an improved Bottleneck structure. First, the number of operation channels is reduced using point-by-point convolution, the number of parameters of the model is reduced, and the re-parameterized multilayer perceptron (RepMLP) module is introduced; the latter can capture long-distance dependencies between features and obtain local <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> information to enhance the global perception of the model. Second, the efficient channel-attention mechanism is added to adjust the image-feature channel weights so as to improve the recognition accuracy of the model, and the Hardswish activation function is introduced instead of the ReLU6 activation function to further improve performance. The final experimental results show that the improved MobilNetV2 model achieves 99.53% accuracy in the PlantVillage crop disease dataset, which is 0.3% higher than the original model, and the number of covariates is only 0.9M, which is 59% less than the original model. Also, the inference speed is improved by 8.5% over the original model. The crop disease identification method proposed in this article provides a reference for deployment and application on edge and mobile devices.</jats:p>"

However, despite rapid advances in tools and methods to convert data into useful information about impacts and policy effectiveness, and their implementation for decision-making is lagging. There is an urgent need to examine such demand-led action and understand how to accelerate progress towards agricultural supply chain sustainability. Here, we explore how demand-side actors within globalized supply chains see limitations in knowledge and barriers to progress in the context of forest-risk commodities. We draw from 20 semi-structured interviews and two focus group discussions with manufacturers, retailers, NGOs, and data providers. Our findings show that civil society pressure in consumer regions is perceived as a key driver guiding action, that certification is commonly sought to reduce detrimental impacts, but that collaboration to tackle systemic issues remains a gap.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because they are environmentally friendly and safe, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are increasingly used in newly constructed automated container terminals. However, their scheduling strategy is constrained by their limited battery capacity. When batteries reach their charging threshold, the AGVs need to be returned to battery-swapping stations. Moreover, the movement speed of AGVs has a significant impact on their energy consumption and operating times. Therefore, in this paper, a speed control strategy that considers the traffic environment of the terminal is proposed from the perspective of energy conservation and emission reduction. In addition, the charging capacity of the terminal is discretized to model its limited handling capacity to avoid congestion in the battery-swapping stations. To minimize the costs of delays and carbon emissions of AGV operations, a mixed integer programming model is established. It optimizes the efficiency and carbon emissions of the operations by assigning and prioritizing container transportation and AGV battery-swapping tasks. An improved genetic algorithm-based approach is designed where a better initial solution is obtained through a greedy strategy, while simulated annealing is adopted for population selection to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optima. Furthermore, an adaptive adjustment strategy for crossover and mutation probabilities is adopted to improve the algorithm’s convergence. Finally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that considering the variability of AGV speed can more accurately characterize their energy consumption, and increasing the number of AGVs and enhancing the battery-swapping capacity can effectively reduce the costs of delays and carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

The rapid expansion of Short-Term Rental (STR) platforms has led to new challenges for policy regulation. The main objective of this paper is to shed some light on current conflicts surrounding the regulation of STR. The body of literature on this topic mainly focuses on the increasing substitution of sharing economy by commercial hosts. By contrast, we explain that the ideological notion of host hinders the understanding of the supply-side structure. A critical approach (as critique of ideology and ideological categories) should entail a class perspective based on rent theory and engage with critical works on platform capitalism. In this article, we propose an innovative analytical approach to STR supply-side supported by rent theory, which focuses on the relationship of agents with land and technology ownership and specialised management services, as these are forms of rent appropriation. From this point of view, these supply-side agents are not hosts, but class factions with common and competing economic interests in rent appropriation. Therefore, they can employ a variety of strategies to influence the political regulation of STRs. Based on in-depth interviews with landlords, individual managers, and corporate agencies in Andalusia (Southern Spain), we show the conflicting internal structure behind the ideological notion of host and even professionalisation. </jats:p>",

The platform supply chain has been continuously optimized and upgraded. Supply chain leaders have moved downstream to the end of the supply chain. The operational value has been further enhanced. The corresponding systematic construction of the platform supply chain has become an important driving force for future development. The model in this paper is different from the traditional supply chain contract model, which mainly focuses on suppliers or demand. In order to meet the requirements of fresh-keeping services and the goal of revenue sharing, we integrate the production and circulation characteristics of fresh produce into the design of a contract model. In this paper, a revenue-sharing contract model of the fresh produce supply chain is constructed based on the core position of retailers, the uncertainty of the market size, and the consideration of a fresh-keeping service. The model is mainly composed of the core retailer and the supplier. Through further numerical analysis, we verify the effectiveness of the revenue-sharing contract model in supply chain coordination. We also analyze the change trends in the optimal retail price, optimal freshness level, and optimal order quantity caused by changes in both the fresh-keeping service capacity and the revenue-sharing coefficient. The results show that after changing these two parameters, the supply chain can achieve coordination under the specified parameter values. The changed parameters will also lead to certain change trends in the optimal retail price, optimal freshness level, and optimal order quantity, and will have a corresponding impact on the stability of supply chain operation. This research provides a relevant theoretical and empirical basis for a fresh produce supply chain contract model with retailers at the core position. We also provide guidance and reference for optimizing the supply chain management mode and improving the overall operational efficiency of the fresh produce supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, the current groundwater level prediction model is insufficient to consider the spatio-temporal factors of the groundwater level and the autocorrelation of spatio-temporal series, particularly the lack of consideration of hydrogeological conditions in the actual study area. Thus, this study constructed a model based on the hydrogeological conditions and the spatio-temporal characteristics of the dynamic monitoring data of groundwater in the porous confined aquifer III in Nantong, the northern wing of the Yangtze River Delta, China. The spatial autocorrelation coefficient of the hydrogeology important parameter, permeability coefficient K, is used to optimize the distance weighting coefficient of monitoring wells obtained by the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and then reconstruct the spatio-temporal dataset and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. A spatio-temporal groundwater level prediction model LSTM-K-KNN that introduces the spatial autocorrelation of hydrogeological parameters was constructed. The reliability and accuracy of LSTM-K-KNN, LSTM, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and support vector machine (SVM) were evaluated by a cross-validation algorithm.

The ability to effectively distribute resources—such as raw materials, labor, equipment, and financial investments—directly impacts production efficiency, cost management, and supply chain resilience. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes findings from 75 peer-reviewed research papers, industry reports, and case studies to examine the impact of resource allocation efficiency on supply chain operations. The study explores how strategic resource distribution enhances production workflow, minimizes operational disruptions, and improves financial performance in a highly competitive and globalized industry. Key themes include the integration of digital technologies, lean manufacturing principles, sustainable resource utilization, and supply chain agility. Findings indicate that companies that implement structured resource allocation strategies, supported by automation and AI-driven forecasting tools, achieve greater operational efficiency, cost savings, and supply chain adaptability. Moreover, the study highlights major challenges faced by the industry, such as geopolitical risks, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and the bullwhip effect, which often lead to resource mismanagement and inefficiencies. The results also emphasize the growing importance of sustainability in resource allocation, as environmentally responsible practices contribute to cost reduction and long-term industry viability. The study concludes that firms that prioritize efficient resource allocation through advanced planning, real-time decision-making, and supply chain optimization can achieve a significant competitive advantage in the global textile and apparel sector. These insights provide valuable recommendations for supply chain managers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders aiming to improve resource allocation efficiency and enhance overall supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

(4) Precipitation and NDVI are the main elements determining the supply of ecosystem services. While GDP and population density have a significant impact on the demand for ecosystem services, natural causes are primarily responsible for trade-offs in ecosystem services. This study aims to evaluate the supply–demand relationship and driving factors of multiple scale in the Qinling–Daba Mountains, providing a scientific basis for the sustainable management of ecosystems in the region.</jats:p>"

Se utilizó una metodología mixta. Por un lado, con la cualitativa se llevaron a cabo entrevistas semiestructuradas a informantes claves y ciudadanos; por el otro, con la cuantitativa, se aplicó una encuesta. Con los resultados se encontró que existe desorganización para atender asuntos de agua; hay falta de interés en el tema del agua; el agua es un negocio para ciudadanos que tienen pozos y para revendedores que la comercializan en otras comunidades. Los resultados también muestran que el 98 % de los encuestados considera que en la comunidad hay escasez de agua; sin embargo, de acuerdo con datos de la Estación Climatológica 00012053 de la Comisión Nacional del Agua, Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, la precipitación pluvial anual promedio en la zona es de 1 200.9 mm (Conagua &amp; SMN, 2022). Se concluye que los subsistemas social, político-administrativo y cultural son los que mejor describen que el desabasto de agua en la comunidad se debe a la carencia de organización comunitaria; la ausencia de aplicación de acciones de los gobiernos y el sistema operador del agua, así como a los hábitos de consumo. Los subsistemas tecnológico y económico también explican que hay desabasto de agua por la falta de mantenimiento de las redes de distribución de agua y por el comercio del agua.</jats:p>"

Recent studies indicate that collateral blood supply by cerebral arterial anastomoses has an essential role in the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion. However, the physiological importance of these multiscale morphological properties—and especially of intermediate anastomoses—is poorly understood because of innate structural complexities. In this study, a computational model of multiscale anastomoses in whole-brain-scale cerebral arterial networks was developed and used to evaluate collateral blood supply by anastomoses during middle cerebral artery occlusion. Morphologically validated cerebral arterial networks were constructed by combining medical imaging data and mathematical modeling. Sparse intermediate anastomoses were assigned between adjacent main arterial branches; the pial arterial network was modeled as a dense network structure. Blood flow distributions in the arterial network during middle cerebral artery occlusion simulations were computed. Collateral blood supply by intermediate anastomoses increased sharply with increasing numbers of anastomoses and provided one-order-higher flow recoveries to the occluded region (15%–30%) compared with simulations using a pial network only, even with a small number of intermediate anastomoses (≤10). These findings demonstrate the importance of sparse intermediate anastomoses, which are generally considered redundant structures in cerebral infarction, and provide insights into the physiological significance of the multiscale properties of arterial anastomoses.</jats:p>"

However, despite the growing importance of this integration model in the market, there are still numerous unresolved issues from a supply chain perspective, and existing research provides relatively limited guidance on the effective operation of this integrated supply chain model. To address this gap in theoretical research, this study first delves into the essence and fundamental characteristics of sustainable cross-border agricultural product supply chains in the context of live streaming. Secondly, employing grounded theory as the primary research method and combining platform theory and ecosystem theory, an influencing factor system and an impact model for the development of sustainable cross-border agricultural product supply chains in the context of live streaming are constructed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complexity of this integrated supply chain model. Finally, from the perspectives of government agencies and practitioners, development pathways for sustainable cross-border agricultural product supply chains in the context of live-streaming e-commerce are proposed, aiming to enhance existing research and provide decision-making support for relevant stakeholders in formulating development strategies. The findings of this study contribute to expanding the research perspective on the ecosystem of live-streaming e-commerce and sustainable cross-border agricultural product supply chains, providing theoretical support for the establishment and operation of sustainable cross-border agricultural product supply chains in the context of live streaming. Additionally, it offers important references for promoting the sustainable development of live-streaming e-commerce and cross-border agricultural product supply chains, facilitating industry upgrading, global agricultural trade, and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research is about, “The innovation of new dry ports in Zimbabwe: the Critical Success Factors (CSF) and fault lines.” Zimbabwe wanted to start four new dry ports across the country and researchers wanted to help by carrying out research on critical success factors to make these dry ports a success, based on success stories elsewhere, and avoid having another white elephant or disappointment. Researchers used the survey questionnaire method as well as face to face interviews, expert panel interviews at universities, observation and literature review in this research. Findings revealed that dry ports required total connectivity to strategic national institutions and corporates like warehouses, bonded warehouses, airports, Ministries, roads, Customs and Excise Department and railways, and these must all fully embrace e-government/smart supply chain and be strategically linked to all importers and exporters as well as critical trade and related government departments. This is a new concept in Zimbabwe but quite old elsewhere. Systems and institutions have improved a lot but still needed further improvement in Zimbabwe to march SADC/COMESA competitors like South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Mozambique. It was found that critical skills, ports, Customs and investment infrastructure in Zimbabwe needed to be improved as well as processing and turnaround time to match best practices in SADC/COMESA and globally. A One Stop Shop for investment was there but not fully operationalised to cover all transactions, is about partly operational. Delayed deliveries and wrong documentation were experienced sometimes due to port and Customs delays or transport and loading delays. Zimbabwe had made great strides no doubt and was marching on for stardom and big achievements. This paper is futuristic and will be mostly based on best practices globally which Zimbabwe can learn from and start successful dry ports that really add value to the national economy, and avoid toxic bottlenecks and cost overruns. It was time Zimbabwe started to seriously adopt smart blockchain technologies like South Africa to improve efficiencies and turnaround time. One of the biggest frustrations and costs in the value chain was customs delays, fuel shortages and power outages. Something must be done long-term to address these bottlenecks. Dry ports were just like any other business and were concerned about ease of doing business, national competitiveness, country of origin effect, and national image. A business was a business regardless of sector, as they all used the same benchmarks and standards, and deliverables were achievable in a conducive national business environment which generated maximum profits to shareholders and taxes to the government whilst creating thousands of jobs, giving a world-class logistics service, being a national prestige project, national pride and point of reference, giving wide product choice and prosperity to the nation, and operating with environmental protection and ethics in mind. Zimbabwean politicians, the population at large, NGOs, and industrialists needed to get this message as clear as possible.</jats:p>"

The thermal energy source for the district option is a coal-fired boiler house; the one for the individual option is automated pellet boilers. The boiler house receives coal according to a complex multi-link scheme, whereas pellets are produced on site. The district heating option involves laying heat networks throughout the village because currently it has none. The individual heating option suggests the construction of a pellet production plant. Environmental indicators are calculated emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion. Pollutants include solids, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Along with environmental indicators, the authors consider the conditions for ensuring energy security in various heating options. The research findings show the advantage of the individual heating option based on automated pellet boilers for environmental indicators. The risks for this option are assessed from the standpoint of threats to the energy security of the settlement in comparison with the district heating option. The factors considered as threats include those affecting the reliability and survivability of process technologies, an increase in the thermal energy cost, and the availability of fuel and energy resources. The main limitation for the option of individual heating in the Arctic territories, which is based on locally produced wood pellets, is the lack of reasonable reserves of available wood in wood-cutting areas near the settlement.</jats:p>",
