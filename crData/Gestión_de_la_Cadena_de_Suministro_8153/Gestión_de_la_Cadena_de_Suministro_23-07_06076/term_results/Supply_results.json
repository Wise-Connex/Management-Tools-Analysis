      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In a changing business environment, firms encounter significant challenges to fulfill sustainable development goals. However, firms can make substantial progress by adopting regenerative approaches grounded in circular economy principles, enabling them to effectively pursue sustainable development objectives such as responsible production and consumption (goal 12), climate action (goal 13), and the preservation of life on land (goal 15). However, there is a scarcity of research studies that offer guidance to top supply chain (SC) executives, aiming to enhance their environmental focus and enhance the SC viability through regenerative SC practices. This study employed the philosophical perspective of the natural resource‐based view. Advancing the SC literature, it tested a theoretical model to investigate the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives and the environmental orientation of SCs. Additionally, it examined the direct and indirect (via regenerative SC) relationships between a firm's environmental orientation and SC viability. This study also tested the moderating role of a firm's artificial intelligence‐driven big data analytics culture in these relationships. Applying a mixed‐methods approach, the study derived a theoretical model to link the aforementioned constructs. Apart from a qualitative investigation, data were also collected through a questionnaire‐based survey from 375 samples. The results indicated that the relationship between the political skills and SC analytics skills of top SC executives toward the environmental orientation of SCs is significant. Furthermore, they indicated that a firm's environmental orientation is positively related to a regenerative SC, which in turn enhances SC viability. The findings also provided evidence that a firm's AI‐driven big data analytics culture enhances the strength of these relationships. The current study extends the knowledge base by integrating the two unique concepts of digitalization and circular economy.</jats:p>",

Our study contributes to the conceptualization of supply chain 5.0, a term that has been receiving increased attention as supply chains adapt to the fifth industrial revolution. We conducted a systematic literature network analysis (SLNA) to examine the research landscape of Industry 5.0 supply chains. We used VOSViewer software and Bibliometrix R-package for multiple bibliometric analyses using 682 documents published between 2016 and 2022. We present a comprehensive framework of supply chain 5.0, including its key concepts, technologies, and trends. Additionally, this research offers a future research agenda to inspire and support further development in this field. We utilized three academic databases for bibliometric analyses: Dimension, Scopus and Lens. Additional databases could provide a wider research landscape and better field representation. We demonstrate how Industry 5.0 enables supply chain evaluation and optimization to assist companies in navigating disruptions without compromising competitiveness and profitability and provide a unique contribution to the field of supply chain 5.0 by exploring promising research areas and guiding the transition to this new paradigm for practitioners and scholars.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the industrial world, distribution activities are one of the important things in the flow of a business process. The role of advances in information technology also has a considerable good impact on the process of exchanging information in business processes. The XYZ agency is responsible for organizing the distribution of plant seeds to all communities and farmer groups as an effort to improve the economy in the agro-industrial sector. However, there are obstacles in the distribution process activities carried out by the XYZ agency such as the lack of harmonization of information exchange with regional posts. This causes the distribution process to be hampered and also not even distributed. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the process flow using the Supply Chain Management (SCM) method to manage seeds distribution management appropriately. SCM elaborates each supply chain process in detail by categorizing each process with the attributes of plan, source, make, deliver, and return. In addition, performance measurement using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is carried out to determine and provide recommendations for improvements needed for each related performance metric. There are 31 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that are in accordance with the distribution process and validated in XYZ agency. The result of performance measurement based on the Key Performance Indicator reached 83.12, which indicated the performance monitoring of the actual seeds distribution process by XYZ agency at the Good level.</jats:p>"

Achieving sustainable development necessitates a balance between the supply and demand for ecosystem services. We performed a factor analysis using ecosystem service measurement results to assess ecosystem service supply and national statistical data representing socioeconomic factors for ecosystem service demand. The analysis results for Gyeonggi-do are as follows: ecosystem service supply was categorized into mixed service provision (factor 1), food supply (factor 2), and phosphorus retention service (factor 3). Ecosystem service demand, based on socioeconomic factors, was divided into shrinking cities (factor 1), densely populated areas (factor 2), and economically active areas (factor 3). Balanced local governments were identified in Goyang, Osan, Paju, Pyeongtaek, Pocheon, Yeoju, Siheung, and Guri, while unbalanced local governments were found in Suwon, Hwaseong, Yongin, Gwangju, Yeoncheon, Yangpyeong, and Namyangju. Furthermore, we propose a management plan to maintain balance between the demand and supply of ecosystem services. Our analysis method and results are applicable to various local governments, providing an invaluable resource for maintaining the balance between ecosystem service supply and demand.</jats:p>"

A quantitative research approach was adopted, in which a structured online questionnaire using google Form was utilized to collect data from the automotive industry of Pakistan. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the model. Empirical analysis reveals that although SR and DR both have a negative impact on OP, SR has a particularly adverse effect. However, the study discovered that SCI has a partial mediation effect on the relationship between SR and OP, and DR and OP. Accordingly, this study is unusual in its conclusion that DR as compared to SR, has no significant impact on OP in emerging economies, like Pakistan, and also is not a significant factor that limits SCI. This study is novel in the way that it analyzes the mediating role of SCI to evaluate the relationship between external supply chain operational risks and OP in the growing automotive sector of Pakistan’s economy. The study also discovered that incorporating SCI into organizations mitigates the negative impacts of SCR and helps managers to further enhance OP. As a result, the findings add to the body of increasingly complicated research that evaluates the function of SR and DR in the OP of the automotive sectors. Additionally, the scale and the models can be used to evaluate how companies in the automobile industry respond to external supply chain operational risk with SCI to attain OP.</jats:p>"

Adding a contextual response dimension to an established complexity framework helped to explain how hybrid organisations balance commercial viability demands with social mission logic by amending traditional supply chain and governance practices. The case provides insights into supply chain configuration, needed changes and potential impacts when an SE as a focal actor inserts into a traditional for-profit construction supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

It identifies the shocks using a sign-restricted Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model with quarterly data. Estimations of dynamic panel regressions and local projections suggest that supply shocks lead to persistent increases in government debt, while demand shocks result in long-lasting declines. Furthermore, high debt levels increase economic vulnerability, amplifying the impacts of both supply and demand shocks by more than three times. Specifically, supply shocks increase debt through higher borrowing costs and more prolonged depreciation, whereas demand shocks erode debt through persistent reductions in primary balance, driven by increased revenues.</jats:p>"

In China, SWSS has been installed in 97% of residential buildings and the operation of SWSS is directly related to the water pressure and water quality of the users' tap water. In this paper, the operation optimization objectives for the SWSS with storage facilities were proposed, and deep Q-learning network (DQN) was applied to optimize the control of SWSS. In this study, the pressure, the water age in the roof water tank, and the power consumption of the pumps were selected as the optimization objectives. The equation for the qualitative selection of the key hyperparameter (Gamma) was proposed and verified by the experiments in a community of City S in East China. The results indicated that with the decrease in the volume of the water tank, the larger Gamma value was recommended, and the more future conditions were considered. It is hoped that the result can be used as a reference in SWSS operation optimization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The creation of an intelligent supply chain is now an urgent national security priority that cannot be achieved without the joint mobilization of various stakeholders in Canada. It is not, however, an end in itself: the achievement of a single, competitive, sustainable, and consumer-focused domestic market should be the ultimate outcome of the national taskforce needed to collaboratively implement the recommendations of three complementary public policy reports published in 2022 on the state of the supply chain in Canada.   The supply chain challenge is vast, and it will only become more complex over time. Governments in Canada must act together now, in conjunction with collaborative efforts with our allies and partners, notably the United States and the European Union, to ensure supply chain resilience in the face of accelerating current and anticipated upheavals, geopolitical conflicts and natural disasters.   Québec's geostrategic position is a major asset, and gives it a critical role and responsibility in implementing not only the Final Report of the National Supply Chain Task Force (\"ACT\"), but also of the recommendations contained in the report published by the Council of Ministers Responsible for Transportation and Highway Safety (COMT) and those contained in the report of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities published in Ottawa in November 2022, \"Improving the Efficiency and Resilience of Canada's Supply Chains\".  The mobilizing approach towards a common data space for Canada's supply chain is inspired by Advantage St. Lawrence's forward-looking Smart Economic Corridor vision and builds on and integrates experience gained from various initiatives and programs implemented in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as appropriate.  Its initial implementation in the St. Lawrence - Great Lakes trade corridor will facilitate the subsequent access and sharing of data from across the Canadian supply chain in a reliable and secure manner.  The accelerated joint development of a common data space is a game-changer not only in terms of solving critical supply chain challenges, but also in terms of the impetus it will generate in the pursuit of fundamental Canadian priorities, including the energy transition.   This Bourgogne report offers a four-part synthesis:  - An overview of a background characterized by numerous consultations, strategy announcements, measures, and mixed results. - A cross-analysis of the recommendations of three important and complementary public policy reports at federal level, as well as the Quebec strategy, “l'Avantage Saint-Laurent”. - An analysis of the fundamental issues of mobilization capacity, execution, and under-utilization of data. - Some operational solutions for moving into « Action, Collaboration and Transformation » (ACT) mode.</jats:p>"

In turn, these studies have demonstrated the contribution of Venetian Crete’s artistic production to European culture. Despite Giorgio Vasari’s condemnations of the ‘Greek style’, Byzantine icons remained popular in Renaissance Europe among Western patrons. Research on Venetian Crete has greatly benefitted from the survival of its archives, presently housed in Venice (Archivio di Stato di Venezia), an incredibly rich and invaluable source of information. One of the best-known published and referenced documents from these archives, supporting the wider popularity and dissemination of Cretan icons, is a contract offered to three Cretan painters dated 4 July 1499 concerning the production and delivery of 700 icons of the Virgin in just 42 days, by 15 August 1499, the day of the feast of the Dormition of the Virgin. This paper revisits the information the famous contract provides with the aim to scrutinise it further.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industry 4.0 is a period in which advanced digital technologies are integrated into production processes. In this period, technologies such as automation, data analysis, artificial intelligence and the internet of things are used to increase the efficiency of enterprises, optimize their operational processes and gain competitive advantage. In today's rapidly developing technology, the business world is constantly changing and transforming. Industry 4.0 is the most obvious example of this transformation. Industry 4.0 is a period in which advanced digital technologies are integrated into production processes and includes the use of technologies such as automation, data analysis, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. However, business analysis is of great importance in order to understand the value these technologies provide to businesses and to use them in the best way. Business analysis enables businesses to analyze data, evaluate their processes, improve them and determine their future strategies. Industry 4.0 offers new opportunities for business analysis. In particular, the increase in the amount of data in production processes and the use of advanced digital technologies have made the role of business analysis even more important. With Industry 4.0, business analysis has become a basic tool used to increase the efficiency of enterprises, optimize their operational processes and gain competitive advantage. With data analysis and business intelligence techniques, businesses can analyze their production processes, evaluate productivity levels, detect errors and identify opportunities for improvement. While automation and artificial intelligence help businesses optimize their processes and increase efficiency, business analysis can analyze the performance of these technologies and identify areas for improvement in processes. These factors have caused businesses to review their supply chain strategies. Therefore, businesses that want to remain competitive must manage their supply chains effectively and efficiently. For this, real-time information sharing and coordination between supply chain partners should be ensured. Activities such as organizing purchasing, production and distribution processes, stock management, improving supplier relations, receiving customer feedback quickly and responding to demands effectively and efficiently will be possible with the digitalization of the traditional supply chain. In this study, it is aimed to explain the general structure of the digital supply chain, which facilitates and makes the supply chain activities of the enterprises efficient. For this purpose, a general literature review has been made about the general structure of the digital supply chain, its relationship with industry 4.0, the transformation from the traditional supply chain to the digital supply chain, the   haracteristics of the digital supply chain, combining these basic elements with business analysis, its basic characteristics and benefits. In addition, the importance of the Internet of Things and cloud computing in the digital supply chain processes is also examined in this study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The use of pulse voltage can greatly improve the precision of electrochemical microfabrication, and the narrower the pulse width of the applied pulse voltage signal, the higher the machining precision. However, the commonly used chopper circuit topology of pulse power supplies is limited by the maximum switching frequency of the field-effect transistor. To address this problem, this paper proposes a nanosecond pulse electrochemical micromachining power supply based on a differential circuit. The power supply uses the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller as the control core to output high-performance rectangular waves through a DDS device. After differential, rectification, filtering, and power amplification processing, stable, frequency, amplitude, and pulse width adjustable spike pulse voltage signals are obtained. By establishing a system mathematical model and optimizing the time constant of the differential circuit, theoretically, the sub-nanosecond pulse width can be obtained. Prototype performance tests show that the power supply has a maximum frequency of 20MHz, a minimum pulse width of 1.8ns, and a maximum peak voltage of 10V. By using this power supply for microhole electrochemical machining experiments, nanometer-level machining precision has been achieved. Compared with the power supply reported in the literature, the designed spike pulse power supply has a narrower pulse width and better waveform performance, thereby improving the precision and localization of electrochemical micromachining.</jats:p>"

Accurate demand forecasting can provide an important decision-making basis for new energy vehicle enterprises, which is beneficial to the development of new energy vehicles. From the perspective of an intelligent supply chain, this study explored the demand forecasting of new energy vehicles, and proposed an innovative SARIMA-LSTM-BP combination model for prediction modeling. The data showed that the RMSE, MSE, and MAE values of the SARIMA-LSTM-BP combination model were 2.757, 7.603, and, 1.912, respectively, all of which are lower values than those of the single models. This study therefore, indicated that, compared with traditional econometric forecasting models and deep learning forecasting models, such as the random forest, support vector regression (SVR), long short-term memory (LSTM), and back propagation neural network (BP) models, the SARIMA-LSTM-BP combination model performed outstandingly with higher accuracy and better forecasting performance.</jats:p>"

However, the\nfluctuations of renewable generations and railway traction loads in RPSS\nmay introduce data noise, which will jeopardize the accuracy of the\ngenerated pseudo-measurements and thus impact the state estimation.\nAdditionally, when learning the historical measurement data sequences,\nthe traditional pseudo-measurement model is likely to have overfitting,\nwhich will further impact the accuracy of pseudo-measurements, thereby\naffecting the accuracy of state estimation. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a high-accuracy pseudo-measurement-based state\nestimation approach for RPSSs. Firstly, a denoising autoencoder\n(DAE)-based method is used to mitigate the impact of data noise on the\naccuracy of pseudo measurements, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based\nmethod is used to adaptively learn the historical measurement data\nsequence, thereby improving the accuracy of pseudo measurements. Next,\nthe pseudo-measurement weights are obtained by generating\npseudo-measurement variances using the Gaussian mixture model. Finally,\nthe pseudo measurements and real-time measurements are integrated by\nweighted least squares to realize the state estimation of RPSS. The\neffectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by\nsimulation on a modified IEEE 33-node system which includes a railway\ntraction substation and renewable generations.</jats:p>"

However, there are several barriers hindering resilience, and identifying and prioritizing them is essential for developing effective strategies to improve resilience. This study proposes an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that combines the Best Worst Method (BWM), Delphi, and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) to recognize and prioritize SC resilience barriers in the BSC of Tehran, the largest BSC in Iran. The proposed approach provides real-time results for future improvements, and sensitivity analysis investigates the effects of criteria weights on decision-making. Additionally, the proposed method is compared with two existing methods, namely BWM- VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and BWM-Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). The results demonstrated that the most critical barriers are a lack of financial resources and the presence of managerial weaknesses at various levels. By highlighting these barriers, the study provides valuable insights for decision-makers to develop effective strategies and allocate resources to address the identified obstacles and improve the resilience of the blood supply chain.</p>"

The main findings are as follows: First, the adoption of the blockchain platform reduces the interest rate threshold, making external financing more advantageous for retailers with higher capital constraint. Further, financing through the blockchain platform leads to higher wholesale prices, retail prices, and order quantities compared to traditional financing scenarios. Second, internal trade financing and the use of blockchain technology are preferred over external bank financing. However, conducting external bank financing through the blockchain platform yields greater profit growth for manufacturers and retailers. Accessing the blockchain platform is the optimal strategy for retailers and banks, leading to a favorable “multi-win” situation when the manufacturer’s platform fees are reasonable. Third, the manufacturer’s risk guarantee ratio plays a crucial role in determining the choice of financing mode, particularly when the retailer faces the risk of debt default. This study contributes to the literature by quantifying the impacts of blockchain technology deployment for three aspects that have been overlooked in previous studies: the set-up cost and access fee of the blockchain platform, the service level provided by the platform, and the demand increase resulting from blockchain technology adoption.</jats:p>"

Among African Neo-Pentecostal Churches (ANPCs), where miracles and wonders are central to missional activities, it is uncommon to think that excellent delivery in missional service goes beyond power display, miracles and spiritual due diligence. Although some Christian ministries employ professional managers to oversee certain missional operations and logistics, the dynamics and impact of such managerial services, especially the “supply chain” process in the face of evolving technologies, are rarely brought forward in theological conversations. To fill this gap, this article places a searchlight on the interaction of ANPCs’ supply chain with new technologies (NTECH) in the past. Likewise, with an empirical survey covering 219 respondents as the primary source, it juxtaposes the current state with the future of the interaction. The outcome indicates no substantial interaction in the past and a possible wide margin between current and expected future interaction, with a 22.3% total median rate. Lastly, causes of low interaction are briefly discussed and lessons are presented for improved future interaction.</jats:p>"

It is also attested that the industrial revolution 4.0 imposes mandatory conditions on companies to expand and connect all internal processes with customers and suppliers, in order to adopt effective strategies for the supply chain. The model that offers practitioners a modern tool to streamline international supply chains and ensure security is the ISO 28001 international standard, which recognizes the complexity of supply issues, because they are dynamic and involve many business actors (organizations, partners). Ensuring an adequate level of security of the international supply chain is possible with the partial or total implementation of the ISO 28001 standard. This standard can be considered as a tool of strategic supply chain management, with the help of which any company could increase the competitiveness of the chain. This paper comes with a theoretical approach to what supply chain and international supply chain means, and how it can be improved by applying/implementing the requirements of the ISO 28001 standard. The research objectives were achieved by using traditional research methods, such as theoretical, empirical qualitative and quantitative. The literature was researched, both in traditional format, but also in the form of electronic publications in the field of procurement, international supply chains and international ISO standards.</jats:p>"

It is vital to have an adequate understanding of third-party logistics performance drivers. Most studies have concentrated on third-party logistics capability, while few others explored the impact of relational governance structures on performance. However, studies examining the synergy between third-party logistics capability and relationship management are scarce. The purpose of this study is to investigate the stimulators of third-party logistics performance in the Nigerian manufacturing industry. A descriptive survey, e-mail questionnaire, and PLS-SEM approach was used to collect and analyze the data from a sample of 364 manufacturing companies in Nigeria. The findings indicated that relationship management has a significant positive association with third-party logistics capability (β= 0.785, t = 3.457, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); relationship management has a significant negative association with supply chain risk (β= –0.209, t = 4.149, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); third-party logistics capability has a significant negative association with supply chain risk (β = –0.620, t = 3.199, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); supply chain risk has a significant negative association with logistics performance (β= –0.695 t = 5.396, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Hence, relationship management, third-party logistics capability, and supply chain risk are drivers of third-party logistics performance. Therefore, supply chain partners should manage their relationships to strengthen third-party logistics capability and reduce all kinds of uncertainties and risks.</jats:p>",

When the environment changes, a previously efficient energy allocation strategy may become inefficient in the new environment, and organisms are required to change their physiology, morphology, and behaviour. However, how multiple phenotypic traits interact with each other and with the characteristics of the environment to determine energy allocation is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a predictive framework, based on energetic and biophysical principles, to characterise phenotype-environment interactions. We tested this by adapting axenic populations of the ciliate<jats:italic>Tetrahymena pyriformis</jats:italic>to different environmental conditions of temperature and resource levels, and measured population growth, cell size, respiration, and movement. Movement speed and respiration rate increased with acute changes in environmental temperature in a way that could be predicted from simple physical scaling relations such as the Boltzmann-Arrhenius equation and the ‘viscous drag’ impacting movement. Based on theoretical arguments, we argue that these short-term changes of metabolic rate and movement speed introduce a mismatch between energy intake and energy expenditure and are not sustainable on the long-term. In fact, by around 3.5 days after the introduction of<jats:italic>Tetrahymena</jats:italic>into a novel environment, all measured quantities were further modulated in a direction that likely restored the energy allocation balance of the cells. Changes in cell size played a substantial role in mediating these adaptations, by simultaneously affecting multiple phenotypic traits, such as metabolic rate and the energetic costs of movement. In a small microbial consumer like<jats:italic>Tetrahymena</jats:italic>, size changes can happen over rapid timescales, relative to the timescales of ecological changes and of seasonal environmental fluctuations. Changes in body size can therefore be effectively leveraged – alongside physiological and biochemical regulations – to cope with environmental changes.</jats:p>"

The current disruption of the oil supply chain and the rapidly growing energy demand created unprecedented oil shortages and raised the oil price beyond the affordable level. As worldwide oil price hikes continue, there is an urgent need for developing alternative energy sources, such as smart rural energy. Despite its enormous potential as a viable alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources, smart rural energy has never been fully utilized in society. The limited use of smart rural energy may be related to its lack of commercialization, which could have created more eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternative energy sources. This paper assesses the eco-friendliness and cost-efficiency of smart rural energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower for the first time. This paper is also one of the first studies that intends to develop viable strategic plans for commercializing smart rural energy using strategy maps, which subsequently helps increase public awareness of renewable energy by creating visual communication tools that convey the benefits of smart rural energy commercialization to multiple stakeholders, including government entities, business communities, and energy consumers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Identifying and classifying hospital suppliers and choosing the right hospital supplier are based on some criteria, such as price, quality, timely product delivery, and after-sales service.\nMETHODS: The research method was to select a suitable supplier through multi-criteria decision-making methods, including fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy Delphi. This research analyzed the selection criteria of hospital suppliers using fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy Delphi methods. The weight of the selected criteria and their importance were determined by holding interviews with hospital experts. In the next stage, the suppliers were evaluated, and finally, they were ranked using the TOPSIS fuzzy method.\nFINDINGS: In this research, the criteria for selecting suppliers were based on the criteria determined by Dickson. According to the fuzzy Delphi method, 7 criteria of product quality, timely delivery, final product price, after-sales service, technical ability, product position among competitors, and easy-to-use product were selected for supplier evaluation.\nCONCLUSION: The selection of a reliable supplier is becoming increasingly crucial given the critical role played by the healthcare sector, which includes hospitals and the Red Crescent as its constituents, the expanding development of technology, and the growing variety of medical equipment. According to the results obtained by the fuzzy Delphi method, the criterion of product quality with a score of 0.88 was chosen as the most important criterion, while the ease-to-use product index with a score of 0.7 was chosen as the least important criterion. The selection and evaluation of suppliers were accomplished through several different quantitative and qualitative indicators, such as cost, quality, timely delivery, and after-sales service. As a result, companies must choose key indicators and suitable suppliers because the right supplier leads to a reduction in purchase costs, as well as an increase in the quality of the products and ultimately the success of the organization in reaching its goals.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the design considerations of it are presented, and the comparisons between the two power supplies are discussed. The calculation results show that the power supply based on HTS machine has much larger power density than the conventional HIA, and the efficiency is also larger than the conventional HIA.

Under this circumstance, it is urgent to identify effective solutions that can mitigate the concerns of food safety, quality, and fraud. Blockchain has been identified as a promising technology for enabling end-to-end supply chain traceability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study presents a comprehensive supply chain performance optimization model that addresses the trade-off between supply chain cost and customer service level in the distribution network. The model incorporates both deterministic and scenario-based approaches, allowing for a more realistic representation of supply chain operations. The model is applied to a case company operating in the pharmaceutical supply chain in Ethiopia. The goal is to improve the company’s supply chain performance by optimizing various factors such as establishment costs, handling costs, transportation costs, and demand satisfaction. The study considers both financial measures (supply chain cost) and non-financial measures (customer service level) to evaluate the performance of the supply chain. The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in identifying the optimal trade-off between supply chain costs and customer service levels. By comparing the results of the model with the current situation of the case company, it is determined that the company can achieve significant cost reductions of up to 25.26% while still meeting customer demands. The model also takes into account the uncertainty in demand, providing more realistic recommendations for distribution center locations, transportation planning, and order fulfillment. The implications of using this optimization model include the potential for cost savings, improved decision-making, enhanced customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, a more successful supply chain. However, the study has some limitations, including a need for further research on other objectives and considerations, such as environmental impacts and disruptions, which could be addressed in future research directions.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we discuss the effects of multidimensional factors, such as platform commission rate, platform reputation premium, loan interest rate, unit logistics cost and product price on the choice of multi-agent income strategy. Then, we study the stable strategy combination of a multi-agent evolutionary game, and the constraints formed by the combination of agent stability strategies are obtained. Finally, the research conclusions are verified through numerical simulation analysis. The research shows that the commission rate and logistics price of the logistics finance platform should be set within a reasonable range. When the logistics finance platform has a high expectation of reputation premium, it will be conducive to promoting financing enterprises and investors to adopt positive strategies to achieve win-win cooperation. The investor implements the credit strategy according to the principle of maximising its income and dominates the selection of enterprise financing strategy. The higher financing willingness of financing enterprises is conducive to promoting the implementation of credit easing strategy by the investor, ultimately achieving the optimal income of the three agents. However, the stable state of investor-enterprise cooperation depends on the platform to actively promote the establishment of a good trust mechanism.</jats:p>"

The utilization of minigrids to provide an efficient source of power in Nigeria with a population of over 200 million people have begun. However, it appears this is not sufficient to stimulate the growth of minigrid adoption in Nigeria especially as there is a large disparity between the present minigrid and the national grid price of electricity (N250 - N300/kWh versus N53-N76/kWh), this currently serves as a deterrent to minigrids adoption, viability, and sustainability in Nigeria.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper examined the factors that contribute to the high cost of electricity generation from minigrids as well as provided recommendations to reduce the cost of electricity generation from minigrids by carrying out a technical and economic simulation of an existing 85KW solar based renewable energy minigrid project in Nigeria.

In order to restore the supply chain, this paper incorporates social, environmental, and governance (ESG) factors into the study of corporate supply chains. The aim is to explore the factors that influence supply-chain resilience and performance from these three perspectives, with a particular focus on the role of willingness to adopt green innovation technologies. To encompass a wider audience and multiple industry sectors, this study employs a questionnaire survey method, targeting managers of Chinese companies, and utilizes analytical tools such as SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0 for data analysis and validation. The research findings indicate that supply-chain collaboration, supply-chain management capabilities, supply-chain risks, and green-product innovation have a positive impact on a firm’s willingness to adopt innovative technologies, subsequently leading to positive effects on supply-chain resilience and performance. By incorporating ESG factors into the scope of supply-chain research, this study expands the research domain and scope of ESG. Additionally, enhancing corporate social responsibility awareness and sustainable development consciousness holds great significance for the recovery of enterprise supply-chain development. This study also offers new insights for businesses to enhance their supply-chain management.</jats:p>"

The basis of IoT security and privacy starts with trust in the IoT hardware and its supply chain. Counterfeiting, cloning, tampering of hardware, theft, and lost issues in the IoT supply chain have to be addressed, in order to ensure reliable IoT industry growth. In four previous works, radio-frequency identification (RFID)-enabled solutions have been proposed by the same authors, aimed to bring security to the entire IoT supply chain. The works propose a new RFID-traceable hardware architecture, device authentication, and supply chain tracing procedure. In each of these works, a variant of the same is proposed. However, the same variant of lightweight RFID authentication protocol coupled with the offline supply chain proposed in these works has such security vulnerabilities that make the whole supply chain unsafe. In our present work, an online supply chain hop-tracking procedure supported by a novel RFID mutual authentication protocol, based on the strong matching of the RFID readers-their operators-central database present at the transfer hops is proposed. Our proposed Strong RFID Authentication Protocol (STRAP) has been verified by two well-accepted formal protocol analyzers Scyther and AVISPA. The verification results demonstrate that STRAP overcomes the previous works’ vulnerabilities. Furthermore, our proposed novel online supply chain tracing procedure supporting STRAP removes the previous offline supply chain tracing procedure weaknesses.</jats:p>"

Although increasing the compulsory schooling years has successfully narrowed the gender gap in labour supply, we find that this effect was only through higher labor force participation of single women and women without children. In other words, our results signify that marriage and fertility have shadowed the human capital effect of higher education. Therefore, policymakers should mainly focus on supply-side policies to mitigate family barriers to raise female labour force participation in Turkey. \n<jats:bold>JEL Classification</jats:bold>: J12, J13, J22, J24</jats:p>"

This study calculates the adjacency matrix and accessibility matrix by using SPSSPRO, then constructs the interpretative structural modeling method (ISM) and the recursive structure diagram. Combining the Matrix-based Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC), this paper classifies the influencing factors into four categories: autonomous category, dependent category, linkages category, and independent category. The results show that: (1) the factors that constitute the deepest level of risk in supply chain finance are crediting false trade, non-standard bill of lading, data information security risk, imperfection of business process design, et cetera. (2) Among all factors, three factors are identified as the autonomous category, nine as the independent category, and nine as the dependent category with no linkages category.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Germany desires to become climate-neutral in its heat supply by 2045. From 2024 onward communities are legally required to develop a plan documenting how the objective will be achieved. Geothermal resources can be a major building block to reach the aspirational target if they can be developed at competitive costs. To evaluate the economic potential of geothermal resources is time and money consuming. Questions which need to be addressed in the context of such evaluations are: How can an economic recovery of geothermal heat be achieve, how can subsurface risks associated with an exploration be managed, and how competitive is a deep geothermal energy recovery compared to other options of heat supply? These questions are key to a development of deep geothermal heat, especially if the geothermal conditions are not as prominent as in already realized projects, but less favourable as in the deep clastic sediments of the North German Basin. With this contribution a procedure is presented and used to determine net present values and the associated levelized costs for deep hydrothermal heat recovery systems. It consists of modelling the geothermal cycle, sizing all necessary components, costing them, and calculating net present value and levelized cost. The thermodynamic and economic modeling of the thermal cycle is performed in MATLAB coupled to Refprop. The relationships used in the model to determine the state variables pressure and temperature are presented. Based on their knowledge the components of the thermal cycle are sized. Models are presented to cost activities, components, and operations. Together with market information, the results are used to determine cash-in and cash-out and carry out net present value and levelized cost calculations. The model is set up to enable a coupling of a geothermal with another heat generator, such that the geothermal system can be utilized at baseload. The thermal model is verified by comparing the modelled state variables pressure and temperature at relevant state points of the thermal cycle with actual data of a geothermal project. The cost model is validated with biding results and cost information from actual projects and modified as appropriate. Research results published to date typically address deep high enthalpy systems to generate electrical power and focus on particular aspects only. Few publications address the challenges of lower enthalpy heat systems, allowing determination of net-present values/risk discounted values and levelized costs of heat and systemic optimizations. In applying the model to a setting in the Hannover-Celle area with temperatures of around 70°C, conditions are determined, which lead to positive net present values. The degree of their influence is determined in sensitivity analyses allowing a systemic optimization. The presented thermodynamic and cost models are considered helpful instruments for developing preliminary conceptual estimates, strategies for optimization, and portfolio management.</jats:p>"

However, the diffusion rate of AI is widely ranging across countries. This study aims to fulfill a research gap regarding multidimensional comprehensive studies which could provide academic information to the policy makers, technology producers, adopters of technology and the workforce. Friction against the use of new technologies has been existing since the beginning of industrial revolution. This study examines the possible factors behind the friction in AI adoption process. The subject of the course in this study is the supply chain resilience which is a keystone in healthcare sector especially after the recent pandemics. Studies promise the efficiency improvements and cost reductions in healthcare when AI technologies are implemented in supply chain management of the industry. This paper proposes a fuzzy Aczel–Alsina-based decision-making model to analyze the factors that enhance the diffusion of AI technologies in healthcare supply chain management. The model is tested for the case of Turkish healthcare industry. Fuzzy decision-making model is used to solve the complexities in unveiling success factors in the implementation and diffusion phases. Results show that among many other factors tested, technology intensity, trialability and government support and policies are the most important AI success factors. The results are discussed to reveal potential policy recommendations.</jats:p>"

The district Ballia has many reports which are focused on arsenic contamination in its different blocks. This article is devoted to a thorough study of hydrogeochemical characteristics and the source of origin of arsenic in the groundwater system of the Ballia district. The relationship between this hydrogeologically present arsenic and various cations and anions including some physicochemical parameters are discussed here. These observations have been done using ICP MS and ion chromatographic techniques. The relationship study has been done by using a correlation matrix which is further proven by the dendrogram. Different types of loading plots of various principal components have also been studied with the help of principal component analysis. The nature and quality of groundwater are studied with the help of a piper plot. This research article is a complete and detailed study of the nature of groundwater in district Ballia. It also enlightens the source of arsenic contamination in the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The digitization of logistics processes enables, among others, real-time data exchange, which is currently the driving force of the modern economy, as well as functioning supply chains. Digital transformation has been accelerated in recent years, primarily by the development of the Industry 4.0 concept. It is also perceived as a trend supporting the sustainable development of organizations and industries. The main research challenge was identifying current research directions related to the digitalization of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to present the literature review results of the last five years (2018–2022) regarding the digitalization of supply chains. The research used the PRISMA method (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), and 127 articles were analyzed. On this basis, we proposed a two-level qualifications framework that includes eight core categories and sixteen subcategories. The main contributions of this work are as follows: providing a complete and up-to-date (last five years) literature review on supply chains in the digital age from a global perspective that summarizes the current state of the art in an integrated framework; and provides an indication of the two most significant challenges currently observed, which are interrelated. The first key challenge is the digital transformation of businesses and supply chains; the second is sustainable development, which focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals; reducing the complexity of the issue by providing structure and clarity (Identifying categories and subcategories as the mind map); and identifying research gaps that we will work on in the future. Based on the review, we indicate three identified research gaps: there is a lack of research assessing the use of digitalization to build supply chain resilience; there are no studies evaluating the risk of the negative impact of technologies and threats on relations integrating future supply chains; and there is a lack of research on the changing role of man in modern logistics systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global commodity traders play a key role in the purchase-sale, handling and distribution of many of the world’s commodities, thus facilitating trade and consumer demand. Yet they are often criticized for adversely affecting local producers and local communities/cultures and for engaging in (or effectively encouraging) un-sustainable practices and outcomes.\r\nThis paper takes a small, initial step in trying to answer these debates. As part of the Governance of Labour and Logistics for Sustainability (GOLLS) program (via an ISS RIF award), it first seeks to describe what these key firms do and how. Using the case of soya and Brazil (in particular), it describes the commodities, the “typical” organizational and financial mechanisms used by traders (for retaining margins) and the case of the key ABCD group of firms.\r\nThe specific impacts of soya chain governance (plus acts of resistance and strategies/forms of regulation) are noted more clearly in other publications and events (Pegler et al. forthcoming, Pegler and Widmarck 2020, Vecchione 2018), including quite startling reviews of the role of various nations financial sectors and governments in promoting trader activity (FIAN International et al. 2018).\r\n \r\nThis article’s second contribution is more general, making the link between trader activity and the broader question of sustainability through comparing and contrasting how profit/volumes and risk assessments surrounding local supply considerations can at times encourage them to either vertically or horizontally integrate (or not) in the local chain/economy. These choices help provide the context to the “spaces” where global chains touch down, these in turn having important consequences for local development, incomes, jobs and welfare and the (above mentioned) social impacts, forms of resistance and regulation which often emerge.\r\nThe paper makes an important, albeit initial and exploratory contribution to the GOLLS project question – under what conditions might the logic of  “chain drivers and inner (local well- being) drivers” actually meet – i.e. the chain governance and sustainability debate.\r\nKeywords: global production networks, soybean supply chains, commodity trading, sustainability</jats:p>"

This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of digital twin in the supply chain to help researchers, industry practitioners, and academics to understand the trend, development, and focus of the areas of digital twin in the supply chain. This paper found several key clusters of research, including the designing of a digital twin model, integration of a digital twin model, application of digital twin in quality control, and digital twin in digitalization. In the embryonic stage of research, digital twin was tested in the production line with limited optimization. In the development stage, the importance of digital twin in Industry 4.0 was observed, as big data, machine learning, Industrial Internet of Things, blockchain, edge computing, and cloud-based systems complemented digital twin models. Digital twin was applied to improve sustainability in manufacturing and production logistics. In the current prosperity stage with high annual publications, the recent trends of this topic focus on the integration of deep learning, data models, and artificial intelligence for digitalization. This bibliometric analysis also found that the COVID-19 pandemic drove the start of the prosperity stage of digital twin research in the supply chain. Researchers in this field are slowly moving towards applying digital twin for human-centric systems and mass personalization to prepare to transit to Industry 5.0.</jats:p>"

Corn production in Indonesia is influenced by various factors, including price, land area, soybean price, subsidized NPK fertilizer price, post-harvest agricultural machinery assistance, and imports. This study aims to analyze the level of elasticity of corn commodities on the supply side. The results of the analysis show that corn supply in Indonesia is inelastic to the price, land area, and price of soybeans. However, corn supply is elastic to subsidized NPK fertilizer prices, post-harvest agricultural machinery assistance, and imports. The supply elasticity to the price of corn is 0.408, which means that if the price of corn increases by 1%, then the supply of corn will increase by 0.408%. The supply elasticity to land area is 1.578, which means that if land area increases by 1%, then corn supply will increase by 1.578%. The supply elasticity to soybean prices is -0.309, which means that if soybean prices increase by 1%, then corn supply will decrease by 0.309%. The supply elasticity to the price of subsidized NPK fertilizer is -0.016, which means that if the price of subsidized NPK fertilizer increases by 1%, then the supply of corn will decrease by 0.016%. The supply elasticity of post-harvest agricultural machinery assistance is 0.048, which means that if post-harvest agricultural machine tool assistance increases by 1%, then corn supply will increase by 0.048%. The elasticity of supply to imports is 0.232, which means that if corn imports increase by 1%, then corn supply will increase by 0.232%.</jats:p>"

It has become a hot research focus to use district metering area (DMA) for more efficient management and control of WDNs. This article proposes a multistage DMA planning method based on improved weighted spectral clustering and genetic algorithm, aiming to address issues such as high investment cost and large differences in the water network demand distribution. First, the actual case pipe network is transformed into an undirected weighted graph based on graph theory, and a similarity matrix is formed by combining the physical properties and hydraulic characteristics of the water network. Then, based on the similarity matrix, the weighted spectral clustering algorithm is used to preliminarily divide the WDN, and the performance of the water supply pipe network formed with different division quantities and different weighting schemes is discussed. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the arrangement of valves and flow meters on boundary pipes to generate the final configuration of DMA. The results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement in pipe network topology, hydraulic performance index, and economy compared with the traditional DMA method.</jats:p>",

Available spatial data are limited to the aggregate level (i.e., national, state, and district levels) and lack details to make informed policy decisions and allocations. Despite significant advancements in geospatial technologies, their application and integration at the policy and decision-making level are rare. The current research provides a broad GIS-centric framework for actionable science, which focuses on real context and facilitates geospatial maps and theoretical and practical knowledge to address various water issues. The study demonstrates the application of the proposed Geospatial Framework from technical and institutional perspectives in water-stressed zones in Pune city, showing where and how to solve problems and where proposed actions can most impact creating a sustainable water-secured future. The framework makes it possible for everyone to explore datasets that can provide a baseline for research, and analysis, contribute to the process, propose, and act on solutions, and take the benefits of the outcomes and policy recommendations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>As regions around the world invest billions in new infrastructure to overcome increasing water scarcity, better guidance is needed to facilitate cooperative planning and investment in institutionally complex and interconnected water supply systems. This work combines detailed water resource system ensemble modeling with multiobjective intelligent search to explore highly uncertain infrastructure investment partnership design tradeoffs in the context of ongoing canal rehabilitation and groundwater banking in California. We highlight that severe tradeoffs can emerge between conflicting goals related to water supply deliveries, partnership size, and the underlying financial risks associated with cooperative infrastructure investments. We demonstrate how hydroclimatic variability and institutional complexity create significant uncertainty in realized water supply benefits and the potential for strong heterogeneity in partners’ financial risks that threaten infrastructure investment partnership viability. Importantly, the partnerships discovered by our multiobjective intelligent search framework are found to deliver substantially higher water supply benefits with a fraction of the financial risk compared to status quo planning processes. This work has important implications globally for efforts to use cooperative infrastructure investments to enhance the resilience and financial stability of water supply systems confronting increasing competition for scarce resources.</p>"

We show that the duration of starvation determines whether Drosophila melanogaster forms appetitive short-term or long-term memory. The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and fat tissue influences how long sucrose is remembered. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. In turn, octopamine suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, since octopamine-deficient mutants form appetitive short-term memory to sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose in the presence of high internal glycogen levels combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to increased starvation periods might drive increased food intake.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Tillering/branching pattern plays a significant role in determining the structure and diversity of grass, and trimming has been found to induce tillering in turfgrass. Recently, it has been reported that hydrogen peroxide (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) plays a part in regulating axillary bud development. However, the role of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in trimming-induced tillering in bermudagrass, a kind of turfgrass, remains unclear.  This study reveals that trimming has a significant effect on inducing the sprouting and growth of tiller buds in the stolon node, as well as increasing the number of tillers in the main stem. Trimming serves to increase the content and relevant gene expression level of cytokinin and sucrose in axillary buds in a spatiotemporal-dependent manner. In addition, the partial trimming of new-born tillers results in an increase in sucrose and starch reserves in their leaves, which can be attributed to the enhanced photosynthesis capacity. Further research has revealed that trimming promotes a rapid H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> burst in the leaves of new-born tillers and axillary stolon buds. Exogenous application of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> significantly increases the number of tillers after trimming by enhancing photosynthesis potential and energy reserves. Moreover, exogenous H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, these results indicate that both endogenous production and exogenous addition of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enhance the inductive effects of trimming on the tillering process in bermudagrass, thus helping boost energy supply and maintain the redox state in newly formed tillers.</jats:p>"

Outre les suppressions d’emplois et les pertes de revenus, les responsables du secteur agroalimentaire sont confrontés à la menace constante de la contamination des aliments et aux conséquences négatives de l’augmentation, d’année en année, du nombre de personnes touchées ou décédées à la suite d’une contamination alimentaire. De telles erreurs portent atteinte à l’identité de la marque, entraînant des pertes de revenus supplémentaires et une éventuelle cessation d’activité.

To test the hypotheses of the study, the autoregressive distributed lag approach and Granger causality test have been applied. The empirical findings show that there is a relationship between financial and economic growth, but the evidence of the supply-leading hypothesis in the long run in Hungary is varied according to the sector. While in the short run, the changes in the ratios of credit to both agencies of the private sector have no statistically significant impact on economic growth. According to the Granger test, there is evidence supporting the neutrality hypothesis for the credit-to-corporate ratio and the feedback hypothesis for the credit-to-household ratio in relation to economic growth. This is a consequence of the fact low levels of efficiency characterized the Hungarian financial system, despite it being characterized by high levels of financial depth. Besides, financial liberalization and financial development increased reliance on external finance, which caused the fragility of the financial system and the effect on its role in economic growth. Policymakers need to target the channels and financial efficiency mechanisms to influence and transform the real economy in all the regions of the country to equally develop goals and economic growth together and ensure stable macroeconomic policies.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a method using particle filter algorithm for the remaining useful life prediction of lithium-ion batteries in communication power supply is carried out, and the comparisons of prediction effect with the least square method are investigated. From the results, it is clearly seen that the proposed particle filter algorithm presents a better prediction accuracy and stability than the least square method. In addition , the proposed particle filter algorithm presents a weak data dependence than the least square method. For a better prediction result, the number of data to be predicted by the proposed particle filter algorithm accounts about 55% of the total number of the cycle time, which is smaller than that accounts 70% by the least square method.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>A large percentage of the cost of most products is related to shipping and distribution costs. By the proper design of the product distribution network, as an important part of the supply chain, these costs can be reduced in the logistic activities. The use of cross-docks between suppliers and customers is a solution utilized in supply chain management to reduce costs. Cross-docks are one of the most important options for reducing time in the supply chain. Accordingly, this paper develops a multi-objective problem of scheduling the operations of trucks entering and exiting cross-docks by considering that the number of products that are unloaded or loaded by trucks is fuzzy logistic. The first objective function minimizes the maximum time to receive the products. The second objective function minimizes the emission cost of trucks. Finally, the third objective function minimizes the number of trucks assigned to the entrance and exit doors. Then, two steps are implemented to validate and modify the proposed model. In the first step, two random numerical examples in small dimensions were solved by GAMS software with min-max objective function as well as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In the second step, due to the increasing dimensions of the problem and computational complexity, the problem in question is part of the NP-Hard problem and therefore multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms are utilized along with validation and parameter adjustment. Therefore, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NSGA) are employed to solve 30 random problems in high dimensions. Then, the algorithms were ranked using the TOPSIS method for each problem according to the results obtained from the evaluation criteria. The analysis of the results confirms the applicability of the proposed model and solution methods.</jats:p>"

Natural gas is also a key driver of industrialization, a requirement for national growth and development. In the Niger Delta, problems with security &amp; sabotage of hydrocarbon liquid evacuation pipelines as well as slippages in gas drilling projects has also led to shortages in gas supply, creating challenges in meeting contractual obligations to customers with attendant loss of revenue in a high oil &amp; gas price regime.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To harness Nigeria huge gas reserve in the current business climate, it is pertinent to arrest declining gas production caused by aging reservoirs &amp; maximize utility of available ullage by accelerating maturation of gas resources. Quickly maturing a gas resource to market has become very important to meet contract shortfalls in the short term and to comply with the recent call for sustainable greener and cleaner energy for environmental reasons on a long term.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Typically, the maturation and development of a gas project/well takes a minimum of two (2) years from identification to execution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Maturation of Alpha-28 well in the Alpha field, a brown field Niger Delta, Nigeria, took about 12 months from identification to execution. This was achieved by adopting a non-conventional project maturation. This leaner approach, which did not lose any aspect of the project assurance intents of the conventional approach, involved proper framing, risk assessment, scaling, flexibility, and proactive engagement of all relevant stakeholders to ensure alignment. This paper discusses what was done differently, the how and the learnings that are planned to be incorporated into future similar projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil exploration poses an inherent risk to water resources and water quality, exemplified by oil spills resulting from  broken  pipelines,  underwater  blowouts  and  oil  transport  vessel  accidents.  In  these  instances,  as  vulnerable  to  spilled oil, water is usually the first casualty, resulting in oil contaminated water. In an effort to ensure the sustainability of freshwater resources resilience in Small Island Developing States, (SIDS), desalination is increasingly used to provide potable water. Thus, oceanic oil spills are of significant relevance to the provision of a guaranteed supply of potable water. Trinidad and Tobago, an oil-producing (SIDS), with considerable oil and gas activities on land and in shallow coastal  waters;  can  become  increasingly  stressed  from  oil  spills,  possibly  leading  to  halting  seawater  intakes  in  the  desalination process. A real-life seawater surface oil spill in the Gulf of Paria, south-west coast of Trinidad, not far from the largest desalination plant in the Caribbean, is investigated using numerical mathematical modelling to model the spill’s movement underwater. The trajectory plots produced and analysed, indicated that depending on key parameters of the oil and the current ambient conditions, an oil plume can travel significantly long horizontal distances underwater before  destabilising. Inferences suggested that oily underwater and existing ambient conditions can potentially affect the desalination equipment. Hence, oil spill modelling is necessary to determine oil trajectory and further inform the decision-making  process  in  determining  the  best  location  for  constructing  desalination  plants  so  as  to  minimise disruption to the island’s domestic freshwater supply in oil spill events.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To quantitatively estimate the risk of power system operation under extreme rainfall, a multi-scenario stochastic risk assessment method is proposed. First, a scenario generation scheme considering waterlogged faults of power facilities is constructed based on the storm water management model (SWMM) and the extreme learning machine method. These scenarios will be merged to several typical scenario sets for further processing. The outage of power facilities will induce power flow transfer which may consequently lead to transmission lines&amp;rsquo; thermal limit violation. Semi-invariant and Gram-Charlier level expansion methods are adopted to analytically depict the probability density function and cumulative probability function of each line&amp;rsquo;s power flow. The optimal solution is performed by a particle swarm algorithm to obtain proper load curtailment at each bus, and consequently the violation probability of line thermal violations can be controlled within an allowable range. The volume of load curtailment as well as their importance are considered to quantitatively access the risk of power supply security under extreme precipitation scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in case studies based on the IEEE 24-bus system.</jats:p>"

In recent decades, a solar photovoltaic-based water pumping system (SPVWPS) has been a more popularly chosen technique for its feasibility and economic solution to the end-users. The initial cost, efficiency, orientation, auxiliary storage, head, and payback period are the technical issues, whereas transportation, lack of skilled people, theft, vandalism community, and politics are the social challenges that may prevent the solar pumps from being widely adopted. However, more subsidies, training, tax breaks, and remote monitoring can make this technology more accessible. Also, this article emphasizes various parameters affecting system performance, such as the suitable selection of panels, power conditioning units, motors, pumps, the payback period of the energy, and cost. Moreover, this article covers the technical and environmental facets of the SPVWPS, which helps researchers, policymakers, manufacturers, and end-users to design and choose a suitable pumping system. Major findings are stand-alone SPVWPS is highly recommended in areas with a maximum of 50 m dynamic head and a minimum of 2,000 m from local grid power. Moreover, along with the 25-year life span of the 25-kW SPVWPS could generate 150 MWh/year and reduce about 86,500 kg of CO2 emissions.</jats:p>",

The method used in this study is the matrix risk assessment to determine the risk ranking by multiplying the possibilities and consequence values. Descriptive analysis approaches and in-depth interviews are needed to identify the types of risks in the supply chain of PT.X. The application of risk assessment consists of five stages: development mapping of supply chains, risk identification, risk assessment, risk response development, and risk response control. The results of this study indicate that three types of extreme risks need to be handled in priorities by providing proposed mitigation, namely bad weather, road accidents, and damaged items.

The rapidness of economic growth gives manufacturers no option but to shorten the product life cycle. Consequently, new versions following product upgrades happen too fast, increasing product returns in the form of End-of-Life (EOL) or End-of-Use returns. This issue has become crucial with a lack of processes for effectively handling product returns in Malaysia; thus, firms often use a third party, although this is considered improper by global standards. Therefore, this research aims to clarify the connection between Institutional Theory and the Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV) Theory in light of CLSC adoption in Malaysia. The findings highlight the role of government in overpowering competitors and customers in adopting a CLSC. The study’s limitations include presenting a formation of ideas that haven’t been previously linked in a research framework, setting the stage for more research in this area.\n </jats:p>"

In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of general contractors and subcontractors, achieve stability, maximize the benefits of the supply chain system, and improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain, it is necessary to design a scientifically reasonable mechanism for benefit distribution to coordinate the relationships between all members. This paper takes the general contractor and subcontractor in the supply chain of the general contracting project as the research objects and uses the Cobb–Douglas function to establish the benefit distribution model of the cooperation between the two in the supply chain system and analyzes the benefit distribution problem of the one-time cooperation and multiple cooperation between the two parties in the two decision-making modes of egoism and collectivism. The results show that in the case of one-time cooperation between general contractors and subcontractors, regardless of the decision mode, the degree of effort of both parties is positively related to their contributions and negatively related to each other’s contributions; the overall benefit of the supply chain system is positively proportional to the degree of contribution of the general contractor and inversely proportional to the share of benefit distribution of the subcontractor. In multiple cooperation, the equilibrium result of both parties achieving Pareto optimality at each stage is that both parties choose to cooperate.</jats:p>"

Officials working in production, distribution, logistics, and warehouse functions in all pharmaceutical registered enterprises in Kenya would be the unit of observation. The study employed census and purposive sampling methods. The data was obtained through the use of a questionnaire. The pilot data was validated for completeness, consistency, and reliability. The collected data was sorted, coded, and then put into the Statistical Package For social sciences (SPSS version 28). Tables were used to present the study's findings.&#x0D;\nResults: The findings revealed that lead time management strategies namely customer integration, supplier rationalization, product standardization, and inventory optimization had a positive significant influence on performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing firms. The study concluded that Pharmaceutical Manufacturing firms in Kenya had implemented the aforementioned lead-time strategies with the aim of improving their firm performance.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Supply chain management theory is advanced by studying lead-time methods and pharmaceutical manufacturing performance. It adds to current understanding by providing Kenyan-specific theoretical and empirical insights. The research also advances operations management theory by studying how lead-time strategies affect pharmaceutical manufacturing organizations. It fills a literature gap by providing insights into Kenya's pharmaceutical sector's operations and results. Kenyan pharmaceutical manufacturers may consider the study's lead-time strategy. With the research's insights, managers can improve supply chain operations, lead times, and operational performance. The study's findings can inform government plans to enhance Kenya's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. By examining lead-time plans and performance, policymakers can target actions to improve the sector's competitiveness, efficiency, and public health. The report underlines the importance of industry standards for pharmaceutical lead time management. The study's findings can help industry groups and regulators set lead-time standards and best practices, improving performance and competitiveness.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess if blockchain technology, which is hailed for its potential to improve supply chain transparency and efficiency, can deliver to this promise (Abreu et al., 2021; Mahyuni et al., 2020; Manzoor et al., 2022; Rennie, 2022; Yiannas, 2018). Supply chains are increasingly complex and full transparency is difficult to achieve and may sometimes be undesired, yet governments worldwide are demanding more transparency especially with respect to the social and environmental sustainability of supply chains (Francisco &amp; Swanson, 2018; Franke, 2021; Najjar, 2021). If blockchain technology allows to close this gap, without compromising corporate confidentiality and efficiency requirements, it might change supply chain management drastically. Most other research in this field remains rather superficial with respect to the fundamentals of blockchain technology and supply chain management. Our study will add to the very limited theoretically founded research on blockchain potentials in supply chains.Study Design: Our paper is conceptual. Based on the extant literature, we compare blockchain technology and its advantages to the characteristics of supply chains and challenges of supply chain management to identify a theoretical fit. We investigate if published case studies of blockchain technology in supply chain management support this. Finally, we devise a conceptual framework for the application of blockchain technology in supply chain management.Findings: There is, currently, very limited use for blockchain technology in supply chain management. It does not provide an answer to several of the challenges that exist in supply chain management. Blockchain technology was primarily devised as encryption technology for virtual entities and transactions involving them and not for tangible objects. Published case studies describing the use of blockchain technology in supply chain management do not contradict these findings.They rely on private blockchain solutions lacking the key benefits of blockchain technology. Our conceptual framework constitutes a reference for a future public blockchain solution for supply chains. It offers solutions for some of the challenges but also cannot solve some fundamental challenges, like power imbalances in supply chains.Limitations: Blockchain technology undergoes rapid development. Future blockchain technology may be faster, less energy-intensive and more integrated with other technologies. This may be aided by developments in hardware, like quantum computing. The findings of this paper are limited to currently available technology.Implications: Companies and governments alike should be very cautious when considering investing in currently available blockchain solutions for supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are advocated as strategies to improve the sustainability of the agro-food system. The recent literature claims that SFSCs are examples of social experimentation and innovation. By scaling up the positive elements of niche alternative food networks, SFSCs can serve as a basis for changing the overall agri-food system. However, their economic impact remains a matter of debate. Local multiplier methods have been used to measure the economic impact of economic sectors at a regional scale. In the case of SFSCs, multiplier methods need to be developed at a local scale and are highly data demanding. This analysis measures the local financial flow created by the MercaTiAmo project by applying the Local Multiplier 3 (LM3) method. MercaTiAmo is organized by a group of citizens and farmers and arranges farmers’ markets three days per week in the city of Parma (northern Italy). To measure the financial flow created by the initiative, data were collected from 10 farmers representing 70% of the farmers participating in the project. The method takes into account the total annual turnover (Round 1), the local expenses of the farmers (Round 2), and the local expenses of the farmers’ suppliers (Round 3). The results suggest that farmers with a higher turnover (Round 1) and percentage of direct expenses in the local area (Round 2) also show higher values of LM3, thus suggesting a higher economic impact, while Round 3 does not affect LM3. The novelty of the study relies on the fact that here the local multiplier method is applied for the first time at the farm level, providing precise information and data on farmers’ upstream supply chain, which can be used to inform policymakers and initiators of SFSCs. Moreover, the study provides a detailed description of the main categories of costs for farmers and which categories of costs are more suited to be locally based. For this reason, the study contributes to the debate on the economic impact of SFSCs in the local area. The method can also be used to provide information to consumers on the economic impact of alternative food networks and local food production.</jats:p>"

Inverter module 5 is a single-phase dc–ac inverter for the 220 VAC power supply of onboard electric loads. Simulations and experiments were carried out under variable load torques and output frequencies for modules 1–4 and under full and no resistive loads for module 5. The measured total input current and total input power of the proposed APS system under the full-load condition are 114.36 A and 68.84 kW. The total efficiency of the proposed APS system (modules 1–5) is 97.05%. The proposed APS system is suitable for 600 VDC low-floor LRVs. The novelty of this research lies in the use of five parallel-connected inverter modules, as opposed to the three-phase output transformer or isolated dc–dc converter in the early and conventional APS systems. Specifically, the proposed APS system requires neither a three-phase output transformer nor an isolated dc–dc converter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The legume-rhizobium interaction induces formation of specific reactions that take metabolism in the host plant up to a new functional level, increasing its tolerance to unfavourable cultivation conditions. Our objective was to study the participation of key enzymes – phenylalanine ammonia lyase, guaiacol peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidases – in the phenol-metabolism processes and synthesis of a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites in soybean plants that have established symbiotic interactions with rhizobia of varying effectiveness during optimal and insufficient water supplies. In our studies, we used symbiotic systems of soybean and rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) that varied in efficiency and virulence. In the period of active nitrogen fixation by soybean, from the third-true-leaf stage until budding, we created different water-supply regimes for the plants, including optimal watering at the level of 60% of full field capacity (control) and insufficient, at the level of 30% (drought). When the soybean was flowering, we recovered the optimal level of water supply (resumed watering). In the studies, we employed microbiological, biochemical, and physiological approaches. We determined the specificity of how key enzymes of the phenol metabolism such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase, polyphenol oxidase and guaiacol peroxidase in the nodules, roots, and leaves of the soybean reacted to different levels of water supply, depending on the functional efficiency of the symbiotic system involving strains of B. japonicum, varying in effectiveness and virulence. In the effective soybean-rhizobium symbiosis, there occurred insignificant changes in the activity of phenol-metabolism enzymes in the nodules, roots, and leaves during drought and after action of the stress. This evidence is that in symbiosis with effective rhizobia B1-20, soybean could realize its own defensive systems that regulate optimal functioning of phenol metabolism in dehydration conditions. In the low-effective 107 and ineffective 604k symbiotic systems of soybean, there was observed unstable dynamics of the activity of enzymes in leaves and roots, manifested in intensification or inhibition of their activity levels during drought or post-stress period. This indicates malfunctioning of the processes associated with phenol metabolism in the soybean plants. We concluded that tolerance of legume-rhizobium symbiosis to water deprivation depends on mutual involvements of the both symbiotic partners – host plant and rhizobia, their ability to fully realize the defensive systems for activation of the key enzymatic complexes taking part in regulation of phenol metabolism in plants.</jats:p>"

These shifts are expected to\nalter the structure and function of grassland and steppe ecosystems and\npresent challenges for land management and crop production in regions\nlike the Northern Great Plains, North America. Precipitation in\nlower-elevation, semi-arid areas provides a local supply of soil water\nthat drives biogeochemical cycling, agricultural production, and\ngroundwater recharge. However, studies of the fate of precipitation are\nfar less common in lower-elevation areas compared to studies of the fate\nof seasonal snowpack and runoff in alpine areas. This research uses\nisotopic composition of water (δ O and δ\nH) to explore the sources and fate of soil water in\nlower elevation areas of the Judith River watershed, in the headwaters\nof the Missouri River in Montana, USA. Extensive non-irrigated crop\nproduction in this area occurs on well-drained soils and depends on\ncareful water management. Agricultural fertilization and organic matter\nmineralization have resulted in excessive nitrate leaching from\ncultivated soils into shallow aquifers and streams. Our observations\nindicate that colder precipitation contributes isotopically distinct\nwater to cultivated terrace soils relative to downgradient groundwaters\nand streams. Riparian waters also exhibit isotopically distinct\ncontributions from colder precipitation. Apparent contributions from\ncolder precipitation in terrace and riparian soil waters suggest that\nsnowmelt is an important component of water supply to these systems. In\nriparian waters, influence of evaporation is also evident, suggesting\nsufficient residence times and atmospheric exposure for local processing\nto occur. The evolution of isotopic composition from soils to shallow\naquifers to stream corridors indicates source water partitioning as\nprecipitation moves through a semi-arid agricultural landscape. Mixing\nprocesses apparent in landscape water isotopic compositions reveal\nsource water dynamics that facilitate plant uptake, solute processing,\nand contaminant leaching.</jats:p>"

The emphasis on innovation in healthcare has been increasing in recent years due to challenges such as rising costs and an aging population. Innovation, which is of vital importance for the health sector, becomes one of the main determinants of social welfare and quality of life with the innovations and advances it brings. Innovative products and services increase the possibilities of early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing future costs. In this way, alternative solution options can be created for the benefit of the patient, with the increase efficiency of the health system in the long term. In addition, positive externalities can be provided to many health related sectors. With innovation, it is possible to produce cheap and accessible solutions by using advanced technologies in health services where resources are very limited.In this study, it is aimed to draw a conceptual framework on innovation and health innovation and to explain the innovations in health service supply within the framework of the Health Transformation Program put into practice in 2003. In recent years, significant changes have been made in the Turkish health system, especially in the financing, presentation and organization of the service within the scope of health innovation. Although significant progress has been made in the health system with the impact of these changes, there is still some work to be done. As a result of the study, what has been done has been evaluated and recommendations and suggestions have been made about what should be done.</jats:p>"

Due to environmental and health concerns, the use of lead has been restricted in the last years. As lead-free brass alloys are progressively implemented in the industry, challenges arise due to their differing properties from traditional leaded brass alloys. One of the main challenges in automated continuous cutting processes is the worse chip breakability of lead-free brass alloys leading to longer and tangled chips. Hence, the impact of a high-pressure cutting fluid supply, as well as the impact of a chip-breaking geometry and the combined effect of both, has been investigated at different feeds. The three brass alloys CuZn37 (CW508L), CuZn38As (CW511L), and CuZn42 (CW510L) were studied at varying cutting fluid supply pressure levels and feed rates in a radial cutting operation. Cutting forces were measured, and chips were analyzed. No overall systematic impact of the cutting fluid supply pressure on the cutting forces was observed. In conclusion, increased pressure levels, a chip-breaking geometry, and an increased feed rate enhance the chip breakability of the investigated alloys.</jats:p>"

The influence of green innovation capability on enterprise profit, product greenness and marketing investment is analyzed by numerical simulation. The results show that if an enterprise increases the unit cost coefficient of green innovation, it will reduce the green input of all members of the supply chain; When consumers’ green preference is low, manufacturers will tend to increase investment in green marketing; Cost-sharing contracts can promote the overall green degree of products.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to disruptions due to the complex and interconnected nature of global business operations. Supply chain nervousness (SCN) leads to inefficiencies and disruptions in the flow of goods and services. Managing SCN is critical for sustaining the continuity of business operations in today’s dynamic and uncertain business environment. To address this issue, this study proposes a strategic framework that integrates key components of supply chain nervousness management and establishes a robust framework that prioritizes these factors based on their relative importance. By incorporating the fuzzy-ELECTRE methodology into the analysis, the proposed framework acknowledges the inherent uncertainties and imprecisions present in supply chain disruptions. It offers a systematic and comprehensive approach to prioritizing and managing SCN factors, considering both qualitative and quantitative assessments. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study is conducted in a real-world supply chain context. The results highlight demand variability as the factor with the greatest impact on SCN. Moreover, the results demonstrate the framework’s ability to effectively manage SCN by providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers seeking to understand the causes of supply chain nervousness and mitigate its impact. The contributions of this research lie in providing decision-makers with a strategic framework for disruption management under fuzzy environments. The proposed approach enhances the understanding of SCN and enables proactive decision making to mitigate its negative consequences.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: Strategic inventory refers to the inventory held by firms purely out of strategic considerations other than operational reasons (e.g., economies of scale). In this paper, we investigate the roles of strategic inventory in a system with two parallel supply chains under both full bargaining and partial bargaining, which differ in whether inventory is included in the bargaining terms. Methodology/results: (i) Under full bargaining, horizontal competition can induce an asymmetric equilibrium, whereby only one of the chains carries strategic inventory and benefits from it when the holding cost is small. The whole system, however, is worse off. (ii) Under partial bargaining, regardless of whether there is horizontal competition, the retailer in a supply chain always carries inventory when his bargaining power is small and the inventory holding cost is low. Furthermore, with horizontal competition, inventory hurts (improves) the system performance when the inventory holding cost is small (above a threshold and not too big). (iii) Full bargaining can be inferior to partial bargaining when there is horizontal competition. Managerial implications: The conventional wisdom about strategic inventory should be taken with caution. Specifically, the traditional role of strategic inventory empowering the retailer in a supply chain is completely dominated by the full bargaining framework, yet it is still present if inventory is not bargained. The inventory driven by horizontal competition plays a different strategic role of signaling to the competitor to avoid an otherwise adverse quantity competition if both retailers carried high inventory. Furthermore, despite the full cooperation nature of the full bargaining framework, it is not always in the retailer’s interest to give up the decision power on inventory (partial bargaining) and include it in the negotiation process (full bargaining).</jats:p><jats:p>Funding: Q.

Through local point-to-point communication between multi-agents and considering the random communication delay of the system, the utility function is maximized based on the consistency theory, and the optimal price and order quantity are determined. The proposed algorithm is distributed and collaborative, which avoids the centralized demand for all node information and the drawbacks of system paralysis caused by node failure. In addition, we carried out a numerical simulation to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-agent consensus theory in the stable operation of supply and demand within a supply chain when there is a random communication delay and the sudden failure of a supply chain enterprise. It further explains how the coefficient of consumer sensitivity to price affects pricing and order/production strategies.</jats:p>"

Early fault detection prevents some eventual damage to the PMSM and lowers repair costs. This article discusses the detection of supply faults and short circuit faults between turns for the control of synchronous motors with permanent magnets via input-output linearization without a speed sensor in order to accomplish this goal. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) will estimate this. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the steady state, and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the associated energy for the non-stationary state of the electrical variables under study will both be used in the defect detection procedure. To differentiate between turn to turn short-circuits and unbalanced power supply faults, the stator resistance will also be estimated using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulated fault detection and sensorless control algorithms are demonstrated for effectiveness in the MATLAB/Simulink system softaware.</jats:p>"

By increasing their lending volumes, banks will be able to expand their money supply, which will result in a boost to the economy's overall performance. Therefore, substantial research has been carried out to identify the relationship among bank loans as well as economic progress. This study aims to analyze the link among loan volume &amp; money supply in the economy of Azerbaijan. As a method, FMOLS, DOLS and Granger Causality tests, which show co-integration, causality and correlation coefficient from econometric models, were chosen for the data containing quarterly time series of 2006:M1-2021:M9 period. There is a one-way causal connection between money supply and domestic credit volume, so there is a one-way causal correlation among economic growth and domestic credit volume resulting from the findings. It was also discovered that there is a long-term link between the quantity of money and credit accessible to citizens in their nation and the rate at which their economy expands. On the basis of FMOLS test, a 1 percent increase in domestic loan volume results in a 1.078183 percent increase in the money supply. (1.022554 according to DOLS). Performing the FMOLS test does not affect economic development. The FMOLS test found that for every one percent increase in domestic loan volume, economic growth improves by 0.44243 percentage points, based on the number of domestic loans (0.439953 percent according to DOLS).</jats:p>"

It has led to unprecedented economic crisis in countries around the world. The tourism sector isn’t an exception to its devastating impacts. The virus has succeeded in affecting not just the economy. In addition to such, job opportunities, and regional developments in local communities have been greatly affected. Tourism throughout the world has been stagnant since the month of April 2020 due to the advent of COVID-19. Given this temporary problem, economies and employment rates have been affected to a great extent. Also, local communities around the world are struggling to survive. In most countries, 50% the revenue generated from exports is contributed by tourism. This means it is a major contributor of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) as well as employment. The major aim of this paper is to carry out an objective review that can enable researchers and experts understand as well as manage the impacts of COVID-19 on tourism. For this to be achieved, this paper discussed the transformational opportunities presented by COVID-19 including questions that it raises. The paper attempts to identify pre-assumptions, institutions, and fundamental values which the tourism industry including other academia need to challenge for development to be achieved. Furthermore, the paper discusses the major impacts, experiences and behaviors being experienced by the 3 stakeholders in the tourism industry – social cost, supply, and demand. Just as measures have been adopted by countries to ameliorate the situation, recommendations have been put forward to ensure speedy recovery of the sector.</jats:p>"

North American EV manufacturing is driven by initiatives such as the battery belt in the US and Canada’s commitment to clean technology. Mexico, as a major auto-component manufacturer and producer of critical minerals, holds a significant role in supporting the regional supply chain. However, recent developments in Mexican natural resource policy, including the nationalization of lithium deposits and exploration moratoriums, present challenges for foreign miners operating in Mexico, including the risk of future limited participation in the mining sector.\nCanadian miners hold a dominant role in Mexican mineral exploration, and Mexico is Canada’s third-largest trading partner. The political landscape in Mexico, with the ruling Morena party controlling both the national government and majority of state governments, further complicates the situation. Policy changes in 2023 to the mining sector’s regulatory requirements are the most significant reforms to the sector since the early 1990s. The reforms are in response to prominent, long-standing grievances from various non-industry stakeholders and seek to mitigate against future negative social and environmental impacts of mining. The reforms include shorter mining concession permits, stricter environmental impact assessments, and new permitting procedures on water use.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

Configuration (A) is one pressure vessel containing one spiral wound membrane (SWM), (B) is four pressure vessels each containing one SWM connected in parallel, and (C) is one pressure vessel containing four membranes connected in parallel. The effect of applied pressure, temperature, and water salinity is studied. Moreover, a mathematical model using ANSYS Fluent was developed and verified using the experimental data. The mathematical model is applied to an idealized case of an actual desalination plant. The main findings are (1) configurations (B) and (C) accomplished higher permeate discharge comparing to (A) by an average percentage of 60 and 50, respectively, while (C) has the lowest output salinity by 30% from configuration (A).

One of the key challenges in the development of the ITER is the complex electrical grid that is required to support its operations. To address this challenge, a digital twin (DT) of the Central Solenoid (CS) Converter Power Supply grid has to be developed, and real-time simulation strategies have been proposed to monitor and study the performance of the ITER grid. Real-time simulation strategies allow for continuous feedback on the performance of the grid, enabling the quick identification and resolution of issues. However, it is not always possible to perform real-time simulation easily in a real-time simulator; therefore, specific strategies have to be implemented in the DT. This paper focuses on decoupling lines and explicit partitioning as solutions to allow the real-time simulation of the CS Converter Power Supply grid with two converter units (CUs), as required by the ITER Organization (IO). As will be shown later in this article, the proposed approach is progressive and applicable to a more complex grid with multiple CUs. The results concerning the proposed strategies will be analyzed and discussed in terms of real-time performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The productivity levels of the Canadian egg industry have increased over the years, including hen productivity and feed conversion efficiency. Moreover, genetic improvements combined with improved feed and light management have recently resulted in hens potentially being able to produce 500 eggs in an 80-week laying cycle. Nevertheless, most egg farms in Canada are still on a 51-week production cycle despite high hen productivity levels at culling. Lack of economic impact information, combined with the fact that egg production is under supply management in Canada and that farmers are paid their cost of production reduces the incentive to extend laying cycles despite the savings associated with lower rates of flock replacement. On the other hand, a greater percentage of large eggs is beneficial to the value chain, and the use of fewer resources per egg associated with longer laying cycles generates environmental benefits. This article analyzes the economic sustainability of extending laying cycles in Canada by combining partial budgeting analysis based on farm-level data with a non-linear mathematical programming model to assess the economic costs and benefits of extending laying cycles, while taking into consideration the policy context of supply management in Canada. The results suggest that, for hens housed in an aviary, extending the laying cycles from 51 to 64 weeks would increase profits by approximately 6% per year over a 5-year period. Our optimization model forecast that a laying cycle of 71 weeks would be economically optimal, with an average productivity of 6.7 eggs per hen per week and a cumulative mortality rate of 5.53%. This article, through an innovative methodological approach that combines partial budgeting and non-linear mathematical programming models, generates information to help the egg industry stakeholders to make informed decisions on extending laying cycles while considering the policy context of supply management in Canada.</jats:p>"

It addresses the integration of strategic location, tactical inventory, and operational routing decisions. Additionally, it takes into consideration the specific characteristics of perishable products, including their shelf life, inventory management, and transportation damages. The main objective is to minimize the overall supply chain cost. To achieve this, a nonlinear mixed integer programming model is developed for the multi-echelon, multi-product, and multi-period location-inventory-routing problem (LIRP) in the PPSCN. Two hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple population genetic algorithm (MPGA), are hybridized with variable neighborhood search (VNS) and proposed to solve this NP-hard problem. Moreover, a novel coding method is devised to represent the complex structure of the LIRP problem. The input parameters are tuned using the Taguchi experimental design method, considering the sensitivity of meta-heuristic algorithms to these parameters. Through experiments of various scales, the hybrid MPGA with VNS indicates superior performance, as evidenced by the experimental results. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the influence of key model parameters on the optimal objective, providing valuable management implications. The results clearly validate the efficacy of the proposed model and solution method as a reliable tool for optimizing the design problem of the PPSCN.</jats:p>"

As BEVs can be operated with renewable electricity, the CO2−eq emissions of the supply chain are relevant for future mitigation. The aim of this paper is to derive emission-intensity pathways and to determine the decarbonization impact regarding the lifecycle emissions of BEVs. Therefore, an analysis for steel, aluminum, battery cells, plastic, and glass, and an evaluation of the literature containing present emission intensities (e.g., for steel 1.7 tCO2/t to 2.8 tCO2/t) and reduction potentials, were performed. Based on low-carbon electricity, circular materials, and recycling, as well as technological improvements, emission intensities can be decreased by 69% to 91% by 2050. As a result, the carbon footprint of the reviewed vehicles can be reduced by 47% for supply chain emissions, whereas 25% to 37% of the total lifecycle emissions remain. Considering the scenario studied, BEVs cannot be decarbonized aligned to the 1.5 °C pathway using only avoidance and reduction measures until 2050. Consequently, the application of carbon removals is necessary. However, the applied trajectory and extrapolation relies on material availability and does not consider abatement costs.</jats:p>"

Since the Fukushima coastal river basins include large decontaminated and evacuation order areas, considering the decontamination work and resumption of agriculture is important for predicting the 137Cs supply. We conducted a 30-year prediction of the 137Cs supply from the Fukushima coastal rivers to the ocean using a distributed radiocesium prediction model, considering the effects of human activities. In river basins with decontaminated and evacuation order areas, human activities reduced the total 137Cs outflow from agricultural lands, urban lands, and forest areas to the rivers and the 137Cs supply to the ocean by 5.0% and 6.0%, respectively. These results indicated that human activities slightly impacted the 137Cs outflow and supply. The 137Cs supply from rivers impacted by the accident to the coastal sediment was estimated to correspond to 11–36% of the total 137Cs in the coastal sediment in the early phase of the accident. Therefore, the 137Cs supply from rivers to the ocean is important for the long-term behavior of 137Cs in coastal sediment.</jats:p>"

The article presents the results of experimental investigation of the ST-40M Hall thruster modification developed by the Space Electric Thruster Systems (SETS). The thruster used a new filament hollow cathode with an emitting insert made of lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). The use of a new hollow cathode made it possible to study the thruster’s parameters in the discharge power range of 300 – 550 W. The investigation was carried out using a stabilized voltage supply as a discharge power supply. As a result of experimental investigation, the current-voltage characteristics of the discharge in the accelerating channel of the thruster were obtained at fixed values of the anode’s mass flow rate of the working gas - xenon. The experimental dependences of thrust on the anode’s mass flow rate of the working substance and the discharge voltage, as well as the dependences of the specific impulse and thruster efficiency on the discharge voltage, are obtained. Experimental studies have shown that with a change in the discharge voltage in the range of 250 – 400 V and a change in the mass flow rate of the working gas in the range of 0.9 – 2.2 mg/s, the thruster provides a thrust value of 12 – 33 mN, a specific impulse value of 1200 – 1800 s, and the maximum value of the anode’s efficiency is 48 – 52%. The article also contains oscillogramsillustratingtherepeatedprocessofthethrusterstarting. Experimentalinvestigationofthemodified thruster ST-40M with the new hexaboride hollow cathode showed a significant improvement in thruster parameters compared to the prototype parameter before modification. In the process of experimental investigation, it was found that in some modes of the thruster operation, significant fluctuations in the discharge current occur, which led to a significant decreasing in the thruster parameters. For a more accurate clarification of the nature and parameters of the discharge current oscillations, it is necessary to conduct additional studies. The obtained experimental parameters of the modified ST-40M thruster made it possible to determine the values of its optimal parameters for various space missions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This research work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of these technologies and systems in improving the overall supply chain safety management of the organization. The goal of the study is to assess how well these systems’ and technologies’ integration have improved the organization’s overall supply chain safety management. The study also reveals that the successful implementation of these systems requires a holistic approach, involving organizational culture, training, and change management. The results indicate that the integration of these technologies and systems has significantly improved the company’s asset utilization, customer satisfaction, inventory management, transportation efficiency, and overall supply chain safety management. While the implementation of these technologies can be costly and time-consuming, the benefits of enhanced supply chain security can be far greater. The findings of this research can provide insights and guidelines for other companies in their pursuit of achieving effective supply chain safety management through the integration of technologies supporting supply chain safety management, EAM, CRM, WMS, TMS, and RPM systems.</jats:p>",

Raw rubber production involves various stakeholders; however, literature focusing on the social impacts of the supply chains of raw rubber production has hereto been absent. Social life cycle assessment, a popular tool to assess the social impacts of a product or process and was deployed herein to assess the social profiles of three Sri Lankan raw rubber supply chains (crepe rubber, concentrated latex, and ribbed smoked sheets) in a cradle-to-gate manner. The Social Hotspots Database v4 on Sima Pro v9.3 was used for the analysis. Results indicated that Governance, Labour rights &amp; decent work had been affected due to Corruption and Freedom of association &amp; collective bargaining issues, mainly in Belarus and China. Proposed improvement options to address these touchpoints were found to be effective. If the importation of K-fertilizer shifted into countries with lower risks, such as Canada, Israel, and Lithuania, overall social risks associated with Corruption and Freedom of association &amp; collective bargaining could be reduced by ca. 36% and 25%, respectively. As a result, social risks in the impact described above categories, i.e., Governance and Labor rights &amp; decent work, were reduced by ca. 35–41% and ca. 17–20%, respectively. Managers may pay thorough attention to the hotspots identified herein in the first place and try to avoid them as much as possible. They may consider importation from the aforesaid low-risk countries while weighing the trade-offs with economic and environmental aspects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organisational resilience has been identified as one of the critical factors in developing sustainable supply chains. To date, extant research discusses the role of dynamic capabilities in enhancing organisational resilience, particularly in developing and reconfiguring internal and external resources to address the changing business environment. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to exploring the impact of buying firms’ leadership (or supply chain leadership) on the existing relationships between dynamic capabilities and organisational resilience. As a firm’s performance has a significant impact on its entire supply network (in both upstream and downstream orientations), the responsibility to improve organisational resilience could be extended to the buying or focal firms, particularly during unprecedented times such as the pandemic. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework for examining the impact of dynamic capabilities and organisational resilience. In general, this study suggests that dynamic capabilities (adaptive, absorptive, and innovative capabilities) have a significant impact on organisational resilience. Furthermore, this study proposes that supply chain leadership moderates the relationship between dynamic capabilities (adaptive, absorptive, and innovative capabilities) and organisational resilience. It is expected that this study will facilitate discussions on the need to deepen the comprehension of supply chain leadership and its influence on dynamic capabilities and organisational resilience. The study contributes to the existing literature by addressing the gaps between supply chain leadership, dynamic capabilities, and organisational resilience domains.</jats:p>"

Empirical results show that the higher the concentration of the supply chain, the lower the investment of enterprises in digital transformation. In addition, further exploring the impact of the concentration of upstream and downstream partners in the supply chain on digital transformation, it is concluded that the concentration of downstream customers has a more significant negative correlation.

With the looming climate crisis, the world must rapidly wean itself from these resources in favor of others that emit little to no greenhouse gasses. And while this energy transition will likely have profound social implications, it has only recently begun to receive sustained attention from sociologists across subfields. Consequently, although debates have emphasized the technological and market dimensions of this shift, its relational dimensions and human aspects have remained relatively marginal. In this article, we review research on the social impacts of fossil fuel production and transitions to renewables. Such work is critical and urgent, since the main barriers to combating the climate crisis are neither technological nor economic; they are, instead, deeply social.</jats:p>",

This study thereby investigates the technical efficiency of cocoa farmers in Ghana. The study uses cross sectional field data covering Western North, Ashanti, Eastern, Volta and Brong-Ahafo regions of Ghana on a sample of 899 cocoa farmers and adopts Meta frontier stochastic frontier analysis to derive production efficiencies for each region. The findings are that supply-side interventions such as hand pollination, hybrid seedlings, farm pruning and extension services can improve on technical efficiency of cocoa farmers, more especially in Ashanti, Eastern and Western region. Notably, the CODAPEC input support programme which encapsulates insecticides and fungicides spraying has failed to improve on production efficiency as compared to the Hi-Tech (fertilizer application) programme. Eastern region cocoa farmers stand out as the most efficient producers, producing about 87% of their potential output given technology, whereas Western North produces 76% of its output potential, the lowest of the five regions. The three other regions, namely, Brong-Ahafo, Ashanti and Volta can produce on average 83%, 80% and 78% of their output potential in cocoa respectively. Averagely, cocoa growing regions are underutilizing 21.5% of available technology in the industry while losing 36.5% of output potential due to technical inefficiencies.</jats:p>"

This paper tests the varied trajectory of agricultural total factor productivity (ATFP) in Jiangsu Province over the past 21 years.

The paper introduces environmental variables such as urbanization level, import and export trade, financial support for agriculture, and transportation convenience. The research results show that: (1) the ATFP growth in Jiangsu Province presents a fluctuating trend; (2) The further sub-index research of ATFP in Jiangsu Province shows that the average rate of growth for agricultural technology efficiency (AEC) in Jiangsu is negative, indicating that the input cost of agricultural factors in Jiangsu increases and marginal efficiency decreases; (3) The empirical analysis of ATFP growth by region shows that there are still large differences in agricultural economic development level, the level of modern agricultural technology and ATFP in the southern, the central and the northern parts of Jiangsu. (4) Stage III: DEA empirical results showed that improving urbanization level, net export trade, and transportation convenience is conducive to improving agricultural production efficiency; financial support for agriculture is weakly conducive to improving agricultural production efficiency.

Cibuntu tofu industry is one of the well-known tofu industry centers in Bandung and is an association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) that produce tofu from 16 small-scale to industrial-scale craftsmen. The problem of the availability of local soybean raw materials that are experiencing scarcity has an impact on other problems such as soaring raw material prices so that production costs increase in price, which then the selling price of tofu products on the market becomes expensive. This activity in manufacturing does not have a green supply chain concept which causes several problems such as the impact of wastewater from boiling raw materials on local residents. Performance design is carried out using the GreenSCOR model, by weighting performance indicators using the AHP method using Expert Choice software. Based on the results of the assessment carried out, the overall performance value of the green supply chain of the Cibuntu tofu industry is in the Good category. However, the company must further improve some performance indicators that are still considered unsatisfactory. The results of the performance indicator assessment there are 12 KPIs that are still below the target, where improvements must be made in order to improve the company's performance by providing recommendations for improvements to performance indicators that are still below the assessment standard&#x0D;\nAbstrak.

The objective of this paper is to review modern gas fuel supply systems and analyze their efficiency. The goal is to determine the most important parameters of gas fuel that affect the stability of the working process of marine dual-fuel engines and ways to maintain them within the specified limits. Evaluation of the gas fuel preparation efficiency is carried out on the basis of operational data obtained on the gas carrier vessel board. Data collection is carried out under non-standard operating conditions, which makes it possible to evaluate the quality of the resulting gas fuel with a time-varying composition of the initial natural gas. To analyze the obtained data, modern software, which is used by leading developers of marine diesel engines, is used (Wartsila Methane Number Calculator, AVL BoostTM and Python 3 statistic libraries). The analysis results are approximated for gas fuel supply systems for gas-fueled vessels, but not being gas carriers. This approximation is made taking into account the design features of gas fuel supply systems, since the specificity of the design imposes certain restrictions on the applicability of the conclusions obtained as a result of the previous analysis. Also, attention is paid to the accumulation of residual heavy hydrocarbons in bunker tanks, the excess of which can adversely affect the quality of gas fuel. Since there is no universal way to solve this problem, only general assumptions about possible ways to dispose of them have been made. </jats:p>"

Supply terms are progressively changing from long-term and binding contracts to shorter-term and flexible clauses, taking into consideration demand uncertainties. This context is making heavy investments in the LNG infrastructure risky, costly, and irreversible. The focus is shifting towards small-scale midstream facilities to develop small-size markets. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the LNG supply chain from an infrastructure investment approach based on market size and recent technological developments in the field. It addresses the limitations of the classic conducted supply chain and investigates best practices adapted to emerging markets. If properly executed, these logistics alternatives enable emerging markets to access LNG in a short period with lower investment. The objective is to maximize added value while minimizing cost and operational risks. This work suggests an alternative supply chain process replacing onshore terminals and pipeline delivery by Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FRSU) and truck delivery in the midstream market. A SWOT analysis is conducted for the alternative supply chain model, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses alongside opportunities and threats.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Greater access to finance by SMEs in developing countries is one of the most import powerful strategies to reduce poverty and unemployment issues and promote economic growth. The main objective of this study is to construct financial inclusion index for SMEs and identify the determinants of SMEs’ financial inclusion. The data are collected from the primary survey conducted in Sabaragamuwa province using the Stratified Random sampling method to achieve the abovementioned aims. A sample of 139 SMEs is used to analyze the data from a well-structured questionnaire. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Regression Analysis are applied to construct an index and identifying factors. The study’s findings reveal that the financial inclusion index for SMEs is weighted equally by access and quality of the financial services as the pillars. Further, the financial inclusion of SMEs is mainly determined by demand-side factors (ability to manage economic changes, proffer record keeping, and willingness to expand the business), supply-side factors (collateral requirements and application procedure), institutional factors (ownership type and sector of the firm), and some demographic characteristics of owner-manager of SMEs. The study recommends that the state bankers, commercial bankers, and policymakers should put in place policies that encourage financial service providers to set up their operations close and incorporate innovative approaches to ensure that they adopt technologies and financial services that are more accessible. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing global use of technology in everyday chores has raised the need for electric power in our lives the need for constant power thereby becomes very paramount for the smooth running of modern systems. In Nigeria incessant outages have led to failures in systems and sometimes lives, necessitating the use of multiple sources of power for homes, offices and industries, each of which costs differently to use. This work presents the design and implementation of a microcontroller based multiple source power selector with priority selector. The inclusion of priority selection means each source can be selected for use based on its cost or quality/availability. When cost is prioritized by selection then mains power is first selected for use before generator, and when both are absent then solar is optionally available for selection. When uninterruptible power (UP) is prioritized then the source with better quality is selected for use. The three sources are each stepped down using three separate step down transformers, The output of which are rectified and sampled to an ATmega328 microcontroller which is programmed using C++ language to select the most appropriate output based on the Cost or quality/availability, the microcontroller commands relays that perform the switching action i.e. connecting the load to the most appropriate source. The system was simulated in Proteus simulation environment, Simulation result show that in all cases of performance the source that is supplied to the output is based on the priority mode selected. This system can be used in economy mode for homes where cost of power is the criteria while in hospitals the UP-priority mode is recommended because availability is what matters. This device reduces the possibility of complete power outage in the event of a power failure in any specific source. Users can connect their electronic gadgets to the device, which reduces the response time needed to switch from one power source to another.</jats:p>"

In addition, today’s consumer has a complex consumption behavior, is increasingly well informed, knows what he wants to receive and reacts quite firmly if his expectations are not considered by suppliers. For these reasons, at the level of specialized literature but also at the level of business practice, an innovative business philosophy, called the bullwhip effect, according to which demand variation or amplification, is progressive augmentation or diminishing of the demand, has become increasingly interesting to study. That is ascendingly propagating within the supply chain driving order variation to grow exponentially from the final consumer to the raw material supplier. The main thematic axes analyzed during this paper concerned: supply chains growing complexity both as an effect and a cause of the asymmetries that are observed at the level of demand-offer equilibrium; relevant correlations and causal relationships identifiable between the determinants of the general or specific environment in which a company is operating and the optimization together with the efficiency of the activities developed by it can be anticipated by adopting various business models; how distorted demand is propagating within the supply chain; the bullwhip effect as an amplification phenomenon inside the supply chain. The authors of this paper opted for a combination of positivist-type research, prioritizing the main causes of the bullwhip effect, and a phenomenological-type research, during which the most robust of the correlations supporting the starting hypotheses were highlighted. Therefore, we believe that increased attention to minimizing the bullwhip effect within organizations will lead to improved performance of supply chains and, implicitly, of the companies involved. This remains an area of significant interest in scientific research as well as in the practice of commercial entities focused on increasing profits.</jats:p>",

Disruptive events often impede this flow due to confounding factors, which may not be identified immediately. The objective of this study is to assess supply chain risks by detecting significant risks, examining risk variations across different time phases and establishing risk sentiment relationships utilizing textual data. We examined two disruptive events—coronavirus disease 2019 (Omicron phase) and the Ukraine–Russia war—between November 2021 and April 2022. Data sources included news media and Twitter. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm was applied to the textual data to extract potential text-generated risks in the form of “topics.” A proportion of these risks were analyzed to assess their time-varying nature. Natural language processing-based sentiment analysis was applied to these risks to infer the sentiment coming from the media using the ordered probit model. The results identify various unnoticed risks, for example: logistics tension, supply chain resiliency, ripple effect, regional supply chain, etc. that may adversely affect supply chain operations if not considered. The outcomes also indicate that textual data sources are capable of capturing risks before the events actually occur. The outcomes further suggest that text data could be valuable for strategic decision making and improving supply chain visibility.</jats:p>"

Based on the data of 267 manufacturing companies in China Growth Enterprise Market from 2015 to 2019, the DEA-SBM method was used to measure the comprehensive innovation efficiency of different companies, and it was further decomposed into technological innovation efficiency and organizational innovation efficiency. Afterwards, it conducts an empirical analysis through the double fixed effect model, and explores the difference in the impact of supply chain finance on innovation efficiency in enterprises with different industries and different property rights. The results show that supply chain financial services have a strong positive impact on the comprehensive innovation efficiency, technological innovation efficiency and organizational innovation efficiency of manufacturing SMEs. Further, supply chain finance has the most significant improvement on the technological innovation efficiency of the sample of private traditional enterprises, but it has a significant inhibitory effect on the organizational innovation efficiency of the sample of state-owned high-tech enterprises. Therefore, this paper suggests that the development of supply chain financial services should increase support for traditional manufacturing industries; appropriately tilt resources to private enterprises; improve relevant supply chain financial laws and regulations, establish and improve corresponding institutional arrangements, and encourage state-owned enterprises to participate in market competition.</jats:p>"

This study derived an optimum two-dimensional rule curve to jointly operate the parallel reservoirs of Mosul and Dukan, Northern Iraq. A hybridized optimization technique combining conventional dynamic programming with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm (SCE-UA) was developed to solve this problem. The results showed that the proportion of normal water supply areas increased from the beginning of the flood season (October) to its highest levels in April (58.77% of the total water supply area). The proportion decreased to its lowest in September (25.04% of the total water supply area). The newly derived 2D rule cure was compared with the current operation policy and was found to optimize the amount of water shortage by 21.1% during the operational period. It also reduced the shortage period and avoided catastrophic water shortages during droughts. In addition, the developed model optimized the amounts of water more than the joint water requirements, suffering from a significant deficit in meeting the demand during some months of the operational years. As a result, the storage in each reservoir was improved and thence can be adapted to face water shortages during future climate changes. This study proved the new hybridized model's applicability and can serve as a tool for sustainable water management. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2023-09-07-016 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Iranian saffron products hold a unique place in the global market as the most highly valued agricultural and medicinal commodities. The various uses of saffron make it clear that there is a need for special attention to the supply chain network. Unfortunately, the absence of an integrated supply chain network within the saffron industry has resulted in significant challenges related to supply management and demand fulfillment. Addressing real-world uncertainties is paramount when developing models for optimization problems. Therefore, this research proposes a multi-objective optimization model for designing a saffron supply chain network under uncertainty. The model objectives are to decrease the total cost of the supply chain, increase job opportunities and economic development in regions, and improve the quality of products. The proposed mathematical model is solved using the interactive fuzzy method to deal with multiple functions. Furthermore, possibilistic chance constrained programming is employed to effectively manage uncertain variables such as demand, cost, and social parameters within the model. To demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed model and solution method, a real case study was conducted in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran. Additionally, because of the complexity of the proposed model in large-scale networks, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and multi-objective simulated annealing algorithms are proposed. Different parameters are analyzed to determine their impact on the results so that decision-makers can choose values more accurately. The sensitivity analysis and statistical tests performed on the results support the performance of the proposed model. Overall, the results demonstrate that the exact method and metaheuristic algorithms are capable of solving the problem in different dimensions. The computational results derived from this model offer invaluable managerial insights, empowering decision-makers to align their strategies and preferences more effectively.</jats:p>",

Our findings are as follows. (1) The threshold for the retailer to participate in the game during peak season is greater than that in the off-season, while the manufacturer's threshold is the opposite. (2) The platform should reduce commissions during peak season, factories should reduce wholesale prices, and the retailer should increase sales price. (3) The increase in price sensitivity coefficient, inventory cost and production cost are all detrimental to the platform, whereas an increase in the cross-price sensitivity coefficient is usually beneficial. (4) Whether it is the peak season or the off-season, the increase in demand fluctuations is bad for all chain members.</jats:p>"

A mixed integer programming model is established to maximize the efficiency of the supply chain network. The innovation of this paper, first, is to consider the impact of economic, environmental and social benefits in a continuous supply chain, where the environmental benefits not only consider carbon emissions but also include the emissions of plant wastewater, waste and solid waste as influencing factors. Second, a multi-objective fuzzy affiliation function is constructed to measure the quality of the model solution in terms of the overall satisfaction value. Finally, the chaotic particle ant colony algorithm is proposed, and the problem of premature convergence in the operation of the particle swarm algorithm is solved. Experimental results show that the PSCACO algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with MOPSO, CACO and NSGA-II algorithms, and the convergence effect of the algorithm is concluded to be more effective to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of chaotic particle ant colony algorithm for solving multi-objective functions, which proposes a new feasible solution for the supply chain management.</jats:p>"

In contrast, the energy demand is high and continuously increasing. An energy supply chain model is studied with a waste-supplier and an energy-supplier. The waste-supplier collects wastes and transfers them to the energy-supplier for energy conversion. This energy chain is managed among players and studied how the energy can be distributed to consumers such that no shortage of energy occurs. The model is formulated on the different waste and energy cycles. The supply chain’s minimum total cost is acquired using the optimum cycle length of the energy cycle. The model is solved with a classical optimization method. The closed-form solution is obtained with the global minimum cost. The numerical assessment is investigated to prove the validity of the proposed study. Through the numerical findings and sensitivity exploration, several managerial insights are provided. The numerical investigation obtains that the recommended strategy can provide a non-shortage benefit of energy allotment. The total cost can be saved up to 93.82% for the renewable energy conversion with the same energy and waste cycle with no discarded wastes. For different energy and waste cycle with no discarded wastes, the total cost can be reduced by 21.83%.</jats:p>",

In this context, blockchain technology (BCT) solves the bullwhip effect problem, as it supports distributed networking, information synchronization among nodes, digital encryption, traceable information, and unchangeable block content. This paper proposes using public blockchain to solve the bullwhip effect problem in the supply chain (SC), which has yet to be discussed in published academic research papers. To this end, a framework has been developed to determine the readiness of a supply chain for blockchain adoption. This framework includes a checklist to evaluate the motivation, timing, and appropriate platform for adopting blockchain. The framework has been validated using a case study of personal computer devices, which were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and resulted in semiconductors supply chain disruption. The study involved polling four executives The study involved polling four executives (of large organizations in Egypt and some Middle Eastern countries) representing different stages in the supply chain, they are retail, distribution, manufacturing, and supply. The results showed that while the executives recognized the benefits of adopting blockchain, they were still determining if it was the right time for adoption and did not see the technology ready for their supply chains. Finally, some public blockchain platforms were introduced to help businesses choose the most suitable platform for adoption.</jats:p>",

We find that global emissions can substantially increase in the crisis scenario. The relative degree of change, however, varies between the two approaches. At the country level, the largest increases are found in several import-dependent countries. Reasons are likely two-fold: (1) high dependence of certain countries on food imports from Russia and Ukraine, and (2) higher emission intensities (i.e., amount of emissions per unit of product) of imported food items relative to emission intensities in Russia and Ukraine. Very few countries show lower emissions in the crisis scenario. Our results thus highlight the urgent need for countries to lower domestic agricultural emission intensities to avoid negative repercussions on their domestic emissions while increasing agricultural production. Concurrently, our findings underscore the benefits of an emissions accounting process that considers trade flows. By reforming food systems and adopting a trade-adjustment approach in emissions accounting, food systems can contribute towards effective climate mitigation as well as become more resilient to global shocks.</jats:p>",

The selected communities are Ita-Ogbolu, Ogbese, Igoba, Iju, and Oba-Ile. A sample size of 466 respondents equalling 0.3% of the population was randomly selected across the study area for questionnaire administration. The survey research design method through the use of questionnaire was employed to gather data on the assessment of potable water in the study area. Findings revealed protected hand dug well to be the dominant source of domestic water supply in all communities covered in the study.  Huge percentage of the respondents reported that their main sources of water were not reliable during dry season while some said it was not reliable during the raining season. The respondents complained of long distance and the time it takes them to get water from their water source. Boiling of water was the main water treatment among households. Typhoid was the prevalent water borne diseases among households, closely followed by diarrhoea. The study therefore proposed the construction of mini water scheme by the state government and some corporate individuals; the water points should be within 500 m of resident’s homes; construction of a dam for multifarious purposes and enlightenment of residents on the need to treat their water adequately before use.</jats:p>"

A composite power supply structure combining a supercapacitor and power battery is proposed. The supercapacitor is responsible for the peak high power output, and the power battery is responsible for smooth power output.

We show that this has often involves deep ‘pivoting’ by one segment or one value chain, and ‘co-pivoting’ by another to facilitate the former’s pivot. We present a conceptual framework and then illustrate with a variety of examples from Africa and Asia, such as pivoting toward e-commerce by Asian retailers and co-pivoting by delivery intermediaries; pivoting toward quality horticultural production by African and Asian farmers and co-pivoting by mobile outsource services for farming and marketing; and building of redundant ports to protect rice milling operations from climate shocks in Asia by agribusiness and logistic firms.

Regular equipment\n  updates are conducted for all subsystems to ensure continuous\n  improvement and maintain an optimal research facility\n  environment. This study focuses on designing and implementing a\n  temperature-compensated corrector magnet power supply for the\n  TPS.

A temperature control copper box and\n  temperature compensation circuit are employed to improve the thermal\n  equilibrium time of the output current. A laboratory-developed\n  TPS-corrected magnet power supply with temperature compensation\n  control has been successfully developed through these measures. The\n  prototype exhibits a maximum output current of 10 A and operates at\n  a voltage of 40 V. Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect\n  transistors (MOSFETs) are utilised as the power switch in a\n  full-bridge (H-bridge) configuration with a driving frequency of\n  40 kHz. The output current ripple is effectively maintained at\n  100 μA for a 10 A output, and the stabilisation time is\n  achieved within 5 minutes. The control loop design of the prototype\n  has been verified to achieve fast and stable output current\n  performance. The completed prototype demonstrated a -3 dB\n  bandwidth of 2.57 kHz when tested with an input reference signal of\n  0.1 V.

In this paper, an optimal scheduling model of integrated energy system with multiple energy supply devices is established by using Beetle Antennae Search-Particle Swarm Optimization (BAS-PSO) algorithm. First, in the scheduling model, a carbon trading mechanism is introduced and a stepped carbon trading cost model is constructed to constrain the carbon emissions of the plant. Then, using drosophila algorithm, the premise of whether wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation need to be built is determined by judging the economics of wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation in the construction area, and then the target power consumption curve and new energy power supply output curve are fitted. Then use the life cycle analysis method to analyze the carbon emissions generated by electric energy storage equipment, consider the carbon trading mechanism in the system economic operation model, and solve the model by BAS-PSO algorithm to overcome the problems of local optimum and slow convergence speed. Finally, a typical park integrated energy system is simulated to analyze the economic operation conditions and energy efficiency level of the system before and after participation in demand response. The innovation of this paper lies in considering the carbon trading mechanism and solving with the optimized BAS-PSO algorithm. Considering carbon trading can effectively improve the system wind power consumption capacity, and the optimized BAS-PSO algorithm improves the defects of traditional PSO. The simulation analysis results show that the established optimal scheduling model with multiple energy supply devices can realize the optimal operation of the integrated energy system of the park in the demand response environment; the improved BAS-PSO finds the lowest energy consumption within 100 iterations in 21 out of 50 iterations; the improved BAS-PSO algorithm reduces the energy consumption by 27.1 kW on average.</jats:p>"

The population of the study was all 4,318 road transport enterprises in Thailand’s EEC. The stratified random sampling method was used and a sample size larger than 20 times the number of observed variables was selected. Questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 336 enterprises. The questionnaire’s relevance and reliability were assessed using an Index of Item Objective Congruency (IOC) and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. A statistical software was used to analyze the collected data, using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).&#x0D;\nResults showed that the model fitted well with empirical data. All of these factors positively correlated. Factors that had the highest direct, positive effect on business performance of road transport enterprises were innovation, followed by green logistics and sustainable organizational development. Moreover, it was found that innovation and green logistics indirectly and positively affected the performance of road transport enterprises. The data suggested that road transport enterprises in the EEC should consider and implement innovations relevant to their business. Moreover, there is a need to move towards environmentally friendly logistics, to sustainably develop the business, improving the performance, and increase their competitiveness.</jats:p>"

As a matter of fact, not only do manufacturers produce green products, but retailers would also like to introduce their green store brands. However, the costly green investment hinders the improvement of the products’ green degree. Therefore, the government may provide financial support to motivate enterprises to increase their products’ green degree. This study investigates how the presence of green store brands and government subsidies affect green supply chain performance. Four models are discussed using the Stackelberg game theoretic approach, and then, the optimal solutions in different cases are compared. The results show that (1) regardless of the government subsidy, the green store brand introduction always reduces the manufacturer’s profit and improves the retailer’s profit and environmental benefit; (2) In most cases, the implementation of a government subsidy can effectively improve the products’ green degree and benefit the supply chain members. However, it is surprising to find that the government subsidy may be detrimental to the manufacturer once the green store brand is introduced; (3) Interestingly, the introduction of green store brand may have an expansion effect, a shrinkage effect or even an inverse effect on the effects of government subsidies on supply chain performance, and these effects become more significant with the increasing green preference of consumers, product substitute, and subsidy rate. The new findings also provide some implications for supply chain members and the government in green supply chain management (GSCM) and green innovation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bangladesh’s coastal area is vulnerable to the changing climatic condition because of its geographic location and low-lying topography, and this vulnerability has been acute due to reducing upland flow during dry periods and sea level rise contributing to saline intrusion and inundation of coastal freshwater resources. Over the past 25 years, salinity intrusion in Bangladesh has increased by about 26 percent with the affected areas expanding each year. According to a study by World Bank in 2014, climate change is likely to further increase river and groundwater salinity dramatically by 2050 and exacerbate shortages of drinking water in the southwest coastal areas. Because of the salinity of both groundwater and surface water in the Mongla port municipality area, compound river water and rainfed pond water became the main source of drinking water here. Currently, Mongla Port municipality located in the coastal belt is supplying water to town dwellers by pipeline with a water treatment system taking raw water from both harvested rainwater and a limited period of river water through ponds. From physical observation, focus group discussion with water users, and interaction with key information providers, the study team assessed the quantity of water against the demand and also analyzed the quality of water both are satisfied. By using secondary data, the study team also analyzed the Mongla River’s water salinity and rainfall intensity for assessing its long-run feasibility of it. The result of the study on Mongla Port municipality’s water supply shows that it is a well-functional system, that could be replicated in another coastal area as it is a nature-based solution which makes the people and authority adapt it easily with keeping well-functioning</jats:p>"

We then propose a heuristic algorithm based on a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the optimal solution for a special case where the assignment of all ingots to the soaking pits is known. Based on the results of this special case, we develop a modified biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA), which incorporates genetic operations based on the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) to obtain joint production and distribution schedules for the general problem.

This study evaluated the supply-demand and matching\nrelationships between various ecosystem services tapping into the InVEST\nmodel, the supply-demand ratio of ecosystem services, and the\nfour-quadrant model. It also analyzed the supply-demand ratio of\ncomprehensive ecosystem services and their cold and hot spots. The\nfindings suggest that (1) the overall ESs supply showed an increasing\ntrend, with a spatial pattern of “high in the southeast and low in the\nnorthwest”. The demand for food supply and carbon sequestration\nservices has been increasing annually, while the demand for water\nproduction and wind and sand prevention services has been declining. The\ndemand space is characterized by a layout similar to the distribution of\npopulation, production and living areas, and ecologically vulnerable\nareas; (2) From the perspective of quantity matching, with the exception\nof windbreak and sand fixation services which are in short supply, all\nothers are in a state of oversupply. Regrading spatial matching, all ESs\nare primarily dominated by low-low spatial matching zones, with large\nareas concentrated in the northwest desert region; (3) The supply-demand\nratio of overall ESs shows a fluctuating upward trend. The proportion of\ncold spots and sub-cold spots, which are mainly concentrated in the\nnorthwest region, accounts for more than 50%, while that of hot spots\nand sub-hot spots is relatively small and mainly appears in the Qilian\nMountains of the southern region and a few oasis areas.</jats:p>"

The main challenges to provide potable water in Sabah is the variance in terrain and geographical distance between populated regions. Review reveals that other than the river water, average annual precipitation of 3000 millimetres (mm) could be harvested for domestic and agricultural purposes. Numbers of aquifer uncovered in the eastern and western region of Sabah with underlying sandstone and Quaternary Alluvium have significant potential for groundwater reservoirs. Aquifer along the coastal areas and islands around Sabah also gives sufficient potable water supplies. Minimal pollutant content was found in all water sources and acceptable under the National Water Standard of Malaysia, except for contaminants coming from septic tanks and agricultural activities. A decentralized water system is more beneficial for Sabah’s rural areas. Smaller scaled plants are flexible to collect from any water sources and treat at the point of use. Expenditure is significantly decreased by a shorter distribution network and lower installation and maintenance cost. Nonetheless, the treatment utilized may be limited to a simpler process as semiskilled or un-skilled personnel will be required to operate and maintain the system.</jats:p>"

The system incorporates battery storage and a solar photovoltaic array to achieve efficient water pumping. The solar array serves as the primary power source, supplying energy to the water pump for full-volume water surrender. During unfavorable weather conditions or when the photovoltaic array is unable to meet the power demands of the water pump, the battery discharges only at night or during inadequate solar conditions. Additionally, the photovoltaic array can charge the battery on its own when water distribution is not necessary, negating the need for external power sources. A bi-directional charge control mechanism is employed to facilitate automatic switching between the operating modes of the battery, utilizing a buck-boost DC–DC converter. The study incorporates a control system with loops for battery control and DC voltage control within the bidirectional converter. The water cycle algorithm adjusts four control parameters by minimizing an objective function based on tracking errors. The water cycle optimization is compared to other methods based on overshoot and settling time values to evaluate its performance, showcasing its effectiveness in analyzing the results.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to find the controller that performs best when model changes occur in the system, showing insensitivity to parameter variations. A comparison of the finite control set model predictive controller (FCS-MPC), interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based controller (IDA-PBC), and passivity-based model predictive control (PB-MPC) reveals that the PB-MPC provides high resistance to these unexpected LC filter changes in the converter. The second aim of the paper is to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage of the three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). A high total harmonic distortion (THD) value exists in the voltage waveform of the three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI), feeding a non-linear load. A MATLAB simulation was performed using three control techniques for a three-phase VSI feeding: linear load, unbalanced load, and non-linear load. The PB-MPC performs better than the FCS-MPC and IDA-PBC in terms of having a low THD value in the output voltage of the converter under all types of applied loads, improving the THD by up to 30%, and having low variation in THD with mismatched filter parameters, as shown in the bar charts in the results section. Overall, the PB-MPC controller improves the robustness under parameter mismatch and reduces the computational burden. PB-MPC reduces the THD value because it integrates power shaping and the injection of damping resistances into the VSI.</jats:p>"

This has led governments to initiate security programs serving tens of thousands of members worldwide. This paper studies the government's incentive design and the interaction between Customs inspection capacity and the incentives offered in security programs. Using the theory of incentives, we investigate the value of a partnership in improving the security of containerized supply chain. We developed a sequential game featuring the government, firms, and an adversary. The government selects the inspection capacity and incentives to foster the partnership, namely, an operational benefit in the form of a reduced inspection rate, and a security benefit obtained through reductions in the risks of adversarial infiltration. Firms subsequently decide on a collaboration level, followed by a strategic adversary's decision to infiltrate. Using the adversary's best response, we show that, in equilibrium, the government ranks all the firms and induces collaboration with only a subset of them. We demonstrate that, in equilibrium, while security incentives may benefit all participants, tailored operational incentives should be offered strictly to foster collaboration. The required condition to implement the inspection‐free lane for members is also characterized. Our results also inform practice to help security policymakers understand the underlying interaction between Customs inspection capacity and incentive design in forging collaboration with private firms. In particular, as firms opting for collaboration experience lower inspection rates, this further reduces overall congestion, which, in turn, creates a positive externality for nonmember firms. Therefore, having an excess inspection capacity may result in shorter wait times that could dissuade firms from collaborating. </jats:p>",

Decision models are formulated in three cases: (a) both battery leasing and battery swapping services are provided by the vehicle manufacturer; (b) both services are provided by the battery asset company; (c) the battery swapping service is provided by the vehicle manufacturer and the battery leasing service by the battery asset company. The optimal decisions for the vehicle manufacturer and the battery asset company in the three cases are derived and compared. The results show that: (1) When the battery leasing increasing time cost coefficient is smaller, it is advisable for the vehicle manufacturer to provide both services; otherwise, the vehicle manufacturer should only provide the battery swapping service. (2) The battery asset company should actively provide-the battery swapping service, since the provision of the battery swapping service can increase its profit. (3) The mode of the vehicle manufacturer providing both services is optimal for the supply chain. (4) When the battery asset company provides battery leasing service, the vehicle manufacturer can “free ride” to enjoy the benefits of the battery asset company extending battery leasing time. (5) With the high cost of new energy vehicles (NEVs) limiting their development in China, extending the battery leasing increasing time is an effective measure to facilitate the diffusion of new energy vehicles (NEVs).</jats:p>"

It is proposed to use a three-level STATCOM at a voltage of 0.4 kV with a supercapacitor storage, which requires less storage energy than a buffer storage, to ensure the quality of electricity when powered by a diesel generator set. The results of the studies carried out testify to the prospects of using STATCOM with a storage device to improve the quality of electricity in low-voltage networks.</jats:p>"

The magnetic field stability was measured and evaluated using a HTS-MRI test magnet under the power supply driving mode of a dropper-type and of a switching-type direct-current exciter system. A high stable direct current power supply is normally designed using the dropper-type power supply which is suitable for constant current operation of less current ripple. However, it is of large power loss and is not suitable for charging/discharging operation. On the other hand, the switching-type power supply is suitable for variable current control operation and of less power loss. However, it is of large current ripple in the constant current operation which would degrade the magnetic field stability in HTS-MRI imaging operation. The availability of the power supply system was discussed in MRI imaging of a mouse using an experimental HTS-MRI system. HTS-MRI imaging of mouse (~50 mm).</jats:p>",

The Error Correction Model (ECM) Engel-Grange is utilized as the analytical method. The findings indicate that, on a partial basis, the Exchange Rate and BI 7DRR variables do not have a significant influence on the NAV of Sharia Mutual Funds. However, the Money Supply and Inflation variables demonstrate a positive and significant impact on the NAV of these funds. Moreover, when considered together, the Exchange Rate, Money Supply, Inflation, and BI 7DRR variables jointly exhibit a significant effect on the NAV of Sharia Mutual Funds. As a result, it is suggested that the government should create a secure and profitable environment for Sharia mutual funds to foster continuous growth. An evident sign of the expansion of Islamic mutual funds is the increasing number of units offered to investors in the community.</jats:p>"

Here we report our efforts to characterize the adulterants present within the local fentanyl supply of San Diego County, obtained from undifferentiated drug samples seized by local law enforcement over the calendar year 2021.\nMethods\n Thirty two participating local law enforcement agencies across San Diego submitted 4838 unknown individual illicit drug samples (total of 312 kg) to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department Regional Crime Laboratory for identification.\nResults\n Qualitative analysis of these samples via FTIR and GC-MS identified methamphetamine (38.7%), fentanyl (20.8%), diacetylmorphine (heroin) (10.2%), codeine (5.8%) and alprazolam (4.3%) as the most common illicit substances and the presence of 52 unique adulterants. The most common adulterants included 4-methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAAP) (10.9%), mannitol (9%), acetaminophen (8.5%), methamphetamine (4.2%), diacetylmorphine (heroin) (3.6%), tramadol (1.9%), and xylazine (1.7%). Several additional pharmacologically active adulterants and contaminants of interest were also identified.\nConclusion\n This analysis is vital for public health use and harm reduction efforts at the level of the individual consumer. Continued direct surveillance of the drug supply is necessary for the detection of potentially harmful adulterants that may pose serious threats to the public.</jats:p>"

Piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has attracted interest for biomedical applications due to its flexibility, low toxicity, and the piezoelectric response to mechanical stimuli. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PVDF films on bone regeneration in rabbit tibias to assess the potential improvement in osteogenesis. An initial exploratory experiment was performed to determine optimal parameters for regulating the marrow blood supply. The second experiment focused on examining the effects of ultrasound stimulation on the implant's osteogenic capacity. The results showed that PVDF films have a notable impact on the extraskeletal bone formation and bone density in a secluded microenvironment with and without microperforations. At 60 days after surgery, tibias with marrow blood supply reached higher bone volumes and density and they were consistent with the cellular activity. Our results suggest that piezoelectric PVDF films have osteogenic characteristics and can be used to enhance new bone formation in a secluded space, thus reinforcing their biocompatibility nature. Additional studies are required to analyze the benefits of ultrasound stimulation.</jats:p>",

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to rainfall erosivity in the Ksob watershed in Algeria, using six empirical formulas of rainfall erosivity. The RUSLE model with the Geographic Information System (GIS) produces highly variable specific soil loss ranging from 11.35 to 22.85 t ha−1 year−1 throughout the watershed, depending on the erosivity R factor. To validate the results, the soil loss is compared with the silting volume data of the Ksob dam, which is located at the outflow of the basin. The best result is obtained using the Diodato R factor formula with a relative error of 21% and a specific soil loss of 11.35 t ha−1 year−1. Moreover, over 81% of the watershed area is exposed to low erosion (&amp;lt;20 t ha−1 year−1), and less than 5% are affected by high erosion (&amp;gt;50 t ha−1 year−1).</jats:p>",

Our results confirm that US Metropolitan Statistical Areas are generally supply inelastic and the search and matching process plays a key role in supply dynamics. In the least inelastic markets, investors tend to be more flexible to respond to negative demand shocks. As a result, we observe a reduction in structural vacancy and a subsequent increase in cyclical vacancy given the slow short-term movement in absorption.

Indian agriculture is still largely dependent on conventional methods of crop production that are mainly inefficient. Water security is essential for social and economic development, having an indispensable role in enhancing health, well-being, and economic progress, particularly in a developing country like India. Water footprint (WF) is an important indicator that helps ascertain the direct and indirect use of water in any process. WF modeling in agriculture enables us to pinpoint the impacts and limitations of the current crop production system. Assessing vulnerabilities across various regions and time helps us prepare actions to improve water productivity and promote sustainable water use. There is considerable spatial variability in blue, green, and gray WF among the different states of India due to their varied climate, soil, and topographic characteristics. WF assessment is critical for developing water allocation strategies, planning water trade, making policies, and implementing remedial measures. This paper describes the significance of WF and its proper management for sustainable crop production in India.</jats:p>",

How to reasonably arrange tree species and planting methods can effectively improve the current situation of water loss and soil erosion. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model is a widely used soil erosion prediction model, but it does not consider the impact of tree height and crown size on soil erosion. In this paper, six experimental plots of soil and water conservation were carried out on the forest slope land in southern China. Six experimental plots were planted with different trees, and all kinds of data were collected for 3 years. On the basis of data analysis and machine learning methods, it is found that tree height and crown have a significant impact on soil erosion, but have no significant impact on runoff formation. With the growth of trees, the amount of soil loss in each plot gradually decreases. At the same time, an improved RUSLE model related to tree height and crown has been established, which has a high simulation effect (R2 of testing reaches 0.6775, R2 of all data reaches 0.5452).</jats:p>",

Hardiya, a multi-caste and multi-religion village, has a complex social arrangement. This village consists of original households, households resettled due to dam construction, and households resettled due to excessive fluoride contamination in groundwater. Excessive fluoride produces incidences of fluorosis among households, and historically, households have low access to clean drinking water. In response to the drinking water and public health crisis, multiple state, non-state, and transnational institutions intervened in Hardiya to provide safe technologies and infrastructures for clean drinking water. These twenty years of interventions have brought different technologies, institutions, and actors together to supply drinking water. However, these schemes are functioning inadequately on the ground, and access to clean water remains a big question amidst the development of drinking water infrastructures in Hardiya. This paper explores the dialectical relationship between drinking water infrastructures and social spaces, how both shape each other, through which assemblages, and what it renders. It explores the uneven outcomes of this technological intervention across different socio-spatial groups in Hardiya...</jats:p>"

Since the closed-loop e-waste supply chain's operations are primarily focused on achieving sustainability objectives related to the manufacturing, distribution, reusing, and discarding electrical components, it is crucial to evaluate its success in this area. In order to monitor the performance of supply chains and enhance the processes, the supply chain operations reference model offers suggestions and benchmarking tools. In this study, a conceptual framework is illustrated to show how these standards could be used in the E-waste supply chain to link business processes, metrics, industry standards, and technology in order to enhance the relationship and coordination between the supply chain members and to increase sustainability throughout the supply chain. Insufficient attention so far has been paid to the SCOR model's sustainability criteria, according to an assessment of the literature. Consequently, in the wake of portraying the structure of Supply Chain Operation Reference model, we make sense of which credits should be included in Supply Chain Operation Reference so to reflect manageability and which cycles and practices are related with every standard or should be remembered for Supply Chain Operation Reference to lay out the connection between execution, cycles, and practices.</jats:p>"

It typically consists of the hydrogen tank, the pressure regulator, the water separator, and the ejector, which is a vital component of the anodic recirculation system (ARS). As the vehicle’s operation necessitates a wide range of power output, the recirculation system must have an appropriate design to function accurately. A fixed-shape ejector is found to be tough to cover the whole range required. Furthermore, determining a suitable ejector geometry throughout the working conditions of the PEMFC is quite challenging. Therefore, the idea of applying the dual-ejector design in the ARS is introduced. In this study, using the concept of dual ejector ARS, the one-dimensional model of the whole hydrogen supply system integrated with the PEMFC is developed in MATLAB/Simulink platform. Design parameters are included in the ejector model so that the design analysis can be conducted. Therefore, the performance of the hydrogen supply system using the dual ejector concept is deployed under dynamic operation. The results show that the dual ejectors can well cover all operating ranges of a vehicular fuel cell. In addition, an improvement in stack performance is captured when utilizing the dual ejector-based anodic recirculation system.</jats:p>",

The potential of data analytics-enabled dynamic capability for improving organizational performance and agility has been investigated in past research. However, there has not been sufficient research on the potential benefits of the data analytics capability and supply chain ambidexterity paradox to develop a sustainable and agile supply chain that can integrate and reorganize all of its resources in order to respond to rapidly changing business circumstances. This study aimed to empirically validate how an organization’s SC ambidexterity affects its sustainability and dynamic capability, and the mediating role of supply chain analytics capability (SCAC) in their relationship. The research’s theoretical framework is founded on dynamic capability theory. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect responses from 427 supply chain specialists who worked in diverse product-based industries across Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a total of six hypotheses were evaluated, and the results show that supply chain ambidexterity has a positive effect on dynamic capability and sustainability, and SCAC plays a complementary, partially mediating role in their interaction. The findings of the research reveal the expected results of investing in the analytics capability of the supply chain and provide firms with some recommendations for improving their dynamic capabilities. This study will facilitate in creating an agile and sustainable supply chain, enabling it to adapt to both short- and long-term changes in the market while simultaneously considering the social, economic, and environmental vitality.</jats:p>"

Therefore, efficient models incorporating the unique characteristics of such chains are essential for making optimal supply chain decisions and achieving economically and environmentally sustainable agro-food supply chains that contribute to global food security. Methods: This article presents a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programing model that integrates agricultural-related strategic decisions into the tactical design of an agro-food supply chain. The model considers transportation, inventory, processing, demand fulfilment, and waste disposal decisions. It also accounts for seasonality and perishability, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability. The model aims to maximize the total generated profits across the supply chain while simultaneously minimizing CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental impact. Results: By implementing the model on a sugar beet supply chain in the Netherlands, strategic crop rotation farm schedules for the crop rotation cycle and the optimum supply network decisions are obtained. Furthermore, different objectives are analyzed and the Pareto-efficient frontier is investigated to analyze the underlying trade-offs. Additionally, the model serves as a decision support tool for managers facilitating informed investment decisions in technologies that prolong product shelf life while maintaining profitability. Conclusions: The proposed multi-objective model offers a valuable framework for designing economically and environmentally sustainable agro-food supply chains. By aligning with sustainability goals and providing decision support, this research contributes to enhancing global food security and promoting sustainable resource utilization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is important to design multi-energy supply systems optimally in consideration of their operations for variations in energy demands. An approach for efficiently solving such an optimal design problem with a large number of periods for variations in energy demands is to derive an approximate optimal design solution by time series aggregation. However, such an approach does not provide any information on the accuracy for the optimal value of the objective function. In this paper, an effective approach for time series aggregation is proposed to derive an approximate optimal design solution and evaluate a proper gap between the upper and lower bounds for the optimal value of the objective function based on a mixed-integer linear model. In accordance with aggregation, energy demands are relaxed to uncertain parameters and the problem for deriving an approximate optimal design solution and evaluating it is transformed to a three-level optimization problem, and it is solved by applying both the robust and hierarchical optimization methods. A case study is conducted on a cogeneration system with a practical configuration, and it turns out that the proposed approach enables one to derive much smaller gaps as compared with those obtained by a conventional approach.</jats:p>"

For this reason, the idea of harvesting data from cryptocurrency market users takes an innovative step. Potential investors in supply chain firms in the fertilizer industry need to know whether the observation of data originating from the cryptocurrency market is capable of explaining their stock price variation. The authors identify the innovative utilization of cryptocurrency markets’ user analytical data to model and predict the stock price of supply chain firms in the fertilizer industry stock price. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the contribution of cryptocurrency market big data as a predicting factor for the stock price of fertilizer market firms. Such a finding improves the knowledge and decision-making of potential investors in the fertilizer market. Moreover, this study seeks to highlight the benefits of utilizing cryptocurrency market big data for other financial purposes, apart from stock price prediction. The analytical data was derived from cryptocurrency websites and applications and was then processed through statistical analysis (correlation and linear regressions), Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM), and Hybrid Modeling (HM) modeling. The hybrid model’s simulation showed that analytical data from the cryptocurrency markets tend to explain and predict the stock price of supply chain firms in the fertilizer industry. Such data refer to Bitcoin’s website organic keywords and traffic costs, as well as paid traffic costs from cryptocurrency trade websites/apps. A rise in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trade websites’ organic and paid traffic costs tend to increase supply chain firms in the fertilizer industry’s stock prices, while Bitcoin’s website organic keywords variation decreases accordingly.</jats:p>"

Using the PGA under four exceeding probabilities calculated by China probabilistic seismic hazard analysis method, the probability density function of PGA was obtained by fitting utilizing the Cornell seismic hazard exceeding probability-PGA function model. Combined with the seismic fragility function of the water supply system calculated based on the empirical matrix of actual earthquake damage and the exposure of fixed assets, the seismic loss expectation and loss rate expectation models of the water supply system were established, and the classification standard with the seismic loss rate expectation of the water supply system as the index was proposed. The seismic fragility of the water supply system was classified, and the exposure of the water supply system was analyzed. The total fixed assets in the Water Supply Yearbook were taken as the exposure to earthquake in the region. The accuracy of the fragility model in this paper was verified through the actual earthquake damage losses in Deyang City. Taking the water supply system of 720 cities in Chinese Mainland as an example, the distribution maps of seismic loss expectation and loss rate expectation were calculated and drawn. The loss rate expectation model was verified by the key earthquake prevention areas in Chinese Mainland. The assessment model based on loss expectation and loss rate expectation was taken as the seismic risk assessment model of water supply system in Chinese Mainland.\n                        </jats:p>"

Magnesium is required for major physiological functions and metabolic processes in plants, and in the present study we studied the effects of five Mg treatments (2, 20, 35, 70, and 140 mg L−1 Mg), on plant development and function, and distribution of minerals in drug-type (medical) cannabis plants, at the vegetative growth phase. The plants were cultivated in pots under controlled environment conditions. The results demonstrate that plant development is optimal under Mg supply of 35–70 mg L−1 (ppm), and impaired under lower Mg input of 2–20 mg L−1. Two mg L−1 Mg resulted in visual deficiency symptoms, shorter plants, reduced photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, photosynthetic pigments and stomatal conduction in young-mature leaves, and a 28% reduction of total plant biomass compared to the optimal supply of 35 mg L−1 Mg. The highest supply level of 140 mg L−1 Mg induced a small decrease in physiological function, which did not affect morphological development and biomass accumulation. The low-deficient Mg supply of 2 mg L−1 Mg stimulated Mg uptake and accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mn, and Zn in the plant. Increased Mg supply impaired uptake of Ca and K and their root-to-shoot translocation, demonstrating competitive cation inhibition. Mg-deficiency symptoms developed first in old leaves (at 2 mg L−1 Mg) and progressed towards young-mature leaves, demonstrating ability for Mg in-planta storage and remobilization. Mg toxicity symptoms appeared in old leaves from the bottom of the plants, under 140 mg L−1 Mg. Taken together, the findings suggest 35–70 mg L−1 Mg as the optimal concentration range for cannabis plant development and function at the vegetative growth phase.</jats:p>"

The first focuses on the presentation of theories and methods related to artificial intelligence and supply chain management. Where, Method is A review of artificial intelligence and its role in the ports and maritime supply chain are supported as a review of recent published papers. The findings suggest that the previous literature is largely focused on supply chain management, thus leaving the research screening at a very limited level. The second stage presents the literature on the application of artificial intelligence in the Ports and Maritime Industry. The most remarkable finding is that most studies ignored the theories related to the issue of artificial intelligence and supply chain management. Additionally, the previous works show a lack of adoption of certain types of artificial intelligence in the port and maritime industry. Consequently, the studies of the impact of artificial intelligence on the port and maritime sector remain unexploited as it is based on a bibliometric review. In this case, it is recommended that researchers study other types of artificial intelligence on supply chain management, develop a systematic review of the impact of artificial intelligence on the port and maritime sector, and link theory and practice.

However, this combination is not necessarily efficient given the unclear relationship between the two strategies. Therefore, crucially, this article investigates the strategic relationship between inventory sharing and demand learning, that is, when and whether they are substitutes or complements. We develop a theoretical game model consisting of two firms facing uncertain demand, and both of them need to determine their production quantity before demand is realized. Contrary to the intuition that demand learning is a substitute for inventory sharing, we find that these two strategies can be complements when the production cost is relatively low or high. Moreover, when forecast accuracy is relatively low, the substitutability will be weakened while the complementarity will be enhanced as forecast accuracy increases. Additionally, the substitutability first weakly decreases and then weakly increases, while the complementarity first weakly increases and then weakly decreases with the transfer price.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>he tasks at the stage of planning and operation of power supply systems are related to the calculation of the parameters of their operation modes. With the massive nature of such complex calculations, their execution is possible only with the help of appropriate software and computing tools, that is, using an electronic computer. (Research purpose) The research purpose is to substantiate the algorithm of equivalence of power supply systems or their individual sections as an integral part of the algorithms complex for calculating electrical systems. (Materials and methods) It has been shown that at present there are many agricultural consumers, interruptions in the power supply of which lead to significant damage, in this regard, closed power supply systems are becoming increasingly used, as the requirements for reliability, uninterrupted power supply and the quality of electricity supplied to the consumer are increasing. It was determined that the calculation of closed systems is more complicated than open ones. It was revealed that when solving a wide range of tasks related to the creation and modernization of power supply systems, there is a need to simplify the systems or their individual sections. (Results and discussion) The equivalence rule was formed and methods for calculating equivalent resistances and electromotive force of the converted sections of the replacement circuits were given, which simplifies the circuit and accelerates the process of calculating and analyzing the modes of power supply systems. (Conclusions) It was established that the proposed equivalence algorithm is based on universal formulas for calculating intrinsic and mutual resistances, which were previously obtained by the authors for use in problems of calculating steady-state modes of power supply systems. It was stated that the calculation algorithm is also applicable for the equivalence of forward and reverse sequence circuits in the calculation of currents of asymmetric short circuits and in the analysis of the dynamic stability of electric power systems</jats:p>",

Integrating it with the Global Production Networks (GPN), which is a kind of stepsibling, can help expanding the theoretical foundations of SSCM. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the GPN approach links to SSCM in analysing and explaining interorganizational sustainability. This paper is conceptual. Five central GPN constructs are identified: (1) the emerging supply chain structures and sustainability; (2) the importance and relevance of embeddedness and governance; (3) power dynamics; (4) the stakeholder approach; (5) the sustainability dimensions and the implementation strategies. They are explained in detail and then contrasted with how the related topics are dealt within SSCM. The paper provides insights into the ongoing discussions in GPN and integrates the political economy debate into SSCM research. Findings reveal that GPN offers an alternative and yet complementary explanation about network and cluster formation in supply chains, the effect of embeddedness (geopolitical, social, and cultural) power relationships and governance mechanisms and their role in implementing ecological and social sustainability across the supply chains. The comparison of these complementary disciplines allows for the exchange of ideas between the SSCM and GPN approaches, thereby providing an enriched understanding for managing supply chain sustainability. The selective comparison of the SSCM and GPN constructs is the first of its kind and should trigger further research at this intersection. Five propositions capture core directions for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: In a typical multiechelon supply chain, the supplier makes semifinished items, from which the manufacturer produces finished products to eventually get sold at retailers. However, the majority of existing supply chain models consider the remanufacturing of defective products by solely one organization, despite the fact that both the supplier and manufacturer can produce defective products. This study considers the remanufacturing of defective products with fresh materials and additional expenses by both the supplier and manufacturer. Contrary to well-established articles that hold major partners to be accountable for reducing carbon emissions under a carbon cap-and-trade policy, the proposed model presumes an initial green technological investment by each chain partner. Methods: This study represents a varying market with fuzzy cost components that are then defuzzified with λ-integral method. This study determines the critical values of three discrete and four other continuous decision variables that globally maximize the profitability of the proposed model. Results: Slower production with a longer cycle boosts profitability in a developing market. To increase profit, a case study on the oil and natural gas business suggested to reduce the production of defective items and cutting emission through green investments. Conclusions: Managers can sustainably boost profit via careful production, modern machinery, and slightly longer cycles.</jats:p>"

Using a systematic literature review methodology, this study analyzes publications on Google Scholar and Scopus that explored the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. The research thoroughly reviews and analyzes a total of 95 studies that were found relevant and significant. COVID-19 had a significant impact on supply chains and organizations a like and therefore the study has revealed the following findings. Although some scholars claim that the pandemic revealed the fragility of supply chains, brought many logistical activities to standstill, and completely disrupted markets, but other researchers found that it has also created unlimited opportunities for organizations and industries. This review concluded that extant of literature falls into four themes; those who believe that COVID-19 was a complete threat, researchers who believe that it was both a threat and opportunity, those who believe it created enormous opportunities and lastly scholars who proposed a model that can help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on supply chains. This study opens the door wide for other researchers to explore how COVID-19 pandemic impacted supply chains positively and negatively across many industries and contexts. The study also provides an easy reference for business managers who are interested in knowing what would be the consequences of such pandemic on their organizations and how to take the right decisions that can help mitigate the many threats while at the same time maximize any opportunities created.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, changes in people’s lifestyles and occupations have led to new food consumption patterns around the world, with a notable growth in the demand for ready meals and meat products. Accordingly, the food industry has tried to transform the global food culture by promoting its more profitable products to become able to set a higher price for meat. Considering the short lifetime of products in perishable food supply chains, inventory decisions are considered crucial. In addition, the demand for perishable food products is greatly affected by their freshness. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model for a four-level sustainable supply chain (SC) of a perishable product with price-dependent demand and deterioration rates. The SC consists of suppliers, a production center (PC), distribution centers (DCs), and retailers. We aim to ascertain the optimal pricing policy and cycle length to maximize profit, achieve specific social objectives, and minimize the total cost and adverse environmental impacts. The proposed model determines the deterioration rate of each product according to its expiration date, the optimal location of supply-side facilities, and the flow rate between the facilities based on the selected mode of delivery. The products are delivered to the retailers by a mechanized transportation system either directly from the PC or indirectly through the DCs. Finally, an actual case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the model and our theoretical results under real-world conditions. We solve the case study by a preemptive fuzzy goal programming method and perform several sensitivity analyses on the results. By performing simultaneous sensitivity analyses on the demand and expiration dates, the optimal values of the problem’s parameters are determined. The optimal values help decision-makers make optimal decisions regarding the selling price of products and replenishment times. The model is applicable to supply chains of any perishable items with expiration dates.</jats:p>"

The main problems faced by the development of the new retail are the interest balance of all decision subjects, the pricing strategy, and the coordination of online and offline channels. This paper considers the effect of the new retail firms’ delivery time and establishes a two-part tariff contract to study the decision-making and coordination of the new retail fresh products supply chain. This paper constructs cooperative and non-cooperative models and employs the cooperative model as the benchmark case to realize the coordination. It is found that when the delivery time has little effect on the market demand, the offline store often should pay more fixed charges to the new retail firm. With the increased impact of delivery time on market demand, the fixed charges paid by the offline store become smaller. Under the coordination decision model, the offline store pays fixed charges to compensate for the new retail firm’s early delivery costs, but its interests still increase compared with the decentralized decision model. This study models the time-dependent demand for fresh products and proposes an incentive mechanism to coordinate the new retail fresh products’ supply chain; further, it demonstrates that the prices can be significantly decreased with the designed contract, and all the supply chain members can benefit from Pareto improvement.</jats:p>"

Power battery recycling is inevitably becoming the key link in the formation of the green closed-loop supply chain for new energy vehicles and the green cycle of the new energy vehicles industry. This study establishes a three-party evolutionary game model of “new energy vehicle manufacturers, power battery manufacturers, and power battery recyclers”, simulates the dynamic evolution process of each game player’s strategy, and analyzes the effects of the digital transformation factor and other factors leading to the evolution trend. The main results show that: (i) in the absence of sufficient incentives and constraints, the green closed-loop power battery supply chain cannot be formed naturally; (ii) digital transformation is an important factor in the journey of the green closed-loop supply chain for power battery recycling, and (iii) government rewards and penalties can promote the formation of the green closed-loop supply chain for power batteries. This research innovatively investigates the concept of the green closed-loop power battery supply chain and its formation mechanism, which provides theoretical support to promote the recycling of used power batteries to achieve sustainability.</jats:p>"

While global fisheries are considered key in providing essential nutrients to hundreds of millions of people around the globe, the specific contribution of small-scale fisheries to the nutrient supply given other available food supplies is unknown. Here, we combined multiple global databases to quantify the importance of marine small-scale fisheries to national-level nutrient supply of coastal populations. We found that, on average across assessed nutrients (iron, zinc, calcium, DHA + EPA and vitamins A and B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>), small-scale fisheries contributed about 32% of overall global seafood nutrient supply, 17% of the nutrient supply from animal-sourced foods and 10% of nutrient supply from all foods. These global averages, however, underrepresent some key roles of ocean-based foods. Combining nutrient supply estimates with global estimates of inadequate nutrient intake, we found that about half of coastal countries that have a mean inadequate intake of at least 50% across assessed nutrients (iron, zinc, calcium, DHA + EPA and vitamins A and B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>) rely on small scale fisheries for at least 15% of mean nutrient supply, and many rely on small scale fisheries for more than 30% of mean nutrient supply.

The purpose of the study was to determine the moisture content of the winter common and durum wheat sown after various forecrops. There has been found that during the study, precipitation fell unevenly over the seasons. The amount of useful precipitation during the vegetation period of winter wheat (mean for three years) was 319.80 mm. There has been established that when sown in weedfree fallow, the total moisture consumption both over the years (278.90–445.00 mm) and on average over three years (381.40 mm) exceeded the amount of useful precipitation. On the formation of grain yield winter wheat has spent, in addition to precipitation, the productive moisture accumulated from the soil. There has been found that when sown after non-fallow forecrops, in the absence of reserves of productive moisture in the soil, the productivity formation proceeded mainly due to precipitation. When sowing winter wheat, the total moisture consumption (mean in 2019–2022) was 322.00 mm after peas and 315.50 mm after sunflower. There has been determined that the highest grain yield of the varieties ‘Zodiak’ (7.90 t/ha) and ‘Yantarina’ (6.28 t/ha) was obtained when sown in weedfree fallow, while they spent the least amount of moisture per yield unit, being 487.10 and 649, 70 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/t respectively.

As a response, this article aims to broaden how supply chain scholars view decision-making for supply chain resilience from an institutional perspective – in particular, using the construct of institutional complexity. We argue that the inherent complexity in supply chains, consisting of multiple organizations and multiple institutional environments, represents a different playing field and results in different responses, in particular when confronted with disruptions. We provide a systematic and structured understanding of how the interactions of institutional logics, influenced by field-levels structures and processes, impact global supply chains and its constituents. Using existing literature on institutional complexity and works on the effects of institutional logics, we present not only field-level structures and attributes influencing and shaping institutional logics in the supply chain, but also discuss and contrast existing theories and concepts by highlighting the differences between supply chain and organizational responses both on an institutional and an overarching operational level.</jats:p>",

Carbon emissions will be produced in the processes of production, transportation, processing, etc. We consider the four-stage game, obtain the function expressions of optimal market prices with respect to carbon emission reduction level (CERL), analyze the best responses of the supplier and the retailer regarding their CERLs, and obtain the 25 optimal CERLs under competitive equilibrium. In 24 of the 25 equilibrium cases, the supplier or the retailer either do nothing to reduce carbon emissions, or make the most effort to reduce carbon emissions. Excluding these special cases, we focused on a non-trivial case where the increasing consumer preferences for low-carbon products will encourage the supplier and the retailer to reduce carbon emissions. Interestingly, we find that when the consumer preference for low-carbon products is low, the retailer’s and supplier’s equilibrium carbon reduction levels are low, so that the potential market size is small such that the competition for two kinds of customers is fierce. Then, an increase in the sale cost will reduce the retail price. However, when the consumer preference for low-carbon products is high, the potential market size is large such that the competition is not fierce. Then, an increase in the sale cost will advance the retail price.</jats:p>"

A mathematical model describing the non-stationary modes of operation of heaters of the heating system under the conditions of the implementation of this arrangement is constructed and studied. Calculations were carried out using this model, including numerical simulation on a computer using the Monte Carlo method. It is established that in this case, due to fluctuations in the waste water consumption following the daily variation in water consumption at the DHW, there occurs a decrease in the average heat transfer coefficient of the heater of the heating system and its temperature efficiency due to the fact that these values depend on the flow rate in a non-linear way, and their growth during the period of increased water intake at the DHW does not compensate for the decrease during the reduction of water consumption. It is noted that in this case, the reduction of the heat transfer coefficient lies within the usual error of engineering calculation, and this effect can be neglected. It is proved that, with a small number of heat transfer units in the heater of the heating system attributed to the heated flow, the total amount of heat transferred can decrease quite significantly (by up to 30 percent); however, with a rational choice of the heater size, such a decrease is within the limits allowed by the margins applied when setting the flow rate of delivery water and determining the heat transfer area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Rather than a surprising and illogical move to leave oil in the ground for international compensation, Ecuador's Yasuní-ITT Initiative should be understood as an outcome of ongoing struggles of interests within the state at the time. In this landmark oil moratorium attempt, launched in 2007, the Ecuadorian government offered to forego extraction of its largest oil reservoir, projected to contain 20% of the country's oil reserves, if it received international compensation totalling half the expected revenues. If successful, the initiative could have constituted a post-extractivist economic model that would have favoured indigenous and environmental interests at the expense of oil interests. However, the initiative was cancelled in 2013, after only a fraction of the requested sum had been received, and oil production is now ongoing. Most academic literature highlights how a developmentalist petro-state was willing to abstain from extracting its largest oil reserves, yet encountered a range of national and international obstacles. This article defies this ‘against all odds’ framing. It examines the initiative as a space-making process and understands the attempted internationalisation of the Yasuní oil as the state's spatial strategy to ensure continued income from oil, either in the form of compensation or by legitimising their continued existence as a petro-state and for business as usual if the attempt failed. This analysis demonstrates how understanding political economic resource governance and its space-making processes as outcomes of struggles and complex negotiation processes within the state could bring new insights into energy transition processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: Urban population growth and the expansion of the built environment, pollution, overexploitation of water, inequality in water distribution, and the impacts of climate change in future availability of water, are all elements that jeopardize urban water security. Due to the complexity of urban water systems and their relevance for urban life, a holistic and integrative perspective is therefore needed to address such challenges. In this paper, Urban Water Metabolism (UWM) has been used for comprehensively understanding water (in)security in the City of Puebla (Mexico) and its metropolitan area. Water inflows and outflows have been estimated using a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) method with data either obtained from official sources or simulated with the Monte Carlo method. Our findings show that the UWM configuration in the City of Puebla and its metropolitan area is effective for generating profits to service providers and water related business, yet ineffective to guarantee citizens’ Human Right to Water and Sanitation (HRWS), a right recognized in the Constitution of Mexico. We conclude that to advance towards an inclusive and sustainable provision of water, economic interests must be reconsidered and therefore adjusted so they can be in line with such aspirational socioecological goals. UWM accounting can therefore inform new water governance arrangements, those based on both the best available knowledge and a vibrant participation of all relevant stakeholders.</jats:p>"

This paper manually collects annual data on the loan balances of SMEs from listed commercial banks in China from 2011 to 2021, and it empirically tests the implementation effects of the direct monetary policy tools using the double-difference model and the moderating effect model. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of the direct monetary policy tools can increase the credit supply of commercial banks to SMEs. The moderating effect of digital inclusive finance on the impact of direct monetary policy on the credit supply of SMEs is not statistically significant for the time being. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the transmission mechanism of structural monetary policy, establish a sustainable development mechanism for digital inclusive finance, and guide commercial banks to improve their capital strength and profitability so that structural monetary policy tools can be most effective.</jats:p>"

Theoretically, regional cooperative agreements promise improved resource efficiency by realizing economies of scale, adding flexibility for achieving improved supply reliability, and, ideally, limiting individual and collective financial risks. However, there has been little research exploring how implementation uncertainties in the partners' cooperative actions shape infrastructure investment and management pathways' robustness and drive counterparty risks. Counterparty risks potentially exacerbate collaborating partners' vulnerability to the supply and financial challenges they initially sought to mitigate through cooperation. To address these concerns, we introduce the safe operating spaces (SOS) for Deeply Uncertain Water Supply Pathways (DU<jats:sub>SOS</jats:sub>Pathways) framework. The framework, demonstrated on the multi‐city Sedento Valley benchmarking test case, facilitates the formal characterization of the effects of implementation uncertainty within cooperative regional water supply investment and management policy pathways. Results demonstrate the path‐dependent effects of implementation uncertainties in short‐term operational drought mitigation instruments and long‐term infrastructure investments. Our analysis further reveals the potential for increased regional conflict due to asymmetries between partners' vulnerabilities to the actions of cooperating partners that can be exacerbated by other deeply uncertain factors that reduce their robustness (e.g., demand growth rates). The study finally delineates SOS, beyond which utilities experience robustness degradation and increased vulnerabilities to future uncertainties to guide implementation of cooperative policy pathways. Overall, this framework is broadly applicable to regional systems seeking to navigate complex cooperative regional water supply investment and management policy pathways.</jats:p>",

This is because food processing, as is the case with most production systems, is not perfect and there is a possibility that some of the processed products do not meet the required quality standard. Likewise, the inspection process is seldom perfect, meaning that it is subject to errors and thus, some of the processed products might be incorrectly classified. In light of this, an inventory model for a four-echelon food processing supply chain is developed. The supply chain has a farming echelon where live items are grown with the possibility that some of them might not survive; a processing echelon where the live items are transformed into processed inventory; an inspection echelon where the processed inventory is classified into good and poorer quality classes under the assumption that the inspection process is subject to type I and type II errors; and a retail echelon where the processed inventory of good quality is sold to consumers. The supply chain is modelled as a profit maximisation problem and a solution procedure for solving the model is proposed. The problem is studied under both centralised and decentralised supply chain structures and from the analysis, the centralised supply chain with a profit-sharing agreement performs better in terms of profit maximisation.</jats:p>",

As of 2018, an estimated 46% of the annual wood harvested came from corporate forests, 42% came from family forests, and the remainder came from other private, public, and Tribal forests. The supply of wood from corporate forests is well described by traditional economic models, but the supply from family forests is much less well understood. This article combines data from three components of the USDA Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program—plots, landowner surveys, and mill surveys—with other data to model the wood supply from family forests in the United States. Results are summarized in terms of bivariate relationships and a logistic regression model. The model results show that basal area, stand origin, forest type, having timber as an ownership objective, the amount of annual income derived from their forestland, proximity to a mill, management advice, and region are significantly associated with family forest timber harvesting. The results should be useful for forest industry analysts and others interested in understanding the current and potential future supply of wood from family forests.</jats:p><jats:p>Study Implications: Family forests provide an estimated 42% of the annual timber harvested in the United States. It is important to understand the factors affecting their harvesting behaviors to design effective policies and programs to ensure a continual supply and sustainable management of this critical resource. This article shows that timber harvesting by family forest owners is influenced by a combination of biophysical, social, and economic factors, including basal area, stand origin, forest type, having timber as an ownership objective, the amount of annual income derived from their forestland, proximity to a mill, management advice, and region. These results suggest that programs aimed at increasing the area covered by planted stands, the area covered by softwood stands, and the number of owners receiving forest management advice may be particularly influential in maintaining and increasing the amount of wood harvested from family forests.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Container terminals are cargo gateways in the global maritime supply chain network. Major container terminals generally operate throughout the year, but do not operate at night, when container vessels are not calling at ports, or when there is no need to handle containers. Terminal congestion can delay containers’ shipping schedules, which impacts the supply chain network. To optimize global logistics, it is therefore important to understand fully the daily operational status of container terminals. A vessels’ automatic identification system data are not sufficient to determine whether containers are being handled in container terminals at night. Remote sensing, especially nighttime-light (NTL) imagery, might solve this problem. Recently, high-resolution images for the CE-SAT-IIB satellite with a pixel resolution of 5.1 m became available to observe NTL. This study assessed the operational status of container terminals based on satellite image taken at night. Eight terminals in the Port of Tokyo, Japan, were selected for the study. A Sentinel-2A image recorded during the day on 7 April 2021, and a CE-SAT-IIB image recorded during the night on 6 April 2021, were obtained. The digital numbers (DNs) of each red-, green-, and blue-(RGB) band image were analyzed, revealing that the red, green, and blue bands, in that order, had higher DNs in the Sentinel-2A daytime image and the CE-SAT-IIB NTL image at all terminals. One of the eight terminals had a low DN in the CE-SAT-IIB RGB image because its lights were off at the time the image was taken. The operational status of the terminals could be verified from the CE-SAT-IIB image by setting the DN threshold to the green or red bands. We also found that the CE-SAT-IIB image could distinguish white-light-emitting diode (LED) lamps from high-pressure sodium lamps based on color differences in the DNs of the RGB bands. If high-resolution NTL sensors were placed onboard microsatellites, a high-frequency observation constellation network could be constructed using a combination of NTL data and daytime images. This study showed the benefits and usefulness of NTL images of ports; the results will contribute to the overall optimization of the global maritime supply chain network.</jats:p>"

The issues in the GSCLM for the halal food industry are mainly costs, quality, non-segregation, and cross-contamination of halal-haram goods in supply chain processes. Therefore, the paper reveals the knowledge of the key factors for GSCLM in the context of the halal food industry. The research is hypothetically deducted from a transactional cost economic (TCE) and used a quantitative approach. A survey questionnaire was distributed to the halal food industry managers across the country. The key findings from PLS-SEM analysis indicated that technology, strategy, and environment affected the GSCLM through knowledge management. Nevertheless, technology had a small effect on GSCLM. The limitations of the research as it was conducted in the halal food industry, hence the generalizability of our findings is contingent on the validation of the findings with the non-specific halal certification industry. Practical implications are realized in which the industry could enhance the knowledge management in GSCLM effectively. Government should also support the industry with new policies and regulations that could fulfill the halal market demand. Future research may apply other theories to be tested in the context of GSCLM in other non-specific halal certification industries. The paper provides a new model of GSCLM in the halal food industry. Specifically, it applies TCE in GSCLM which demonstrates how knowledge management can affect the GSCLM performance.</jats:p>"

The results suggested that RSCs can achieve Pareto improvement in both cases, thereby coordinating port supply chain revenues. Led by the port logistics service provider and port enterprise, the coordination mechanisms based on RSCs of port supply chain were discussed using logistics service capacity as the coordination link. Despite differing decision orders, the RSC model can coordinate the port’s supply chain with its service provider, while the port and logistics service provider determine the retention ratio.

The goal of this paper is to explore the impact of disclosing sustainability-related information on the cost of equity for firms. The paper first introduces the concept of sustainability information disclosure, and then exhibits its benefit through exploring its impact on reducing a firm’s financing cost. It uses the Gartner supply chain top 50 rankings to construct the experiment environment to test for the effect of sustainability information disclosure on the cost of equity capital. The study uses the Gartner top 50 supply chain rankings from 2013 to 2017 to construct the experiment environment, and test for the sustainability information disclosure’s impact on reducing the cost of equity capital. The regressions, which are based on the 350 firm-year sample of the United States and the 604 global firm-year sample, indicate that sustainability information disclosure significantly reduced the cost of equity capital. This paper uses a fixed effect regression method to analyze the impact of sustainability information disclosure. According to the regression result, the sustainability information disclosure variable has a significant negative coefficient. The result is robust under many settings. Thus, the paper finds that sustainability information disclosure significantly diminishes the cost of equity capital, controlling for ESG information disclosure. It also discusses the implications of the findings and future research directions for sustainability information disclosure.</jats:p>"

However, due to many uncertain factors, the evolution of trust remains a “black box” phenomenon. In order to analyze the impact of the evolution of trust in the PPP supply chain on investment companies and suppliers’ strategic choices, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of PPP supply chain projects, this paper establishes a trust evolutionary game model, which analyzes the evolutionary paths under different scenarios and explores the impact of parameters on the cooperative strategies of participants. The findings indicate that trust asymmetry or an increase in trust can facilitate investment companies and suppliers to opt for positive cooperation strategies. Furthermore, both parties’ strategies are less influenced by their initial willingness and more by trust degree. The moral risk coefficient and information asymmetry coefficient have a negative effect on the cooperative strategies, with the moral risk coefficient of investment companies exhibiting a more significant impact on the entire cooperation process. Moreover, both parties can only choose positive strategies when the information asymmetry coefficient is low. This study holds significant implications for promoting cooperation, enhancing contract performance, safeguarding the interests of all parties, and increasing cooperation satisfaction.</jats:p>"

The possibility of using the geosynthetic materials for ice roads reinforcement is considered, as well as possible challenges arising from their use are exposed for consideration. The use of chemical modifiers for the creation of structural materials based on water ice is shown to be prospective and promising, especially in combination with the reinforcement of ice blocks. Modern approaches to choice of ice modifying compounds and materials for ice reinforcing are described, as well as criteria achieved on the basis of their application. The scientific studies confirming the possibility of a significant increase in the bearing capacity of glacial coverage and, as a result, an earlier start of their operation is carried out. It is shown that the combined use of reinforcement and ice modifiers allowed the ice sample to maintain its integrity even under exposure to significant deformation loads. The technical possibility of additional reinforcement of ice transport routes as a result of optimizing the modal parameters of their formation, depending on weather conditions, is also described.</jats:p>"

One widely used method for leak detection is the Pressure Residual Vector method, which involves comparing pressure values with computed values. In this paper, a new approach using probability distribution function and entropy content is proposed to expand the applicability of the previous models. The study began by collecting real-time information on water consumption using automatic electromechanical water meters over a one-year period. Hourly parameters were calculated to determine the temporal pattern of water consumption per capita. Hypothetical leakage was then imposed on each pipe, and the average entropy of water head variations in the nodes was determined. A combinatorial search process was used to suggest a Pressure Gauge Network (PGN) in a WDS. The study found that after a certain number of pressure gauges, the increase in entropy content is insignificant. This quantity may be deemed as the number of pressure gauges required in the PGN. Furthermore, the study showed that the impact of leak parameters can be disregarded when designing a PGN for leak detection purposes. Overall, the study's findings can be used to design a PGN for leak detection in a WDS.</jats:p>",

The object of analysis is a retailer of pharmaceutical products, more precisely, medicines, which offers, both, brick-and-mortar and online shopping possibilities. The results show that spatial aspects concerning the residential location of consumers, the vehicles used for shopping trips, the shopping basked size, and trip-chaining effects have a crucial impact on the mobility demand and CO2-equivalent emissions of the two commerce forms.

Here, we conducted a short-term (54 days) trial to investigate the impact of different phosphorus fertilizers on plant growth and the soil P cycling microbiota. Lolium perenne was grown with application of superphosphate (SP) as inorganic fertilizer, two ashes (poultry litter ash (PLA) and sewage sludge ash (SSA)), and two struvites (municipal wastewater struvite (MWS) and commercial CrystalGreen® (CGS)) applied at 20 and 60 kg P ha−1 in four replicates. A P-free control (SP0) was also included in the trial. Struvite application increased plant dry weights, and available P acid phosphatase activity was significantly improved for struvites at the high P application rate. The ash RDFs showed a liming effect at 60 kg P ha−1, and PLA60 negatively affected acid phosphatase activity, while PLA20 had significantly lower phoD copy numbers. P mobilization from phosphonates and phytates was not affected. TCP solubilization was negatively affected by mineral SP fertilizer application at both P concentrations. The bacterial (16S and phoD) communities were only marginally affected by the tested P fertilizers. Overall, struvites appeared to be a suitable substitute for superphosphate fertilization for Irish L. perenne pastures.</jats:p>"

Oil production peaked in 1975 at ca. 50kbopd with current production at 11kbopd. The producing reservoirs have a combination drive mechanism with both an active aquifer and a gas cap. Consequently, the wells completed in these reservoirs have a GOR ranging between 500 – 2000scf/bbl and about 15-20MMscf of gas is flared from the facilities daily. To manage the flare volume, the oil wells are typically beaned down to produce on restricted rates, resulting in production deferments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper outlines the technical assessments using Integrated Production System Modelling (IPSM) with the Petroleum Expert IPMTM tool to confirm the viability of bulk flowing the wells from the Alpha &amp; Beta Fields to the nearest facility with AG gathering capability to manage flaring, reduce GHG emissions and create value by unlocking additional gas and oil production. Re-routing to the 120MMscf/d capacity AG compression facility, located ~30km from the fields required the isolation of the wells from the existing delivery line and installation of multiphase header and flowmeters.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results of the analysis indicated that the wells could deliver the expected production to High Pressure (HP) Separator in the Central Processing Facility (CPF). In addition, the wells are expected to sustain production with peak gas rate of 15MMscf/d. The project is expected to contribute to the company's net-zero emission ambition through reduction of GHG emission from flares and combustion engines, enable OPEX savings associated with flare penalties and maintenance activities while providing revenue from unlocking oil production as well as the monetization of the produced gas.</jats:p>",

The acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (COVID-19) proved challenging not only due to threats of contractor deception but also due to disruptions in contractor supply chains. This research analyzes primary interview data with contracting officials involved in purchasing PPE in the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. The results indicate the ways that contractor relationships were perceived useful in anticipating risks surrounding a contractor’s behavior (behavioral uncertainties), but insufficient in anticipating disruptions that can result from a contractor’s supply chains (environmental uncertainties). Contractor relations were perceived to help in predicting industry disruptions, but such relations were likely to be formed alongside transactional and short-term contract designs—and likely to require comparison with other data sources. The results indicate that improving the reliability of critical supply acquisition for future crises is likely to depend on developing expertise in supply chain analysis, especially as the U.S. government increasingly relies on global supply chains in critical supply acquisition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Fourth Industrial Revolution offers new opportunities for improving the efficiency and agility of supply chain operations such as transportation. This study explores the impact of integrating truck platooning technology in forestry products supply networks. Companies need to know how and where to use truck platooning in transportation networks to get optimum benefits from truck platooning in supply chains. To this end, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model was developed. Decisions to be made include the selection of the potential terminal locations, the number of ordinary and platooning trucks needed in the transportation network, the origin and destination of products, and their flow in direct and backhaul routes. The objective is to minimize the overall transportation cost, including terminal location costs, fixed costs for ordinary and platoon trucks, fuel, and driver costs. A total of 27 randomly generated instances are used to test the optimization model. We considered several scenarios to analyze different combinations of using or not backhauling, having or not truck platoons in the network, and allowing or not the truck platoons to visit the forest areas. The results show that the potential savings of combining the two types of trucks are in the range of 1%–12% in the scenarios in which truck platooning transportation is allowed only between terminal and mill nodes. This savings could reach more than 20% when the truck platoons are allowed to visit forest areas, depending on how many forest areas are visited. The number of drivers can be reduced by 3% to more than 30%. In addition, using truck platooning and backhauling together could reduce fuel consumption by 15.6% on average. </jats:p>",

To study the transient characteristics of PCA, firstly, the voltage and the dissipative power of PCA at the common and neutral sections of the power supply line are analyzed and calculated respectively. Secondly, two PCA models that describe the different PCA states are established based on the improved Habedank arc model. Finally, the high-frequency transient voltage and current of the PCA when high-speed trains pass through the common and neutral sections at different speeds are obtained by simulation.

Results show that, the greater consumers' recognition of the remanufactured product, the higher its price and revenue; using FL platform can guarantee the degree of consumer information security, which in turn has a constructive effect on the CLSC; when the FL platform is not adopted, the manufacturer will raise more revenue by misrepresenting the manufacturing and remanufacturing costs; the FL platform would provide some incentive for manufacturers to disclose true cost information and improve the CLSC revenue; an increase in investment costs would lead to a reduction in revenue, so CLSC members would need to make investment decisions based on revenue comparisons before and after using the platform; finally, within the feasibility of the contract parameters, the CSRS contract both maximizes optimal revenue of CLSC system and improves revenue per member.</jats:p>"

Control groups without external nitrogen application were included for each genotype. Several parameters were analyzed, including plant growth, root length, gas exchange, fluorescence, chlorophyll, reducing sugars, amino acids, proteins, and nitrogen uptake. The results revealed a significant genotype effect, particularly between the interspecific OxG hybrid and the Elaeis guinensis genotypes. Ammonium nutrition increased shoot growth in all genotypes compared to nitrate nutrition. Additionally, there was a trend towards increased primary root length, amino acids, proteins, and nitrogen uptake under ammonium supply. These findings are promising, particularly considering the recommendation to use ammonium with inhibitors for environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

In addition, the performance and knowledge of farmers also need to be improved to minimize food loss. Food loss in the milk supply chain occurs due to spills, damage, and product contamination caused by operator negligence and poor handling procedures due to the lack of material handling and operational performance. This study aims to determine the effect of material handling and operational performance on food loss in the milk supply chain. The method used is a quantitative method with a statistical test Chi-Square. The results show that most material handling cases involve manual milking and milk storage. Another cause of food loss is the high production of bacteria, which impacts milk quality. In operational performance, the primary reason is communication among farmers regarding the cleanliness and handling of cattle during production. New farmers with low experience are expected to attend training to increase production capacity and avoid bacterial contamination. Upgrading Milking equipment is also essential to reduce food loss in the milk supply chain</jats:p>"

While on one hand the stratospheric drones, so-called high altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS), form a special use case, the challenge to supply suitable weather data for new air space users is a much wider and more general field of interest.\nHaving a glider-like design with a wide wingspan makes the HAPS very weather-susceptible. They fly very slowly, thus achieving only small climb rates. Hence, ascend and descent take long time and play an important role in the operational concept of the HAPS. For this reason, special focus must be put on the distance between earth&amp;#8217;s surface and the first kilometer above ground, where both, other air traffic but also weather conditions feature lots of constraints. Laterally well resolved weather data in this range is not only key for the HAPS, but ultimately addresses a much wider spectrum of users. Since, however, data sets and their supply ways to the customer in this field are still sparsely available, new dataset products as well as suitable web application programming interfaces (web-APIs) are needed.\nMoreover, particularly strategic flight planning for the next days requires probabilistic weather information since deterministic weather forecast lacks reliability in this regime. But, probabilistic ensemeble-data consists of vast amounts of data that can be challenging to handle. We present a new prototype probabilistic weather data set with detailed height level resolution based on the ICON-D2 NWP model of the Deutsche Wetterdienst. We combine this with the prototype of a new web-API that allows the evaluation of general probabilistic weather data in different height levels in a universal and user-driven fashion. With this contribution we address new air space users but also customers interested in near-surface probabilistic weather information.</jats:p>"

One of the solutions in this case may be the joint use of partitioning and redundancy tools, monitoring and mobile energy platforms. Currently, this issue has not been fully investigated. (Research purpose) The research purpose is justifying the joint use of partitioning tools and mobile energy platforms for reserving electricity supply to rural consumers. (Materials and methods) Used data from a literature review on the values of the time of interruptions in power supply during emergency and planned outages in 0.4 kilovolt electrical networks, monitoring tools, partitioning and reserving power supply to rural consumers. The method of situational modeling was applied to identify the features of the joint use of partitioning tools and mobile energy platforms for reserving electricity supply to rural consumers. (Results and discussion) We performed situational modeling of reserving power supply to consumers using mobile power platforms without localization and with localization of sections of power lines by means of partitioning and redundancy, which showed the relevance of the method of sharing means of partitioning, monitoring and mobile power platforms for reserving power supply to rural consumers.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate and monitor the risks associated with such disruptions. Epidemics, including the profound impact of COVID‐19, exemplify disruptive risks that engender complexities throughout the value chain. COVID‐19 has caused significant disruptions to the global supply chain due to the preexisting fragile supply chains, resulting in the unavailability of essential raw materials, halts in production, and imbalances between supply and demand. It has forced the supply chain community to rethink their risk mitigation strategies. Despite its significance, there are a few studies on the existing options and strategies to mitigate the risks associated with epidemics such as COVID‐19. This special issue explores state‐of‐the‐art knowledge of various risks and their mitigation strategies, presenting optimized models and solutions. This editorial seeks to introduce valuable insights and illuminate promising avenues for future research by reviewing existing studies. The comprehensive understanding derived from this editorial and the accompanying articles of this special issue will benefit both researchers and practitioners, enabling them to navigate the multifaceted landscape of epidemic‐induced disruptive risks in the supply chain and adopt suitable mitigation strategies. Furthermore, this special issue lays a solid foundation for implementing advanced methods for managing and mitigating the disruptive risks that epidemics pose to the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban water distribution networks are crucial infrastructures for providing essential services to society, but their exorbitant costs and limited water resources make their optimization a critical research area. Optimal management and design of these networks can help to reduce costs and enhance their efficiency while meeting technical, economic, and quality standards. In particular, the management of network pressure is critical for reducing leakage in water distribution systems. Thus, this study aimed to investigate two objective functions for optimizing the water distribution network: (i) minimizing costs while considering the number of pressure-relief valves, and (ii) minimizing network pressure by observing the optimal pressure range. To achieve this, the Nondominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) multi-objective metaheuristic algorithm was employed as the optimization tool, and a computer program was written in MATLAB software for solving the optimization models. EPANET software was also used for hydraulic simulation of the water distribution network. The efficiency and capabilities of these models were tested on the case study of the third district of Mashhad in Iran. The results indicated that the installation and adjustment of pressure-relief valves in accordance with the positions and optimal settings of the output of the proposed models significantly improved the desired goals, particularly the average pressure of the network. As an example of optimization, the study achieved a 56.12% reduction in pressure compared to the case without a plan, considering five pressure-relief valves.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we investigate whether and how investors of suppliers learn from the private information embedded in the customer credit default swap (CDS) market prior to customer earnings announcements. We find that investors of suppliers indeed incorporate the customer private information revealed in the CDS market into the supplier valuation, thereby leading to significant changes in suppliers’ future stock prices. Moreover, such price discovery effect is more pronounced when: (i) the level of customer private information revealed in the CDS market is more prominent; (ii) the customer bond market is more illiquid; (iii) the customers are expected to report bad earnings news or experience deteriorated credit conditions; (iv) the strength of the supplier–customer economic bond is stronger. Our results remain robust when we control for the supplier's own CDS market price discovery effect or conduct matched sample analyses. Finally, utilizing the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank Act) as an exogenous shock, we show that the effect of customer CDS trading on suppliers’ future stock prices is less pronounced after the Dodd–Frank Act due to more explicit regulation on informed trading activities. Overall, our study documents significant cross‐market information transmission along the supply chain network (i.e., from the customer derivative market to the supplier equity market). </jats:p>",

Therefore, a transition into a more sustainable system can only be possible by adopting circular economy principles and practices that can facilitate the elimination of unsustainable packaging, irresponsible disposal behaviors, and waste management. This paper mainly focuses on circular packaging practices in the existing literature to reveal the drivers of circular food packaging applications. The study also displays the triple combinations of material-sector, material-CE, and sector-CE principles. As a methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) has been used for this study. Furthermore, this study investigates the literature findings, such as the most frequently mentioned food sector and sub-sector, CE principles, materials adopted for food packaging, and so on. The primary contribution of this study to the body of literature is the synthesis and mapping of the literature as a whole from the perspectives of CE principles, both sector-based and national, and the materials used through circular food packaging, and the attempt to facilitate this transition into a more circular system by outlining the drivers of circular food packaging.</jats:p>"

A conceptual framework is formulated by incorporating the natural resource‐based view, knowledge‐based view, and rational choice theory. This framework is supported and validated using PLS‐SEM. The findings of the analysis reveal that the virtual environment of the metaverse can create a sense of physical proximity, effectively managing communication distance and influencing firms' emotional attitude during interactions. Furthermore, the metaverse facilitates sensory feedback, thereby strengthening emotional expression. Based on these observations, supply chain firms are likely to adopt rational thinking and demonstrate rational behavior, making choices that foster mutual trust. As trust is established, it promotes the sharing of green knowledge, strengthens supply chain resilience, facilitates the achievement of environmentally friendly performance in the green supply chain, and contributes to the sustainable development of the environment. This study makes valuable contributions to the existing literature concerning the integration of green supply chain and the metaverse.</jats:p>",

Pre-commercial and commercial thinning were applied to a portion of the better sites, which allowed shortening of the time to merchantability and earlier harvest than unthinned stands; less than 25% of the forest was thinned over the course of the plan. The sustainable harvest rate, represented here as the annual allowable cut (AAC), increased by ∼14% above baseline, when thinning was applied. Similarly, there was a 20.7% increase in AAC projected with the relaxation of even flow rules if thinning was also applied. Finally, thinning offset the expected decline in AAC after a 20-year surge in cutting of mature pine, designed to slow an epidemic of mountain pine beetle. In terms of wood supply, the volume extracted at thinning was &lt;2% of annual supply but volume from final harvest from thinned stands, at times, surpassed that of unthinned stands of the forest. Individual tree size from thinned stands was ∼twice that from unthinned areas in the second part of the planning period, offsetting the expected decline in piece size after the era of harvest of natural forests. </jats:p>",

This paper uses a volume-of-fluid model based on the finite-volume method to track the fuel motion in different states of a flight vehicle and obtains the liquid-surface sloshing and the liquid flow in the connecting pipe. The model uses the dynamic meshing technique combined with the pressure at the solid wall to track the motion of the one-way stop valve diaphragm in the connecting pipe, thereby better predicting the fuel transfer in the connecting pipe. The calculation covers the whole process of flight vehicle erection, standby, flight, pumping, and pressurization and provides the distribution of pressure in different fuel tanks and the fuel flow characteristics in the connecting pipe. The calculation results are consistent with the experimental results, which verifies the accuracy of the model. By calculating different working cases, the results show that the different states of the flight vehicle strongly affect the sloshing of the liquid in the fuel tank, the pressure distribution, and the opening and closing of the valves. The maximum mass flow rate through the three valves, pressure at the bottom of the tank, and pressure at the pumping port all increase after the pressurization in the fuel tank. The flow of fuel between different tanks can be increased by changing the structure of the connecting pipe, which affects the pressure at different locations in the tank and at the pumping port.</jats:p>",

Residential and industrial consumers are characterized by a state of family/business and ownership and the use of energy equipment such as rooftop solar PV and stationary battery storage in their homes/offices. Consumers’ electricity demand is estimated from regression analyses using training data. Using the hypothetical community constructed for the analysis, the simulation model performs rule-based electricity trading and provides outputs comprising the total electricity demand in the community, the state of use of battery storage and solar PV, the trading volume, and the electricity independence rate of the community. From the simulation results, we discuss policy implications on the effective use of renewable energy and increasing electricity independence by fully utilizing battery and trading functions in a community.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to explore the impact of the purchase regret of consumers on dynamic closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) under discrete-time conditions. Durable products are mostly traded under discrete-time conditions, and consumers tend to have different purchase regret psychologies during the trading process of different types of durable products (innovative or remanufactured). In addition, different purchase regret psychologies can affect the dynamic decision-making behaviour of the nodal enterprises in the supply chain, thus affecting the dynamic decision-making optimization sequence of the supply chain and nodal enterprises. Based on the traditional Bass model, this paper introduces the factor of consumer purchase regret psychology into the Bass model and constructs a model of a CLSC led by the manufacturer and followed by the retailer and recycler on the premise of heterogeneous characteristics of new products and remanufactured products. The optimal control theory of discrete systems is used to obtain the optimal decision sequence for each participant in the CLSC, when there is consumer regret psychology in the market. Then, the effects of consumer purchase regret psychology on the members of the CLSC at each stage are analysed. Finally, the conclusions are verified by using a numerical analysis. Compared to previous studies, the results further revealed the following: when the market share of brand new products is below 50%, the wholesale and retail prices are positively related to the regret psychology; while when they are above 50%, the wholesale and retail prices are negatively related to the regret psychology; the product sales and the manufacturers and retailers’ profits are negatively related to the regret psychology; purchase regret psychology does not affect the recyclers’ profits. To mitigate the negative consequences of the purchase regret psychology, manufacturers and merchants should completely grasp the market, enhance product quality, such that the price plan for the product is fairer.</jats:p>"

Consequently, there are calls for moving away from JIT toward holding more inventory as preparation against future disruptions, which is referred to as just‐in‐case. The academic community is also divided. Some scholars argue that JIT is not resilient, while others maintain that JIT can continue providing superior performance even with disruptions. Motivated by this debate, we discuss various misconceptions about JIT that underlie this debate. Furthermore, we present different ways to adapt JIT for turbulent environments and argue that companies can improve their supply chain performance if JIT supply chain segments are chosen fittingly—even more so—during disruptions. </jats:p>",

However, the widespread adoption of blockchain faces several barriers that need to be identified and understood. The construction industry faces significant challenges regarding supply chain transparency and sustainability. Current practices lack visibility, leading to difficulties in tracing material origins, tracking movement, and ensuring compliance. To fill this gap, this study employed a three-phase approach. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature review identified 37 potential barriers. Subsequently, expert discussions were held to refine the list, ultimately selecting 15 barriers of utmost importance. In the second phase, data were collected from 17 experts representing academia and industry. Finally, in the last phase, the collected data were analyzed using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (AHP) methodology. The findings revealed that the “transparency range” category was the most critical barrier, closely followed by “inadequate access to institutional finance”. Surprisingly, the study identified the “security environment” as the most significant barrier. These results offer construction companies, policymakers, and other industry stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of blockchain adoption’s challenges. With this knowledge, stakeholders can design effective strategies and policies to address these barriers. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in decision making when assessing technology adoption, making the findings applicable beyond the construction industry.</jats:p>"

It aims to reduce transportation and inventory costs and avoid alerts of inventory limit violations by formulating reasonable crude oil transportation and inventory strategies. Two main difficulties coexist in this problem: the large problem scale and uncertain supply and demand. Traditional operations research (OR) methods, which rely on forecasting supply and demand, face significant challenges when applied to the complicated and uncertain short-term operational process of the crude oil supply chain. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hierarchical optimization framework and proposes a well-designed hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL), as an upper-level agent, is used to select the operational operators combined by various sub-goals and solving orders, while the lower-level agent finds a viable solution and provides penalty feedback to the upper-level agent based on the chosen operator. Additionally, we deploy a simulator based on real-world data and execute comprehensive experiments. Regarding the alert number, maximum alert penalty, and overall transportation cost, our HRL method outperforms existing OR and two RL algorithms in the majority of time steps.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient widely used in maize crop production. The application of a high N rate is commonly practiced by growers as a \"guarantee\" of optimal growth and yield. However, excessive nitrogen consumption can cause wastage, negatively impact plants, and adversely affects the environment. This paper reports on the impact of N supply on leaf characteristics in maize. Maize was grown in an experimental plot of the Department of Agronomy, The Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Hungary, during the spring and summer of 2021 (May - October). Four observation plots consisting of ​​102 m area size were evaluated for various N levels (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1 N a.i) with marked plants sampling in four replications. Data collection on leaf traits viz. leaf number plant-1 (B), leaf number plant-1 (S), temperature 0C (leaf surface), SPAD, leaf length (cm), leaf width (cm), and leaf area (cm2) were measured one week after application in weekly sequences of N until the eighth week. The results showed that nitrogen fertilizer application increased the leaf number plant-1 (B), temperature, SPAD, and leaf width while contrasting with leaf number plant-1 (S). However, there was no difference in leaf length for all treatments studied. Although an increase occurred up to the use of 100 N. Whereas, the 150 N treatment showed low performance and exhibited a negative correlation for all traits except temperature and number of leaves (S). The results suggest that treatment of 100 N produced the best results in most traits studied. Furthermore, a detailed research study is needed to confirm the findings, as many other environmental factors influence maize plant growth.</jats:p>"

For the characteristics of occasional and sudden changes of rainfall in coastal hilly areas, this article chooses four cities in the eastern Zhejiang province as the object of the study and establishes a rainfall prediction model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), reptile search algorithm (RSA), and differentiable neural computer (DNC). The VMD algorithm reduces the complexity of the sequence data; RSA is used to find the best-fit function; and DNC combines the advantages of the recurrent neural network and computational processing to improve the problem of memory forgetting of long short-term memory. To verify the prediction accuracy of the model, the prediction results are compared with the other three models, and the results show that the VMD–RSA–DNC model has the best prediction with the maximum and minimum relative errors of 9.62 and 0.17%, respectively, the average root-mean-square error of 5.43, the average mean absolute percentage error of 3.59%, and the average Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.95 for predicting four cities in the coastal hilly area. This study provides a new reference method for the construction of rainfall prediction models.</jats:p>",

The objective is to minimize the gap between available generation capacity and load demand while maintaining an equitable supply for all consumers. Load shedding is a prominent problem for many developing countries. To address this issue, this paper explores the potential of a hybrid energy system (HES) to provide uninterrupted power supply at the distribution feeder despite load shedding from electrical grid. The proposed HES in this work combines photovoltaic (PV) array, battery storage system (BSS) and diesel generator (DG). The HES is equipped with energy management scheme (EMS) that ensures continuous power supply, improves energy efficiency, and minimizes the electricity cost. To accomplish these tasks, the EMS operates the system in one of three modes: grid mode, renewable energy source mode and the diesel generator mode. Besides, the proposed methodology allows injecting surplus PV energy into the grid, thus maximizing PV utilization and improving power system’s reliability. The results of this study will assist policymakers to determine the prospect of renewable based hybrid system to supply sustainable power and eliminate the energy problems in the power deficit countries.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology is a technology that performs several operations without letting the information get lost. This digital technology of blockchain will show the potential to reshape the management of supply chain operations in various companies. We will investigate the impact of blockchain technology in relation to efficiency and sustainability. As an example recently the operations in the airport industry have been improving due to technological advances as blockchain technology is handling all the information in the warehouses about product delivery and services in SCM. This technology allows companies to track all types of transactions more securely and transparently and blockchain technology shows benefits, especially in terms of improving Operational Management. The technological disruptions that have an effect on operations must include A-CDM (Airport collaborative decision-making) disruption management and there should be a collaborative network where everyone shares mutual trust and common culture in order to avoid disruption. Airports are still under research in terms of managing blockchain technology efficiently and effectively. The database which is decentralized causes the transactions to be transparent, reliable, traceable, and efficient to supply chain management. This article will be useful to understand the importance of blockchain technology for maintaining sustainability in the operations of SCM along with that we will take an example of SCM in the airport industry to understand how this technology is used there.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, there is limited empirical evidence on the potential impact of green initiatives, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and reflective moral attentiveness (RMA) on sustainable performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effect of reflective moral attentiveness (RMA) on the relationship between green supply-chain-management practices (GSCM) and CSR on sustainable performance. Based on the natural-resource-based view, stakeholder resource-based view, and signaling theory, this study investigated the role of GSCM practices and CSR in sustainable performance using cross-sectional data from the manufacturing and services industries from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in Pakistan. (2) Methods: Using a non-probability convenience-sampling method, 500 employees were selected from the firms which are listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSE) and questionnaires were distributed. Complete questionnaires were received from 380 employees and used in the analysis, yielding a response rate of 76%. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) software was used for the confirmatory-factor analysis (CFA) and the testing of the hypotheses. The CFA results revealed the reliability and validity of the questionnaires. (3) Results: The results of the structural model (hypotheses testing) show that four attributes of GSCM practices (internal environmental management, green purchasing, cooperation with customers, and eco-design) have a positive influence on sustainable performance, while investment recovery and CSR were found to be insignificant. Moreover, there were significant and positive influences of GSCM and RMA on sustainable performance. On the other hand, control variables, such as gender, experience, and age, were found to have no significant role in sustainable performance. A further analysis revealed that reflective moral attentiveness mediated the relationship between GSCM, CSR, and sustainable performance. (4) Conclusions/implications: This study has several implications for green services and manufacturing firms specifically and for practitioners, researchers and academics in general. The innovation and novelty of this study lie in its determination of the contribution of RMA, GSCM, and CSR to achieving sustainable performance. Firms can improve their clean production activities by incorporating this model as a strategy. Future studies may add moderators and mediators to explore the impact of CSR and GSCM practices upon sustainability.</jats:p>"

Type 1 is the least common form in this group. In 75% of these cases, the aberrant artery (AA) originates from the thoracic aorta. AA originating from the celiac plexus is very rare. Moreover, even if it originates from an abdominal vascular, AA is extended left lower lobe of the lung or the right middle lobe. Our case is atypical with its azygoesophageal recess (AOR) localization. The AOR is a special region that forms the mediobasal segment of the right lung. After the pandemic, this region has been expressed as one of the areas where COVID-19 infection shows affinity. The reason for this condition has not been definitively clarified yet. Therefore, the anatomical details of this segment need to be more probed. Furthermore, the radiological multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) appearance of our case is in the differential diagnosis, with Scimitar syndrome and, as far as we know, this differential diagnosis detail has not been mentioned so far. MDCT plays an important role in the diagnosis and planning of definitive treatment by determining the origin and course of the AA. Definitive treatment may be surgery (lobectomy or segmentectomy) or endovascular. The case of a 62-year-old patient with a lung AA is presented accompanied by radiological and clinical findings.</jats:p>",

We develop a model supported by the resilience and resource‐based theories to assess supply chain decision‐makers in the United States. We validate the model by employing partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. We find that supply chain agility and flexibility can support supply chain resilience, which in turn sustains supply chain performance. Furthermore, we find a mediation effect of supply chain resilience in the relationship between agility and supply chain performance, as well as between flexibility and supply chain performance. Furthermore, the findings suggest that supply chain performance under severe disruptions can be achieved when supply chains are resilient based on the combination of agility and flexibility. Our study contributes to the supply chain resilience and resource‐based theory literature by identifying that resource configuration plays a decisive role in resilience and performance in severe disruptions due to resource scarcity. Our findings suggest that not all resilience‐related resources are necessary to build resilience and support performance. Therefore, when confronted by a disruptive crisis, managers, practitioners and policymakers should identify the best resource configurations to create resilience and support performance.</jats:p>",

A combination of the know-how and mandates of local government and the private water-retail sector could provide solutions. In order to achieve successful implementation, the authors present here tools from the disaster risk management legislation in South Africa for operationalization of this public–private partnership. These are tools based on Chapter 5, part 1, paragraphs 42 (1d) and Chapter 5, part 2, section/paragraph 47 (1a) i-iv of the Disaster Management Act no. 57 of 2002. Regulations for the recruitment and participation of volunteers in disaster risk management should be applied through the establishment of the volunteer units and the component for drinking water provision. The use of volunteer units with the engagement of the private sector would provide additional tools for the implementation of the preparedness and mitigation measures for drinking water provision in Makana Local Municipality. Local solutions for increasing the resilience of drinking water provision are available and identified based on the modeling work of a container solution. Potential implementation of that container solution for increasing resilience of drinking water provision would require an investment of 6.81-13.00 percent of the 2017-2019 annual budget of Makana Local Municipality. At any given time in 2018, the probability of the emergency treatment activation would be about 33.4 percent in Makana Local Municipality. An example of the ad hoc management about the provision of borehole water from 2019 indicates that planning is critical to success of the increased resilience initiatives. Onsite storage of water during the constant supply might be necessary to ensure treatment and drinking water provision.</jats:p>"

Bu pencereden bakıldığı zaman, söz konusu hizmetlerin nitelikleri kadar, nasıl hazırlandığı, yani süreç ve maliyet gibi hususlarda önemli bir başlık olarak ortaya çıkmaktadır. Belediyelerde özellikle süreç yönetimi ve buna paralel olarak paranın doğru şekilde yani verimli kullanılamayışı orta ve uzun vade de  büyük sorunlar çıkmasına sebep olabilmektedir. Genel denetim olarak Sayıştay denetimlerine tabi olan belediyeler, kamu kaynaklarının verimli bir şekilde ifa edilememesi durumunda denetim ve teftişler sonucunda düzeltilmesi zor bazı sorunlar ile karşılaşabilmekte ve bazen bahsi geçen iş ve işlemleri yapanlar hakkında soruşturmalar açılabilmektedir. Tam olarak bu noktada Yapı Bilgi Modellemesi (YBM - BIM) kullanılarak süreç yönetimini daha verimli bir şekilde kullanmanın mümkün olduğu, buna ek olarak söz konusu hizmetlerin sağlanması için gerekli olan mal ve hizmet alımı süreçlerinin yapıldığı doğrudan temin adı verilen ve belirli bir limite kadar olan alımları da BIM ile entegrasyonunu sağlayarak, söz konusu süreçleri daha kontrol edilebilir bir mekanizmaya sokulabileceği görülmüştür.

But in the United States, the establishment of Machine learning (ML)is not easy because of the higher level of regulations, higher cost, data privacy issues and issues related to the integration of Machine learning (ML) with the existing systems. This article seeks to discuss the problems and possibilities of ML’s implementation in American healthcare supply chains while considering factors that facilitate or hinder the processes. In this study, national survey data of 200 professionals from the healthcare supply chain are used to discover the challenges related to the implementation of ML and the respondents’ perceptions of the advantages and future of ML. Comparing with the result of questionnaire survey, data analysis points out that Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are two important regulatory that create problems for health IT firms, including security requirements and high compliance cost. The research also reveals that geographic location influences ML priorities, as Machine learning (ML) is expected to enhance decision making for the Western US participants while cost containment applications of ML are valued by Northeast participants since healthcare costs are higher in this region. The study also shows that there are differences based on the role; procurement managers and supply chain analysts have varied opinions regarding the use of ML to improve cost efficiency and inventory management. The study shows that there is a need to develop the U.S.-specific approaches to ML adoption based on the regional, regulatory and role-specific circumstances. Some are increasing data accuracy and data security; others are implementing specific monetary rewards for patients; still, others are investing in staff development and infrastructure to support the use of ML. This research serves to add to the developing literature on ML in healthcare supply chains and gives a viewpoint unique to the United States while also delivering informative best practices for those organizations aiming to exploit ML’s possibilities effectively</jats:p>"

Leagile strategy has been suitably applicable to manufacturing and has also been adopted by organizations in the optimization of deliveries of prefabricated building projects1,2. Companies equally embrace leagile strategy towards improving their competitiveness and realizing success3. Objective: This paper is an empirical study that examines the Supply Chains of Construction Companies to determine how Leagile Strategy impacts Competitive Advantage. Methodology: From a population of 4,015, stratified and simple random sampling procedure was employed to obtain a sample of 323 construction companies located in Nairobi-Kenya which were surveyed vide a cross-sectional approach. Diagnostic tests were conducted which revealed the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Using structured questionnaires formulated in a five-point Likert Type scale to collect data, inquiries were directed to 323 respondents who were Supply Chain Managers and Directors or their representatives obtaining response from 260. Analysis of information was done vide Statistical software for social sciences version 22, generating both descriptive and inferential statistics.  Correlation, and a linear regression model were used to test the hypothesis. Findings: This study found that leagile strategy influences competitive advantage in the construction companies’ supply chains. The findings further showed that other additional factors besides leagile strategy influence competitive advantage. Conclusion: A major conclusion was drawn that competitive advantage is significantly influenced by leagile strategy in construction companies’ supply chains. It was further concluded that through leagile strategy implementation, construction companies improved their competitiveness, outperformed competitors and alleviate the various problems hindering survival. Furthermore, the study established that besides leagile strategy, there are other factors which are contributing to competitive advantage. Implications: There is an exposition of the existence of a significant influence on competitive advantage by leagile strategy. The finding enhances conceptual understanding on the association between those two variables and increases knowledge in strategic management.  There is fresh literature on the fact that leagile strategy vide its attributes such as waste removal, TQM, strategic planning, flexibility, responsiveness, IT systems, economies of scale, etc. impacts on competitive advantage.  Additionally, leagile strategy has the capabilities of attaining competitive advantage by reducing costs, differentiating products, enhancing customer service level and shortening the lead times.  The study also compliments knowledge concerning methodology in terms of the use of stratified sampling procedure, diagnostic tests which ensure research instrument’s reliability and validity as well as the Statistical software for social sciences version 22 to confirm how leagile strategy influences competitive advantage. Limitations: However, major limitations such as the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic hindered the smooth data collection process and may have affected the response rate. This study recommends that construction companies should embrace leagile strategy to improve their competitiveness, outperform competitors and survive in the tumultuous business environment. This can be done through the implementation of practices which focus on reducing costs, differentiating products, increasing customer service level and shortening lead times. This research proposes that future studies should be conducted across other multiple industries and sectors using different methodologies from the current study.</jats:p>",

The supplier directly sells products to overseas market through an online channel and a retail channel. Since the supplier expands the overseas market and bears the potential risk of exchange rate volatility, the supplier is risk‐averse. In the presence of exchange rate volatility, the risk‐averse supplier decides whether to purchase an option to hedge against the risk of exchange rate volatility. Conditional value at risk is applied as a measure of the supplier's risk‐averse behavior. To identify the conditions under which the risk‐averse supplier should purchase an option, we analyze two scenarios: the benchmark model and the option model. By comparing the benchmark model with the option model, we show that if the option premium is lower than a threshold, the risk‐averse supplier prefers to purchase an option, which also makes the retailer better off. Interestingly, when the supplier becomes less risk‐averse, as the exchange rate volatility increases, both players benefit a higher utility in the option model. Finally, we verify the results’ robustness using numerical analysis.</jats:p>",

We show that, in the presence of supply chain competition, the global brand will be benefited from blockchain adoption when the competition intensity degree is high, the crash cost is low, and the probability of COVID‐19 outbreak is high. We then verify the robustness of the main findings by studying the impact of the global brand's risk attitude, its overestimation of production delay, and the unexpected production delay in the low‐risk areas. In addition, we examine the social welfare and find it can also benefit from the global brand's blockchain adoption but the consumer surplus cannot.</jats:p>",

Effects of abiotic environmental factors on phenolic compound concentrations in the plant tissue may represent one of the major underlying mechanisms, as these compounds are known to play a substantial role in plant resistance to pests. In particular, this applies to conifer trees, in which a large range of phenolic compounds are produced constitutively and/or induced by pathogen attack. We subjected Norway spruce saplings to water limitation and elevated nutrient supply over 2 years and subsequently controlled infection with the needle rust Chrysomyxa rhododendri (DC.) de Bary and analysed both constitutive and inducible phenolic compound concentrations in the needles as well as the degree of infection. Compared with the control group, both drought and fertilization profoundly modified the constitutive and pathogen-induced profiles of phenolic compounds, but had little impact on the total phenolic content. Fertilization predominantly affected the inducible phenolic response and led to higher infection rates by C. rhododendri. Drought stress, in contrast, mainly shaped the phenolic profiles in healthy plant parts and had no consequences on the plant susceptibility. The results show that specific abiotic effects on individual compounds seem to be decisive for the infection success of C. rhododendri, whereby the impaired induced response in saplings subjected to nutrient supplementation was most critical. Although drought effects were minor, they varied depending on the time and length of water limitation. The results indicate that prolonged drought periods in the future may not significantly alter the foliar defence of Norway spruce against C. rhododendri, but fertilization, often propagated to increase tree growth and forest productivity, can be counterproductive in areas with high pathogen pressure.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Highlights</jats:title>\n               </jats:sec>",

Therefore, this paper first uses historical data to quantitatively fit the unfavorable effect of rainfall on maize yield affected by drought, taking the maize planting in the Heilongjiang Province of China as an example. Then, using a Stackelberg game, payback revenue sharing (PBRS), and cost revenue sharing (CRS), contract mechanisms are developed to coordinate the maize supply chain incorporating yield uncertainty from drought and demand risk faced by the retailer. We investigate the impact of uncertain maize yield on the supply chain and conduct numerical experiments to verify the analysis. The results reveal that declining rainfall, representing increasing drought severity, negatively affects the profits of the entire supply chain and its members; however, supply chain efficiency is raised under both coordinated contracts. In addition, the yield risk-sharing proportion was higher under a CRS mechanism than a PBRS one, which gives more incentives for the vulnerable supplier to participate in the supply chain. Finally, our analysis indicates that rearranging contract structures and parameters based on classic revenue sharing contracts could realize supply chain coordination.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the impact of the enforcement cost on a firm's tax‐efficient supply chain allocation strategy, wherein the firm can either create a research and development (R&amp;D) center that innovates the intangible assets or create a distributor that acts as a marketing hub, in a low tax region to explore tax arbitrage. We show that when the firm engages in market competition and the impact of the enforcement cost is low, it prefers to create a distributor in the low tax region to align the benefits of tax saving and internal coordination. While if the impact of the enforcement cost is high, the firm prefers R&amp;D center in the low tax region that can effectively mitigate the enforcement cost and achieve tax saving. When the market competition becomes more intense, the firm becomes more likely to choose R&amp;D center in the low tax region to alleviate market competition. In this scenario, the social welfare is always higher when the firm allocates distributor in the low tax region. When an external supplier exists, the firm is still more likely to choose R&amp;D center in the low tax region to reduce the supplier's wholesale price. What's more, in the presence of external supplier, the social welfare can be higher under either allocation format.</jats:p>",

In this study, a simulation of the PLTS system design was carried out using a hybrid microgrid as a power supply using PVsyst software to simulate PLTS performance. Power load requirements are adjusted to the specifications of electric vehicles. Meteonorm meteorological data were compared with field data to adjust for data variability. In the design simulation, there are three different slope angle scenarios, namely 10º, 13º, and 15º. The effective surface area for installing PLTS on an unmeasured roof is 35 m x 14 m (490 m2), so the number of modules that can be installed will be adjusted to the roof area. The PLTS system is capable of producing 169.3 MWh of power per year with an optimal tilt angle of 13º which has specific production of 1726 kWh/kWp/year and a performance ratio of 78.63%.

But this approach was missing in tackling the COVID-19-crisis while it was spreading globally. Most countries like Bangladesh were not prepared addressing it. They started with traditional approaches explicitly lockdown, shutdown-crowded-spots, and imposed-mandatory wearing-mask outside-home. However, a sizable population-percentage country-wise had ignored the restrictions. During the second wave of the crisis, no-mask-no-service was in practice. It was effective in most cases. However, no effort was given to convince people, making them understand and then make appeal for peoples’ actions. Today there is no lockdown or restriction. But a small population-percentage wear masks, which has been growing. This dichotomy result raises the question: Is it the outcome of individual’s psychological influence being safe? This study uses demand and supply model and concludes that perceived risk-factors, being observers or heard about the consequences, media-messages, and feelings of responsibility &amp; safety out of self-consciousness etc. play significant roles in today’s scenario. Since most people are risk-averse, utility analysis of the factor(s) of psychology-influences such as individual’s understanding about severity, knowledge etc. are dominating today’s scenario where expected utility leads the mask-wearing-trends. Thus, the policy-proposal ratifies that use the techniques of convincing over command &amp; control could have undercut the death-numbers during severity-period.

      "abstract": "<p>Large-scale investments in water supply infrastructure will be required to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. Safely managed water services are also a central element of global strategies to prevent cholera and diarrhoeal diseases. However, evidence remains scarce on how to efficiently improve piped water services in the complex settings that bear high disease burdens and where infrastructure investments are most needed. We conducted a process evaluation of a large-scale water supply infrastructure improvement programme in the town of Uvira, an endemic cholera hotspot in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Considering three evaluation domains – context, implementation of the intervention, and population response –, we assessed the validity of the programme’s theory of change and its underlying assumptions. Information sources included documents related to construction works and to the programme implementation, operational and billing records from the water system operator, and household surveys, covering the period from 2014 until 2021.The programme did not achieve the expected improvements in the water supply service available to the population of Uvira during the evaluation period. Contextual challenges included major events such as extreme flooding in early 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Issues related to the electricity supply and the rise of Lake Tanganyika emphasise the need for cross-sectoral approaches and consideration of climate change in the planning of water supply infrastructure. Implementation challenges underlined a need for capacity strengthening alongside infrastructure improvements. Population response elements revealed the importance of designing affordable interventions and of taking informal practices such as the sharing of household taps into account. The programme was a good example of early engagement with researchers. Pragmatic evaluation approaches combining relevant methods should be adopted for the generation of useful scientific evidence from complex programmes in order to inform and enhance the effectiveness of future infrastructure investments contributing to progress towards SDG6.</p>"

Inability to dispose of the produced water would result in water level build-up in the condensate stabilization tank, which impacts the ability to spike condensate, forced reduction in gas production as much as 500MMscf/d or complete gas plant shut down with deferments as high as 1.2 Bscf/d from both gas plants.

Particularly, cavitation is a prominent problem when the flow in the tunnel transitions from pressurized to unpressurized conditions. As a countermeasure, sidewall contractions are often installed at the end of the pressurized section. In this paper, with numerical simulations and vacuum tank experiments, we analyzed the design parameters of several prototype projects and studied the flow properties and cavitation characteristics of the transition section. The four main factors that influence cavitation risks are the contraction ratio of the transition section, the top press slope, the length of the transition section, and the shape of the orifice. The study of a real-world project demonstrates that by implementing a severe constriction degree, the top press slope can be slowed down, and the pressurized transition section can be extended, thereby reducing cavitation risks and improving flow patterns. These research results provide a reference for the optimal design of hydraulic structures.</jats:p>",

The accessory kidney is more medial, slightly cranial. The native kidney is more lateral and more caudal. The native and accessory kidneys had only one blood supply, venous drainage, and a single ureter. As at the time of reporting, the patient has not received any intervention because there was no remarkable symptom noted. This case is rare and unique, in that it is a fused supernumerary kidney seen at the age of 62 and has a single blood supply and ureter. Imaging for vague symptoms can result in an incidental finding of a rare anatomical variant. It is also very essential for planning surgical intervention if need be.</jats:p>",

The denouement of this research work will be useful for the designer and installer of such a system in deciding the number of collectors according to the requirement. An exhaustive calculation is carried out considering all four kinds of climatic conditions in each month of the year for the weather of New Delhi, India. Fundamental equations of NPVT-FPC-DSU and all pertinent sets of values have been dined to the data processing code developed in MATLAB to estimate annual freshwater production, energy, thermal and electrical exergies, overall energy, exergy, and efficiency. Finally, values of these parameters except annual overall electrical energy recede with the augmentation in ṁfr value, and they become approximately constant exceeding ṁfr value of 0.10 kg/s. Conversely, an increase in the values of the above-mentioned parameters has been obtained with the increase in the value of N. Moreover, the optimum value of N is found to be 4 and 8 from yearly overall energy and exergy efficiency viewpoints, respectively.</jats:p>",

Digital technology, a valuable tool for enhancing organizational information processing capabilities, plays a crucial role in promoting successful green supply chain innovation. However, existing research has a limited understanding of how digital capability advantage influences green supply chain innovation. Therefore, based on an inter-organizational learning perspective, this study aims to explore the impact of digital capability advantage on green supply chain innovation and examine the mediating role of green supply chain learning (green supplier learning and green customer learning). The survey results from 221 Chinese manufacturing firms indicate that digital capability advantages contribute directly and positively to green supply chain innovation and also indirectly enhance it through green supplier learning and green customer learning. This study establishes the positive relationship between digital capability advantages and green supply chain innovation and highlights the mediating role of green supplier learning and green customer learning. The research conclusions not only enhance our understanding of the factors and key success paths of green supply chain innovation from a digital perspective but also provide theoretical guidance for its effective implementation in manufacturing firms.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the role of digital technologies in addressing these barriers in the circularity of supply chains in the public sector remains a gap. Thus, this study bridges these gaps by evaluating digital technologies according to their relevance in addressing the identified barriers. In particular, eight domain experts who have sufficient knowledge and expertise in the domains of the public sector and circular economy were asked to elicit judgments in order to (1) set a threshold that defines the list of barriers that are significant to supply chains in the public sector, (2) obtain the priority weights of these barriers through the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), and (3) rank the identified digital technologies based on their relevance in addressing the identified barriers in public sector supply chains using combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) method, all under a Fermatean fuzzy set environment to account for epistemic uncertainties in judgment elicitation processes. This novel integration of the CRITIC and CODAS methods augmented by Fermatean fuzzy sets forms the methodological contribution of this work. Findings show that barriers associated with regulations restricting the collection of wastes, poor demand or acceptance for environmentally superior technologies, lack of expertise, technology, and information, operational risk, immature recycling technologies, and information sharing and communication were considered critical in managing circular public sector supply chains. The analysis also revealed that ripple effect modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence are the priority digital technologies. These digital technologies offer efficiency and flexibility to decision-makers in analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios before the deployment of any circularity initiative, providing crucial information in its design and implementation. This paper outlines several managerial insights and offers possible agenda for future research.</jats:p>"

In this study, a new classification method (trend, mean and change-rate catastrophe) was proposed and applied to the Qinglong River watershed, Northern China. Two groups of algorithms were compared to obtain the optimal algorithm: the Cumulative-anomaly method and the Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQ-MK) algorithm, the Pettitt algorithm and the Bernaola-Galvan heuristic segmentation (B-G) algorithm. Its parameters were optimized and its robustness was tested. Results revealed that: (1) The SQ-MK algorithm was suitable for trend catastrophe and sensitive to the length of the time series. The most significant point of trend catastrophe in the Qinglong River watershed was in 2012. (2) The sensitivity of parameter P0 (Range value (R) = 4.333) in the B-G algorithm was greater than that of parameter l0 (R = 2.889). (3) The B-G algorithm was suitable for identifying mean catastrophes and insensitive to the length of the time series. In the Qinglong River watershed, mean catastrophe points were identified in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2018. (4) There was no change-rate catastrophe point in the Qinglong River watershed. Trend catastrophe and mean catastrophe do not necessarily lead to change-rate catastrophe.</jats:p>",

Qualitatively, the community included the key stakeholders of the supply chain of the steel industry and the sample consisted of 10 specific representatives who were selected purposefully. Barriers were extracted through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and analysed by thematic analysis method. In the quantitative part, the statistical population included supply chain experts and the sample included 10 experts who are proficient in the subject and modelling management concepts, who were selected as the target sample. The research tool in the quantitative part was the interpretive structural equation questionnaire. 17 barriers to the circular supply chain acceptance from the perspective of the key stakeholders were extracted. Using MICMAC analysis, the type of variables was determined. The variables were divided into independent and linked groups and were plotted at three levels in an interactive network.

We use data from 758 managers from 185 firms in Turkey, an emerging economy context. We find that organizational strategic agility, enabled by organic organizational structures and regional innovation initiatives, leads to more collaborative environmental innovation with supply partners and higher environmental sustainability performance. Our study contributes to the literature on grand challenges, organizational strategic agility, and innovation management by showing how for‐profit firms can leverage their strategic agility to address the grand challenge of environmental sustainability in supply chains.

It has been determined that vocational and technical education institutions in the western region of Ukraine (Ternopil, Volyn, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and Chernivtsi regions) are distinguished by a wide range of professions, including construction and welding, which are typical for any locality. A total of 345 vocational and technical education institutions are registered in the region. It has been established that the training of qualified construction workers and welders is carried out in 139 vocational (and technical) colleges (40,3 %) in the western region of Ukraine, where builders are trained in 110 (31,9 %) institutions and welders in 89 (25,8 %). In 73 institutions (21,2 %), both builders and welders are trained simultaneously. In terms of the number of vocational (and technical) colleges, Ternopil region ranks 4th having 16 institutions for training builders and welders (42,1 % of the number of registered ones). The number of future construction workers and welders in the region has been determined. It varies from 4,684 students in the Lviv region to 854 in the Chernivtsi region. In general, the region shows an almost equal distribution of learners in the professions of a builder (8114 individuals) and welder (8491 individuals). 1,747 students are studying in Ternopil region institutions; the total number of the specified qualifications’ students is 16,405. In the educational institutions of Ternopil region, there are 1747 future construction workers and welders, and in the educational institutions of Ternopil city, there are 599 students.

It is stated that the authors previously formulated and solved the problem of creating a decision support system, which allows to calculate the optimal route of movement of a water tank with data on the number of residents in each district and the distances between districts. Using a number of parameters (average service time, tank volume, average percentage of the population going out for water, restrictions on the volume of water dispensed, etc.), the system allows you to make a schedule (schedule) of the movement of the tank, as well as give recommendations on increasing the number of these tanks and their optimal distribution by districts, to determine the places of their best location in each district for the maximum satisfaction of all its residents. Currently, a mathematical model has been developed for calculating a special coefficient that allows to assess the level of dissatisfaction of residents' needs in the provision of drinking water. The proposed coefficient contains three components, namely, the ratio of the volume of the recommended dispensing of the maximum possible number of liters per person to the calculated one; assignment of real \"time on the road\" to optimally calculated; the average relative distance from the calculated center of the district. The created model is added as an additional module to the existing decision-making support system, examples of the system's operation during route calculation and the position of tanks supplying the city of Toretsk, Donetsk region are given. The examples show that the reason for the biggest dissatisfaction is the insufficient number of cars, in second place is their not very good location; available time has almost no effect on the result. Increasing the number of machines to two reduces the first component of the coefficient to unity. The results indicate the possibility of reducing the indicator from 1.305 to 1.087.</jats:p>"

Recent stratigraphic forward modelling using SedsimX from StrataMod Pty Limited of the Oligocene to Miocene Huesca distributive fluvial system in northern Spain was used as a base‐case for this sensitivity analysis. Based on literature research and initial modelling, a sediment supply sensitivity range of 0.22 to 21.85 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/kyr and lake‐level sensitivity range of −1000 to 1000 mm/kyr were used. Results show that the stratigraphic architecture of the modelled distributive fluvial system is more sensitive to changes in sediment supply than to changes in lake level. While an increase in the rate of sediment supply results in an increase in preserved average grain size, aggradation rates and sandbody connectivity at the same distance from the apex, the average grain size, aggradation rate and sandbody connectivity all decrease with increasing distance from fan apex. The main difference in the stratigraphic architecture can be found in the proximal zones. Only oversupplied models, with much higher sediment supply than the base‐case, deposited fully amalgamated channelized deposits with laterally continuous, tabular beds with occasional scoured surfaces. Models with base‐case sediment supply contain channelized sandy deposits within a fine‐grained floodplain environment. Models with sediment supply much lower than the base‐case had no deposition in the proximal zone. Lake‐level rise leads to reduced distal erosion of sediments, concentration of silts close to the lake shore, and higher aggradation rates and thicker sandbodies in the proximal zone. The sensitivity analysis highlights that the parameters governing the formation of distributive fluvial systems have different weightings but are ultimately all interconnected and interdependent. This quantitative framework can be used as a predictive tool for subsurface exploration in distributive fluvial systems.</jats:p>",

The non‐linear load produces harmonic current while it seriously threatens the normal and safe operation environment of other system equipment. It can be difficult to design shunt active power filter (APF) to eliminate the harmonic effect while achieving stability and reliability. This paper designs a hybrid optimization shunt active power filter, which adopts enhanced echo state network (ESN) to predict harmonics and reduce the delay problem in traditional control. The prediction performance of enhanced ESN is verified by simulation. The modelling and simulation of the hybrid optimization shunt APF are completed in Simulink, and the parameters of APF are reset according to the radar power supply system. Furthermore, a prototype based on DSP TMS320F28335 was developed to test whether the theory is feasible and accurate. The experimental results demonstrate that the APF with harmonic prediction has improved steady‐state response performance and rapid dynamic response performance.</jats:p>",

Decision‐makers should analyse the social, environmental, and economic constraints in a multi‐dimensional business context. We analyse these issues by considering the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concerns. A scorecard‐based mathematical model, consisting of mixed‐integer linear programming, is developed to assist fast‐fashion decision‐makers in supply chain policy formulation. The model is validated through a practical case study using IBM CPLEX Optimizer. The results indicate that involving the social aspect can increase the profit compared to considering only the economic impact, under high environmental costs with low return on investment. Furthermore, the mathematical model is able for the case study to optimise the distribution network of the entire multi‐tier supply chain, considering CSR concerns, in less than 5 s. This research has implications for the advancement of multi‐tier supply chain optimisation and provides a basis for future distribution decisions for firm stakeholders.</jats:p>",

It aims to analyze and link the changes in the land classes with the water resources supply demand as the groundwater is unable to meet the inhabitants demand, necessitating land management practices. The method includes deriving land use/cover maps using the supervised classification, identifying basin governorates, cities and villages, calculating the basin governorates’ inhabitants, water demand, supply of internal wells, water loss, and actual water consumption. The results showed an increase in the urban area by 3.01%, while forests, rain-fed vegetables and crops declined by 1.57% and 1.09%, respectively. Urbanization appears mainly at the expense of rangelands, an important change affecting water supply from internal wells due to increased pumping to balance population demand. Although it is decreasing per capita, the water demand is high. Changing land use practices, securing inter-basin water resources, and calculating water losses is a challenge of great importance that can manage water shortages and increase actual consumption. This research is important in order to understand the supply demand situation and to aid a wide range of users, water-managers, land-planners and decision-makers.</jats:p>"

The results indicated that RW irrigation is beneficial for improving crop yields, WUE, and IWUE (16.8, 23.8, and 18.7%, respectively). However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the aqueous, edaphic, and management factors of the studies evaluated. Greater responses were found in practices using RW with a pH &amp;lt; 7 or a nitrogen content &amp;lt;100 mg/L. The soils with a pH ≥ 7, electrical conductivity between 2 and 4 dS/m, bulk density &amp;lt;1.35 g/cm3, and/or initial nitrogen content between 200 and 2,000 mg/kg produced the highest effect size. Furthermore, using a surface drip irrigation system, with a nitrogen fertilizer rate &amp;lt;1,000 kg/ha and irrigation level at 100% crop evapotranspiration are effective ways to use RW. Our findings highlight the potential of RW irrigation to improve crop yield, WUE, and IWUE and identify the conditions under which these results can be achieved.

However, integrating these choices in a competitive environment has received scant attention for deteriorating inventory systems from academics despite being crucial to practitioners. From this perspective, our research focuses on designing a supply chain model with inventory coordination to reflect time systems with improved accuracy and optimal control systems. In this research, we develop a two-layer supply chain model consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer incorporating the inventory classification of the retailer. Price-sensitive market demand and two-parameter time-varying Weibull distribution deterioration have been assumed to develop the mathematical model. First, a collective decision on price and inventory control of a deteriorating product has been evaluated in a duopoly environment. Secondly, to explore the decentralized scenario, we have proposed the NSGA-II algorithm to solve the bi-objective programming problem of the two-layer supply chain. The paper aims to explore product collaborative pricing policies and the inventory decision of the deteriorating item in two-layer supply chain coordination. Finally, numerical research is conducted to execute the centralized supply chain and NSGA-II application in a decentralized supply chain. The research findings can provide valuable insights for members of the two-layer supply chain to make optimal product pricing and inventory scheduling decisions.</jats:p>",

The study found that the carbon emission reduction level of multi-channel centralized decision-making is better than that of decentralized decision-making under the same carbon emission cost, and centralized decision-making can improve the carbon emission reduction level. Manufacturers open a direct channel to help reduce carbon emissions and need to consider the cost of emission reduction in their channel decisions. Consumer loyalty also directly impacts channel decisions. Only when carbon emission costs and consumer loyalty are within a reasonable range can new direct sales channels be opened to bring in new profits. Simultaneously, the total profit of the supply chain is greater than that of decentralized decision-making, but the double marginal utility of both parties decreases with the increase in carbon emission costs.</jats:p>"

In this study, sensitivity functions of different nodes were obtained according to the influence of the leakage of each node on the water distribution network. Combined with the water pressure correlation and water pressure sensitivity between nodes, the monitoring range of monitoring points and the water demand of covering nodes of monitoring points were taken as objective functions to build an optimal layout model. Taking a pipeline network in Qingdao as an example, the model was solved by using multi-objective White Whale Optimization and NSGA-II.

The current state of affairs has compelled practitioners and academics to investigate the role of sustainable technologies in greening the operations of businesses. Previous studies have attempted to examine the number of operational aspects for their role in making firms sustainable, yet the utility of blockchain technologies is in its infancy. The role of BT in enhancing integration across supply chains has been in the limelight in the recent past. At the same time, its ability to cause sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) in sync with the circular economy (CE) and supply chain integration (SCI) has largely remained unexplored. Therefore, this study intends to examine the association between blockchain technologies (BTs) and SSCPs through integration to fill the empirical gaps. The study was pursued to investigate the moderating role of the CE on the relationship between multiple extents of SCI and SSCP. Based on dynamic capability theory (DCT), the study considered BT a dynamic resource. BTs are used to integrate and reenergize the relationships with upstream and downstream channel members in pursuit of sustainable performance outcomes. The study opted for a cross-sectional design, where data was collected through convenience sampling from 475 managers from SMEs operating across Pakistan. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data and to generate the required empirical outcomes. Study results favored the significant association between BT and SSCP, followed by a significant mediating role of SCI dimensions and moderating role of the CE. The study's findings propagate the utility of BTs adoption for SMEs, which holds the potential for firms to achieve system-wide integration to achieve sustainable outcomes. The given empirical investigation holds valuable insights for practitioners and scholars intending to pursue research on the subject matter. </jats:p>",

Accordingly, this paper proposes a three-echelon supply chain in which demands are uncertain. The proposed supply chain has three participants, including supplier, manufacturer, and retailer, while three decentralized, centralized, and coordination models have been formulated to maximize participants’ profits. In the decentralized model, both the manufacturer and retailer independently determine the level of investment and order quantity regarding scenario-based demands. The centralized model determines the optimal order quantity and investment amounts for the whole network. However, these amounts may be different from optimal values for all participants. As such, using game theory, a bilevel adjustable contract based on wholesale price has been proposed as an incentive for players to participate in the coordination plan. Results show that the coordination model outperforms others by reducing the network’s costs and increasing profits simultaneously.</jats:p>",

This study investigated upper limits of dietary free AA inclusions without undesirable effects including the dependence on asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) supply. Ten broilers were allocated to sixty-three metabolism units each and offered nine experimental diets from day (d) 7–21 (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 7). One diet (167 g CP/kg) contained 80 g soya protein isolate (SPI)/kg. In the other diets, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the digestible AA from SPI were substituted with free AA. Digestible Asn+aspartic acid (Asp) and Gln+glutamic acid (Glu) were substituted with Asp/Glu or 50/50 mixes of Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln, respectively. Total excreta were collected from d 11–14 and from d 18–21. Growth and nitrogen accretion were unaffected by 25 and 50 % substitution without and with free Asn/Gln, respectively, but decreased at higher substitution (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ 0·024). Circulating concentrations of Asp, Glu and Gln were unaffected by treatment, while Asn decreased at substitution higher than 50 % when Asn/Gln were not provided (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ 0·005). Blood gas analysis on d 21 indicated a compensated metabolic acidosis at substitution higher than 50 and 75 % without and with free Asn/Gln, respectively (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ 0·017).

This study investigated various feedstock supply chains for a centralized biorefinery based on different objective functions and how the biorefinery responds to supply chain volatility. For the analysis, a hypothetical centralized biorefinery was supplied by switchgrass grown on marginal lands in Michigan. From an economic standpoint, the minimum biofuel selling price is an important metric of the objective function, and the greenhouse gas mitigation potential is a similarly important metric for global warming impact. A trade‐off therefore exists between the economic and environmental performance of biofuels under this system configuration. However, when a carbon tax credit is applied to soil organic carbon sequestration in switchgrass production, the metric of the objective function may not be the key factor in establishing a supply chain as long as it is associated with biorefinery capacity as well as economic or environmental values. Year‐to‐year fluctuations in cellulosic biomass yield (supply chain volatility) might also prevent the biorefinery from operating at full capacity. Cellulosic biomass pellets can serve as an auxiliary feedstock for the centralized cellulosic biorefinery system to minimize the impacts of supply chain volatility.</jats:p>",

Using a full factorial design, we ran both choice and no-choice experiments to measure preference and performance. We confirmed locust preference for plants with a lower protein-carbohydrate ratio (unfertilized plants). Unlike previous studies with mature wild grass species, we found that intact plants supported better performance than dried and ground plants, suggesting that cell wall removal may only improve performance for tougher or more carbohydrate-rich plants.

The main objectives of the present work are to develop a novel soft computing framework including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Wavelet-GEP (WGEP) for the temporal and spatial estimation of groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) in the East Azerbaijan province, Iran over 2001–2020. The results demonstrate the importance of wavelet transform application; the performance percentage enhancement of the WANFIS and WGEP models compared to the ANFIS and GEP, using the RMSE criterion, ranged from 15.48 to 51.09% and from 5.06 to 86.95%, respectively. All the developed models showed the WGEP superior compared to others. The impact of land use characteristics, climatic conditions, and geological features on groundwater quality showed that there is a direct relationship between the extent of agricultural land, semi-arid climate conditions and groundwater EC amounts. The results demonstrated that the values of EC increase from east to west, indicating the direct exchange of surface and groundwater in the study area. Moreover, groundwater quality changes significantly across the width of the fault, with groundwater EC in the northern part of the fault higher than that in the southern part.</jats:p>",

Using a branded food composition database, products in cheese, yogurt, milk, and meat categories were examined (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 3231). Products were categorized as plant‐based analogs versus animal‐derived products using the ingredient list. Products were examined for their nutrient content, overall nutritional quality using the Food Standards Australia New Zealand nutrient profiling model, price, and processing levels using the NOVA classification. All plant‐based analogs had lower protein and higher total carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber content compared to their respective animal‐derived products. Compared to their respective animal‐derived products, plant‐based milk and meat analogs had lower energy, total fat, and saturated fat content; plant‐based yogurt and meat analogs had lower sodium content; and all plant‐based dairy analogs had lower calcium content. Plant‐based cheese and yogurt analogs were more expensive than animal‐based products; however, there was no significant difference among milk and meat products. There was no association between processing levels and overall nutritional quality among dairy and meat products. Plant‐based analogs may be part of a healthy and affordable diet to reduce the intakes of nutrients of concern; however, additional compositional guidelines and/or labeling may be needed to highlight the differences in the levels of nutrients to encourage.</jats:p>",

Based on the research results, it can be concluded that: 1) Based on the short-term VECM test, the estimated inflation variable has a positive but insignificant effect. Then, the long-term estimation results show that the inflation variable has a negative but insignificant effect on the IHSG variable. 2) The short-term estimation results for the BI Rate variable have a negative but insignificant effect on the IHSG. Then, the long-term estimation results show that the BI Rate variable has a negative but insignificant effect on the IHSG variable. 3) The Money Supply variable has a significant negative effect on the IHSG in the short term. The long-term estimation results show that the Jumlah Uang Beredar variable has a significant negative effect on the IHSG. 4) The short-term estimation results for the nilai tukar variable have a positive but insignificant effect on the IHSG. Then, the long-term estimation results show that the nilai tukar variable has a positive and significant effect on the IHSG. 5) Based on the IRF test to determine shocks on each variable, the BI Rate variable shows a tendency for thin shocks above the horizontal line, indicating that the BI Rate variable has a permanent positive impact.</jats:p>"

Recently, the resurgence of COVID-19 has highlighted the limitations of the world-health surveillance measures and caused unprecedented effects on the food supply chain and the food industry. Amid this recent crisis, aroused population and scientific concerns and the demand for food safety and quality control improvement trough-out the food supply chain. To solve this constraint, it is primordial to understand food supply chain contamination stem and develop new, more sensitive, specific effective, and efficient point-of-care detection methods to segregate food items at an early pathogen contamination stage. 3D printing technology positioned itself as the solution because it enables the synergistic action of new molecular detection methods combined with the new 3D printing techniques for the production of high end-point biosensors capable of direct testing of food along the production line and the food supply chain. Because 3D printed biosensors are user and eco-friendly, convenient, fast, and take away the laboratory analysis constraints, 3D printed molecular biosensor devices are the new trend to enhance the food safety screening performances and guarantee food quality. We aimed to present how impactful COVID-19 was in the food industry and food supply chain across the globe and the adaptive measures that have been put in place to ensure consumer were provided with safe food with the usage of biosensors and 3D printed technology.</jats:p>",

Here, we use 12 state-of-the-art climate models to assess climate change impacts on SDM, quantified by the fraction of demand met by local wind or solar supply. For energy systems with varying dependence on wind or solar supply, up to 32% or 44% of non-Antarctic land areas, respectively, are projected to experience robust SDM reductions by the end of this century under an intermediate emission scenario. Smaller and more variable supply reduces SDM at northern middle-to-high latitudes, whereas reduced heating demand alleviates or reverses SDM reductions remarkably. By contrast, despite supply increases at low latitudes, raised cooling demand reduces SDM substantially. Changes in climate extremes and climate mean make size-comparable contributions. Our results provide early warnings for energy sectors in climate change adaptation.</jats:p>"

Based on in-depth interviews, field observations, and literature reviews, it is concluded that supply chain resilience has a positive influence on company performance and competitive advantage for Shopee e-commerce sellers. Sellers with resilient supply chains are able to increase sales, customer satisfaction, and business growth, as well as maintain competitive advantage through reliable service, faster delivery times, and consistent product availability. Key factors contributing to supply chain resilience in the context of e-commerce include strong collaboration and communication with suppliers and business partners, adoption of digital technology in supply chain management, and flexibility and agility in responding to demand fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. These findings confirm the importance of supply chain resilience for e-commerce sellers in facing challenges such as demand fluctuations, logistics issues, and intense competition. Sellers with strong supply chain resilience can continue to operate and expand their businesses despite disruptions. This study provides new insights into how e-commerce sellers in Indonesia implement strategies to improve their supply chain resilience, as well as its impact on company performance and competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Using data for apple growers in Shaanxi Province, China, we used ordinary least squares (OLS), stochastic frontier production function (SFA), and truncated regression to investigate how rural aging affects apple production under different landform conditions. We provided evidence that (i) aging leads apple growers to use hired labor to replace family labor in the flatlands, but not in mountainous and hilly areas, due to landform constraints on the factor substitution; (ii) aging has no significant impact on mechanical inputs in either the plains or the mountains, indicating that machinery cannot effectively replace the labor force; (iii) limited by a shortage of labor quantity and quality, apple growers respond to aging by reducing agricultural inputs in mountainous and hilly areas; (iv) changes in input structure cause aging to have little influence on yield and technical efficiency in flatlands, while aging significantly reduces yield in mountainous and hilly areas; (v) there is a nonlinear relationship between aging and technical efficiency and yield; and (vi) because the overall mechanization level of China’s apple industry is low, mechanical substitution for labor is not common in apple production.</jats:p>"

The resulting closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) have been considerably studied under different aspects. However, there is a lack of research investigating electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) network design under uncertainty. This paper focuses on the issues of quantitative modelling for the network design of a CLSC of used EVBs consisting of power battery manufacturers, EV retailers, collection centers, recycling centers, echelon utilization centers and disposal centers, where power battery manufacturers can remanufacture used EVB products. We investigate a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) model to design the network and the model is solved using the Benders Decomposition (BD) method to derive optimal solutions. Numerical experiments show that the SMIP model can effectively hedge against high uncertainty.</jats:p>",

The findings indicate that the adoption of SCSC drivers has a significant influence on OSS during the construction phase, ranging from moderate to high.

      "abstract": "<p>Safely managed drinking water is critical to prevent diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera, but evidence on the effectiveness of piped water supply in reducing these diseases in low-income and complex emergency settings remains scarce. We conducted a trial of water supply infrastructure improvements in Uvira (DRC). Our primary objective was to estimate the relationship between a composite index of water service quality and the monthly number of suspected cholera cases admitted to treatment facilities and, as a secondary analysis, the number of cases confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests. Other exposures included the quantity of supplied water and service continuity. We used Poisson generalised linear models with generalised estimating equations to estimate incidence rate ratios.  Associations between suspected cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0·86, 95% CI 0·73-1·01), quantity (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·62-1·02) and continuity (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·77-0·86) were estimated. The magnitudes of the associations were similar between confirmed cholera incidence and water service quality (RR 0·84, 95% CI 0·73-0·97), quantity (RR 0·76, 95% CI 0·61-0·94) and continuity (RR 0·75, 95% CI 0·69-0·81). These results suggest that an additional 5 L/user/day or 1.2 hour per day of water production could reduce confirmed cholera by 24% (95% CI 6-39%) and 25% (95% CI 19-31%), respectively. Ensuring a sufficient and continuous piped water supply may substantially reduce the burden of endemic cholera and diarrhoeal diseases but evaluating this rigorously is challenging. Pragmatic strategies are needed for public health research on complex interventions in protracted emergency settings.</p>"

However, kale production systems are also affected by various pests and diseases, especially plant pathogenic bacteria, such as Pectobacterium carotovorum. The purpose of this research was to investigate the biocontrol activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SP007s and develop a formulation that provides stability, long shelf life, and disease control, as well as promoting growth in kale; we expect this formulation to have further commercial applications in the cultivation of kale. The results indicated that a unique mixture of paper sludge, sugar sludge, and glycerol at 40% relative humidity promoted SP007 survival for 6 months at room temperature (30 °C) with measures of 5.92 × 106 CFU/g. This treatment maintained the control efficacy of P. carotovorum in infected soil within 28 days of soil drenching. We evaluated the SP007s formula for controlling soft rot disease in greenhouse conditions, and our results revealed that it can reduce the disease in kale by 65.2% and promotes growth in terms of canopy width, shoot height, number of leaves per plant, fresh weight, and dry weight, which were superior to the control. In addition, the formula can induce the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid and phenolic compounds, as well as a systemic acquired resistance pathway in the plant defense system. Therefore, the formula of SP007s can be a promising novel biocontrol formula for use in kale production, as it promotes plant growth and acts against P. carotovorum causal soft rot disease.</jats:p>"

A potential consideration in manufacturing ramie-based products is the need for an integrated set of processes to operate efficiently along the supply chain. A strategy in maintaining the supply chain in manufacturing ramie fiber is based on standardization of the upstream production process starting from the ramie cultivation system and processing raw fiber resulting from the decortication process. Raw fiber is processed by standardized procedures, either chemical degumming or biodegumming, using enzymatic activity produced from microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The purpose of this research is to provide a standardized production line for the manufacture of ramie raw fiber. The study reports on a number of issues, including: supply of ramie fiber, degumming process include biological dan chemical degumming methods which has been used as a production process for small-scale industrial in Indonesia. The recommendation must be tested with data from manufacturing companies in the ramie industry to develop it as a standardized ramie industrial product model in Indonesia.</jats:p>",

This study aims to prevent secondary pipe bursts by addressing the propagation of water hammer waves triggered by primary pipe bursts. Based on an analysis of pipe burst incidents and considering different pipe laying methods, air valve arrangement criteria are developed to mitigate the risk of secondary bursts in LGWSS pipelines. The principal results include a reasonable mathematical analysis model for understanding pipe bursts and the determination of air valve arrangement criteria which considers potentially dangerous pressure variations resulting from primary pipe bursts. This model aims to mitigate the adverse effects of pipe bursts and minimize the likelihood of secondary bursts. Implementing the proposed criteria has important engineering applications, thus improving the reasonable and effective placement of air valves to prevent secondary pipe bursts in LGWSSs. The conclusion involves optimizing the placement of air valves to enhance the flexibility and reliability of LGWSSs. By implementing the proposed air valve arrangement criteria, water supply systems can minimize the potential damage caused by pipe bursts and improve overall operational efficiency.</jats:p>",

A systematic literature review has been developed to locate, select and evaluate relevant contributions made to CE interrelationships with I4.0 technologies. Studies have been analysed and classified according to the specific I4.0 technology and CE principle addressed (10Rs). The articles have been clustered into three main groups: (i) useful application of materials, (ii) extending the lifespan of products and their parts and (iii) smarter product use and manufacture. A mind map of the investigated articles has been used to establish the interrelationships between individual technologies and each CE principle at the supply chain level. Based on this classification, a focus group interview (FGI) was held with experts to dig deeper into the interrelationships between I4.0 technologies and CE principles. The FGI results have identified how each as yet unexplored I4.0 technology could be linked to each CE principle. A Fuzzy Delphi (FD) study was also applied to identify the most relevant I4.0 technologies for improving CE principles and closing gaps in the literature regarding the 10R CE principles. In addition, guidelines have been established to assist with practical applications and generate a research agenda on the interrelationships between I4.0 technologies and CE principles at the supply chain level. Implications for theory include the extension of view from the research gaps between I4.0 technologies and the 10Rs identified in the literature; also, an FGI and FD were performed based on the detected research gaps to identify future lines of research for academics and offer useful guidance to directors and managers on I4.0 technology interrelationships for improving at least one of the 10R CE principles. The contribution to practice aims to enable managers to easily identify which technology from the I4.0 domain should be used to advance any given CE principle. Lastly, we provide useful guidance on the application of as‐yet‐unused technologies to improve CE principles.</jats:p>",

The implication of sophisticated technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the blockchain improves the optimization and evaluation of ESG performance. An IIoT-Blockchain-based Supply Chain Economy Evaluation (IB-SCEE) model is introduced to identify and reduce functional growth risk factors. The proposed model uses green blockchain technology to identify distinct transactions’ economic demands and supply distribution. The flaws and demands in the circular economy process are validated using the IIoT forecast systems relying on ESG convenience. The minimal and maximum risks are identified based on economic and distribution outcomes. The present investigation highlights the significance of ongoing ESG-conceptualized research into blockchain-based supply chain economics. Companies who recognize the blockchain’s potential can improve corporate governance, environmental impact, and social good by increasing transparency, traceability, and accountability. A more sustainable and responsible future for global supply chains can be shaped through further research and development in this field, which will make a substantial contribution to the scientific world. This information is individually held in the green blockchain for individual risk factor analysis. The proposed model improves the recommendation and evaluation rate and reduces the risk factors with controlled evaluation time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The presented article is actualized by the current state of the logistics sphere of activity, because logistics activities occupy a significant share of the GNP of countries, and this share is steadily growing. Transformational processes in supply chains in the context of most spheres of the national economy, both regional and federal scales, dictate the need to strengthen the role of strategic logistics management in order to ensure sustainable development of the economy, in general. The direct success of business in the regions largely depends on ensuring effective integration between business units. Through effective and efficient logistics activities it is possible to achieve higher customer value, creating both a value advantage and a productivity advantage, and through the work done in this area, businesses can take another step forward compared to their competitors in the sectors in which they do business. This article considers the theoretical aspects of strategic logistics and supply chain management in the current economic environment. The paper reflects some aspects of the effectiveness of the use of information technology in logistics, by the example of using RFID-identification technology. The authors conclude by applying different analysis methodologies that supply chain management acts as a system of business process management tools from raw material suppliers to end users, in which products, services and information are provided, increasing the added value for customers and other partners.

It is found that the manufacturer's collection responsibility strategy creates the (implicit) incentive for the e‐tailer to offer complimentary return‐freight insurance. A high level of optimism and return handling costs expand the equilibrium range over which the manufacturer collects returns, and the e‐tailer offers complimentary return‐freight insurance. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that unilateral optimism does not always lead to a win‐win situation, but it can still result in suboptimal results on the other side. Finally, despite possibly high shipping costs, the e‐tailer's refusal to offer complimentary return‐freight insurance still benefits consumers, implying that managers with high optimism level benefit consumers.</jats:p>",

We established the cooling capacity supply–demand evaluation systems of UBGLs by using multi-source data and a suitable landscape mesh size. Furthermore, we utilized the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model and the linear regression equation method to explore the spatial distribution of and variation in UBGLs’ cooling efficiency. The results showed the following: (1) according to the UBGL/SUHI landscape pattern index and the Pearson correlation coefficient of the land surface temperature (LST), the optimal mesh size was found to be 1200 m. (2) According to the unitary linear regression calculation, the matching of the cooling capacity supply and demand in the context of Qunli New Town showed obvious polarization; furthermore, Hanan new town and old town are more balanced than Qunli new town. (3) According to the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of CCD, the proportion of moderate coordination- advancing cooling efficiency is the highest, reaching 35.3%. Second are moderate imbalance–hysteretic cooling efficiency (18.4%) and moderate imbalance–systematic balanced development (13.7%), with the old city highly coordinated area as the center and the coupling coordination type (gradually outward) turning into a state of serious imbalance, and then back into a state of high coordination.

However, the randomness of the supply side and load side of the integrated energy system brings further challenges to system planning and scheduling. Therefore, the optimal scheduling method of an integrated energy system considering the uncertainty of supply and demand in the market environment is studied in this paper. Firstly, the uncertainty models of the supply side and load side of the integrated energy system are established. Then, the optimal scheduling model based on robust chance constraint is established. The reserve capacity constraint is set as a chance constraint with a certain confidence level to maximize the system profit in the power market. Finally, simulations show that the proposed method not only guarantees the robustness of the system but also improves the economy of the system. The method provides ideas for exploring the development mechanism and strategy of integrated energy systems in the electricity market environment.</jats:p>"

This study identified two genes in the phosphate transporter 2 (PHT2) family of soybean by bioinformatics. The expression patterns of two genes by qRT-PCR at leaves and all were induced by low-phosphate stress. After low-phosphate stress, GmPHT2;2 expression was significantly higher than GmPHT2;1, and the same trend was observed throughout the reproductive period. The result of heterologous expression of GmPHT2 in Arabidopsis knockout mutants of atpht2;1 shows that chloroplasts and whole-plant phosphorus content were significantly higher in plants complementation of GmPHT2;2 than in plants complementation of GmPHT2;1. This suggests that GmPHT2;2 may play a more important role in plant phosphorus metabolic homeostasis during low-phosphate stress than GmPHT2;1. In the yeast backfill assay, both genes were able to backfill the ability of the defective yeast to utilize phosphorus. GmPHT2 expression was up-regulated by a low-temperature treatment at 4 °C, implying that GmPHT2;1 may play a role in soybean response to low-temperature stress, in addition to being involved in phosphorus transport processes. GmPHT2;1 and GmPHT2;2 exhibit a cyclic pattern of circadian variation in response to light, with the same pattern of gene expression changes under red, blue, and white light conditions. GmPHT2 protein was found in the chloroplast, according to subcellular localization analysis. We conclude that GmPHT2 is a typical phosphate transporter gene that can improve plant acquisition efficiency.</jats:p>"

The utilization of biomass energy not only can promote low-carbon transformation to establish a competitive advantage through value creation under the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality but is also an important force in solving environmental problems. Government subsidy policies play an important role in promoting the development of biomass energy utilization. Taking straw as an example, this paper constructs a straw recycling supply chain system dynamics model consisting of farmers, acquisition stations, power plants, and pyrolysis plants based on a real-world case. Two types of straw processing, namely power generation and pyrolysis, are considered in the model. This paper analyzes the economic and environmental impacts of three subsidy policies, namely the unified rate policy, the linear growth policy, and a two-step policy, by comparing the profit, carbon, and pollution emission reduction benefits of the supply chain under different subsidy scenarios. The result shows that, among the three subsidy policies, the unified rate policy shows the best-promoting effect. The research results and policy implications in this paper could be a reference for governments trying to formulate subsidy policies for developing biomass energy utilization.</jats:p>"

The prepared magnetite nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric/differential thermogravimetric (TG/DTG) analysis. The water contact angles (θW) of Fe3O4@ODPA nanoparticles were more than 120°, indicating hydrophobic nature, and the diameter of the obtained spherical-shaped magnetite nanoparticles was 12–15 nm. The ODPA coating amount (AO) (coating weight per gram Fe3O4) and specific surface area (SO) of Fe3O4@ODPA were 0.124–0.144 g·g−1 and 78.65–91.01 m2·g−1, respectively. To evaluate the demulsification ability, stability, and reusability, the magnetite nanoparticles were used to demulsify an n-hexane-in-water nanoemulsion. The effects of the magnetite nanoparticle dosage (CS), pH value of nanoemulsion, and NaCl or CaCl2 electrolytes on the demulsification efficiency (RO) were investigated. The RO of Fe3O4@ODPA samples was found to be higher than that of bare Fe3O4 samples (S0, ST, and SN) under all CS values. With the increase in CS, the RO of Fe3O4@ODPA samples initially increased and then approached equilibrium value at Cs = 80.0 g·L−1. A maximum RO of ~93% was achieved at CS = 100.0 g·L−1 for the Fe3O4@ODPA sample S2. The pH and two electrolytes had a minor effect on RO. The Fe3O4@ODPA nanoparticles maintained high RO even after being reused for demulsification 11 times. This indicates that the hydrophobic Fe3O4@ODPA samples can be used as an effective magnetite demulsifer for oil-in-water nanoemulsions.</jats:p>"

To solve this problem, a voltage balancing control based on third harmonic injection of co‐phase power supply system using direct AC/AC FB‐MMC is proposed. With the third harmonic injection, voltage balancing between arms is ensured and the capacity of FB‐MMC is enhanced. The third harmonic voltage is directly obtained from existing signals and the third harmonic current reference is produced by simple proportional‐integral (PI) controller. The effect of the third harmonic currents under different voltage ratios and phase difference is quantitatively analyzed, optimized range of voltage ratio and phase difference are obtained to minimize arm currents increment and reduce overrating of converter currents. In addition, a comparison between the proposed and the conventional control scheme is studied, showing the superior of proposed method in cost and performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations and experiments.</jats:p>",

We derive the conditions whereby the manufacturer can benefit from the emergency production and emergency orders and the social planner is willing to place the emergency orders and upgrade the optimal decisions with Pareto improvement. Besides, we find that, (1) the unit cost for emergency order is either too high or low, which might be worse off if the emergency order opportunity is provided to social planner; (2) even if the centralized case is better than the decentralized case in terms of the total cost, the social planner prefers decentralized case to centralized case. Finally, we use the real data to prove the theoretical analysis and show that the emergency supply mechanism can almost meet domestic demand.

Leveraging a quantitative and a qualitative method based on a grounded theory approach, we aim to investigate the state of ESG maturity of pharmaceutical corporations in Germany and develop a perspective on the effects of ESG measure implementation on supply chain security. We find publicly traded and larger companies having higher ESG target‐setting maturity than privately‐owned or smaller companies and that company priorities, costs, and regulatory processes limt ESG progress overall.

Second, the members tended to be risk averse with no time pressure, and the degree of risk aversion was weakened with time pressure, which had the greatest effect in the natural disaster event. Third, even though the change in risk preference had a consistency regarding the four types of sub-events of supply chain emergencies, it was inconsistent regarding the conventional risks and emergencies. With the evolution trend of risk preference demonstrated and the relationship between preference and time pressure revealed, this study may provide a decision-making reference for the formulation of a supply chain emergency coordination scheme.</jats:p>"

In the present study, the methanolic extract of Elaeagnus angustifolia tree bark was used for the synthesis of ZnFe2O4@TiO2 nanocomposite and then properties and structural elements and diagnostic features of nanoparticles were analyzed. According to the results, the ZnFe2O4@TiO2 nanocomposites have an average crystalline size of ∼65–250 nm. Also, the effects of pH (3–11), nanoparticle dose (0.005–0.1 g/L), and humic acid concentration (2–15 mg/L) were examined up to 120 min of time. From the results, the highest removal percentages achieved about 100% at optimal conditions (pH = 3, nanocomposite dose = 0.05 g/L and humic acid initial concentration = 2 mg/L). The results of this research showed that the efficiency of nanocomposite at the highest concentration of humic acid that was investigated in this research (15 mg/L) was about 95.67%. Therefore, it can be concluded that this nanocomposite, while being cost-effective and environmentally friendly, is also very effective in removing humic acid from an aqueous solution.</jats:p>",

Demand charges are the charges incurred by industrial facilities as a result of power usage. Thermal energy storage has advanced significantly with lots of new applications, garnering the interest of many industrial facilities. These applications could be used to shave the industrial facilities’ peak electric demand and reduce their demand charges. This paper aims to demonstrate the efficacy of thermal energy storage in reducing demand charges and highlight new developments in the integration of smart control systems with thermal energy storage. The study compares energy consumption and peak demand for a facility equipped with and without thermal energy storage tanks using a fixed schedule for charging and discharging. Additionally, the paper examines the impact of incorporating a smart controller to determine when to charge and discharge the tank based on the facility’s real-time power usage and a given setpoint. The results indicate cost savings from the use of thermal energy storage tanks under two proposed scenarios, reflected in the reduced cost of power consumption for the studied facility. The incorporation of a smart controller with the thermal energy storage tank in the facility studied could provide estimated savings of 3.3% per year of power consumption charges, without considering the contribution of any incentives. The estimated savings provided by the fixed schedule scenario are 2.7% per year.</jats:p>"

The nature of DFR in glacial moraine environments, such as those located in northern latitudes within North America and Europe, is less well established than in other regions such as the Prairie Pothole Region (Northern United States, Western Canada) and the High Plains Aquifer (Central United States). The objectives of this study were to quantify seasonal infiltration flux beneath a topographically‐closed depression within 50 m of a public supply well and to interpret the impact of this DFR process on well vulnerability. Field instruments including groundwater monitoring wells, pressure transducers, soil moisture sensors and temperature sensors were installed in vertical clusters to capture the dynamics of infiltration, drainage and recharge within the depression feature. Continuous weather data were recorded by a meteorological station at the site. Transient infiltration was quantified during two contrasting hydrological events. The first event (~2 days) was an intense rainfall (&gt;50 mm) on a melting snowpack during the fall season when the soils were unfrozen. The second was a longer (35 day) period during the spring freshet when the surficial soils were initially frozen and subject to diurnal freezing and thawing and occasional precipitation events. The water table fluctuation method augmented by Darcy flux contributions, in addition to numerical modelling using the HYDRUS‐1D model, were used to quantify recharge rates beneath the depression. Numerical DFR estimates and analytical results differed by ±8%. Results indicate that recharge rates on the order of the annual regional average can occur beneath localized features in response to extreme events associated with snowmelt and intense rainfall. Such events may represent a microbial threat to groundwater quality if public supply wells are located nearby.</jats:p>",

However, uncertainties brought by new energy sources have posed great challenges to the energy safety and stability of distribution networks, especially in the process of fault restoration. To address these issues, this paper investigates an emergency power supply recovery strategy for distribution networks by considering the support capability of microgrids and the high-dimensional dynamic correlations of uncertainty. Firstly, the structure of distribution networks including microgrids is analyzed. Then, the high-dimensional dynamic vine copula model is proposed to model the joint output uncertainty process. Next, island partition and operation models are established, including the objective function and constraint conditions, and the model solving methods are also presented. Finally, an example analysis is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The results show that the proposed strategy is able to deal with the uncertainties brought by renewable energy sources in distribution networks with microgrid support, improving energy safety and stability. This research provides valuable insights for the development of emergency power supply strategies in distribution networks.</jats:p>"

As one of the first to examine the effects of BCT implementation in SCF from the perspective of demand volatility, we focus on the impacts of BCT on equilibrium and whether the retailer has the incentive to adopt BCT. We perform a comparative analysis of the Stackelberg game involving three parties under scenarios with and without BCT adoption. We find that when the demand volatility reduction coefficient is sufficiently large, BCT can facilitate a reduction of the ordering quantity while still sustaining the same service level, thus avoiding excessive inventory, and reducing the associated risk of bankruptcy. Additionally, the decreased bankruptcy risk enabled the bank to reduce interest rates. The adoption of BCT can improve the profit of the retailer when the adoption cost of BCT is sufficiently low. Our findings provide management insights into when the small and medium‐sized enterprises should adopt BCT and the interactive decision‐making of all parties in the SCF business after BCT adoption.</jats:p>",

The mechanisms of μ-CAT were analyzed and characteristics of accumulated discharge, energy distribution, and ion velocity distribution of thruster were compared under different energy supply modes to obtain the effect of the energy supply mode on the discharge characteristics of the interelectrode of μ-CAT. The results show that the energy supply mode of μ-CAT affected the ionization characteristics and ionization stability of the micro-cathodic arc thruster, causing a multistage ionization difference in the cathode metal target. This would not only affect the propulsion performance of the thruster, but also affect the change of the number of particles in the cathode region in a single discharge cycle.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the six parameters of soil drainage, slope, lineament density, drainage density, soil texture, and land use land cover were used. ArcGIS 10.3, ERDAS Imagine 2015, IDRISI Selva 17, Arc SWAT 10.3, and Google Earth Pro were applied. The results revealed that about 58 km2 (2.1%) and 1,442.5 km2 (52.9%) were ranked as excellent and good for the groundwater recharge potential. Consequently, about 1,183.2 km2 (43.4%) was covered by a moderate groundwater recharge zone. Larger parts of the study area were dominated by good and moderate groundwater recharge potential.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Capital constraints hinder enterprises’ carbon reduction efforts and affect the sustainability of the supply chain. To alleviate this limitation, the core enterprise considers offering two financial-based carbon reduction incentive mechanisms: cost-sharing mechanism (CS) and preferential financing mechanism (PF). In a supply chain with the dual sensitivity of market demand to price and carbon reduction, we model each incentive mechanism, discussing their impact, value, and selection strategies. The results show that neither party under CS pursues an excessively high share ratio. Only a below-threshold sharing ratio can promote the supplier’s carbon reduction behavior and improve efficiency for both parties. Conversely, PF has a stable incentive effect on the supplier’s carbon reduction behavior and can effectively increase the retailer’s profits. However, a reasonable carbon reduction standard is needed to attract the supplier. In addition, as market demand becomes more sensitive to carbon reduction, the feasible range of CS narrows and that of PF expands. We compare players’ preferences of PF and CS and find a Pareto region in which all players prefer PF to CS. Finally, we test the robustness of our findings by an extending model. Our study provides guidance for supply chain decisions facing dual pressures of financial constraints and carbon reduction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results of the research show that even today crop cultivation in the entire territory of the steppe and in a large part of the forest-steppe zone is carried out in conditions of a significant deficit of the climatic water balance, which necessitates a significant expansion of irrigation application as a mandatory element of the of highly efficient and sustainable cultivation technologies of the most of crops. Therefore, without active measures to adapt agricultural production to climate change, which is accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency and duration of drought events and, accordingly, a shortage of moisture supply, the restoration and development of irrigation remains the main factor in increasing the productivity of field crops. The research was conducted in the Eastern Forest Steppe zone. For the assessment and analysis of climate change, raw meteorological data for 1961-2020 were used. The data source is the Global Climate Monitoring (GCM) system developed by the Climate Research Group of the University of Seville. According to the results of the assessment of the dynamics of the average annual air temperature for 1961-2020, it was established that over the past 30 years the temperature has risen on average by 1.2oC, and since 1987 the rate of its growth is 0.79oC over the decade, while the annual amount of precipitation remains practically unchanged. It was established that the potential evapotranspiration increased by 70 mm and is almost 850 mm per year. With such a difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, the deficit of the annual climatic water balance reaches on average almost 300 mm over the last 30 years, against 247 mm in 1961-1990, and the tendency to its increase persists. Simulation modeling of the economic efficiency of irrigation based on preliminary results indicates the efficiency of its implementation, and especially restoration on areas with existing reclamation infrastructure.</jats:p>"

A decreased NO3− uptake rate in AMF-colonized plants reduced the N:P ratio of the plants.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In pursuing clean energy systems and carbon neutrality, the efficient use of renewable energy is key. This research introduces a novel wind–solar–hydrogen multienergy supply (WSH‐MES) system, powered by renewables, designed to stabilize power output through regulated concentrating solar power (CSP) and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEs). An active regulation strategy for thermal and hydrogen storage is developed to counterbalance the volatility of wind and photovoltaic power. Key results reveal that the WSH‐MES system surpasses WP–PV and WP–PV–CSP systems in reliability, reducing power supply loss probability to 2.81%. This improvement is largely due to the controlled CSP and PEME, which effectively mitigates the stochastic fluctuations in wind and solar power generation, thereby ensuring more stable and reliable power output. Moreover, the system achieves an 80.97% primary renewable energy rate and a 0.12 power discard rate. In conclusion, this research comprehensively examines the operational characteristics of the WSH‐MES system, elucidates the practical advantages of the WSH‐MES system in terms of reliability, renewable energy utilization, and adaptability under various conditions. The results offer valuable insights into the design and operation of multienergy supply systems, potentially fostering the large‐scale implementation of renewable energy systems and leading toward a sustainable energy future.</jats:p>",

A través de un análisis de las posibilidades de sinergia entre Brasil y Bolivia, este estudio se centra en la optimización de las matrices energéticas para satisfacer la demanda futura y reducir los costos ambientales y de producción de energía para ambos participantes en el proceso. Para ello, se analiza inicialmente la caracterización de los países foco de estudio con el fin de comprender la evolución histórica de la gestión energética de cada uno, además de las potencialidades a abordar dada la matriz energética analizada en cuestión. Con la intención de equiparar posibles formas de integración entre los dos países, se realizó un análisis en torno a las integraciones energéticas en América del Sur, principalmente en la dinámica de las relaciones existentes, planteando casos de éxito y el enfoque adoptado para las mismas. La metodología de análisis fue creada para comparar los costos técnicos y ambientales de la ampliación de la matriz energética, para atender la demanda esperada en el 2040. La ampliación de la matriz considerando el escenario base, con solo recursos nacionales y consecuentemente las limitaciones de expansión que existen por restricciones en Brasil, y considerando la integración con Bolivia, ya sumado al costo de expansión de la transmisión representó una reducción del 12% en el costo esperado para atender la demanda. Con base en las técnicas de reducción de costos ambientales de la ampliación, el mismo análisis resulta en la optimización del uso de gas natural, con la reducción del costo total del proyecto del 11% en comparación con el escenario sin integración. De esta manera, hay una optimización de recursos que se puede aplicar al servicio nacional y que se puede escalar al tener en cuenta integraciones con otros países. Finalmente, también se discute la importancia de la integración energética como forma de desarrollo socioeconómico y como forma de protección frente al cambio climático, dada la complementariedad energética entre ambos participantes del proceso. Se espera, por tanto, la posibilidad de presentar una optimización frente al uso de los recursos ambientales para la generación de energía, combinando un equilibrio técnico-socio-ambiental para atender las necesidades de ambos países.</jats:p>"

The acute bioluminescence V. fischeri inhibition assay is widely recognized as a toxicological method that can be used to detect the acute effects of different contaminants. In this study, the physicochemical characteristics and toxicology of 72 water samples collected in 18 rural aqueducts located in Boyacá (Colombia) were evaluated. The primary economic activities identified as potential influencers of water quality in the water supply basins were agriculture (n = 3), livestock (n = 2), and domestic sewage discharge (n = 1). The average luminescence inhibition rate was 66%, with a minimum of 29%, and a maximum of 97%. A total of 85% of the tested samples (n = 61) had “moderate acute hazard”, while 15% (n = 15) had “acute hazard”. A total of 95% of the aqueducts distributed water with high risk. There was a weak positive correlation between the apparent color and the V. fischeri inhibition rate (p &lt; 0.05). The water treatments, including disinfection, and the economic activities had no correlation with the inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria. The results of this investigation can be used by sanitary authorities to incorporate future toxicological monitoring of chemical contaminants, such as humic substances and metals, into water-quality monitoring in rural areas.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the study sought to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of cucumber farmers in the study area; examine the amount of labour utilized for different cucumber production operation; estimate the determinants of cucumber productivity and examine constraints to cucumber production in the study area.  Structured questionnaire was used to collect data which were analyzed using means, frequencies, standard deviation, multiple regression analysis and the Likert Scale Rating technique. Result revealed a mean farming experience, age, household size and farm size of 5 years, 4 years, 5 persons and 0.5 hectare and 5 persons respectively. Majority (62.21) of respondent were female, married (71.1%), educated (87.3%), and participation in off farm activities (83.3%). Findings showed that while men participated more in land clearing (81.1%) and land preparation (76.6%) women were actively involved in weeding (79.2%) and harvesting (45.1%). Children on their part participated more on planting (44%) and fertilizer application/pesticide (47.4%), respectively. Results further showed that the major determinants of labour were farm size (p&gt;.0.01), household size (p&gt;0.05), education (p&gt;0.05), farming experience (p&gt;0.01) and quality of manure/fertilizer (p&gt;0.01). Also, the major constraints to cucumber production were scarcity of seed and agro chemicals, lack of storage facilities, high perishability of product, pest and disease infestation, low prices of product, high cost of labour, poor labour supply, poor access to credit, thefts of product, and low yield, respectively. It is recommended that prices of input should be subsidized, extension agents should be deployed to the area and that effort should be made to discharge the high off farm participation among cucumber farmers in the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large-scale epidemics impose significant burdens globally and cause an imbalance of medical supplies among different regions owing to the dissimilarly and unevenly distributed prevalence of the infection. Along with rebalancing the limited medical supplies to meet the demand and supply requirements, ensuring that the supplies are allocated to support the affected regions is also important. Hence, this study focuses on the collaborative medical supply rebalancing and allocating process to balance the demand and supply. The law of diminishing marginal utility is incorporated in this study to quantify the principle of fairness in rebalancing and allocating medical supplies. Accordingly, under uncertainty, a marginal-utility-oriented optimization model is proposed to formulate the rebalancing and allocation of collaborative medical supplies. Because the proposed model is nonlinear and computationally intractable, a linearization approach is adopted to obtain the global optimum that supports decision-making in response to epidemics. Furthermore, a real case study of the United States is implemented, where the sensitivity analysis of critical parameters is conducted on the coronavirus disease 2019. Computational results indicate that additional medical supplies, stock levels, and scenario constructions significantly influence the supply/demand point identification and outgoing/incoming shipments. Moreover, this study not only validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the method but also highlights the importance of incorporating the law of diminishing marginal utility into the collaborative medical supply rebalancing and allocating problem.</jats:p>",

The proposed strategy consists of three stages. First, the WT/PV power generation is forecast by a LightGBM model. The WT/PV siting and sizing at each node of the distribution network is optimized with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, with the objectives of economy and stability. In the second stage, the distribution network is partitioned into sub-clusters, based on a voltage and loss-sensitivity index. Finally, the ES siting and sizing is optimized with PSO to minimize the line loss and the voltage fluctuation for each sub-cluster. The relationship between the economic and stability indicators is conducted quantitatively in the joint-planning approach. Considering the 10 kV distribution network of an oil–gas platform in the Bohai Sea of China as an example, our experiments demonstrated that by adjusting the WT/PV ES capacity for different gas-turbine power outputs, line losses can be reduced by 55–66% and voltage fluctuations can be reduced by 30.4–47.5%.</jats:p>"

Herein, low- and high-dose (concentration–time values at 75 and 9,600 mg min L−1, respectively) chlorination processes were used to simulate short-term chlorination in drinking water treatment plants and long-term residual chlorine reaction in drinking water supply systems, respectively. Both chlorination processes induced modifications to polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs, varying in polymer types and sizes. Oxidized and chlorinated bonds were detected, and destructed surfaces with increased specific surface area and reduced hydrophobicity were observed. As a result, the sorption capacity of all MPs was weakened, e.g., low-dose chlorination (pH 7) depressed the sorption of ciprofloxacin by 6.5 μm PE (Kf from 0.140 to 0.128 L g−1). The sinking behavior of PET, PS, and PVC MPs was enhanced, e.g., the sinking ratio of 200 μm PET increased by ∼30% after low-dose chlorination (pH 7). By contrast, PE tended to float after high-dose chlorination. Furthermore, chlorination of MPs generated various products, which were the degraded fragments from the MP skeleton. In general, chlorination disinfection reduces the potential of MPs as transport vectors of organic contaminants.</jats:p>",

The hydroponic experiments also suggested that Mg mitigated leaf bronzing without significantly decreasing Fe concentration or oxidative stress as assessed by the content of malondialdehyde, a biomarker for oxidative stress. An RNA-seq analysis revealed that Mg induced more changes in leaves than roots. Subsequent cis-element analysis suggested that NAC transcription factor binding sites were enriched in genes induced by Fe toxicity in leaves.

As part of this goal, the environmental and socio-economic factors affecting the quantity and quality of farmland and, subsequently, the amount of its market price will be discussed. In addition to the quality of the farmland, the market price of individual plots of land is influenced by a number of other factors, such as the size and shape of the plot, location, erosion risk, the concluded usufructuary lease agreements, competition from buyers in the vicinity, and other factors. The average market price of farmland in Czechia was 29.4 CZK/m2 in 2021, which represents an increase of 16.1% against the amount of 25.3 CZK/m2 in 2020. According to the results of the statistical analysis, it is possible to assume a constant increase in the prices of farmland precisely because of the ever-decreasing area of land intended for agricultural production. Another factor for the increase in prices can be increased inflation. In 2027, market prices for farmland could reach up to 40 CZK per m2. Nevertheless, Czechia is among the countries with the lowest market price of farmland; the price is even lower than in neighboring Poland or Spain. This also contributes to the fact that the market prices of farmland in Czechia are increasing at a relatively fast pace every year.</jats:p>"

In addition, under the same mean inhalation flow, the minimum outlet air velocity increases first and then decreases with the increase of the duty cycle variation coefficient (λ), while the maximum outlet air velocity decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the minimum air supply flow of the BF-PAPR is achieved when the standard value of the air velocity is 13.4 m/s and the value of λ is 1. The BF-PAPR can reduce the air supply flow by 6.5%-8.6% and the energy consumption by approximately 20% compared with the PAPR, which is beneficial for reducing the usage cost and extending the continuous working time.</jats:p>"

Second, interview data were thematically coded to extract the preliminary drivers. Third, the preliminary drivers supported by the literature or original interview quotes were considered the final drivers. Lastly, subcategories and categories were extracted from the final drivers by thematic coding to form a framework of drivers for RSHTUE development. The results show that the framework driving RSHTUE development includes two categories: demand and supply. Nine demand drivers were clustered into four subcategories: economic, social, cultural, and natural. A total of 21 supply drivers were clustered into five subcategories: economic, social, political, cultural, and natural. This study enriches the knowledge of RSHTUE development drivers. The literature supporting each driver was systematically reviewed. RSHTUE-relevant participants can use these drivers to identify villages’ suitability for developing RSHTUE and to explore countermeasures for the sustainable development of RSHTUE. The literature on each driver can provide support for subsequent studies.</jats:p>"

One of the most promising solutions to sustainably fight malnutrition is to design programs that will consider locally produced foods and production approaches that protect the soil. The present study was designed to evaluate the nutritional quality of grains produced in the Savannah in order to provide data that will be used to make recommendations for nutrition and sustainable farming. Farmers in the Savannah region in Togo were interviewed about their productions and their produced grains were sampled for biochemical characterization. All producers exploit family lands and mainly produce grains. More than 98% of producers breed poultry by only at the family level. Biochemical characterization of the sampled foods shows that pulses present a relative high level of sand, fatty matters and proteins. Results show that both cereals and pulses contain sufficient energy, fatty matters, vitamins and minerals that are necessary for human wellbeing. Foods formulations could be made especially for children under food substitution. In addition, pulses production is encouraged for sustainable soil preservation.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"

Both upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain pay more attention to carbon emission reduction, and consumers are gradually turning to a low-carbon preference. How carbon reduction targets are allocated among supply chain members with different technical efficiency and market opportunities will directly affect supply chain performance and social welfare. Power structure is an important factor that dominates the decision-making of the supply chain, so we establish the low-carbon supply chain model under three different power structures: manufacturer-led, retailer-led, and power pairs between two parties. We study the government distribution decisions of carbon emissions reduction targets under different supply chain power structures and discuss the influence of supply chain power structures on carbon emissions reduction distribution decisions and social welfare. The study found that if the carbon emissions reduction target increases, the government will adjust the allocation strategy to increase the proportion of enterprises whose emissions cuts have less impact on market demand. The study also found that the government will allocate more emissions reduction to enterprises with higher emissions reduction efficiency, and enterprises whose emissions reductions have a greater impact on market demand. When supply chain enterprises have equal power, the supply chain will have greater social welfare and market demand, but not necessarily greater supply chain profits.</jats:p>"

However, as a quasi-public good, it faces challenges because of its non-excludability, meaning that everyone can use it whether they pay for it or not, which results in a phenomenon known as ‘free-riding’ and poor supply. In China, the government can regulate the supply behaviour by adjusting information feedback approaches, such as disclosing the supply value and revenue. This study examined three information feedback approaches: full feedback (disclosing supply and revenue), half feedback (disclosing only supply), and no feedback (no disclosure). It then combined these three information feedback methods with other three groups of variables, namely whether there was a reward or punishment mechanism, whether the return rate of forestry infrastructure was certain, and whether the foresters could communicate with each other, and 20 policy scenarios were designed. Using experimental economics, foresters’ supply behaviours in these policy scenarios were simulated. The results revealed that: (1) The scenario yielded the highest supply, which is with half feedback, certain return rate of forestry infrastructure, with a reward or punishment mechanism, and no communication. (2) When there is no reward or punishment mechanism, no communication, and the return rate of forestry infrastructure is certain, no feedback increases the supply. In the presence of rewards and punishments, half feedback leads to the highest supply. If there are no rewards or punishments but with a certain return rate and communication, full feedback results in the highest supply. (3) Implementing a reward or punishment mechanism and information feedback simultaneously increases the supply more effectively. The theoretical analysis and policy recommendations of this study aim to improve the supply status of forestry infrastructure.</jats:p>"

Based on game analysis technology, different Stackelberg game models among the government and the CLSC members are formulated to analyze the optimal decisions under different power structures. By conducting theoretic comparative and sensitivity analyses and a case study, the effects of the government subsidy and the power structure are explored from the total profit, environmental benefit, and social welfare. Results show that the subsidy is good for sustainable development of the CLSC, which improves the total profit of the CLSC members, environmental benefit, and social welfare and the improvement effect is more prominent when the CLSC members have unequal bargaining power. Moreover, according to the growth proportion of profit, the retailer and collector benefit more from the subsidy among the CLSC members when they have different bargaining power, otherwise, the CLSC members benefit equally from the subsidy, and the subsidy is more beneficial to the environment compared with the total supply chain profit and social welfare.</jats:p>"

IKN covers a total area of 256,000 hectares, with approximately 56,000 hectares of planned urban built areas will be conducted in five stages from 2022 until 2045. One of the challenges faced by the construction phase in IKN is that the existing seaports in Handil and Muara Samboja still cannot provide the support required for the logistics supply of construction materials. To support the development of the IKN, the current seaports and supporting infrastructure must be developed to allow the seamless operation of the logistics process. Therefore, this study aims to propose a conceptual design for logistic seaports in the Simpang Samboja and Muara Jawa areas. Case study is the method used in this study, using both qualitative and quantitative approach. This case study method references previous studies to obtain alternative value-added components.

The adoption of sustainable procurement practices has gained significant attention due to the growing emphasis on the environmental, social, and economic impact of organizations and their suppliers. It aimed to determine the extent to which sustainability principles were incorporated into procurement practices, identify challenges faced in adopting sustainable procurement, and identify factors that could influence sustainable procurement adoption. A quantitative approach was used, and data is collected through a structured questionnaire administered to procurement officers in Ghanaian tertiary institutions. The questionnaire included statements of sustainability practices, challenges of adoption, and factors influencing adoption. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings revealed that the adoption of sustainable procurement practices in Ghanaian tertiary institutions is a low to moderate state. Respondents show disagreement in areas such as following up on environmental and social performance, ensuring the well-being of the less privileged, and including reporting on environmental and social issues. However, respondents express moderate agreement in considering alternatives to purchasing, such as reusing, recycling, and hiring. Challenges in adopting sustainable procurement practices were identified, including difficulty in accessing suppliers of sustainable products, suppliers' lack of understanding of sustainability concepts, and low commitment of management to sustainability adoption. Factors that can influence sustainable procurement adoption are also explored, including demystifying the perceived cost of sustainable products, encouraging top management support and policy implementation, providing sustainability training for staff, and enforcing governmental laws and regulations on sustainability. The study highlights the need for increased awareness and implementation of sustainable procurement practices in Ghanaian tertiary institutions. It emphasizes the importance of addressing challenges and promoting factors that facilitate adoption. By incorporating sustainability principles into procurement practices, these institutions can contribute to a more sustainable future, where resources are used efficiently, waste is minimized, and social well-being is prioritized.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the optimal input features are selected by calculating the maximal information coefficient (MIC) between the input features and the target output. Based on this, a stacking ensemble learning model is applied for the prediction of wind power, photovoltaic power and load power. Secondly, the distributions of the forecasting objects are obtained based on forecasting errors and the error statistics method. Finally, the forecasting distributions of wind power, photovoltaic power and load are set as the parameters of a power system, and then probabilistic ALSC is calculated using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and repeated power flow (RPF). In order to simulate a more realistic power system, multiple slack buses are introduced to conduct two types of power imbalance allocations with novel allocation principles during the RPF calculation, which makes the ALSC evaluation results more reasonable and accurate. The results of probabilistic ALSC forecasting can provide a reference for the load power supply capacity of a power system in the future, and they can also provide an early warning for the risk of ALSC threshold overlimit. Case studies carried out on the modified IEEE 39-bus system verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</jats:p>"

However, river water's highly nonlinear and complex spatio-temporal dependencies pose significant challenges to water quality prediction tasks. In order to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of water quality data simultaneously, this paper combines deep learning algorithms for river water quality prediction in the river network area of Jiangnan Plain, China. A water quality prediction method based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), namely spatio-temporal graph convolutional network model (ST-GCN), is proposed. Specifically, the spatio-temporal graph is constructed based on the spatio-temporal correlation between river stations, the spatial features in the river network are extracted using GCN, and the temporal correlation of water quality data is obtained by integrating LSTM. The model was evaluated using R2, MAE, and RMSE, and the experimental results were 0.977, 0.238, and 0.291, respectively. Compared with traditional water quality prediction models, the ST-GCN model has significantly improved prediction accuracy, better stability, and generalization ability.</jats:p>",

The technologies of preparing water harvesting materials with modified microstructure and wettability arrangement have been introduced, it has been shown that surface embedded with a bump array which has counter wettability compared with its plane section is a common morphology adopted by current works. After comparing climates in desertification regions with those in dewing chambers, it has been found that currently, the expected values of dew productivities of most water harvesting materials in deserted areas will not be as efficient as they performed in experiments due to low relative humidity. However, hydrophobic surface with submicron scale hydrophilic spherical cavity array produced by nanosphere lithography has shown reliable prospects in reducing the energy barrier of heterogeneous nucleation and thus become a more potential medium in dew water production.</jats:p>",

Fringe benefits are additions to compensation that companies give their employees. This research project is on Fringe Benefits and Employees productivity in public sector. This research work is generally about the Benefits and Employees productivity Public Sector.  The project has undertook the general introduction into the research work led to the review of various literature that relates to the major variables involved in the research work especially employees productivity. The purpose of employee benefits is to increase the economic security of staff members, and in doing so, improve worker retention across the organization. As such, it is one component of reward management. In any case, employers use fringe benefits to help them recruit, motivate, and keep high-quality people. According to Mathis and John (2003), productivity is a measure of the quantity and quality of work done, considering the cost of the resources used. The more productive an organization, the better its competitive advantage, because the costs to produce its goods and services are lower. Employee benefits in Canada usually refer to employer sponsored life, disability, health, and dental plans. Employee benefits in the United States include relocation assistance; medical, prescription, vision and dental plans; health and dependent care flexible spending accounts; retirement benefit plans (pension, 401(k), 403(b). fringe benefits refers to the regular review of an employee’s job performance and overall contribution to a company. The objective is to know the effect of fringe benefits on employee motivation. The reveals that fringe benefits lead to improved employees’ performance. This results from increased productivity in the organization. The majorities of the employees are motivated of the organization through feedback and increased productivity.</jats:p>"

However, achieving real-time scheduling of pump and valve in dynamic environments remains challenging. Thus, this study proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning scheduling framework to address the uncertainty of water demand in WDNs. First, we constructed a WDN environment and modelled the scheduling problem as a Markov decision process. Second, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method was used to determine the strategy of the fully cooperative multi-agent task. Moreover, the impacts of energy and water loss costs on the scheduling strategy were explored. Finally, the results were compared with those of a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) to verify the performance and robustness of the proposed model. The results show that water loss dominates the scheduling process, and the scheduling solutions for minimising water loss and energy costs are mainly affected by the demand pattern of consumers rather than the energy tariff. The proposed MADDPG model outperforms the GA, PSO, and DE models, achieving a significantly faster solution, which is advantageous for practical applications.</jats:p>",

For this reason, the application of circular economy criteria that are committed to the development of new, more sustainable construction materials has become one of the major challenges included in the European Green Pact. In this research, the physical and mechanical characterisation of a new plaster composite material with the incorporation of recycled rubber granular particles and glass wool waste fibres has been carried out. It has been possible to replace up to 30% of the original plaster material with recycled raw material, improving the thermal behaviour of the prefabricated plaster plates. In addition, good mechanical performance has been obtained and the weight of the precast elements has been reduced. Finally, using the FlexSim simulation software, different scenarios have been examined which have permitted to know the increases in productivity in the manufacturing process derived from the use of these lightened sustainable materials, as well as to verify the reduction in fuel consumption (litres/plate) and CO2 emissions during transport. For all these reasons, the application of circular economy criteria applied to waste management is fundamental to progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nKey Words: circular economy, building/construction industry product innovation, sustainable prefabricated construction, efficiency, simulation.</jats:p>",

It is found that the retailer always prefers to conceal her actual cost information thus signal as a higher-cost type in the first period to pursue a higher information rent, which would decrease the supplier’s profit and thereby the overall profit of the supply chain. To mitigate this ratchet effect, we introduce a reputation compensation mechanism in the two-period trade credit setting. This mechanism could alleviate the information asymmetry to a certain extent as there exists a threshold that incentivizes the retailer to share her true cost information in the earlier period. Moreover, the retailer might claim as a lower-cost type when the supplier offers a relatively higher reputation compensation to take full advantage of her information. Therefore, the supplier should provide trade credit with a reasonable reputation compensation in a two-period setting to enhance his expected profit.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, various applications have been developed to meet the needs of mobile users, which include navigation. The integration of these applications with maps and various localization technologies such as augmented reality (AR) will improve the reliability of navigation systems for wayfinding under certain constraints. AR allows the user to experience an interactive environment by observing the real world augmented by digital objects. However, this technology cannot store and control data. A geospatial information system (GIS) provides storage, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data that can be used to address the challenges and shortcomings of AR. In addition, the capabilities offered by GIS can be useful for achieving sustainability goals in areas such as effective planning and resource allocation. Traditional GIS, especially two-dimensional maps, provide a weak intuitive experience for users, leading to difficulties in interpreting the map and reaching conclusions. Therefore, AR can be used as a bridge between 2D and 3D visualization. The involvement of GIS in human activities and the transition of AR use from traditional terrain outreach to industrial applications makes it worthwhile to integrate GIS with AR to benefit from the two technologies simultaneously. The simultaneous visualization of real and virtual geospatial information leads to an interactive approach. The paper analyzes the capabilities of augmented reality and geo-referenced data approaches for the construction of water systems, describes their weaknesses and strengths, notes the main characteristics of the logistic regression algorithm and considers the tasks performed by this algorithm. A comparative analysis of the algorithms is carried out.</jats:p>",

This study utilized Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) models and geographical detectors to quantify the spatial–temporal patterns of the supply, demand, and supply–demand ratio of ESs such as water yield, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration, along with their driving factors, in the Shanxi section of the Yellow River Basin. The results show that: (1) From the year 2000 to 2020, although the supply and demand of water yield, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration fluctuated, they generally increased during this period of time. In comparison to ecosystem services from the year 2000 to 2020, the supply of water yield exceeded the demand in 2020. The supply, demand, and supply–demand ratio of ESs exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity. (2) The most notable factors influencing the supply–demand ratio of water yield varied between 2000 and 2020. In 2000, construction land was the most important factor, while in 2020, cropland had the greatest impact. However, the primary factors affecting the supply–demand ratio of soil conservation and carbon sequestration remained the same in 2000 and 2020. Forestland was the primary factor in 2000, while construction land was the primary factor in 2020. (3) Considering interaction factors, the interaction factors between construction land and precipitation had the greatest impact on the supply–demand ratio of water yield in 2000, while the interaction between forestland and cropland had the greatest impact in 2020. The interaction between cropland and shrubland had the greatest impact on the supply–demand ratio of soil conservation in 2000, whereas the interaction factors between construction land and forestland had the greatest impact in 2020. The interaction between construction land and shrubland had the greatest impact on the supply–demand ratio of carbon sequestration in 2000, while the interaction between construction land and cropland had the greatest impact in 2020. Overall, the interaction between construction land and various land-use factors had the strongest explanation for the supply–demand ratio of ecosystem services.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vertical agriculture has developed rapidly in recent years, pushing artificial light planting to new heights. Under indoor artificial light, the light supply mode has practical significance in studying the impact of lighting conditions on plants. This experiment involved five intermittent light supply modes (with a light period of 16 h and a dark period of 8 h (16/8) as the control group, with a light period of 8 h and a dark period of 4 h repeated twice a day (8/4), a light period of 4 h and a dark period of 2 h repeated four times a day (4/2), a light period of 2 h and a dark period of 1 h repeated eight times a day (2/1), and a light period of 1 h and a dark period of 0.5 h repeated 16 times a day (1/0.5) (as the experimental groups). A total of ten treatments were combined before the continuous light supply mode (B) and after the continuous light supply mode (A). Through experimental settings, we explored the response mechanisms to intermittent and continuous light supply modes as they pertain to lettuce growth, nutrient content, photosynthetic parameters, and light stress. Through research, it was found that continuous light supply significantly increased plant height, root length, aboveground dry and fresh weight, and the underground dry and fresh weight of lettuce. The treatments with a light period 4 h/dark period 2 h (4/2) and a light period 8 h/dark period 4 h (8/4) significantly increased the N, P, K, and Cu contents. Additionally, continuous light supply helped stabilize the Mg, Ca, and Mn contents across all treatment groups. Stomatal closure has been found to cause a decrease in the rate of net photosynthesis, transpiration, and intercellular CO2 concentration. The energy absorbed by antenna pigments is significantly increased when participating in photochemical reactions; however, continuous light supply has been observed to reduce the absorption flux per reaction center (ABS/RC), trapped energy flux per reaction center (TR0/RC), electron transport flux per reaction center (ET0/RC), and the probability that a trapped exciton moves an electron into the electron transport chain beyond QA− (at t = 0) (ET0/TR0). Conversely, the electron transport flux per cross section (ET0/CS) has been found to increase significantly. In summary, among the intermittent light supply treatment groups, the 2/1 treatment group showed the best response to growth indicators, nutrient absorption, and photosynthesis, and could improve the quality of lettuce without adding additional light energy. Continuous light supply in the short term can improve the growth and nutrient absorption of lettuce; both of the two light supply modes produced light stress on lettuce, and this light stress caused by non-circadian rhythm forced the lettuce to increase its photochemical quenching (qI) and electro transport flux crossover (ET0/CS). This paper may provide a theoretical reference for the use of light supply modes in plant factories to improve vegetable yield, and for the study of the response mechanism of light stress under non-circadian rhythm.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is of great significance to systematically analyze the characteristics of the regional grain supply and demand balance, reveal the influence mechanism of crop sustainable development, and put forward effective countermeasures to achieve the goal of food security. This paper aims at addressing the unique geographical characteristics of Northwest China and the current lack of research on its food security. This paper systematically analyzes the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the regional grain production, consumption and food security level. The main factors affecting regional food security are examined, and we put forward effective suggestions to promote regional sustainable production. The results show that the average annual growth rate of grain production in Northwest China from 2000 to 2021 was 3.4%, and the years of increased grain production accounted for 77.3%. The main reason for the increase in grain production was the increase in yield per unit area (average annual growth of 2.8%), of which the rice yield was the largest, up to 7.3 t/ha. Maize and wheat accounted for 60.7% and 23.4% of the total grain production in the region, respectively. From the perspective of the regional structure, Inner Mongolia contributed the most to the grain production in the region, accounting for 33.5% of the total output. Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai contributed 17.1%, 15.4%, 15.2%, 13.0%, 4.5% and 1.3%, respectively, to grain production. From the perspective of the dietary structure, the grain consumption pattern in Northwest China has gradually changed from raw grains to animal products, which has undoubtedly increased the regional demand for grain. At present, since the increase in output is greater than the demand for food, the food self-sufficiency rate in the region has increased from 0.81 to 1.28. Since the grain yield per unit area in Xinjiang and Ningxia has a relative advantage over other provinces, to achieve regional food security for a long time, moderately increasing the grain planting area in these two provinces will help to promote regional food security. In addition, as the grains produced in the region are mainly wheat and corn, the yield level of wheat and corn in Xinjiang and Qinghai has a comparative advantage within Northwest China. Therefore, moderately increasing the planting area of wheat and corn in Xinjiang and Qinghai is of great significance in ensuring regional food security. The research results can provide theoretical support for the realization of regional food security and provide a reference for other regions in the world, to better serve global food security.</jats:p>"

Green investment strategies are explored under three scenarios: no-green investment, ex-ante and ex-post green subsidies by the incumbent manufacturer (IM), and green investment by the supplier. The results show that market size does not influence supplier channel selection and investment decisions. The green investment strategy is significantly affected by investment cost efficiency. Meanwhile, contrary to expectation, the more the investment is, the more willing the incumbent supply chain is to invest. Moreover, under a single-channel format, the incumbent supply chain can’t always achieve Pareto equilibrium. However, in the presence of the supplier green investment, although each green investment scenario can improve the profit, it cannot realize Pareto equilibrium. In addition, when the dual-channel format is adopted, the local areas can achieve Pareto equilibrium under different scenarios. The supplier plays an important role as it holds a monopoly upstream in the supply chain. As a result, the supplier’s green investment generates excellent profit and consumer surplus; however, there will be fluctuations in the optimal strategy of the incumbent manufacturer.</jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, the Brazilian national electricity system operator establishes that alternating current (AC) auxiliary systems of ESS must have, at least, two power supplies, and in the case of failure of these sources, an emergency generator (EG) must at least supply energy to the essential loads. In order to improve the availability of auxiliary systems, a microgrid with other sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), can be an alternative. In this case, an economical optimization of the PV/BESS system must be addressed considering the costs associated with the installation and maintenance of equipment, and the gains from the credits generated by the photovoltaic system in the net metering scheme. In this paper, the size of the BESS system was determined to supply energy to the load of auxiliary systems of an ESS, as well as a PV system to achieve a null total cost. Furthermore, multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithm technique was employed to optimize the size of the hybrid PV/BESS to minimize the investment cost and time when the demand was not met. Simulations under different scenarios of contingency were allowed to obtain the Pareto frontier for the optimal sizing of a PV/BESS system to supply energy to AC auxiliary systems in an ESS under contingency.</jats:p>"

The Northern Sea Route is one of the most promising directions for ensuring the northern delivery of goods to the territory of the Arctic and the Far East. The significance of the Northern Sea Route lies in its ability to provide a shorter and more cost-efficient way to transport goods compared to the traditional sea routes. At the same time, an important factor is the reduction of time and costs for transporting goods to the remote regions, which contributes to improving the economic availability of food and increasing food safety. Nevertheless, at present a number of the problems are available, which are associated with the use of the Northern Sea Route for the northern delivery of goods. One of them is the availability of the required capacities to ensure transportation.  Forecasting the required number of supply vessels to ensure the reliability of the northern delivery contributes to the development of solutions aimed at ensuring food and food safety in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and the Far East. The results of a study are presented concerning the existing base of vessels that provide northern delivery, as well as objective factors that complicate the process of carrying out this set of measures. It is proposed to solve the problem of ensuring economic and food safety by building the required fleet to compensate for departing ships and increasing the volume of traffic that could be sent along the Northern Sea Route. Thus, the availability of a fleet for the northern delivery using the waters of the Northern Sea Route is directly related to the availability of the corresponding fleet of the Russian Federation as a whole. An assessment was made of the need for vessels to carry out the northern delivery, a forecast was made and the volume of demand for supply vessels until 2030 was identified.</jats:p>",

Results show that (1) manufacturers and retailers are more likely to produce and promote LCPs as consumers become more sensitive to carbon emission reduction (CER); (2) manufacturers are less likely to produce LCPs but retailers are more likely to promote them as consumers become more sensitive to promotional rates; and (3) manufacturers are less likely to produce LCPs but retailers are more likely to promote them as consumers become more sensitive to retail prices.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this research, we investigate a supply chain consisting of a downstream firm who purchases a component from an upstream firm and then transforms it into a final product. The downstream firm has a production capacity constraint and considers to raise capital from an investor through equity financing. The raised capital not only enables the downstream firm to expand the capacity but also allows the investor to hold equity shares in the downstream firm. We derive the optimal pricing and production decisions of the two firms and discuss the optimal equity financing strategy of the downstream firm. We consider two distinct models: the external equity financing model, where the capital is raised from an outside institution, and the internal equity financing model, where the capital is raised from the upstream firm. We show that because the cooperative relationship between the two firms can be improved in the internal equity financing model, the production quantity in this model may be even higher than that in a benchmark model with no capacity constraint and no equity holding by the investor in the downstream firm. In addition, the original shareholder of the downstream firm gets more benefit from the internal equity financing activity than from the external equity financing activity. We also analyze the impacts of the key model parameters on the equity financing strategy and find that the dependence of the financing strategy on the initial asset of the downstream firm is quite different in the two models. Moreover, when the production cost of the downstream firm is changed, less capital raised for expanding capacity may create more value for the original shareholder of the downstream firm in each model. Finally, we show that the key finding remains unchanged when deterministic demand is changed to stochastic demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current sales model combining online and offline channels meets the diverse requirements of consumers. However, consumers’ inter-channel switching behavior and strategic behavior also pose significant challenges to pricing decisions in the hybrid channel. Using game theory and consumer utility theory, a retailer-driven pricing model is developed to study the optimal pricing problem for each channel in a mixed-channel supply chain considering the characteristics of channel competition and the waiting behavior of strategic consumers. Study results show there is a negative correlation between the proportion of strategic consumers and the optimal pricing and profit of each channel, and as the proportion of strategic consumers rises, the optimal pricing and profit of manufacturers and retailers all trend downward. Incorporating strategic consumers into the pricing model will assist the supply chain in elucidating the behavior of consumer heterogeneity during various decision-making periods and in making reasonable pricing decisions. Effective guiding strategies, such as pre-discount and purchase restrictions, can reduce the profit loss caused by strategic consumer behavior. The optimal combination of pre-announcement discount and strategic consumer ratio can generate the greatest profit for retailers and the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Even less is known about the individual and interactive effects of warming and N availability on the fate of recently photosynthesized C in soil. On a 10‐year geothermal warming gradient in Iceland, we studied the effects of soil warming and N addition on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes and the fate of recently photosynthesized C through CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> flux measurements and a <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> pulse‐labeling experiment. Under warming, ecosystem respiration exceeded maximum gross primary productivity, causing increased net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. N addition treatments revealed that, surprisingly, the plants in the warmed soil were N limited, which constrained primary productivity and decreased recently assimilated C in shoots and roots. In soil, microbes were increasingly C limited under warming and increased microbial uptake of recent C. Soil respiration was increased by warming and was fueled by increased belowground inputs and turnover of recently photosynthesized C. Our findings suggest that a decade of warming seemed to have induced a N limitation in plants and a C limitation by soil microbes. This caused a decrease in net ecosystem CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake and accelerated the respiratory release of photosynthesized C, which decreased the C sequestration potential of the grassland. Our study highlights the importance of belowground C allocation and C‐N interactions in the C dynamics of subarctic ecosystems in a warmer world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Network literature has widely documented that the managerial ties between corporate leaders in two firms can promote their economic exchanges in supply chains, that is, social embeddedness. In this study, we strive to advance this line of inquiry by exploring the dynamics of such socially embedded supply chains, examining whether and when the dissolution of managerial ties between two firms would cause the subsequent termination of their supplier–buyer exchanges. We address this question by distinguishing two types of socially embedded supply chains based on their different relational origins: business‐with‐friend links in which the managerial ties precede the supply chains, and friend‐in‐business links in which the supplier–buyer exchanges precede the managerial ties. We posit that the managerial tie dissolution has a negligible effect on the subsequent termination of supply chains in business‐with‐friend links. In contrast, in friend‐in‐business links, the dissolution of managerial ties between two firms is associated with a significantly higher likelihood for their supplier–buyer exchanges to dissolve afterward. We find strong empirical evidence for the above propositions using a nuanced data set that integrates the managerial tie information and the supply chain data. In sum, we show that socially embedded supply chains with different origins (“doing business with friends” vs. “making friends in business”) would have distinct patterns of evolution and dissolution. </jats:p>",

Sustainability considerations must be incorporated into mission planning and execution to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration. The study emphasizes the importance of considering environmental sustainability, resource use, ethical concerns, long-term planning, international collaboration, and public outreach in space missions. It emphasizes the significance of reducing negative environmental consequences, increasing resource use efficiency, and making responsible and ethical actions. The paper offers a multi-objective optimization conceptual model that may be used to evaluate and choose sustainable space mission tactics. This approach considers a variety of elements, including environmental effects, resource utilization, mission cost, and advantages for society. It provides a systematic decision-making approach that examines trade-offs between different criteria and identifies optimal conceptual model solutions that balance risk, sustainability, and supply chain objectives. A practical approach is also offered to demonstrate the use of the multi-criteria optimization conceptual model in a space mission scenario. The practical approach demonstrates how the model can aid in the development of mission strategies that minimize risks, maximize resource consumption, and fit with sustainability goals. Overall, this paper delivers a multi-criteria optimization conceptual model and provides a space mission planning practical approach, as well as an overview of the interaction between risk, sustainability, and supply chain in space mission organization, planning, and execution.</jats:p>"

Seasonal reproductive changes contribute to intermittent production, which poses challenges for optimizing goat product yields. Consequently, a significant objective in seasonal reproduction research is to attain continuous reproduction and enhance profitability in goat farming. Glutamate plays a crucial role as a modulator in several reproductive and metabolic processes. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of exogenous glutamate administration on serum insulin concentration and ovarian function during the out-of-season period in yearling goats. During the anestrous season, animals were randomly located in individual pens to form two experimental groups: (1) glutamate (n = 10, live weight (LW) = 29.1 ± 1.02 kg, body condition score (BCS) = 3.4 ± 0.2 units) and (2) control (n = 10; LW = 29.2 ± 1.07 kg, BCS = 3.5 ± 0.2), with no differences (p &lt; 0.05) regarding LW and BCS. Then, goats were estrus-synchronized, and blood sampling was carried out for insulin quantification. Ovaries were ultrasonographically scanned to assess ovulation rate (OR), number of antral follicles (AFs), and total ovarian activity (TOA = OR + AF). The research outcomes support our working hypothesis.

To that end, this study assessed the sustainability of the current nutrient origin and supply of 71 arable organic farms in 8 European regions. Deficient nutrient supply was found on 24%, 66%, and 56% of farms for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively. On average, we show a moderate surplus for nitrogen (28 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), while phosphorus and potassium balances were close to zero (− 1 and 2 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively). Large variation between countries and farm types shows a divide between more intensive systems relying on external inputs, and less intensive systems facing nutrient deficits and lower outputs. We show, for the first time, the extent of current use of external input types, where conventional manures supplied 17–26% of external nutrients and inputs from non-agricultural origin supplied 31–41%. A large proportion of nutrient sources within the last group are materials derived from urban wastes. The sustainable expansion of the organic sector will require increased use of locally available recycled fertilizers from urban wastes, and acceptance of such sources by organic farmers is shown to be high, provided they are considered safe.</jats:p>",

Such approaches should contribute to increased plasma collection in Europe to meet patients’ needs for plasma‐derived medicinal products, notably immunoglobulins and avoid shortages. Overall, presentations and discussions confirmed that European non‐profit transfusion institutions are committed to increasing the collection of plasma for fractionation from unpaid donors through dedicated programmes as well as novel strategies and research.</jats:p>",

To date, research has not systematically assessed labour conditions against international standards across diverse, complex food products. Here we combine data on production, trade, labour intensity and qualitative risk coding to quantitatively assess the risk of forced labour embedded in the US land-based food supply, building on our previous assessment of fruits and vegetables. We demonstrate that animal-based proteins, processed fruits and vegetables, and discretionary foods are major contributors to forced labour risk and that 62% of total forced labour risk stems from domestic production or processing. Our findings reveal the widespread risk of forced labour present in the US food supply and the necessity of collaborative action across all countries—high, middle and low income—to eliminate reliance on labour exploitation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demand planning-oriented research on nighttime urban lighting provides a foundation for formulating strategies to eliminate dark areas and reduce light pollution. In this paper, Binjiang District of Hangzhou was investigated. Four factors, namely land-use type, road grade, parcel volume, and nighttime crowds, were evaluated. Based on the spatiotemporal geographic data and the urban lighting planning of Hangzhou, a calculation method for the supply and demand of urban lighting at night in Hangzhou was constructed. In this process, the current state of lighting brightness in different areas of the district were calculated and compared with the results of the total lighting demand to analyze reasonableness. The research results show that according to the actual lighting demand classification, the first to fifth levels of lighting control zones accounted for 1.84%, 19.69%, 49.61%, 21.74%, and 7.12% of the total statistical land area of the district, respectively. Focus should thus be placed on the second, third, and fourth levels of lighting control zones when covering lighting demand. Importantly, areas with unreasonable supply and demand for lighting construction accounted for 20.8% of the total statistical land area, indicating that the nighttime lighting demand and carbon emissions in the Riverside District should be adjusted and optimized. This paper proposes a research method to compare supply and demand for the planning and construction of nighttime urban lighting, which can improve the science on lighting demand measurement.</jats:p>"

Since 2007, the regional governments have taken a leading role in agricultural water-saving planning by upgrading irrigation systems and constructing water-saving facilities. In this study, the effects of water-saving irrigation strategies on the groundwater table and quality were investigated in the Yellow River basin during the last two decades. The average phreatic water level of bore-wells was monitored as 13.47 m during 2011–2020 compared to the level of 12.09 m during 2011–2020. Besides, the depth of the deep confined aquifer dropped dramatically during 2001–2013 with a declining rate of 2.55 meters per annum (m/a) compared to the value of 0.385 m/a after 2014, suggesting the reduced exploitation of deep groundwater and increased availability of groundwater after the water-saving campaign. In addition, the physicochemical parameters of both phreatic water and deep confined aquifer indicated improved water quality. Consequently, understanding how the water-saving planning influences the groundwater availability is important, which would provide an insightful guidance for the water managers to protect the groundwater environment in the Yellow River Delta.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the diffusion pattern of contaminants in the tee structure was examined using a combination of numerical simulations and experiments. The coefficient of variation was chosen as an evaluation indicator, and the uniform diffusion length (LU) was defined to quantify the location of uniform diffusion of pollutants in the structure. Several factors were used to investigate pollutant diffusion in the pipe, including pipe diameter, break location, inlet Reynolds number, outlet flow ratio, brine flow rate, and brine density. Results show that the inlet Reynolds number, outlet flow ratio, and pipe diameter all significantly affect pollutant diffusion. The LU increased as the inlet Reynolds number, outlet flow coefficient, and pipe diameter increased. In addition, equations for calculating LU were fitted using dimensional analysis and can be used to predict LU under other conditions as well.</jats:p>",

To enhance the accuracy of the simulation, we extend data and models in previous studies in four ways. First, we identify the damage to production facilities in the disaster-hit regions more accurately by using establishment-level census and survey data and geographic information system (GIS) data on the damages caused by the GEJE and subsequent tsunami. Second, the use of establishment-level data enables us to capture supply chains between non-headquarter establishments in disaster-hit regions and establishments in other regions. Third, we incorporate the effect of power outages after the GEJE on production reduction, which exacerbated the effect of the supply chain disruption, particularly in the weeks immediately after the GEJE. Finally, our model incorporates sectoral heterogeneity by employing sector-specific parameters. Our findings indicate that the extended method can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the domestic production after the GEJE, particularly due to the first three improvements utilizing various data sources, not because of the use of more sector-specific parameters. Our method can be applied to predict the economic effect of future disasters, such as the Nankai Trough earthquake, on each region more precisely.</jats:p>"
