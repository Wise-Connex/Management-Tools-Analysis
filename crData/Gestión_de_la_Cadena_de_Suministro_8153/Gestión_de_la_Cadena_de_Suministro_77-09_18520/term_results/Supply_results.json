      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main purpose of the book is to investigate the changes in\n      the factor intensity of Korea's trade. The time span covered for the\n      analysis is 1960-1973, the period during which Korea experienced both\n      rapid capital accumulation and a prodigious expansion of manufactured\n      exports. The book contains 12 chapters in all. Following an introductory\n      note, Chapter 1 presents an overview of growth and trade in Korea. It is\n      shown that annual commodity exports of Korea, which amounted to less\n      than 100 million before 1962, increased at an average annual rate of 40%\n      during 1962-73 and were around $3200 million in 1973 and §4500 million\n      in 1974. The share of manufactured goods in total commodity exports,\n      which never exceeded the 20 percent level during 1953-61, steadily\n      increased thereafter and had reached a level of over 90 percent after\n      1970. It is further shown that in the Sixties in Korea, import\n      substitution and export expansion went concomitantly and that private\n      entrepreneures determined the allocation of resources. However, in the\n      Seventies, the government encouraged entrepreneurs to diversify exports\n      away from unskilled labour-intensive manufactures, for example, textiles\n      and ply-wood, to relatively skill intensive and moderately\n      capital-intensive manufacturing, such as the ship-building and machinery\n      industries. This was necessary if the coun¬try was to take full\n      advantage of the changing comparative costs which were becoming apparent\n      in her foreign trade.</jats:p>"

Some viruses, apparently of animal origin and noninfectious for man, were found in two of five plants processing animal products. Samples representing processing of vegetable products (two plants), intestinal infections in processing personnel (13 plants), and retail foods (a total of 60 samples purchased from five stores) gave negative results. The level of human viruses associated with the U.S. food supply is apparently below what such a survey can detect.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relevance of national accounts data to the broad development planning process which spans varying time horizons is considered. Undue emphasis on aggregated conventional macro‐economic variables and recorded monetary values may have distorted the real vision and objectives of development. At the same time, other important and measurable problems like regional and distributive imbalances have often remained unquantified in traditional planning models. The UN “Supply‐Disposition” table permits a summary description of the basic structure of an economy which can be easily extended within the context of the complete SNA to embrace significant social features without resort to complex inter‐industry relationships. The table, however, loses few of the important dynamic economic properties of a full I–O system. It retains the means of checking the consistency of both overall policy objectives as well as basic data and it enables governments to ensure the necessary equilibrium between physical resource flows and financing capacity in formulating their development plans. The system's internal logic, combined with its potential for greater relevance and flexibility and capacity for fairly rapid and regular up‐dating, makes it a most useful tool for practical planning purposes. Case studies of Zambia, Fiji and Oman are used to illustrate the fundamental concepts and underlying schematic framework of the system and its flexibility.</jats:p>",
