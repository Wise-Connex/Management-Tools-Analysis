It is at least much better than in the intra-articular portion where ruptures are seldom observed. This means that mechanical components such as friction are dominant.

The theory developed in Chapter 9 predicts that the coefficient on availability should be significant, positive, and less than unity. The test of this hypothesis is complicated by the unusual and specific data required. Indeed, the central innovative feature of the analysis is the construction of two data sets each of which permits the elasticity to be estimated. Since the data sets are independent, the results constitute a check o:n each other. Section 10.2 discusses the measurement problems and their resolution and Section 10.3 presents the results.</jats:p>",

Recall that the theory being tested is that instead of income and expenditure both being determined endogenously as functions of endowments and prices, planned income is adjusted so-as to equal exogenously constrained expenditure plus any desired change in monetary assets. However, cross-section evidence that planned cash incomes are associated with expected expenditure fails to establish the direction of causality. Evidence of a positive association could reflect expectations of exogenously constrained expenditure inducing an income adjustment (our hypothesis) or exogenous changes in income inducing changes in expenditure. We must therefore identify and test those hypotheses of the model which are causally distinguishable from the expenditure-determined income account.</jats:p>",

The model presented here is simplified in two important respects. First, the stochastic nature of shortages gives rise to extremely complex multi-period dynamics. These are finessed in the present model and it appears unlikely that any model could fully incorporate them and retain analytic tractability. A more complex modelling of stochastic dynamics which generates the same results as the present model is given in Controlled Open Economies. Secondly, the aggregative structure of the model is kept extremely simple; the alternatives to the production of cash crops, namely leisure or the production of food, are treated as a single aggregate. We assume that food is produced only for own consumption. In Tanzania during our period this is not such an unrealistic assumption as might first appear. Dar es Salaam, the major urban centre, was largely fed by means of food imports rather than purchases from peasants. Hence, net sales of food by peasants in exchange for urban-supplied consumer goods were probably modest relative to non-food cash crops. In Controlled Open Economies, we discuss disaggregation of this model and demonstrate that the results presented here are robust, generalizing to all disaggregations which preserve the key assumption.</jats:p>",

Nutrient solutions, made up so that nitrogen was the element limiting growth, were added hourly at relative addition rates between 0.04 and 0.12 d-1. This technique enabled stable seedling nitrogen concentrations and relative growth rates to be maintained during experimental periods of 40-80 days in most treatments. \n       Once steady state growth was established, allocation of dry matter to stems compared with foliage increased with ontogeny and the allometric relationship was not influenced by plant nitrogen status or genotype. In contast, the intercept of the allometric relationship between root mass and foliage mass was dependent on plant nitrogen concentration, but the slope was equal to unity at all nitrogen concentrations. \n       Our data indicate that nitrogen-induced changes in allocation of dry matter between foliage and root components, together with changes in specific leaf area, had a larger influence on seedling growth rate than did changes in net rate of carbon gain per unit leaf area.</jats:p>"

Plants were grown in solution culture with both discontinued (40 8M and 160 8M reduced to nil) and constant supply (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 8M Mg). Magnesium was depleted from old leaves when Mg supply to the roots was interrupted. However, deficiency symptoms occurred first on the young tissue under these conditions. Under constant but inadequate supply, initial deficiency symptoms occurred in old tissue. Symptoms in leaves were associated with Mg concentrations in the leaf of &lt; 1046 8g g-1 with constant root supply and 586 8g g-1 when supply was interrupted. At luxury constant supply, concentrations of Mg tended to be higher in the older leaves than in the young leaves; the reverse occurred with inadequate supply. Tissue choice for diagnosis was not critical, but the minimum Mg concentration in tissue commensurate with maximum shoot growth varied from 740 8g g-1 for the unifoliate leaf to 1310 8g g-1 in the youngest open leaf (YOL), when plants were grown under constant Mg supply. Current supply of Mg to roots was reflected more rapidly in the concentrations in young leaf than in old leaf tissue. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Six cultivars of subterranean clover were compared for growth as swards under controlled conditions in six separate experiments. Conditions common to all experiments were: 400 8mol quanta m-2 s-1 and 12 h day: 12 h night. The variable regimens were: 2 000 or 12 000 plants m-2 ('low' and 'high' density), 10 to 20�C; and no mineral N (0 mM) or N supplied as a 7.5 mM NO3- solution. Growth responses to these conditions were tested by sequential harvesting for dry matter and the fitting of linear and quadratic regression models. Special attention was given to testing for differential responses by cultivars to temperature. All cultivars except 'Woogenellup' grew about 20% faster when NO3- was supplied in the nutrient solution than when the N was derived entirely from N2 fixation under the 0mM treatment. Crop growth rate at 20�C was about double that at 10�C at low density, but at high density the rate at 20�C was 90-95% of that at 10�C. Cultivars differed significantly in growth rate but over all conditions, there was a hierarchical order from the highest to the lowest of: 'Clare', 'Woogenellup', 'Yarloop', 'Mt. Barker', 'Daliak' and 'Geraldton'. There was very little evidence of any cultivar by temperature interaction except for 'Woogenellup, which responded to a low temperature of 10�C compared with a 'high' of 20�C better than the other cultivars. The importance of seed size as a factor influencing the early growth of a subterranean clover sward was emphasized where swards established from large seeds of 'Mt. Barker' grew faster than where small seeds were used. 'Clare' was a highly productive cultivar under all growth conditions. It is concluded that the growth rates of swards of subterranean clover established at seedling densities in excess of 5000 plants m-2 are less sensitive to a low temperature of 10�C than are those established at more conventional densities.</jats:p>"

Charles Wolf has made an important start by attempting to draw parallels between market failures and the manifestations of government supply failures. This article provides a more useful analytical framework for government supply failure in two important ways. First, it draws on several perspectives from the economics of organization to sketch both normative and positive theories of government supply. Second, it uses the positive theory of government supply behavior to make direct comparisons with the traditional market failures. It concludes with some implications of the framework for assessing the potential gains from privatization.</jats:p>",

Three groups of patients were formed, in which nutritional therapy was performed following trauma of differing severity: (1) patients following moderate trauma -N-losses 10–15 g/day; (2) patients following severe trauma – N-losses 15–20 g/day; and (3) polytraumatised patients – N-losses more than 20 g/day. The data gained for the calorie and N-supplies as well as for the N-balances in each group of patients served as a basis for the calculation of regression analyses of higher order; in these the cumulative N-balance was regarded as a function of the calorie and the N-supply: NB&lt;sub&gt;cum&lt;/sub&gt; = f (C, N) Whilst for the group of polytraumatized patients only statements for a nutrient supply of about 20–30 kcal/kg BW/day and 0.2–0.3 g N/kg BW/day are possible, due to the limited data available, general statements about the different influence of calorie and N-supply can be made for nutritional therapy after moderate and major trauma; the calculated functions reveal that the N-supply influences the N-balance decisively, whereas the calorie supply exerts only a slight N-sparing effect. The mathematically calculated optimum of the N-supply after severe trauma is 0.2g/kg BW/day, corresponding to an amino acid supply of 1.25 g/kg BW/day.</jats:p>"

We compared the growth and bulk soil pH changes when four annual medic species (M. truncatula, M. littoralis, M. polymorpha and M. murex) were supplied with ammonium, nitrate or biologically fixed nitrogen. Growth and nodule number were measured for M. polymorpha grown in solution culture at constant nitrogen supply (1 mM) but variable ammonium to nitrate ratio (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 0:1). Similar measurements were also made on M. truncatula, M. polymorpha and M. murex exposed to different concentrations of nitrate (0, 0.1, 1.5, 10 mM) during nodulation. When uninoculated, all medic species grew at the same rate when given equivalent levels of inorganic nitrogen as either ammonium or nitrate. All species similarly decreased the pH of soil around their roots when supplied with ammonium, and increased pH when supplied with nitrate. Nutrient solutions were acidified when M. polymorpha was supplied with ammonium and neutralized when nitrate was supplied. However, when ammonium and nitrate were added simultaneously solutions acidified, indicating a more rapid uptake of ammonium than nitrate. Nodule number of all medic species was reduced by nitrate concentrations in solution as low as 0.1 mM. M. truncatula formed fewer nodules than M. polymorpha and M. murex at all concentrations of nitrate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of length of the flowering period on seed production characteristics of 3 cultivars of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) was determined by varying the period of watering postflowering. The subterranean clover cvv. Nungarin, Seaton Park and Woogenellup were grown in polystyrene boxes and given 1 of 4 watering treatments: continuous (WC); until approximately 34 days after flowering commenced (WE); until Nungarin finished flowering (WN); as for WE but with watering recommenced after plants became wilted (WEL). Plants were either undefoliated or were repeatedly defoliated during flowering. Flowering in all 3 cultivars was terminated early and seed yields were reduced by WE (e.g. WC v. WE for Seaton Park, 1620 � 61 v. 320 � 61 kg/ha), but each of the cultivars was able to produce appreciable numbers of viable seed on the WE treatment, ranging from 406 � 95 seeds/dm2 for Woogenellup to 791 � 95 seeds/dm2 for Seaton Park. WEL increased seed size in all cultivars by approximately 50%, and increased seed numbers in Seaton Park to 1083 � 106 seeds/dm2. Nungarin produced most seeds on the WN treatment (1232 � 104 seeds/dm2), but approximately half of these were lost if the soil was kept moist during seed maturation. In comparison, little loss of seed was detected from Seaton Park and Woogenellup under continuous watering, possibly due to differences between cultivars ii seed dormancy and periods of exposure of maturing seeds to moisture. The development of initial hard seeds in Nungarin and undefoliated Seaton Park was adversely affected by continuous moisture. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yields in all cultivars (e.g. UD v. D for Seaton Park, 1130 � 44 v. 310 � 46 kg/ha), due to decreases in both seed numbers and size. The results indicate that choice of maturity of subterranean clover cultivars for areas with unreliable spring rainfall is not necessarily restricted to those early maturing cultivars which will always finish flowering prior to moisture restrictions.</jats:p>"

The efficiency of removal of NH4-N was about 80% under complete mixing conditions and when the raw water quality did not fluctuate rapidly. Under the adverse conditions of the low water temperatures which occurred in winter and spring, the removal of NH4-N was 60 to 80%. The critical NH4-N concentration was observed to be approximately 0.01 to 0.02 mg/l, and a moderate decrease in E260 was also observed in the experiments.

When applied to the US Lake States, the model provides evidence against the Nerlovian model. It suggests that the pattern of dynamic effects of prices on cow numbers varies for different prices. The estimated dynamic supply elasticities provide some useful information on the nature of dairy production adjustments. For example, the response of milk supply to market prices is found to be very inelastic in the short run. It takes at least 7 years of sustained change to obtain an elastic response to milk price. Also, feed price and slaughter cow price are found to have smaller effects on dairy supply than milk price, but larger effects than risk, hay price or capital cost.</jats:p>",

In the present study, plants of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) were grown in solution, with increasing, decreasing and stable root supply of Mg over the range 0-160 8m. Old leaf tissue was sampled in six harvests over 21 days. The chlorophyll was extracted from the leafwith dimethyl sulfoxide. This partitioned Mg into that in either the chlorophyll or residual fibre after extraction, and that Mg unaccounted for by these fractions ('other'). The forms of Mg in leaves could be related to the Mg concentration in the leaf and were not influenced by whether the concentration in the leaf was increasing or decreasing. Chlorophyll concentration was stable at about 1% when the concentration of Mg in the leaf was greater than 776 8g g-1. Below this Mg concentration, the concentration of chlorophyll declined rapidly. The proportion of total leaf Mg in the chlorophyll ranged from 6% at 5000 8g g-1 Mg in leaf to 35% at 700 8g g-1. Magnesium associated with the residual fibre was generally 80% of the total tissue Mg, although this appeared to be about 60% when Mg concentrations in leaves were &lt; 1000 8g g-1. When the Mg concentration in the first trifoliate leaf was below 600 to 800 8g g-1, the leaf showed symptoms of Mg deficiency and became relatively heavier than non-deficient leaves.</jats:p>"

Across conditions, the number of trials per session was varied. Body weight and choice of the risky lever decreased as the number of trials per session decreased, even though body weight could only be defended by increased choice of the risky lever. In Experiment 2, trials per session were fixed, but the number of pellets delivered by the risky and riskless levers was either at the same level as in Experiment 1 or tripled from those levels. Now choice of the risky lever was inversely related to the size of reinforcement and to body weight.

The two accessions used were Naturalized, which was grown from a seed collection made from a low P soil on the Northern Tablelands of N.S.W., and cv. Ladino. Nutrient solutions were renewed when the P concentrations fell by a maximum of 10% and were pumped so that there was a flow rate of 4.4 L min-1 over the plant roots. The shoot and root fresh weight yield of Ladino was higher than Naturalized at all P levels. At 16 8mol P m-3 the shoot yield of Ladino was fourfold that of Naturalized; however, the relative yield response of Ladino between 1 and 16 8mol P m-3 was only 20% of the response of that in Naturalized. Phosphorus uptake was highest in Ladino at all P levels. The minimum shoot labile P concentrations recorded in this study were 1.1 and 2.5 8mol P g F.wt-1for Ladino and Naturalized respectively, indicating that Naturalized is capable of maintaining relatively high soluble tissue P levels under low P supply. The generally higher labile, lipid and residue P levels in new leaf, old leaf, stem and root in the Naturalized white clover accession indicate a lower efficiency of nutrient utilization in this collection compared to Ladino. In contrast to Ladino, Naturalized white clover may be able to control its P accumulation at high levels of supply, as toxic levels do not accumulate in old leaf. Ladino was the more efficient accession when P efficiency was defined as shoot yield per unit of P in solution. When P efficiency was defined as shoot or plant yield per unit of P absorbed or as the inverse of P concentration (utilization quotient), Ladino was the more efficient accession at 1 and 4 8mol P m-3, with only small differences between the accessions at 8 and 16 8mol P m-3. The results suggest that Naturalized may be adapted to low P supply through its low inherent growth rate which lowers its demand for exogenous P.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Political reforms in the socialist countries cannot be understood with the traditional demand-side theories. The property-rights structure is a crucial element in deciding the level of social demand for democracy. But the institutionalization of political pluralism can only be explained by elite strategic thinking. Typically, Leninist elites do not opt for political reforms if they can successfully restructure the economic systems without making political changes. There are two primary reasons for the regime to take steps toward political pluralism: one is to stifle the conservative opponents in the regime who are against economic reform; the other is to strike a social contract with the society to make economic reform acceptable to the population. When the elites are forced to tinker with political reforms, the single-party multicandidate model usually precedes the multiparty solution. Democratization, however, may fail to bring about economic recovery and is vulnerable to the elite's change of mind and the pressure from more orthodox Leninist regimes. </jats:p>",

Therefore, four oxygen supply methods (free surface aeration, porous Teflon tubing, perfluorocarbon addition and external aerator) were compared in terms of oxygen transfer rate for suspension culture of animal cells.

N supply rates before floret initiation affected the % fatty acid composition of mature seeds; the percentage of palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2) acids responded positively to increases in N supply whereas % stearic (18:0) and oleic (18:1) acids responded negatively. The only fatty acid to respond to N supply rates between floret initiation and anthesis was 18:0 acid. The percentage of 18:1 responded positively and that of 18:2 acid negatively to high N supply rates after anthesis Responses to single N applications at different stages of plant development in the field confirmed these findings but results were more variable than in the glasshouse. Partial or complete defoliation at anthesis in the field caused the same changes in fatty acid composition as did a low N supply after anthesis.</jats:p><jats:p>The results are difficult to interpret in terms of our current knowledge of lipid biosynthesis. N supply rates may affect the rate of hydrolysis of fatty acid complexes or their transport from the proplastid to the cytosolic compartment.

La première section porte sur les “principaux réseaux d'entraide possibles” (membres de la parenté et amis proches) qui apportent un soutien au “véritable” groupe d'entraide et qui peuvent en réalité être plus utiles en offrant un support moral et en facilitant l'accès aux services organisés. Les sections 2 et 3 traitent de l'assistance donnée et reçue par les canadiens d'âge mûr et présentent les différences attribuées au sexe, à l'âge, à l'état de santé donné, aux conditions de vie et au niveau d'éducation. Les conclusions confirment les études de recherches et les expériences dans le domaine. À l'âge de 70 ans, on observe une diminution de l'aide donnée, tandis qu'au-delà de 80, on remarque une nette augmentation de l'aide reçue. Cette aide provient en majeure partie de simples réseaux d'entraide. Le livre sert remarquablement bien d'introduction au General Social Survey de 1985 et il servira tant aux chercheurs qu'aux praticiens.</jats:p>"
