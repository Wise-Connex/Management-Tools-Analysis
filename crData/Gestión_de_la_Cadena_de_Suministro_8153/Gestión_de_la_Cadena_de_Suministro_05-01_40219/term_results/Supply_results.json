      "abstract": "<jats:p>Both academically and practically, one of the most interesting aspects of supply chains is their intrinsic dynamic behavior. Dynamic interactions can cause unexpected and undesirable results. There are both external and internal reasons for this. Externally, severely competitive environments, consumer behavior and technological innovations are major concerns for supply-chain management. These affect both the structure and behavior of the supply chain and force it to be more flexible and agile. Internally, the supply chain is a multi-echelon system composed of a scratched-together and shifting set of players whose preferences and intentions often differ. This may create and amplify the information distortions, lags, and tricks of business within the supply chain. The combined effects of these external and internal factors make Supply Chain Dynamics (SCD) active and complex. In this chapter, we discuss the influences, mechanisms, and effects of SCD.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of this chapter is to propose a framework for the dynamics of supply chains from a life cycles point of view. It is inevitable for supply chains to be affected by the life cycles of the product. There are three important interrelated life cycles that have effects on the dynamics of supply chains and are associated with the product. These are: (i) the innovation (Abernathy &amp; Clark, 1983), (ii) the market (Kotler, 1999), and (iii) the location (Vernon, 1966). The first life cycle related to the innovation illustrates how the product and production process progress. It gives us a hint to consider the feasibility of the location dependent on the degree of innovativeness of the product. The second one related to the market clarifies the marketing objectives in each stage. It suggests the reasonable location strategy. The last one related to the location proposes the relation between the product and the reasonable location of the manufacturing facilities. It is operational because it considers the timing and the reason to shift the manufacturing facilities. In this chapter, we discuss the mission and structure of the supply chain in the different stages of these life cycles. We illustrate the proposed framework using the case of the VCR.</jats:p>"

Moreover, we could show that the objective function of the approximated problem converged to that of the original problem as Tf ® ¥. Several examples have been solved to illustrate the efficiency of our method. In these examples, some important results relating the production rate to demand rate have been developed.</jats:p>"

We will show in this chapter that order variability from a buyer is also affected by the payment terms offered by the supplier. We develop mathematical models to accommodate different payment terms into the lot sizing techniques. The models are then simulated under uncertain demand situations over a range of parameter values. The results suggest that payment terms have substantial impacts on order variability passed by a supply chain channel onto its upstream channel.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Genetic algorithms have been applied in solving various types of large-scale, NP-hard optimization problems. Many researchers have been investigating its global convergence properties using Schema Theory, Markov Chain, etc. A more realistic approach, however, is to estimate the probability of success in finding the global optimal solution within a prescribed number of generations under some function landscapes. Further investigation reveals that its inherent weaknesses that affect its performance can be remedied, while its efficiency can be significantly enhanced through the design of an adaptive scheme that integrates the crossover, mutation and selection operations. The advance of Information Technology and the extensive corporate globalization create great challenges for the solution of modern supply chain models that become more and more complex and size formidable. Meta-heuristic methods have to be employed to obtain near optimal solutions. Recently, a genetic algorithm has been reported to solve these problems satisfactorily and there are reasons for this.</jats:p>"

Second, with an eye toward information that may be useful for supply chain planners, we detail the motivation for global integration of the supply chain. Our third aim is to address global supply-chain issues that may be at odds with cost-minimizing strategies. Specifically, in this time of political debate regarding trade legislation, these issues involve the consideration of country of origin when sourcing, and the disparate demands of customers when marketing. A country offering inexpensive components may be associated with poor quality. Thus, despite inexpensive inputs, the overall profitability of the supply chain may suffer as perceived quality deteriorates. Similarly, a largely standardized product across multiple markets may present the lowest cost alternative from a production standpoint, but a high degree of standardization may reduce the attractiveness of the product in the eyes of the end consumer, and reduce overall profitability.</jats:p>"

Linear programming models based on ideas from Data Envelopment Analysis have been developed for maximizing the throughput of serial input-output processes in which one or more outputs of an upstream process become inputs to a successor process. We consider their adaptation to supply chain monitoring. We also propose some additional research needs in this area.</jats:p>"

The synchronisation is achieved by scheduling the actual ordering days of the buyers and co-ordinating it with the vendor’s production cycle whilst allowing the buyers to choose their own lot sizes and order cycle. A mathematical model for our proposed co-ordination is developed and analysed. Our results show that the synchronised cycles policy works better than independent optimisation or restricting buyers to adopt a common order cycle. Some illustrative examples demonstrate that there are circumstances where both the vendor and the buyers gain from such synchronisation without the need for price and quantity discount incentives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order for economically viable distributed generation systems for local community to spread, it is essential to develop an efficient and low-cost heat supply system. We propose a new heat supply system called DREAMS (Distributed Residential Energy with Advanced Management System). The key technology for the system is to connect compact heat supply units installed in all the households of the local community, such as a condominium, by a single loop of hot water piping. Two methods to decrease the heat supply rate through the single loop are proposed in this paper. The one is an utilization of a compact heat supply unit with heat storage in each house. The momentary heat demand can be covered by the heat storage. The other is a tap water preheating. A new CO2 regenerative heat pump cycle was proposed for the recover of the low temperature heat from the generator. A new heat supply unit with a practical capacity was manufactured, and the heat supply performance was evaluated by some experiments. Furthermore, an advanced energy management system has been under consideration to realize the effective system operation by utilizing IT. In this paper, experimental results on the performance of the new heat supply unit, the new CO2 heat pump system and evaluation of the energy-saving effect of our DREAMS are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sheep meat eating quality research program has identified a number of outcomes and critical control points in the supply chain from live sheep genetics to cooked meat. The critical control points, which are largely independent of each other, can be translated into quality management systems to increase average eating quality of all cuts and lower variability. The choice of sire was a critical control point in that selecting for high growth rate and muscling can adversely affect eating quality. The challenge is to make sure that high yield traits are not promoted at the expense of eating quality. Animal age was a critical control point but it was clear that the definition of hogget could be revised to include slightly older animals with teeth in eruption but not in wear. Moreover, M. longissumus dorsi from older animals had only slightly lower eating quality than that from lamb such that this cut could be positioned as a premium product at all maturities, complementing the universally tender muscle psoas major. There was no doubt, however, that over all muscles, lamb remained the premium product. The critical control point for nutrition is that it be adequate, typically to ensure growth of at least 50 g/animal.day. Meat quality is improved through higher glycogen concentrations in muscles at slaughter, higher intramuscular fat content, and possibly reduced collagen crosslinking. Critical control points between muster and slaughter are more difficult to define but are generally aimed at stress reduction to minimise occurrence of the high ultimate pH condition. They include avoiding temperature extremes, loud noises and use of dogs, implementation of good lairage design and the use of skilled animal handlers. Stress is best monitored by ultimate pH measurements in abattoirs, rather than at remote points down the supply chain. After slaughter, the use of electrical stimulation to accelerate post mortem glycolysis is a critical control point. Its use is indicated where 2 conditions are simultaneously met: carcasses are Achilles-hung throughout processing, and the meat is destined for early consumption, as would normally be the case for the domestic market. By accelerating glycolysis, the temperature at rigor can be optimised for rapid tenderisation of low-connective tissue muscles through ageing. The alternative to electrical stimulation of these muscles for the local market is Tenderstretch hanging where rapid ageing is less temperature dependent. Where electrical stimulation is applied the monitoring of its effects with a temperature probe and a pH metre is a critical control point. Even where stimulation is not applied, measurement of average muscle temperature and pH is useful for defining any process. This is because the first 24 h after slaughter sets the scene for later meat storage/distribution, which has its own critical control point: the temperature at which meat is held between abattoir and consumption. Where meat is destined for early sale, the temperature of processing and storage can and should be higher than where the meat is destined for long-term storage as in export markets. For early sale, rapid ageing to optimum eating quality is promoted by higher temperature (2–4°C), whereas for export sale, very cool meat will slowly age in the weeks before consumption while at the same time minimising spoilage and maximising display life. Thus, matching the time–temperature profile of processing and storage to a particular market is a critical control point. The retail end of the supply chain has its own control points, principally display temperature and choice of display packaging, which have major effects on chilled display life. The cooler the better. Compared with conventional overwrap packs, modified atmosphere packs extend display life by typically 80%. However, these more sophisticated packs cost more and will not suit all domestic retailers. The matching of muscles by age with recommended cooking method is a critical control point at retail for ensuring consumer satisfaction. The challenge is effective communication with consumers and is part of the wider challenge of effectively communicating quality-related information at all links of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is a fairly new creature and one that has evolved out of a variety of different enterprise functions over the past two decades. Traditionally, the majority of activities within supply chain management were related to the physical transport of goods from one point to another. Today, we understand supply chain management to include a broader range of activities such as demand planning, purchasing, warehousing, and transportation at the very least. Many authors will also throw production, product, and package design as well as marketing into the definition (Dornier et al., 1998; Schary &amp; Skjøtt-Larsen, 2001; Taylor, 1997; Gourdin, 2001). For the context of this article, we refer to supply chain management as activities that are related to the planning and fulfillment of market demand. All of the activities within supply chain management can be performed by one or more than one legal entity. We further understand supply chain management as a business process rather than a function or department within a given company. Figure 1 below illustrates the set of core and potential activities as well as supporting ones such as process, performance, and information management. </jats:p>"

It is mainly applied in multiple-actuator hydraulic systems, and installed between hydraulic pump and actuators (one switchmode hydraulic power supply for one actuator). It can provide pressure or flow rate that is adapted to the consumption of each actuator in the system by boosting or bucking the pressure, with low power loss, and conveniently, through high-speed switch valves, just like a hydraulic pressure transformer. There are two basic types of switchmode hydraulic power supply: pressure boost and pressure buck. Their structures and working principles are introduced. The dynamic characteristics of two typical types of switchmode hydraulic power supply, the pressure boost type and the pressure buck type, were analyzed through simulations and experiments. The performances were evaluated, and improvements on the efficiency of switchmode hydraulic power supply were proposed.</jats:p>",

Vendor competitiveness demands an agile deployment process for ERP software while offering increased functionality. User competitiveness depends on obtaining optimal benefits from ERP while not sacrificing competitive agility. This research shows that as deployability of SAP software becomes more agile, using organizations experience increased business agility. In addition to agile ERP deployment, the importance of process understanding and targeted agility impacts are shown to influence user SAP outcomes.</jats:p>"

However, the AIDS epidemic did reveal significant flaws and weaknesses in our delivery of a safe blood supply, unfortunately with some devastating ramifications. Since that time, public tolerance of adverse events following receipt of infectious donations is very low.

In this paper, the impact of the water loop temperature on operating energy cost is investigated for different types of buildings under different loads using theoretical models. The theoretical models and approaches are also applied to an 80,000 square feet office building to determine the building heating and cooling load, optimal supply water temperature, and potential energy cost savings based on measured supply water temperature and loop heat gain. It is concluded that the optimal supply water temperature control can significantly reduce the annual energy costs associated with compressor power and boiler energy. The potential energy savings is determined to be 24% in the application building.</jats:p>",

Then the concepts, techniques, and tools that may contribute to the successful implementation of EC are surveyed. Finally, a self-diagnosis tool is presented to initiate the re-engineering process. The self-diagnosis tool details the company’s profile in view of an EC implementation and identifies the operational activities that need to be reviewed, upgraded, integrated or outsourced.</jats:p>"

It summarizes the most important concepts of supply chain management. Both technological changes and organizational improvements are essential for effective integration of supply chains. Therefore the paper shows how business process modelling can be used to analyze the existing processes and help in renovation and integration of those processes, with a special emphasis on an inter-organizational level. It is shown on a practical example, how sharing and strategic utilization of information in a supply chain can radically improve execution of vital business processes and help integrate processes in different companies. That leads to shorter cycle times, lower costs and inventory levels and better quality for the final customer.</jats:p>"

This chapter examines various types of SCM IS — from traditional EDI systems to more recent Web-services-based e-business applications. It argues that the approach best suited for an organization depends in part on the degree of integration between the partners, the complexity of the business processes, and the number of partners involved. A model is presented for analyzing the costs and benefits that can be expected from each type of SCM IS. The model enables researchers and practitioners to better understand the differences among SCM IS and thus can help reduce the risks of implementing these valuable yet complex information systems.</jats:p>"

In traditional supply chain management, business processes are disconnected from stock control and, as a result, inventory is the direct output of incomplete information. The focus of contemporary supply chain management is to organize, plan, and implement these flows. First, at the organizational level, products are manufactured, transported, and stored based on the customers’ needs. Second, planning and control of component production, storage, and transport are managed using central supply management and replenished through centralized procurement. Third, the implementation of the supply chain involves the entire cycle from the order-entry process to order fulfillment and delivery. Data mining can create a better match between supply and demand, reducing or sometimes even eliminating the stocks. </jats:p>"

In this method, they are determined together with maximum contract demands of utilities such as electricity and natural gas so as to minimize the annual total cost in consideration of system’s annual operational strategies corresponding to seasonal and hourly energy demand requirements during every evaluation year considered. A numerical study is carried out for an office building with a total floor area of 15 000m2, where the system is consisted of an electric refrigerator and a steam boiler. Through the numerical calculation, the influence of the following items are clarified on the optimal renewing year and selection of renewing equipment of the system by the parametric study; (a) upgrading technology of the equipment in the future; (b) initial capital cost of equipment; (c) renewing construction cost and trade-in value rate; and (d) interest rate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we study competition in multiechelon supply chains with an assembly structure. Firms in the supply chain are grouped into homogenous sectors (nodes) that contain identical firms with identical production capabilities that all produce exactly one undifferentiated product (that may itself be a “kit” of components). Each sector may use several inputs to produce its product, and these inputs are supplied by different sectors. The production process within any sector is taken to be pure assembly in fixed proportions. The number of firms in each sector is known. The demand curve for the final product is assumed to be linear, as are production costs in all sectors. Competition is modeled via a “coordinated successive Cournot” model in which firms choose production quantities for their downstream market so as to maximize profits, given prices for all inputs and all complementary products. Production quantities for sectors supplying the same successor are coordinated through pricing mechanisms, so that complementary products are produced in the right proportions. Under these assumptions, equilibrium prices for any multiechelon assembly network are characterized by a system of linear equations. We derive closed-form expressions for equilibrium quantities and prices in any two-stage system (i.e., a system with multiple input sectors and a single assembly sector). We show that any assembly structure can be converted to an equivalent (larger) structure in which no more than two components are assembled at any node. Finally, large structures can be solved either by direct solution of the characteristic linear equations or through an iterative reduction (compression) to smaller structures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In different industries, such as automobiles, chemicals, or retailing, competitors are joining forces in establishing electronic marketplaces to reduce inefficiencies in the purchasing process and cut costs by combining their buying power. Joining such an alliance leads to reduced costs, including those of possible rivals, because members share the development and operating costs. A company that joins an alliance agrees to share its suppliers with others, which may lead to more intense competition among the increased number of suppliers, and it may further benefit an alliance member at the expense of companies left outside the alliance. Natural questions that could arise, then, are when would a firm prefer to take part in an electronic marketplace joint venture; when would it prefer that other firms, possibly rivals, join the venture; and what are the financial consequences of either joining an alliance or remaining independent? In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the issues, we have developed a model of three retailers whose products may have a certain degree of substitutability. We provide some conditions, in terms of product substitutability and compatibility of retailers, that would lead to the formation of a three-member alliance, or a two-member alliance, or no alliance at all. We also study the effect of alliance structure and compatibility of retailers on the profit of a company. </jats:p>",

Engine manufacturers should focus on these companies when optimising their supply chain. The tool factory simulation with an attached economic evaluation tool is able to contribute to this supply chain optimization. It is presented and discussed on the basis of a titanium supply chain optimization from the view of an engine OEM. Two examples show the ability of this approach to predict the impact of future scenarios. Opportunities and weaknesses of this approach are discussed as well as ways and possibilities to bring a forging factory as well as the supply chain closer to optimal performance are evaluated and explained.</jats:p>",

Despite the fact that ICT is the determining element in SCM automation and rationalization, practical use of ICT in SCM is in its starting rather than progressive phase. The present philosophy of logistics is characterized as coordinated cooperation between companies in supply chains, through which it is possible to achieve higher productivity than in any other way. These cooperation activities represent a typical content of logistical centers, which provide a wide range of services for their clients. This chapter focuses on designing a multi-integral logistical center and analyzing it from the aspect of its effectiveness. Also, other aspects, such as the impact of ICT on the development of virtual logistical centers and the development stages of SCM are presented. Moreover, the chapter outlines pitfalls of this development trend in an effort to provide practitioners in SCM with a more complex view of this issue.</jats:p>"

Also discussed are the results of an application of the methodology to estimate stover supply from continuous maize rotation and three tillage practices (conventional, reduced/mulch, and no-till) by soil type for the 10 largest maize producing states in the USA. This analysis indicates that up to 98 million dt of stover (equivalent to 1.37 quads of primary energy or 1.5% of US current use) could be collected at costs less than $35/dt and 35 million dt (0.49 quads) could be collected at costs of less than $20/dt. Farmer premiums, transportation and storage costs are not included and could add an additional $10/dt to $40/dt to the cost of the stover.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this paper is to point out existing risks of current design and management strategies in water supply systems and to identify possible ways of designing and operating schemes which minimize these risks. This paper is motivated by the observation that existing design principles and engineering rules (best practice) seem to cope insufficiently or even conflict with current trends of declining water demand. In order to evaluate this situation, an agent-based model comprising the current rules of best practice was developed in a participatory process. Once the model was validated with data sets from a real utility, multiple-scenario testing was used to explore different design strategies, thus allowing ideas for developing alternative management and design schemes to be generated. The simulations show that the traditional risk of insufficient supply security must be supplemented by considering the opposite risk of excessive security (over-capacity). The introduction of demand-side measures may help to calibrate existing best practice with the trends of the current operating environment. Ideas are brought forward on how to shape incentive systems for stakeholders in order to facilitate such a shift.</jats:p>",

In this chapter, a model that shows the effects of eSCD on the customization capability of companies was developed. From previous studies, the model identifies three major effects of eSCD—electronic linkage effect, supply chain coordination effect, and co-engineering effect. The model also shows a process through which an electronic supply chain network is transformed from a simple infrastructure for data exchange into a knowledge-sharing network for fast response and customization. The model was tested using the data collected from the automobile industry in Korea. It was shown that eSCD has significant effects on the supply chain coordination and co-engineering. It was also shown that eSCD affects the customization capability.</jats:p>"

However, it is not easy for people to accept this fundamental aspect especially when it comes to the Internet and technologies’ growing importance in business operations. They claim it’s a temporary trend that will leave little visible change in the way business is conducted. For these businessmen, the philosophy seems to be “keep making better products and offering new services, and the customers will keep buying”. They ignore changes occurring in the buying habits of customers and impact of technology. There are some businesses who are happy to follow the leader and adopt tools like supply chain management. Supply chain management is a recognized discipline to shorten cycle times, reduce inventories, decrease logistics costs and streamline communication process across the business network. On the other hand are the businessmen who understand the learning organization concept and develop a forward orientation. They are prepared to ride the technology wave to new heights and accomplishments by using technology as a defining element in business operations. This chapter suggests a new approach to this new breed of entrepreneurs. In this chapter, we are trying to give supply chain management a customer orientation and to study its results. We highlight the synergistic advantage of linking supply chain management with customer relationship management into a tightly knit network using technology. The main focus is on finding a solution to deal with Internet empowered customers and to learn how to apply technologies demanded in the new digital economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In recent years, business rule management has become an important component of enterprise information systems. Business rules represent guidelines about how an enterprise should conduct its business and provide better service for customers. Business rules are being widely deployed in supply chains to support real-time decision making. The research reported in this paper is aimed at designing a dynamically adaptable data-sourcing service for deploying business rules effectively in supply chain management. Such a data-sourcing service is important since execution of business rules requires data to be retrieved from various data sources spread across the enterprise, including the enterprise data warehouse. We propose a semantics-based approach to implement the data-sourcing service for business rules. Our approach captures semantics of business rules and provides an agent-enabled mechanism that dynamically maps business rules to the enterprise data model. A prototype system is implemented to illustrate our sourcing service and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We use anticipated changes in tax rates associated with changes in family composition to estimate intertemporal labor supply elasticities and elasticities of taxable income with respect to the net-of-tax wage rate. A number of provisions of the tax code are tied explicitly to child age and dependent status. Changes in the ages of children can thus affect marginal tax rates through phase-in or phase-out provisions of tax credits or by shifting individuals across tax brackets. We identify the response of labor and income to these tax changes by comparing families who experienced a tax rate change to families who had a similar change in dependents but no resulting tax rate change. A primary advantage of our approach is that the changes are anticipated and therefore should not cause re-evaluations of lifetime income. The estimates of substitution effects should consequently not be confounded by life-cycle income effects. The empirical design also allows us to compare similar families and can be used to estimate elasticities across the income distribution. In particular, we provide estimates for low and middle income families. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate an intertemporal elasticity of family labor earnings close to one for families earning between $30,000 and $75,000. Our estimates for families in the EITC phase-out range are lower but still substantial. Estimates from the IRS-NBER individual tax panel are consistent with the SIPP estimates. Tests using alternate control groups and simulated \"\"placebo\"\" tax schedules support our identifying assumptions. The high-end estimates suggest substantial efficiency costs of taxation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, SONGS, Unit 3 experienced substantial turbine damage in early 2001 after the turbine bearings lubrication oil supply failed. During a loss of off-site power incident, power was lost to the two AC powered turbine lubrication oil pumps due to a breaker failure in the switchgear and the DC powered emergency bearing lubricating oil pump failed to start due to a breaker trip. The SONGS turbine generators have no shaft driven bearing lubricating oil pumps and consequently the turbine generator coasted down from full speed to a full stop without lubricating oil. This resulted in significant bearing, journal and steam path damage that required a four-month duration repair outage during a time period where electricity was in short supply in the State of California. The generator hydrogen sealing system remained operable during this event, however it was discovered during the event follow up investigation that this system had vulnerabilities to failure similar to the bearing lubrication system. In order to prevent a reoccurrence of this extremely costly event, SONGS has taken actions to modify both of these critical turbine generator systems by adding additional, continuously operating pumps with new, independent power source and independently routed cables. The main challenge was to integrate the additional equipment into the existing lubrication and seal oil systems. The SONGS approach and findings are discussed as well as a summary of the work performed. This technical paper will be of interest to utilities with a need to improve turbine generator reliability issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under a revenue-sharing contract, a retailer pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased, plus a percentage of the revenue the retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the videocassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer's purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or outright sales. Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i.e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain's profit. We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e.g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that revenue sharing is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case. Revenue sharing also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing in quantities, e.g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several limitations of revenue sharing to (at least partially) explain why it is not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in which revenue sharing provides only a small improvement over the administratively cheaper wholesale price contract. Additionally, revenue sharing does not coordinate a supply chain with demand that depends on costly retail effort. We develop a variation on revenue sharing for this setting.</jats:p>",

The technologies used for the system design are already available in the market and, at least for the standard solutions, sufficiently mature. The innovation consists of an integration, optimization and industrialization of this modular system, which is an electric zero emissions generator, giving as output power 3,5 kWp. This is the only system able to produce its own fuel, guaranteeing renewable and clean energy, available where and when you want. This system is constituted of a polymer membrane electrolyser, a metal hydride tank, that absorbs and desorbs hydrogen, and a polymer fuel cell. The system modularity can satisfy also greater energy requirements and the hydrogen storage by metal hydride at low pressure guarantees the system safety.</jats:p>",

As more executives adopt environmental practices, supply chain strategies will only increase in importance. In this paper, we review how companies develop environmental supply chain strategies. Our interviews with companies from The United States, The United Kingdom, Japan and Korea, along with prior research, are used to develop a framework for environmental supply chain strategy decision‐making. We then use this framework to suggest guidelines for how companies might change their current supply chain practices to successfully integrate environmental issues into their supply chain strategy.

Laws, decrees, norms, and/or regulations covering most of these aspects of blood transfusion exist in 16 of the 17 countries in Latin America that are the subject of this review. In 17 countries, there is an information system that, although still incomplete (there are no official reports on adverse events and incidents), allows us to establish progress made on the status of the blood supply since 1993. Most advances originated in increased screening coverage for infectious diseases and better quality assurance. However, in 2001 to 2002, tainted blood may have caused infections in 12 of the 17 countries; no country reached the number of donors considered adequate, i.e., 5% of the population, to avoid blood shortages, or decreased significantly the number of blood banks, although larger blood banks are more efficient and take advantage of economies of scale. In those years, paid donors still existed in four countries and replacement donors made up &gt;75% of the blood donors in another eight countries. In addition, countries did not report the number of voluntary donors who were repeat donors, i.e., the healthiest category. In spite of progress made, more improvements are needed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Barriers for these include the pricepaid for excess power—defined by law—and the uncertainty of gasprices and supply—determined by the market. Because power sectorreform definitions remain uncertain, diminishing investment in infra-structure, improvements in the cost of small generation, the need fordistributed generation, the activism of industry and environmentalgroups and a changing political environment in México are giving higherweight to cogeneration and self-supply as part of the power generationportfolio.

The authors’ past research relying on cross-state variation in SSI benefits found evidence of negative labor supply effects. However, a reliance on cross-state variation implied less than ideal control samples. In contrast, this article uses CPS data covering a twenty-two-year period, which permits identifying the effects of SSI from within-state, time-series variation in SSI benefits, using a better control sample. The evidence points consistently to negative effects of more generous SSI payments on the labor supply of likely SSI participants aged sixty-two to sixty-four. For those with a high probability of SSI participation, the implied elasticities of employment and hours with respect to benefits are generally in the range of -0.2 to -0.3. </jats:p>",

This paper is concerned with the second category of risks, which may arise from natural disasters, from strikes and economic disruptions, and from acts of purposeful agents, including terrorists. The paper provides a conceptual framework that reflects the joint activities of risk assessment and risk mitigation that are fundamental to disruption risk management in supply chains. We then consider empirical results from a rich data set covering the period 1995–2000 on accidents in the U. S. Chemical Industry. Based on these results and other literature, we discuss the implications for the design of management systems intended to cope with supply chain disruption risks. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we model a manufacturer that contracts with two retailers, who then choose retail prices and stocking quantities endogenously in a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. If the manufacturer designs a contract that is accepted by both retailers, it sets the wholesale price as a compromise between two conflicting roles: reducing intrabrand retail price competition and inducing retailers to stock closer to first-best levels (that is, optimum for the supply chain as a whole). In equilibrium, fill rates are less than first best. If, on the other hand, the manufacturer eliminates retail competition by designing a contract accepted by only one retailer, the assignment of consumers to retailers is inefficient. In either equilibrium, the performance of the supply chain is strictly less than first best. However, the manufacturer achieves first-best retail prices and fill rates if it can subsidize the retailers' leftover inventory. Absent such subsidies, the two-retailer equilibrium arises when the two retailers compete less intensively. In that equilibrium, numerical results indicate that the value of subsidizing unsold inventory is increasing in demand uncertainty, intensity of retail competition, and salvage value of inventory, and is decreasing in manufacturing cost and opportunity cost of shelf space. </jats:p>",

The engine startup profiles of the core speed (N2) and the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) collected with high speed sampling rate are extracted and processed into a more compact data set. The fuzzy clustering method is applied to the smaller number of parameters and the fault is detected by differentiating the clusters matching the failures. In this work, the actual flight data collected in the field is used to develop and validate the system, and the results are shown for the test on nine engines that experienced fuel supply system failure. The developed fault diagnosis system detects the failure successfully for all nine cases.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gas journal bearings are very sensitive to the hydrodynamic instability known as subsynchronous whirl motion, especially when they are unloaded. The wave bearing concept can improve the bearing stability, meaning that the wave bearing can run stably up to higher speeds than the plain bearing. In addition, when whirling motion occurs due to the fluid film instability, the orbit of this motion can be contained within the bearing clearance. Another step ahead for improving bearing stability is to pressurize the bearing. Tests were conducted to verify the threshold of subsynchronous whirl motion of bearings with a 35 mm diameter and 30 mm length. Pressurized air is admitted to the bearings through inherent compensated holes located in two planes along the bearing length. Various numbers of holes and diameters were used. The tests were conducted at speeds up to 30,000 rpm and the supply pressure was varied from zero to 0.14 MPa. The pressure was measured within a 2% precision. Two values for the wave amplitude to bearing clearance ratio were used. Pressurizing the bearing with 0.14 MPa can make the bearing run stably up to a speed of 20,000 rpm, unlike an unpressurized bearing that can experience subsynchronous motion at speeds less than 1,000 rpm. It was found that the supply pressure has a strong stabilizing effect. As a general rule, a 10% change of the value of the supply pressure can modify the stability threshold speed with more than 1000 rpm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we analyze the impact of supply-side externalities existing among downstream retailers on supply chain performance. Namely, multiple retail firms face stochastic demand, purchase the product from the upstream wholesaler, and make stocking decisions that affect all other retailers in the same echelon. Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization and the other is externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory understocking at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities. </jats:p><jats:p> We show that the effect of externalities depends critically on whether the stocking decisions of retailers exhibit positive (complementarity) or negative (substitutability) externalities, and whether retailers are managed centrally or competitively. Under complementarity, competing retailers tend to understock the product (compared with the centralized inventory management at the retail level), thus aggravating the double-marginalization effect. This is the opposite of what happens under substitutability, where competing retailers tend to overstock the product, thus compensating for the double-marginalization effect. Hence, we conclude that supply chain coordination between retailers and the wholesaler is most important when there is downstream competition that exhibits complementarity. From the wholesaler's point of view, competition among retailers is preferable over centralization of retailers when externalities are negative, and vice versa when externalities are positive. Moreover, with competition on complements, both retailers and the wholesaler have incentives to coordinate the supply chain. </jats:p>",

There have been many new ideas and concepts in business management over the last thirty or so years, some of which have endured and others discarded. However, perhaps one of the most significant principles to become widely adopted and practiced is that of just in time, or JIT. It is a philosophy as much, as it is a technique; it is based upon the simple idea that wherever possible no activity should take place in the system until there is a need for it.&#x0D;\nWith increasing pressures on profits, due to the launch of several new models, with marginal differences in prices, Indian Automotive companies would do well to move towards JIT purchasing systems. Given the extent and variety of constraints and the existing purchasing mindset in Indian Automotive industry, it'will take some more time to understand and practice the technique.&#x0D;\nThis paper attempts to understand the possibilities of implementing JIT technique in the Indian automotive industry. This will help the automotive component manufacturers to effectively formulate their marketing strategies to create value to their OEM customers. It also helps the vehicle manufacturers to be competitive in the end market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Measuring the success of Alternative Development (AD) programs by the number of illicit crop hectares eradicated puts AD in an undesirable competition with aerial fumigation, which can reduce these areas in a much shorter time. Whereas AD can only obtain results over the long term, the political push to demonstrate immediate successful results has led to an imbalance in United States anti-drug aid, which is strongly weighted towards aerial fumigation. Despite the short-term success of aerial spraying, the key question of the political, social, and economic sustainability of the results obtained through the use of forceful eradication remains open. AD policies have suffered from changes in their focus over time. Today they are fixated on the idea that the sole purpose of illicit crops is to finance terrorist groups. This conception of the policy issue results in the use of force – specifically, aerial fumigations using chemicals – as the foundation for decision making. This single criterion, therefore, affects programs that once recognized the social and economic roots of the problem of illicit crops. This paper seeks to examine and question those aspects of the current strategy and to explore alternative strategies of eradication that take into account who makes decisions in this matter and on whose behalf said alternatives establish oversight for the ongoing advancement in drug policy. </jats:p>",

The sag compensation circuit consists of compensation units connected in series. Each compensation unit consists of capacitances, diodes, and semiconductor switches. The capacitances of each unit are charged with different voltages by 2<jats:sup><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sup>(<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>,2<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>,4<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>,…). The compensation voltage, which has 2<jats:sup><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sup>−1 steps, is generated by switching the semiconductor switches of each unit in a binary sequence. Using this method, compensation voltage waveforms up to 6.2 kV with 31 steps can be obtained with five compensation units. The sag compensation circuit has been adapted to a direct switch‐type pulsed power supply, which generates 7 kV pulsed voltage with a pulse width of 700µs, thus realizing sag compensation. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider the problem of managing demand risk in tactical supply chain planning for a particular global consumer electronics company. The company follows a deterministic replenishment‐and‐planning process despite considerable demand uncertainty. As a possible way to formally address uncertainty, we provide two risk measures, “demand‐at‐risk” (DaR) and “inventory‐at‐risk” (IaR) and two linear programming models to help manage demand uncertainty. The first model is deterministic and can be used to allocate the replenishment schedule from the plants among the customers as per the existing process. The other model is stochastic and can be used to determine the “ideal” replenishment request from the plants under demand uncertainty. The gap between the output of the two models as regards requested replenishment and the values of the risk measures can be used by the company to reallocate capacity among different products and to thus manage demand/inventory risk. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            Modern and ancient euxinic sediments are often enriched in iron that is highly reactive towards dissolved sulphide, compared to continental margin and deep-sea sediments. It is proposed that iron enrichment results from the mobilization of dissolved iron from anoxic porewaters into overlying seawater, followed by transport into deep-basin environments, precipitation as iron sulphides, and deposition into sediments. A diagenetic model shows that diffusive iron fluxes are controlled mainly by porewater dissolved iron concentrations, the thickness of the surface oxygenated layer of sediment and to a lesser extent by pH and temperature. Under typical diagenetic conditions (pH &lt; 8, porewater Fe\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            = 10\n            <jats:sup>−6</jats:sup>\n            g cm\n            <jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>\n            ) iron can diffuse from the porewaters in continental margin sediments to the oxygenated overlying seawater at fluxes of 100–1000 μg cm\n            <jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>\n            a\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            . The addition of reactive iron to deep-basin sediments is determined by the magnitude of this diffusive flux, the export efficiency (ɛ) of recycled iron from the shelf, the ratio of source area (\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            ) to basin sink area (\n            <jats:italic>B</jats:italic>\n            ) and the trapping of reactive iron in the deep basin. Values of ɛ are poorly constrained but modern enclosed or semi-enclosed sedimentary basins show a wide variation in\n            <jats:italic>S/B</jats:italic>\n            ratios (0.25–13) where the shelf source area is defined as sediments at less than 200 m water depth. Diffusive fluxes in the range 100–1000 μg cm\n            <jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>\n            a\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            are able to produce the observed reactive iron enrichments in the Black Sea, the Cariaco Basin and the Gotland Deep for values of ɛ ×\n            <jats:italic>S/B</jats:italic>\n            from 0.1–5. Transported reactive iron can be trapped physically and/or chemically in deep basins. Physical trapping is controlled by basin geometry and chemical capture by the presence of euxinic bottom water. The\n            <jats:italic>S/B</jats:italic>\n            ratios in modern basins may not be representative of those in ancient euxinic/semi-euxinic sediments but preliminary data suggest that ɛ ×\n            <jats:italic>S/B</jats:italic>\n            in ancient euxinic sediments has a similar range as in modern euxinic sediments.\n          </jats:p>",

We develop simulation‐based rolling schedule procedures that link the replenishment processes of the channel members and apply them in an experimental analysis to study manual, semi‐automated, and fully automated e‐replenishment strategies in decentralized and coordinated decision‐making supply chain structures. The average operational cost reductions for moving from a manual‐based system to a fully automated system are 19.6, 29.5, and 12.5%, respectively, for traditional decentralized, decentralized with information sharing, and coordinated supply chain structures. The savings are neither equally distributed among participants, nor consistent across supply chain structures. As expected, for the fully coordinated system, total costs monotonically decrease with higher levels of automation. However, for the two decentralized structures, under which most firms operate today, counter‐intuitive findings reveal that the unilateral application of e‐procurement technology by the buyer may lower his purchasing costs, but increase the seller's and system's costs. The exact nature of the relationship is determined by the channel's operational flexibility. Broader results indicate that while the potential economic benefit of e‐replenishment in a decentralized system is substantial, greater operational improvements maybe possible through supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

The supply function is modeled with a local linear trend and a strictly exogenous autoregressive distributed lag price. The seasonality in the data is adjusted by a structural time‐series model. In the 1970–1997 period, there were major dairy policy changes in Japan: a production adjustment, related penalties, and two‐tier pricing. Hokkaido is the region that mainly provides the supply of raw milk for milk products, while Tofuken is the region that mainly produces drinking milk. The estimated price elasticity in Hokkaido became stable after imposition of the production adjustment. On the other hand, price elasticity in Tofuken became stable after the inflation of the mid‐1970s. Price elasticity is estimated to be more inelastic as well as more likely to converge in inelasticity in Hokkaido than in Tofuken. We discuss the relationship between changes in dairy policy and changes in price elasticity.</jats:p>",

The problem treated is a part of the purchasing plan of a company in an uncertain environment and it is very common in business practice. Optimization criteria selected describe the performance measures of ordering policies and generally their relative importance is different. It is assumed that the values of the optimization criteria are vague and imprecise. They are described by discrete fuzzy numbers and by linguistic expressions. The linguistic expressions are modeled by discrete fuzzy sets. The measures of belief that one ordering policy is better than another are defined by comparing fuzzy numbers. An illustrative example is given.</jats:p>"

Peat samples were collected at 21 different sites in Norway encompassing large geographical differences in marine influence and air pollution. The study demonstrates that surface peat is an excellent medium to study geographical differences in heavy metal deposition, provided that effects of the surface plant cover are properly considered. Long‐range atmospheric transport of pollutants is the main source for As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Zn, and to a lesser extent for Cu and Se. Biogenic emissions from the ocean appear to be the main source of Se to the peat. The metals Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni are mainly associated with windblown local soil dust. Surface enrichment of Mn, and in part Zn, is mainly caused by nutrient circulation between the surface peat and vascular plants growing on it. Deposition of marine salts appears to be the main reason for lower Mn concentrations in the peat near the coast.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Owing to its inherent modeling flexibility, simulation is often regarded as the proper means for supporting decision making on supply chain design. The ultimate success of supply chain simulation, however, is determined by a combination of the analyst's skills, the chain members' involvement, and the modeling capabilities of the simulation tool. This combination should provide the basis for a realistic simulation model, which is both transparent and complete. The need for transparency is especially strong for supply chains as they involve (semi)autonomous parties each having their own objectives. Mutual trust and model effectiveness are strongly influenced by the degree of completeness of each party's insight into the key decision variables. Ideally, visual interactive simulation models present an important communicative means for realizing the required overview and insight. Unfortunately, most models strongly focus on physical transactions, leaving key decision variables implicit for some or all of the parties involved. This especially applies to control structures, that is, the managers or systems responsible for control, their activities and their mutual attuning of these activities. Control elements are, for example, dispersed over the model, are not visualized, or form part of the time‐indexed scheduling of events. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly addresses the modeling of control structures. First, we will conduct a literature survey with the aim of listing simulation model qualities essential for supporting successful decision making on supply chain design. Next, we use this insight to define an object‐oriented modeling framework that facilitates supply chain simulation in a more realistic manner. This framework is meant to contribute to improved decision making in terms of recognizing and understanding opportunities for improved supply chain design. Finally, the use of the framework is illustrated by a case example concerning a supply chain for chilled salads.</jats:p>",

This system requires a compact heat storage unit of quick response. In this study, a plate fin type brazing heat exchanger was built and tested as the heat storage unit. Sodium acetate trihydrate with a melting point of about 58 °C and a paraffin wax with a higher value of 74.8 °C were used as the phase change material (PCM). As a result, it was shown that the heat transfer in the heat storage unit was dominated by thermal conductivity in PCM. The paraffin wax showed higher responsibility and higher heat output due to its higher melting point and quite lower super cooling in solidification.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sandstone units in the Middle to Late Devonian Lower Clair Group form the reservoir in the Clair Field, UKCS Block 206, West of Shetland. The sandstone facies vary from thick, well-sorted, medium sands deposited by aeolian processes, to amalgamated fluvial channel deposits of coarser sand, to thin sheets of fine sand deposited in floodplain or shallow lake settings. The distribution of these different facies within the basin-fill succession was controlled by the locations of sediment supply into the basin and the climatic controls on the processes of sand distribution and sedimentation. Six lithostratigraphical subdivisions (Units I to VI) are differentiated by changes in the predominance of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine facies. During periods of high sediment supply and relatively humid climate (Units II, IV and V), fluvial conditions dominated in the form of sandy to pebbly fluvial distributary systems laid down as terminal fans. The water-lain sandstone facies characteristics vary from stacked, coarse channel fills deposited by braided rivers (Unit II) to decimetre sand sheets interpreted as the deposits of poorly channelized flow at the margins of the terminal fan (Unit V). At times of relative aridity, the fluvial system retreated and aeolian reworking resulted in extensive sheets of well-sorted sands deposited as dunes or on sand flats (Unit III). Periods of wetter climate and reduced clastic input resulted in widespread lacustrine conditions. Lakes were fed by rivers which terminated in lake deltas ranging from coarse, fan deltas (Unit I) to fine-grained deltas (Unit VI). The Devonian Clair Basin is an example of deposition in a basin of internal drainage which was predominantly controlled by climate and sediment supply variations. A predictive model for sandbody character and distribution can be developed using an understanding of these controls on the evolution of continental depositional systems in the basin.</jats:p>",

Phosphorus supply to the crop is affected by soil P, P fertilizer management and by soil and environmental conditions influencing P phytoavailability and root growth. Phosphorus uptake in many crops is improved by associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Cropping system and long-term input of P through fertilizers and manures can influence the amount and phytoavailability of P in the system and the development of mycorrhizal associations. Optimum yield potential requires an adequate P supply to the crop from the soil or from P additions. Where early-season P supply is low, P fertilization may improve P nutrition and crop yield potential. Alternately, under low-P conditions, encouragement of arbuscular mycorrhizal associations may enhance P uptake by crops early in the growing season, improving crop yield potential and replacing starter fertilizer P applications. Soil P supply that exceeds P requirements of the crop may preclude mycorrhizal development. To encourage arbuscular mycorrhizal association, threshold levels of soil solution P that restrict mycorrhizal development must not be exceeded. Sustainable P management practices must be applied both in conventional and in alternative biologically based agricultural systems. Key words: Microbiology, fertility, colonization </jats:p>",

The development of the sequences reflects a complex interaction between eustatic sea‐level changes, physiography and variable sediment supply. Superimposed on this, frequent storms promoted longshore sediment transport and the development of spit systems adjacent to structural highs. As a consequence, sequence boundaries and flooding surfaces are not always expressed as portrayed in conventional sequence models; sequence boundaries or flooding surfaces may only be marked by subtle changes in depositional environment that can only be revealed by careful integration of sedimentological observations with palynological data. The influence of the topography resulted in the development of brackish water basins that were sufficiently large to permit the deposition of hummocky cross‐stratified sands with muds. These deposits are overlain by clean hummocky and swaley cross‐stratified sands that were deposited in a fully marine, high‐energy environment. This evolution from mud‐rich, storm‐influenced sediments to sand‐dominated shoreface sediments resulted from a rise in sea level and was not the result of shoreface progradation and downstepping during a sea level fall. In addition to the topographic control on sequence development, sediment supply to the study area changed significantly during the deposition of the three sequences. Initially the basin was sediment‐starved, favouring the formation of glaucony‐rich sediments. The sediment input gradually increased and the influence of structural highs and lows became less significant with time. Consequently, both sequence boundaries and flooding surfaces are characterized by more conventional features in the younger part of the succession, where a basinward displacement of the shoreline resulted in thick lowstand delta deposits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For regions or nations which historically have had low levels of domestic R&amp;D investment - such as Ireland, North and South - inward investment represents a potentially important source of inward knowledge transfer. Using data from large multinational plants throughout Ireland, this paper examines the geography of knowledge within Irish manufacturing, focusing particularly on knowledge gaps and knowledge-transfer activity. The analysis suggests three main empirical results. First, no significant knowledge gaps exist between the Irish plants of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and international best practice. Second, larger knowledge gaps exist between MNE plants and their best local suppliers, suggesting the potential for local learning in the supply chain. Average knowledge gaps to suppliers also tend to be larger in the North. Third, there is no clear evidence that knowledge-transfer activity is more intensive where knowledge gaps are widest. In particular, developmental interaction between MNE plants and suppliers tends to be more common in the South. Our results suggest the potential benefit of policy measures both to increase knowledge-transfer activity along the supply chain and also to increase knowledge-transfer activity between companies which are not trading partners. </jats:p>",

Precision agriculture is designed to target crop inputs according to within-field requirements to increase profitability while protecting the environment. The objectives of this work were to (a) develop a canopy physiological stress index with spatial resolution commensurate with the needs of site-specific management, and (b) test the physiological meaning of this index by exploring its association with key processes and variables at leaf and crop levels. We report results from a single-year field experiment where different levels of irrigation, wheat crop density, and nitrogen supply were applied to increase the expression of within-season variability. We defined a canopy stress index (CSI) as the difference between canopy (Tc), and air temperature (Ta), normalised by vapour pressure deficit (VPD): CSI = (Tc – Ta)/VPD. A novel method to extract canopy temperatures (Tc) from complex digital thermal images was developed, thus allowing for the spatial characterisation of CSI. CSI is expected to be positive and high if the capacity of the canopy to dissipate heat is reduced as when stomata close. CSI accounted for 80% of the variation in growth rate and yield, compared with 46–49% explained by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Most of the variation in crop response variables was related to water supply. The physiological meaning of this index was reinforced by its significant association with gas exchange variables measured at the leaf-level. The potential for the use of digital thermal imaging in precision agriculture is discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Crop adaptation to edaphic constraints has focussed largely on increasing boron (B) tolerance in cereals, targeted to alkaline soils with high boron content. However, recent studies have implicated several other physicochemical constraints, such as salinity and sodicity, in reduced grain yields of cereals by restricting water extraction in the subsoil. Consequently, the value of B-tolerance may be limited on soils where multiple constraints exist. To test the contribution of B-tolerance where multiple constraints exist, near-isogenic lines of wheat and barley differing in B-tolerance were used, where growth and water extraction by crops in large intact cores, extracted from a Calcarosol profile, were measured. The effect of subsoil disturbance (deep ripping) and growing-season water supply was also investigated. Use of B-tolerant crops did not increase use of subsoil water or grain yield. Wheat and barley extracted soil water down to 0.6 m depth but not below 0.8 m. The soil B concentration of these 2 layers was equivalent (29 ν. 31 mg/kg), whereas salinity [(ECe) 7.2 ν. 8.1 dS/m] and sodicity [(ESP) 22 ν. 29%] both increased significantly with depth, implying that these 2 latter properties had a greater effect than B. Deep ripping with gypsum had no effect on grain yield. Wheat and barley grown under high water supply outyielded their counterparts grown under low water supply, although grain yield per unit of applied water for the crops under low water was 1.5 times that of the crops under high water regime. The results suggest that high salinity and sodicity, rather than B, were exerting the major effects on water extraction of wheat and barley from the deep subsoil, thus negating the effect of crop B-tolerance where multiple constraints exist. This highlights the need to breed cultivars with increased sodium tolerance, pyramided with current B-tolerance, for those crops targeted to many alkaline soils.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Efficient conversion of grazed pasture and supplementary feeds into milk is essential to the profitability of dairy farming in southern Australia as costs of production continue to rise. The application of diet formulation approaches to the nutritional management of grazing dairy cows provides unique challenges in predicting the interactions that occur between grazed herbage and supplementary feeds. How feed intake and associative effects between feeds in lactating dairy cows grazing pasture might affect estimated metabolisable energy supplied by the diet are examined. The effects of increasing feed intake in high-producing dairy cows on decreasing the digestibility of energy, and the compensatory effects of reduced methane production, are reviewed. The factors affecting intake of grazing cows and possible effects on digestibility are considered, and include characteristics of the pasture/forage and amounts and forms of concentrates. Estimates of the potential magnitude of negative associative effects in dairy cows have been made using 2 datasets from recent experiments. Finally, the potential importance of understanding and predicting the magnitude of associative effects for efficient pasture-based dairy production is discussed. It is concluded that although associative effects between feeds in grazing dairy cows cannot be predicted with certainty, and although they involve complex interactions among a number of variables, ignoring their occurrence can lead to significant errors in both feed evaluation and ration formulation.</jats:p>"

Yet FP-to-population ratios remained relatively stable over the last decade, and there were perceptions of physician surpluses, at least in urban centres, 10 years ago. We evaluated whether demographic changes among patients and FPs, and in the volume of care received and provided over the period, contribute to this paradox. Given the relationship between age and FP use in fiscal year 1991/1992, an aging population should have been associated with a 2 per cent increase in visits by 2000/2001. Likewise, given the relationship between FP age and workloads in 1991/1992, an aging workforce should have been associated with a 12 per cent increase in service provision a decade later. Yet visit rates and average FP workloads remained unchanged. There was an increase in age-specific rates of FP use among older adults and a decline in rates among the young, and an increase in age-specific workloads such that older FPs provided many more services than their predecessors (30%) and younger FPs provided many fewer (20%). In terms of impact on future requirements for FPs, both changes in age-specific rates of use, and changes in age-specific patterns of FP productivity, trump population aging as key drivers.</jats:p>"

Stock price effects are examined starting one year before through two years after the disruption announcement date. Over this time period the average abnormal stock returns of firms that experienced disruptions is nearly –40%. Much of this underperformance is observed in the year before the announcement, the day of the announcement, and the year after the announcement. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that firms do not quickly recover from the negative effects of disruptions. The equity risk of the firm also increases significantly around the announcement date. The equity risk in the year after the announcement is 13.50% higher when compared to the equity risk in the year before the announcement. </jats:p>",

The efficacy of the decontamination measures was evaluated by monitoring the temperatures and legionella concentrations at different parts of the hot water distribution system. The genetic diversity of the colonizing legionella flora was examined using two genotyping methods: amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Selected serogroup 6 strains were also analyzed by sequence‐based typing (SBT). The results indicated that long‐term eradication of serogroup 5 strains was never achieved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The internal capsule and basal nuclei are supplied by perforating branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), Heubner's artery, middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and anterior choroidal artery (AChA). Some of the mentioned perforators vascularize both the internal capsule and basal nuclei, while some of them also perfuse the adjacent brain structures. Dorsal part of the anterior limb, knee and posterior limb of the internal capsule are commonly supplied by lateral MCA perforators. The intermediate part of the anterior limb is perfused by medial MCA perforators, while its ventral part is nourished by ACA perforators and Heubner's artery. The intermediate part of the knee is supplied by medial MCA perforators, while its ventral partis mostly vascularized by ICA and proximal AChA perforators. The intermediate part of the posterior limb is perfused by medial MCA perforators anteriorly and the proximal AChA perforators posteriorly. The ventral part is supplied by AChA perforators. The retrolenticular and sublenticular portions of the internal capsule are mainly nourished by distal AChA perforators. The caudate nucleus is supplied by perforators of the ACA, MCA and AChA, as well as by branches of the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Most of the putamen is vascularized by MCA perforators, and smaller parts by ACA and AChA perforators. The lateral segment of the globus pallidus is perfused by MCA perforators and partially by Heubner's artery and ACA, while its medial segment is supplied by ICA and AChA perforators. The ACA perforators, that most often originate from the initial 5.9 mm of the Al segment, range in number from 1 to 5 (mean, 2.2) and in diameter between 80 urn and 710 urn (average, 295 urn). Heubner's artery, which most often arises close to the anterior communicating artery, can be singular (72.5%), double (23%) or triple (4.5%). It varies in diameter from 190 urn to 1,600 um (average, 750 urn) and in length between 11 mmand36mm (mean, 22.4 mm). The MCA perforators, that most frequently originate from M1 segment (90.7%) and leptomeningeal branches (62.6%), range in number between 2 and 13 (mean, 8.1) and in diameter from 80 um to 1,300 um (mean, 520 um). Many perforators arise as individual vessels, and some of them with common trunks (70.8%). Medial and lateral group of these perforators can be distinguished. The ICA perforators, which more often arise close to the AChA originating site (35.4%) than from the ICA bifurcation point (10.4%), vary in number from 1 to 5 (average, 3) and in diameter between 70 ?m and 500 um (mean, 236 ?m). The AChA perforators that originate from its cisternal segment, range in number from 2 to 9 (mean, 4.5) and in diameter from 90 ?m to 600 ?m (mean, 325 ?m).</jats:p>"

Laboratory measures of N availability were carried out on unamended and PPS-amended soils to investigate their value in estimating supplementary N needs of crops in Australia’s northern grains region. Cumulative net N mineralised from the long-term (30 weeks) leached aerobic incubation was described by a first-order single exponential model. The mineralisation rate constant (0.057/week) was not significantly different between Control and PPS treatments or across soil types, when the amounts of initial mineral N applied in PPS treatments were excluded. Potentially mineralisable N (No) was significantly increased by the application of Wet PPS, and increased with increasing rate of application. Application of Wet PPS significantly increased the total amount of inorganic N leached compared with the Control treatments. Mineral N applied in Wet PPS contributed as much to the total mineral N status of the soil as did that which mineralised over time from organic N. Rates of CO2 evolution during 30 weeks of aerobic leached incubation indicated that the Stockpiled PPS was more stabilised (19–28% of applied organic C mineralised) than the Wet PPS (35–58% of applied organic C mineralised), due to higher lignin content in the former. Net nitrate-N produced following 12 weeks of aerobic non-leached incubation was highly correlated with net nitrate-N leached during 12 weeks of aerobic incubation (R2 = 0.96), although it was &lt;60% of the latter in both sandy and clayey soils. Anaerobically mineralisable N determined by waterlogged incubation of laboratory PPS-amended soil samples increased with increasing application rate of Wet PPS. Anaerobically mineralisable N from field-moist soil was well correlated with net N mineralised during 30 weeks of aerobic leached incubation (R2 = 0.90 sandy soil; R2 = 0.93 clay soil). In the clay soil, the amount of mineral N produced from all the laboratory incubations was significantly correlated with field-measured nitrate-N in the soil profile (0–1.5 m depth) after 9 months of weed-free fallow following PPS application. In contrast, only anaerobic mineralisable N was significantly correlated with field nitrate-N in the sandy soil. Anaerobic incubation would, therefore, be suitable as a rapid practical test to estimate potentially mineralisable N following applications of different PPS materials in the field.\n</jats:p>"

The delayed line intensity responses to the modulation of the arc current were investigated using calcium as a representative analyte. The intensities of both the atomic and ionic lines were monitored at different distances from the arc axis in the presence of various concentrations of the easily ionised element. Temporal evolutions were monitored on a millisecond time scale. It was found that the responses of the line intesity to the arc current change strongly depended on the observed radial position, especially in the vicinity of the arc axis. The obtained results showed a significant influence of even small amounts of the easily ionised element on the excitation and transport of the analyte and indicated a way of possibly improving the analytical capabilities of the excitation source.</jats:p>"

Early recognition of transmission of this genotype is therefore important. To evaluate the usefulness of variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) typing to discriminate and recognize strains of the Beijing family,<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates from Hong Kong were subjected to VNTR analysis, spoligotyping, and IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. The allelic diversity of the 14 VNTR loci included in the analysis varied from 0 to 0.618 among Beijing strains. The discriminatory power of VNTR analysis was slightly lower than that of IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP. Our analysis shows that VNTR typing, which has many practical advantages over RFLP typing, can be used for epidemiological studies of Beijing strains. However, VNTR-defined clusters should be subtyped with IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP for maximal resolution.</jats:p>",
