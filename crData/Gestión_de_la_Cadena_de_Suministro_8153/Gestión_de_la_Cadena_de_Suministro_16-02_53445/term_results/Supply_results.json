      "abstract": "<jats:p>Through a qualitative study of two firms' supply networks, we develop a theory of the process by which environmental innovations emerge and proliferate in supply networks. To overcome limitations of current supply network innovation theories, which focus on the diffusion of existing innovations, we employ a complex adaptive systems perspective, which addresses how such innovations come into being in the first place and how they spread in a network over time. Our findings suggest a process model, in which temporally connected processes cross from the organizational to the network level, creating and spreading environmental innovations in supply networks. This model and its corresponding theoretical propositions were generated through an abductive research methodology. Our key insight is that development of environmental innovations in supply networks is an emergent phenomenon. Once in the network realm, the process ceases to be under the control of the dominant buying firm. Instead, self‐organization and decentralized coordination prevail.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply disruptions are commonplace in today's global supply chain environment. The sheer magnitude of daily transactions makes it inevitable that there will be disruptions, further exacerbated by differences in cultural norms and attitudes that add a layer of complexity to managerial response. In this research, we examine the impact of national culture on individuals' responses to supply disruptions due to psychological contract breach. Using data from controlled experiments conducted with 158 subjects in China and 125 subjects in the U.S., we evaluate changes in decision‐making behaviors and assessments of attitudinal outcomes regarding trust and repurchase intentions. Our results show post‐breach behavioral differences based on national culture, but find that these differences are short‐term in nature. Additionally, cultural differences show up in both of the attitudinal outcomes assessed in this research. Following a psychological contract breach, individuals from the U.S. express less trust in their supply chain partner and less willingness to work with that partner again in the future as compared to individuals from China. Our research suggests that managers and scholars interested in the cultural influences on the response to supply disruption will benefit from further research and understanding focusing on the intersection of psychological contract breach and cultural distance.</jats:p>",

Evidence that firms are attempting to become less unsustainable is mounting, but compensating practices such as offsetting a supply chain's negative impact on the environment and society do not create truly sustainable supply chains. This conceptual study seeks to move the field from the question of how can firms merely diminish environmental or social problems to how supply chains can become truly sustainable. To that end, we review the major weaknesses in previous logics and develop an Ecologically Dominant logic where environment and social interests supersede economic interests. To encourage a wider adoption of our perspective, the study illustrates how the Ecologically Dominant logic can advance practice and research. We do this by providing examples drawn from practice and our previous research and by offering propositions to encourage future research.</jats:p>",

Moreover, this capability allows firms to build the resiliency to mitigate enterprise risks. The purpose of this paper is to apply two main theoretical frames from the strategy literature, dynamic capabilities, and organizational ambidexterity, to supply chain management (SCM) to examine mitigation strategies for supply chain (SC) disruptions. The authors empirically investigated how the firm’s SC ambidexterity is developed through a dynamic capability-building process and how this, in turn, can mitigate the negative impact of SC disruptions and improve business performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– This study conducted a field survey to answer the research questions as there exists no archival database with detailed information on ambidextrous SC strategies and dynamic capability. A total of 316 usable responses were received from managers working in the SC area.

To take advantage of an ambidextrous SC, through minimizing the negative impact of SC disruptions and maximizing firm performance, firms should continually search for creative ways to satisfy new market needs and adapt to the fast changing business environment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This study applied a dynamic capability-building process and ambidexterity to SCM.

We estimate the willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) of U.S. consumers for a packaged cereal product where the key grain ingredient may be grown in one country and processed in a second country (multicountry supply chain) and compare it to equivalent products that have both stages located in a single country. We find consumer WTP for products with single‐country and multicountry supply chains are statistically different, meaning that simplifying a multicountry label by listing only the country where the ingredients are grown or only the country where the ingredients are processed can result in different consumer values. We also find that for countries with a poor quality reputation, consumers respond more negatively when that country has the “last touch” than when that country's involvement is limited to upstream supply chain links.</jats:p>",

Moreover, four simulation scenarios were performed in which the values of variables modified management strategies. The installed bioethanol production capacity was increased to observe the evolution of increased waste generation evaluated. The initial conditions for the simulation were modified to represent a production of about 2,500,000 liters / day. This leads to an increased generation of vinasse of over 400 million liters on average in a month and around more than 1 million tones of bagasse. The results are used to estimate the impact of management strategies on the amount of waste generated in the production of bioethanol.</jats:p>"

Enterococcus moraviensis was the most frequently isolated species. Until now, no faecal sources of this species have been reported and the potential for growth under certain environmental conditions was reported for other Enterococcus species. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of E. moraviensis to grow in habitats present in the dune passage process (dune vegetation, sediment from abstraction wells, biofilm developed using abstracted water and soil). Different concentrations of boiled and filtered (0.45 μm) plant extracts obtained from dune vegetation supported growth (up to 6 log), with maximum concentrations after 4 to 6 days at 15 °C. Although E. moraviensis was shown to be able to attach to the biofilm, no growth was observed in biofilm or in sediment and soil. These observations confound the use of E. moraviensis as a faecal indicator.</jats:p>",

In this case, the transport component is of particular importance, as it may significantly exceed the share of other logistics costs. Demonstrated approach to the design of delivery of goods takes into account the alternative choice. It is proposed to assess not only the most optimal (in terms of cost and integrated indicators) options, but to take into account those in where a certain benefit or important social aspect with more distant consequences for the production itself is prevailing. Examples of calculations, models and methods of designing logistics systems are presented. It is expected that the developed methodology can be used for individual subsystems - for example, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, inventory management. Keywords: transport, economy, logistics, supply chain, multimodal transportation, design, transportation, logistics costs.

In our modeling, we also explicitly incorporate realistic operational parameters, including biomass deterioration rates and transportation economies of scale. For an efficient solution of our model, we suggest a Benders decomposition–based algorithm that can handle realistic size problems for design and analysis purposes. We implement the approach in a particular way using callback functions, in which the master problem is solved only once; we also develop surrogate constraints for enhanced lower bounds to obtain improved convergence especially for large instances. We provide computational results that demonstrate the efficiency of the solution approach on a wide-ranging set of problem instances. Furthermore, we develop a realistic case using data pertaining to the state of Texas and conduct an extensive analysis on the effects of varying input parameters on the design outcomes for a bioenergy supply chain network. </jats:p>",

We obtain the following major conclusions: (1) the total WF in Beijing is 353 108 m³ in 2012; per capita WF is 1,704 m³, which is 8 times that of the entity water of Beijing; (2) the Iwf in Beijing rises after 2007, indicating that there remains a great potential for improving water-use efficiency; (3) through virtual water trade, the external WF takes over 70% of the total WF annually; therefore, Beijing has faced more severe water resource stress recently; (4) through the spatial analysis of external WD, we identify that in each side of the Hu line, distribution of distance of the flow of imported virtual water shows homogeneity, and that WD in the southeast region is high and in the northwest is weak.</jats:p>",

Work processes within ILL have changed significantly in Norway in recent years, and new challenges have emerged. County libraries, public libraries and The Norwegian Library Association’s Special Interest Group saw the need for a survey to understand how these changes were affecting ILL-work in the public libraries in Norway. The library community as a whole needed updated information to respond to the present challenges in ILL. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – In March 2014, Sentio Research Norway conducted a survey on ILL among Norwegian public libraries. The survey was commissioned by the county libraries in Norway. In total, 425 questionnaires were sent to all the main libraries. There are 428 main public libraries, but three of them were without staff at the time of the survey. Further, 336 answers provided a response rate of 79 per cent. The survey had 48 questions. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – An interesting result from the survey is that 53 per cent of the public libraries want no restrictions on what to borrow, while 45 per cent believed there should be some restrictions on lending. This shows a difference in the attitudes to lending compared to borrowing library material. However, 58 per cent of the libraries have not implemented restrictions on what to lend on interlibrary loan. One of four had restrictions on lending new literature. The public libraries were, in general, highly interested in better access to curriculum literature from universities and colleges. To some extent, they wanted better access to new literature, e-books and nonfiction (the category was named “special subjects and topics” in the survey). The survey shows that most libraries still prefer to order interlibrary loans for their users rather than encourage users to order themselves. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study is the first systematic survey of ILL in Norwegian public libraries.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

However, it is difficult for an energy supply to operate stably and economically with only a conventional fossil fuel boiler system. For this reason, several unused energy sources have become attractive and it was found that power plant waste heat has the greatest potential for application in this scenario. In this study, we performed a feasibility assessment of power plant waste heat as an energy source for horticulture facilities. As a result, it was confirmed that there was a sufficient amount of energy potential for the use of waste heat to supply energy to the assumed area. In Dangjin, an horticultural area of 500 ha could be constructed by utilizing 20% of the energy reserves. In Hadong, a horticulture facility can be set up to be 260 ha with 7.4% of the energy reserves. In Youngdong, an assumed area of 65 ha could be built utilizing about 19% of the energy reserves. Furthermore, the payback period was calculated in order to evaluate the economic feasibility compared with a conventional system. The initial investment costs can be recovered by the approximately 83% reduction in the annual operating costs.</jats:p>"

In the current research, a genetic algorithm method was selected to optimize pump operations to reduce energy consumption while maintaining good service. The method was then applied to the water supply network of Milan, Italy, a large, complex system in which hydraulic head is maintained by the action of pumping stations. On the basis of real data and following field testing, the operations of the network and its pumping stations were first simulated with specially developed software that uses the EPANET Toolkit and then optimized with the proposed method. When checked against real data, simulation results indicated that application of the optimization procedures could produce significant improvement and cost savings.</jats:p>",

Conjoint analysis (CA) was conducted to determine what factors are considered important for consumers’ selection of drinking water. The information provision effect was also investigated inside CA profiles using different model equations. Results indicate that the perception of the safety of tap water was much lower than that of other waters. Higher levels of water hardness and cancer risk negatively influenced selection of drinking water, while third-party certifications about taste and safety positively impacted it. When cancer risk was shown in a CA profile, the weight given to other attributes decreased. Among different socio-demographic groups, gender was important in establishing drinking water preferences with men paying less attention to the benefits of water-dispensers and certifications from third parties. Besides, age also has some influence on drinking water selection. People's consciousness of taste, safety, cost, and handling for drinking water were assessed using an analytic hierarchy process and the scores were incorporated in a CA equation. The results suggest that improving people's perceptions of the taste and safety of tap water can promote consumers’ selection of tap water as drinking water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Side weirs have many possible applications in the field of hydraulic engineering. They are also considered an important structure in hydro systems. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) technique was employed to predict the side weir discharge coefficient. The performance of SVM was compared with other types of soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). While ANN and ANFIS models provided a good prediction performance, the SVM model with a radial basis function kernel function outperforms them. The best SVM model was developed with a gamma coefficient and epsilon of 15 and 0.3, respectively. The SVM yielded a coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.96 and 0.93 for the training and testing data. Sensitivity analyses of the ANN, ANFIS and SVM models showed that the Froude number and ratio of weir length to the flow depth upstream of the weir are the most effective parameters for the prediction of the discharge coefficient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze a general model in which, at each echelon of the supply process, an arbitrary number of firms compete, offering one or multiple products to some or all of the firms at the next echelon, with firms at the most downstream echelon selling to the end consumer. At each echelon, the offered products are differentiated and the firms belonging to this echelon engage in price competition. The model assumes a general set of piecewise linear consumer demand functions for all products (potentially) brought to the consumer market, where each product’s demand volume may depend on the retail prices charged for all products; consumers’ preferences over the various product/retailer combinations are general and asymmetric. Similarly, the cost rates incurred by the firms at the most upstream echelon are general as well. We fully characterize the equilibrium behavior under linear price-only contracts, and we show how all equilibrium performance measures can be computed via a simple recursive scheme. Moreover, we establish how changes in the model parameters, in particular, exogenous cost rates or intercept values in the demand functions, impact the system-wide equilibrium. These comparative statics results allow for the quantification of cost pass-through effects and the measurement and characterization of the firms’ brand value. Lastly, we illustrate what qualitative impacts various changes in the structure of the supply chain network may bring forth. </jats:p>",

A high percentage of feed samples have been reported to be contaminated with more than one mycotoxin. In most cases, the concentrations were low enough to ensure compliance with the European Union (EU) guidance values or maximum admitted levels. However, mycotoxin co-contamination might still exert adverse effects on animals due to additive/synergistic interactions. Studies on the fate of mycotoxins during cereal processing, such as milling, production of ethanol fuels, and beer brewing, have shown that mycotoxins are concentrated into fractions that are commonly used as animal feed. Published data show a high variability in mycotoxin repartitioning, mainly due to the type of mycotoxins, the level and extent of fungal contamination, and a failure to understand the complexity of food processing technologies. Precise knowledge of mycotoxin repartitioning during technological processes is critical and may provide a sound technical basis for feed managers to conform to legislation requirements and reduce the risk of severe adverse market and trade repercussions. Regular, economical and straightforward feed testing is critical to reach a quick and accurate diagnosis of feed quality. The use of rapid methods represents a future challenge.</jats:p>"

The quantitative and risk-based metrics are calculated by WaterMet2 and risk modules, while the qualitative metrics may be quantified by external tools feeding into the DSS. Finally, a multi-criteria decision analysis approach is employed in the DSS to compare the defined intervention strategies and rank them with respect to a pre-specified weighting scheme for different scenarios. This mechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare different strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple scenarios.

The purpose of that original work was to examine the state-of-the-art in supply chain management (SCM). There have been substantial changes to the landscape within which supply chains function and changes to supply chains themselves. Given these changes it is appropriate to re-visit what is the new state-of-the art and determine whether the 1989 conceptualization requires extending. The authors also attempt to assess whether the evolution of SCM is associated with improved financial performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The authors take a conceptual approach to suggest that SCM is undergoing a transition to devolved, collaborative supply chain clusters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pengembangan budidaya patin pasupati didorong oleh besarnya permintaan daging patinberwarna putih. Patin produksi Indonesia seperti patin siam dengan daging berwarna merah kurangdisukai di pasar Internasional, untuk itu diperlukan pengembangan patin pasupati yang memiliki dagingberwarna putih. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mempelajari supply chain patin Pasupati yang telahdikembangkan di Tulungagung. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah pendekatan analisis supplydan value chain. Data yang dikumpulkan adalah data primer dan data sekunder melalui studi literatur dansurvei terhadap pembudidaya, pedagang serta informan kunci seperti peneliti dan pejabat dinas terkait.Analisis data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah deskriptif dan kuantitatif. Berdasarkan hasilanalisis, perbandingan rantai nilai patin pasupati dan patin siam dari pembudidaya dengan luasan lahansebesar 530 m2 ke pabrik fillet ikan ditunjukkan oleh nilai keuntungan yang diterima oleh pembudidayapatin siam lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan pembudidaya patin pasupati. Sementara itu pada simpulpedagang pengumpul ke pabrik fillet ikan, patin pasupati lebih menguntungkan dibandingkan patin siam.Hal ini terjadi karena patin pasupati mempunyai harga relatif lebih tinggi dibandingkan denan hargapatin siam. Beberapa strategi pengembangan Patin di Tulungagung adalah: 1) penetapan kawasansentra patin pasupati di Tulungagung, 2) mengoptimalkan fasilitas Balai Bemih Ikan (BBI) denganBalai Penelitian Pemuliaan Ikan (BPPI) Sukamandi untuk produksi benih patin, 3) penguatan teknologibudidaya patin pasupati berdasarkan Cara Budidaya Ikan yang Baik (CBIB), 4) penguatan kapasitasSDM untuk pengolahan limbah patin, 5) membuka kembali pabrik pakan mandiri berbasis masyakaratdengan pemanfaatan limbah patin itu sendiri, serta 6) market intelligence untuk penetapan harga,sehingga usaha patin pasupati di pembudidaya tidak kalah dibandingkan dengan patin siam.Title: Supply Chain Analysis for Pangasius Pasupati AquacultureDevelopment at Tulungagung, East JavaAquaculture development of Pangasius sp. were driven by high demand of white meat ofpangasius. Indonesian Pangasius production such as Siamese conjoined with red meat is less preferredin the International market, it is necessary for the development of Pangasius aquaculture which haswhite meat. This research aimed to analyzed supply chain of Pasupati catfish that has been developedin Tulungagung. The method used is supply and value chain analysis approached. Data collected wereprimary and secondary data through literature studies and surveys of fish farmer , traders and keyinformants such as researchers and officers of relevant agencies . Data analysis in this research weredescriptive and quantitative. Based on the analysis, comparison of pasupati and siamese pangasiusvalue chain from farmers with land area of 530 m2 to fish fillet factory indicated that Siamese catfishfarmers gain more than pasupati catfish farmer. The value chain comparison of Pasupati and Siamesepangasius trading conjoined from the traders to the fillet factories is that Pasupati gained more profit ofselling. It happened because the price of Pasupati is better in fillet factories. Some development strategiesin Pangasius Development are: 1) Establishing The regional center of Pangasius at Tulungagung,2 ) Optimizing the facility of Fish Breeding Center owned the Agency with Sukamandi Fish Breeding Research Center (Marine and Fisheries Research and Development Agency) for seed production ofPangasius, 3) Strengthening the Pasupati aquaculture technology based on Standard of Aquaculture, 4)Strengthening the human resource capacity for pangasius waste treatment, 5) Reopen the independentfeed mills based on society with the raw material from the pangasius waste, and 6) Market intelligencefor pricing, untill the Pasupati business at farmers are not less than Siamese pangasius.</jats:p>"

This paper reviews mechanisms presently used in Australia to improve the supply of ecosystem services, with particular emphasis on financial mechanisms. Auction, green bond and biobanking schemes are widely and, so far, successfully used in a number of States, especially in projects where the actions required and ecosystem services can be readily measured. Measurement of biodiversity and biodiversity-based services remains problematic, despite some fairly widespread application of different measurement systems. Inadequate or variable measurement systems could engender a loss of investor interest if equivalence or gains cannot be appropriately verified. A new Biodiversity Investment Scheme is proposed, based on the structure used commercially in Managed Investment Schemes. The choice of mechanism, however, will be mainly determined by landowner attitudes to assignment of property rights, and by scale, the extent of public versus private consumption goods, and the transaction costs and risks.</jats:p>"

Findings are as follows: 1) For the integrated supply chain, when unanticipated events lead to product cost increase, market size will shrink, and the system profit is harmed. In contrast, when unanticipated events lead to reduced product cost, market size will expand, and system profit increases; 2) Production strategies applicable to normal situations have certain robustness, and should be maintained when product cost disruption caused by unanticipated events is relatively small; 3) When product cost disruption caused by unanticipated events is relatively large, product sales price should be first adjusted, and aligned with the way that product cost is disrupted. Meanwhile, order quantity and product output should also be properly adjusted. That is, order quantity and output need to be reduced when product cost increases; order quantity and output need to be increased when product cost is reduced. In the end, this paper employs numerical examples to testify the findings. Research conclusions help to further enrich and extend the theoretic basis of “supply chain disruption management”, and are helpful for researchers’ further study.</jats:p>",

Nanosized Fe and Fe/Ni materials are considered as promising options for chlorinated phenol removal. The effect of Ni morphology on the removal of pentachlorophenol (PCP) with Fe/Ni nanomaterials was investigated in this study. Iron nanoparticles and nickel nanomaterials with different shapes were synthesized using a chemical reduction method and wet chemical techniques, respectively. The concentrations of PCP and chloride in solutions were measured with and without Ni present. The intermediates of PCP were also analyzed. The results showed that the dechlorination of PCP was promoted by Ni nanomaterials, among which the tubular porous Ni nanomaterials expressed the most promotion, then those with net shape and nanochains. However, the tubular porous Ni nanomaterials inhibited the removal of PCP, and the other two expressed a certain promotion. In the Fe/Ni system, Fe nanoparticles transformed into magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or maghemite (Fe2O3), and Ni nanomaterials were still pure Ni after reaction. The introduction of Ni nanomaterials would improve dechlorination of PCP, but the removal of PCP might be inhibited or improved as the morphology of Ni changed.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a practical device design guideline for low voltage operation of steep-slope negative-capacitance field-effect-transistors (NCFETs) operating at sub-0.2V supply voltage is investigated regarding operation speed, material requirement and energy efficiency in the case of ferroelectric HfO2 gate insulator, which is the material fully compatible to Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process technologies. A physics-based numerical simulator was built to design NCFETs with the use of experimental HfO2 material parameters by modeling the ferroelectric gate insulator and FET channel simultaneously. The simulator revealed that NCFETs with ferroelectric HfO2 gate insulator enable hysteresis-free operation by setting appropriate operation point with a few nm thick gate insulator. It also revealed that, if the finite response time of spontaneous polarization of the ferroelectric gate insulator is 10-100psec, 1-10MHz operation speed can be achieved with negligible hysteresis. Finally, by optimizing material parameters and tuning negative capacitance, 2.5 times higher energy efficiency can be achieved by NCFET than by conventional MOSFETs. Thus, NCFET is expected to be a new CMOS technology platform for ultralow power IoT.</jats:p>",

The adoption of a green supply chain involves a complex decision-making process characterized by multiple criteria. The goal of the current study is to construct a decision framework by identifying a comprehensive set of consideration factors and their causal relationships. The consideration factors are deliberately drawn from a variety of different, yet related, theories and are grouped into an extensive Technology-Organization -Environment (TOE) framework. In accordance with the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, the decision framework was analyzed for appropriateness through surveys of selected experts in the semiconductor industry. Because the semiconductor industry has a long history of heavy resource usage and has proven an early advocate of green supply chains, results from this study can provide insights to other firms with similar operations and aims. The contributions of this research are twofold. First, its theoretical contribution consists of integrating previously separate strands of different theories into a holistic framework and exploring the causal relationships among decision factors. Second, its practical contribution lies in its establishment of a strategic path that provides firms a set of priorities when adopting green supply chains.</jats:p>"

As an alternative option to pipe replacement, the use of pumps working as turbines, throttle control valves (TCVs), or pressure reduction valves (PRVs) can be used to reduce leakage. For a preassigned number of these devices, their positions and settings can be chosen to minimize the water losses in the network or to minimise the costs associated with the leakage. On the other hand, for a preassigned reduction in leakage, the number, the position and the setting of valves could be optimized in order to minimize their installation and maintenance costs. Based on these observations, a procedure for the optimal choice of the number, position and setting of PRVs is devised. The procedure is aimed at reducing the whole cost associated with water loss in urban WDSs, due to the background leakage from joints, and the purchase, installation and maintaining of the PRVs themselves. The effectiveness of the procedure, which is based on the physical modelling of leakage from pipe joints as well as on the use of a genetic algorithm, is proven using a small but realistic example.</jats:p>",

Supply chains link the activities of firms: when a host government breaks a contract with one firm, other firms in the supply chain are harmed. These partner firms therefore have incentive to protect one another’s property rights. This leads to the key implication of our argument: host governments are less likely to violate the property rights of firms that are more tightly linked with other firms in the host economy. We test our argument with cross-national data on investment arbitration, a survey of US multinational subsidiaries in Russia, and case studies from Azerbaijan. Our findings imply that one benefit of outsourcing in developing and transition economies is the creation of a network of partner firms that protect each other’s property rights.</jats:p>",

This scheme not only increases the output power of solar panels but also has a significant effect on switching loss and oscillation of solar charging. The experiment results showed that the proposed method can also significantly improve temperature rise, and that charging efficiency is also better than it is in a traditional charge mode. The results also showed that charging power was enough for solar tracking and the requirements of the charging system.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production. When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate variability associated with low volume part production and may be preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM’s long-term supply chain implications. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This invited paper explores a DDM rollout scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain reconfigurations. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production. Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Extant research largely focusses on two potential reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM’s capacity to isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts. Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration. The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw materials at generalized DDM supercenters.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Despite this important economic standing, agricultural economic research focuses more on other agricultural sectors like meat or milk supply chains. The present study aims to analyze the organization of the horticulture supply chain. In order to fill this gap in research, the impact of various management instruments on performance at an individual farm level as well as in the whole horticultural supply chain get analyzed by using the partial least square method. For this, German vegetable farmers participated in an online survey in 2013. The innovative empirical analysis thereby is based on existing literature and the contingency theory. The results show that the individual farm performance is positively influenced by factor endowment of the farms as well as by trust and business climate between the different levels of the supply chain. In contrast, the external situation of the farms does not exert any meaningful influence on farm performance but on organizational farm parameters of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Results showed that adsorption was quite vulnerable to initial threshold odor number (TON), and higher influent TON required a larger dosage. Both PAC species (derived from coal and wood) presented excellent adsorption capacity for odorants. The adsorption process versus time had three steps and the adsorption kinetics were well fitted by the second order model.

The sowing area of hybrid wheats are increasing, they may have different nutrient nitrogen utilization compared to varieties, and the question arose if it is possible to achieve same yield at lower nitrogen fertilizer application or not.&#x0D;\nThe present study analyzes the results of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from tillering growing stage. Under controlled conditions three different wheat hybrids were grown (Hywin, Hystar, Hybiza) with two different amounts of nitrogen supplies (optimal and the fourth part). The dry matter accumulation, relative chlorophyll content and nitrogen content were measured in order to draw conclusions from the different supplies of nitrogen for winter wheat genotypes and their physiological plasticity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: Workforce attitudes, such as intent to stay, leave temporarily, or exit permanently from nursing, develop at an early career stage. This paper explores the mismatch between the challenges faced by nursing graduates (of whom many belong to Generation Y) in obtaining a Registered Nurse (RN) position following graduation and the continuing shortages in nurse workforce in aged care and mental health areas.\r\nSetting: Current Australian literature reveals the discontent of university graduates seeking positions in an industry that does not make arrangements to employ graduates, but concomitantly reports workforce undersupply. Areas of nursing shortages of concern discussed in this paper are aged care and mental health nursing.\r\nPrimary argument: A number of reasons may explain why these areas are depleted of nurses: an ageing workforce, unattractive market positions for new graduate nurses and negative perceptions of the aged care and mental health sectors. Also, numerous generational negative opinions expressed in academic literature and popular media serve to discourage newly graduating nurses from working in these areas.\r\nConclusion: The paper offers potential solutions to address three main issues raised in the discussion. Firstly, addressing the shortage of new graduate positions is an effort to retain qualified but inexperienced nurses. Secondly, drawing on the pool of new graduates to supply aged care and mental health rejuvenates these specialty areas and ensures these nursing fields are well catered for. Finally, directing efforts to retain new graduate nurses is an opportunity to address the 2025 projected Australian nurse workforce shortfall.</jats:p>"

A clear bimodal (two peaks, where the first peak represented the fast developing individuals and the second peak slow developing individuals) pattern of distribution for both prey supplies was obtained, which got skewed with change in prey supply. On abundant prey supply, more fast developing individuals (139<jats:italic>M. sexmaculatus</jats:italic>and 123<jats:italic>P. dissecta</jats:italic>) were found and less (46<jats:italic>M. sexmaculatus</jats:italic>and 36<jats:italic>P. dissecta</jats:italic>) on scarce prey supply.

Unlike past studies that measure forecast error in terms of <jats:italic>forecast standard deviation</jats:italic>, our study extends research to consider the impact of <jats:italic>forecast bias</jats:italic>, and the complex interaction between these variables. Simulating a two‐stage supply chain using realistic cost data we test the impact of bias magnification comparing two scenarios: one with forecast sharing between retailer and supplier, and one without. We then corroborate findings via survey data. Results show magnification of forecast bias to have a considerably greater impact on supply chain cost than magnification of forecast standard deviation. Particularly damaging is high bias in the presence of high forecast standard deviation. Forecast sharing is found to mitigate the impact of forecast error, however, primarily at higher levels of forecast standard deviation. At low levels of forecast standard deviation the benefits are not significant suggesting that engaging in such mitigation strategies may be less effective when there is little opportunity for improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, forecast sharing is found to be much less effective against high levels of bias. This is an important finding as managers often deliberately bias their forecasts and underscores the importance of exercising caution even with forecast sharing, particularly for forecasts that have inherently large errors. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the impact of forecast errors, suggest limitations of forecast sharing, and offer implications for research and practice alike.</jats:p>",

The results indicated that nitrogen was the limiting factor for biofilm development in GAC columns for this source water. The biomass density in the column with ammonia nitrogen addition was much higher than those of the other two filters, while its microbial diversity and biological activity were lower. Moreover, the ammonia-feeding column also showed the highest removal of organic contaminants during the stable operating periods, i.e. chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), assimilable organic carbon as well as biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. Therefore, nitrogen amendment favors the formation of biofilm. It could shorten the start-up time of a GAC filter and enhance the bio-stability of its effluent. This might add some new insights towards the operation of GAC filters with low nutritional levels in the influent during winter.</jats:p>",

We measure the coping costs incurred by households in one area of rural Kenya. Sixty percent of the 387 households interviewed were collecting water outside the home, and household members were spending an average of 2–3 h doing so per day. We value these time costs using an individual‐level value of travel time estimate based on a stated preference experiment. We compare these results to estimates obtained assuming that the value of time saved is a fraction of unskilled wage rates. Coping cost estimates also include capital costs for storage and rainwater collection, money paid either to water vendors or at sources that charge volumetrically, costs of treating diarrhea cases, and expenditures on drinking water treatment (primarily boiling in our site). Median total coping costs per month are approximately US$20 per month, higher than average household water bills in many utilities in the United States, or 12% of reported monthly cash income. We estimate that coping costs are greater than 10% of income for over half of households in our sample. They are higher among larger and wealthier households, and households whose primary source is not at home. Even households with unprotected private wells or connections to an intermittent piped network spend money on water storage containers and on treating water they recognize as unsafe.</jats:p>",

However, commonly used root water uptake models only consider the stress from root zone moisture availability. There is a need to incorporate the stress from both the above-ground factors and root zone water condition. In this study, a newly developed coupled supply- and demand-induced (S&amp;D) root water uptake model is examined with measurements on two tree species, Guihua in the subtropical monsoon climate and Drooping Sheoak in the Mediterranean climate. The results show that the S&amp;D model outperforms a supply-constraint water stress function (the S-shape model) for both studied species. The S&amp;D model predicts 67% and 84% temporal variability in the measured water stress for Guihua and Drooping Sheoak, respectively. The improvement of the S&amp;D model over the S-shape model is more significant for Guihua than for Drooping Sheoak, which might be associated with the specific climate conditions. A two-step parameterization approach is adopted in this study for the S&amp;D model, and is recommended for future applications. These results further support the validity of the S&amp;D model, and should be considered for the root water uptake modeling.</jats:p>",

The grafted CA-RO membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. It was found that the contact angles were 58° and 45° for pristine CA and 15 wt% grafted CA-RO membranes, respectively, which suggest an increase in the membrane surface hydrophilicity after grafting. The morphological studies of the surface of the pristine CA-RO membrane revealed a typical ridge-and-valley morphology and displayed a relatively high surface roughness of 337 nm, and a significant decrease at 15 wt% of grafted CA-RO membrane to 7 nm. The effect of the grafting percentages of AMPSA on the water flux and salt rejection was studied using a cross flow RO unit. The salt rejection and water flux of the grafted CA-RO membrane with 15 wt% were 99.03% and 6 L/m2h, respectively.</jats:p>",

An opportunity exists to meet the needs of supply chains to increase efficiency. This research presents three propositions on how to reduce the gap between supply chain needs and satisfaction in interaction with the product and packaging system. It also proposes a supply chain focused packaging design and development method to better satisfy supply chain needs placed on packaging. An extensive literature review was conducted, and a Tetra Pak derived case study was developed. The propositions were formulated and became the basis for improving Tetra Pak's existing packaging design and development method by better integrating supply chain needs. This was accomplished by using an expanded operational life cycle perspective that includes the entire supply chain. The resulting supply chain focused packaging design, and development method enables improved supply chain efficiency while considering the product, the processes and cost.

The conditions regarding the utilization of water resources in Jiamusi in 2010 are taken as the benchmark for the model, and the supply–demand structure of urban water resources and the geographical characteristics of the region are used as the basis for its establishment. The model is divided into five subsystems described by 64 variables to simulate the supply–demand structure of the water resources in the region, as well as both the individual supply and demand structures, and thus to obtain the supply–demand conditions and the trends of variation in water resources in the short, medium and long terms. The results show that seriously unbalanced supply–demand conditions for water resources will prevail in Jiamusi in the future. By 2030, the supply–demand ratio will be only 0.5987; the level of development and utilization of surface water resources and transit water resources will be relatively low, and the groundwater resources will still be suffering excessive exploitation; the industrial water demand will be greatly increased, and agricultural development will be restricted. With a focus on the problems that may arise in the utilization of water resources at present and in the future, a proposal regarding the realization of the sustainable utilization of water resources and sustainable social and economic development in Jiamusi is presented. The outcomes of this research have important theoretical and practical significance for providing guidance regarding the scientific and reasonable utilization of water resources in Jiamusi.</jats:p>",

Silt particles with a mode of 10.7 μm diameter and fluorescein (as the dissolved tracer (DT)) were injected into the columns in short pulses. The SP transfer parameters were compared to the DT one. All the parameters (dispersivity, recovery rate, and deposition rate) obtained from the breakthrough data varied with the flow rate. The breakthrough curves were well described by an analytical solution of the advective–dispersive equation with a first-order deposition kinetic. The results showed that the transport of the SP was faster than the DT when the flow velocity reached a critical value which was different between the glass beads and quartz sand. The mean diameter of the recovered particles and the longitudinal dispersivity increase with flow rate; In addition, the recovery rate of SP is higher in the glass beads than in the quartz sand even under similar porosities.

Further, an increase in volumes of non-seasonal products reduces delays in deliveries, but for seasonal products the effect is opposite. In all, weather affects demand, lower volumes do not generally improve supply chain performance, but larger volumes can make it worse. The analysis shows that the dependence structure between demand and delay is time varying and is affected by weather conditions. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study concerns one country and leisure goods, which can limit its generalizability. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Well-managed supply chains should prepare for demand fluctuations caused by weather changes.

Serving as one of the major storage systems, optimal operation rules should be proposed promptly for Danjiangkou Reservoir, completed by a heightening project. In this paper, in order to seek out the optimal operation rules for Danjiangkou Reservoir, a multi-objective optimal operation model is developed, considering the inflow uncertainty, multi-year regulation cycle and water supply for the SNWTP. Three evaluation indexes (hydropower generation, water impoundment condition and shortage index) are adopted to assess the impacts of three influence factors (starting regulation level (SRL), inflow condition and flood control level) on Danjiangkou Reservoir operations. Finally, some critical operation strategies for Danjiangkou Reservoir are proposed. The results show that the optimal SRL for Danjiangkou Reservoir is 158 m and the recommended range of the water level at the end of the first year varies between 162–166 m (very wet), 164–166 m (wet), and 162–164 m (normal) on the basis of setting 158 m as the SRL.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the profile of <jats:italic>Penicillium</jats:italic> spp. present in the pear export chain from South Africa (SA) to the UK was studied over a four‐year period. Sampling was done at two packhouse facilities, controlled atmosphere and cold storage areas in SA and at two repack facilities and cold storages as well as a distribution centre and a retailer in the UK. Sampling consisted of swabbing walls and floors and using active and passive air sampling. In total, 5056 isolates were obtained, purified and grouped into 282 morphological groups. Of these, 350 representative isolates were selected for further identification.

We use actual vehicle data from the International Federation of the Red Cross to feed our model and provide insights into IHO secondary support demand. We find that secondary support demand for items such as vehicles is different from primary beneficiary demand for items such as water and food. When considering disaster response and development program demand simultaneously (disaster cycle management), our results illustrate that keeping a lean centralized hub configuration with an option for temporary hubs in mega disaster locations can reduce overall supply chain costs over a long time horizon. We also show that it is possible to structure a supply chain to take operational advantage of earmarked funding. This research lays the groundwork for using optimization models to analyze disaster cycle management. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it analyzes the impact of participation in the USDA Marketing Assistance Program (MAP) facilitated formal marketing channel on farm-level investments in tomato production. The analysis involves mixed method approach utilizing a case of the USDA MAP in the Armenian vegetable industry and the survey data from 427 Armenian tomato growers. The main results indicate that the tomato growers linked to USDA MAP facilitated formal marketing channel (i.e. processors) invested significantly more in expanding tomato planting area compared to growers in informal channel (i.e. direct-to-consumer markets, middleman, and barter). The lessons from the USDA MAP’s supply chain facilitation strategy and the results of quantitative analysis provide insights on incentive structures and enforcement mechanisms for designing more effective supply chain linkages.</jats:p>",

The pipe wall and sediment fractions of three locations in a distribution system were sampled and different microbiological parameters were determined. The results demonstrated that most of the active biomass in the distribution system is located in the pipe wall biofilm and the smallest sediment size fraction. Fungi were more dominantly present in the pipe wall biofilm than in the sediment, whereas Aeromonas spp. has its dominant niche in the sediment. The highest numbers of the opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus were observed in the biofilm. In contrast, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was only observed in the sediment. The results from our study demonstrate that: (i) microbial activity in the distribution system is high on the pipe wall and sediment and (ii) different microbial groups or microbial species have different dominant environmental niches in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

In the present scenario, the SMEs are under huge pressure to achieve the supply chain competitive advantage and to improve operation and logistic effectiveness and, at the same time, remain tractable to the demand uncertainty and volatility in the market. To enhance the performance of supply chain in SMEs, the managers need to identify the internal as well as the external factors that affect the supply chain performance of SMEs in India.

Batch experiments were performed to determine the rate of adsorption and equilibrium isotherms. Adsorption kinetics were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model for both As(III) and As(V). The adsorption equilibrium data fitted well to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The maximum As(V) sorption capacity was observed at an Fe:Mn ratio of 6:1 (65.0 mg/g), whereas maximum As(III) uptake was at Fe:Mn ratio 3:1 (46.9 mg/g). Arsenic levels in real water samples were reduced from 37 μg/l to below the EU Water Framework Directive limit (10 μg/L) after treatment with Fe–Mn adsorbents.</jats:p>",

Considering this, the study analyzes the automobile industry in India, both to explore the barriers of green supply chain and to classify them. To do so, a legitimate method of mathematical modelling—interpretive structural modelling— is used. The study has identified thirteen barriers based on the extensive literature, and has added one, with reference to expert opinion. It has been found that six attributes are dependent barriers, five are driver barriers and three are linkage barriers. The study holds significant implications at the firm level, for production processes and the green supply chain system, especially in automobile manufacturing firms. The identified relationship between these barriers may help organizations overcome them in order to implement an effective and efficient green supply chain management (GSCM) system. </jats:p>",

As an effective tool for hedging against the risks, option contracts, including call, put, and bidirectional option contracts, have been proved to benefit two members in a one‐supplier and one‐retailer supply chain under inflation. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of different option contacts on the decisions and performances for both the supplier and the retailer under inflation. Our results suggest that the retailer prefers adopting portfolio contracts with bidirectional options under inflation, whereas the supplier is inclined to provide call option contracts under inflation. Our study also reveals that call option contracts are implemented ultimately by the supply chain under inflation because of the supplier's market dominant position.</jats:p>",

Identification resulted in nine species of fungi and four species of yeasts being listed: Bjerkandera, Penicillium, Paraconiothyrium, Paecilomyces, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus. Although yeasts showed higher traceability than filamentous fungi, the fungal genus Penicillium had relevance by both traceability (six species) and its role in mycotoxin generation. From volatile organic compound (VOC) mycotoxins and extracts analysis from P. ochrochloron and P. purpurogenum water–M9 culture, six groups were identified: phenols, alcohols, alkenes, monoterpenes, aldehydes and alkanes, phenols being the predominant group (2,4-bis(1,1-dimethyl)phenol 40–88%). P. ochrochloron water culture and M9 culture reported signals of toxicity: the first one as genotoxic for 0.5 y 1 mg/mL mycotoxin extract and the second one as cytotoxic. M9 media promoted a higher number of compounds in both species and a decrease in phenol predominance in P. ochrochloron but not in P. Purpurogenum. The results showed Penicillium and Debaryomyces as prevalent filamentous fungi and yeast in assessed networks, suggesting that these could be indicators of fungi and yeast presence in drinking water systems.</jats:p>",

Though there has been a great deal of research into the theoretical optimization of large-scale power systems, research into the use of an existing power system as a foundation for this growth has yet to be fully explored. Current successful and robust power generation systems that have significant renewable energy penetration—despite not having been optimized a priori—can be used to inform the advancement of modern power systems to accommodate the increasing demand for electricity. This work explores how an accurate and state-of-the-art computational model of a large, regional energy system can be employed as part of an overarching power systems optimization scheme that looks to inform the decision making process for next generation power supply systems. Research scenarios that explore an introductory multi-objective power flow analysis for a case study involving a regional portion of a large grid will be explored, along with a discussion of future research directions.</jats:p>",

The needs in this sector are considerable, financial resources are scarce and, as a result, the Millennium Development Goals are still off track to be achieved. An integrated approach was applied to estimate the investments needs, considering differentiated levels of service depending on the urban area characteristics and taking into consideration the household income limitations, in order to achieve an economically sustainable increase in coverage and service level. The work developed resulted in an action plan aligned with the national strategy vision and adaptable to every city and town of Mozambique, including two decision support tools to enable stakeholders' decision making on potential investments: the Water and Wastewater Database (Base de Informação de Água e Saneamento) and the Dynamic Economic tool to support investments in water supply and sanitation services.</jats:p>",

When a sensor node is depleted of energy, it becomes unresponsive and disconnected from the network that can significantly influence the performance of the whole network. The purpose of the present research is to create a power supply management module in order to provide stable operating voltage for autonomous operations of radio signal repeaters, sensors or gateways of WSN. The developed management module is composed of a solar panel, lithium battery and power supply management module. The novelty of the research is the management module, which ensures stable and uninterrupted operations of electronic equipment in various power supply modes in different situations, simultaneously ensuring energy protection and sustainability of the module components. The management module is able to provide power supply of 5 V for electronics scheme independently, without power interruption switching between power sources and power flows in different directions.</jats:p>",

On the contrary, the effect of burial position was reversed for the root fragments. Shoot/root fragments of 15 cm in length in horizontal burial position were then subjected to two different fragment diameters (0.5 and 2.0 cm) and four types of nutrient supplies (without nutrient, low frequency, high frequency and patchy).

O'Shaughnessy Dam, located in Yosemite National Park, has been identified as a possible candidate for dam removal. It is a component of San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy System and is operated for water supply and hydropower. This article describes a spatially scaled approach to analyze water reliability without O'Shaughnessy Dam, but with improved water conveyance between the Hetch Hetchy System and existing reservoirs and aqueducts at the watershed, regional Bay Area, and statewide scales. It broadens previous research to highlight larger scale implications of removing O'Shaughnessy Dam and evaluates the role of improved water conveyance for water management. CALifornia Value Integrated Network, a large‐scale hydro‐economic model evaluates intertied water management using estimated urban and agricultural water demands for year 2050 with 72‐year historical and warm, dry hydrologic conditions. Results suggest that O'Shaughnessy Dam can be removed with additional conveyance at any spatial scale while maintaining water reliability. With a warm, dry climate, water reliability, and storage decline, indicating removing O'Shaughnessy Dam may have less effect on water management than climate change when conveyance is improved between the Hetch Hetchy System and nearby systems. Improving water conveyance can sometimes substitute for water storage in storage‐rich watersheds.</jats:p>",

The crop species were cultivated simultaneously side‐by‐side in the following rotation: potato (<jats:italic>Solanum tuberosum</jats:italic>L.), silage maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic>L.), spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic>L.), beet (<jats:italic>Beta vulgaris</jats:italic>L.), and spring barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic>L.). The treatment with 133 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>supply had a nearly balanced K budget. In the treatments with lower supply, the soil delivered K from its mineral constituents. On the low‐K plots (especially on those with only 5 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), crops suffered yield depressions of nearly all main harvest products (cereal grains, potato tubers, beet storage roots, silage maize) and by‐products (straw, beet leaves) by up to 40.7% of dry matter. Only wheat grains were an exception. Potassium concentrations in the harvested plant parts decreased nearly in parallel to the reduction of their dry matter yields, with the exception of cereal grains, which kept stable concentrations even in the treatment with only 5 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. A comparison of four year‐pairs with differing levels of precipitation in yield‐relevant periods showed an average water shortage‐induced depression of dry matter yields by 19.7% in the main harvest products. The severity of this yield depression was not mitigated by elevated K supply, with the exception of beet leaves, where the dry matter production was stabilized by high K supply. In this crop, the reduction of storage‐root yield was associated with a decrease in harvest index and was therefore obviously caused by an inhibition of assimilate translocation from the leaves into these organs, in contrast to cereals, where water shortage primarily affected dry matter production in vegetative organs. It is concluded that the physiological causes of yield reduction by drought stress and the possibility of its amelioration by K supply differ between plant species and organs.</jats:p>",

The literature emphasizes that solving environmental problems requires extensive technological change. On the other hand, due to higher prices the market push is weaker. Regulatory factors are therefore designed to stimulate environmental innovations. The relative influence of these three categories on project performance is investigated on the basis of a sample of 128 German collaborative energy innovation projects in the development phase using a scale-based approach and structural equation modeling at the firm level.

To date, there have not been any studies on the attitude of farmers towards the alternative use of sugar beets in biogas plants. We, therefore, investigated how substrate supply contracts should be designed that farmers agree to cultivate sugar beets for biogas. Due to the lack of farm-level data, we conducted an online-survey including a Discrete Choice Experiment with 118 German farmers. Our results show that the participating farmers react with re-straint to contract sugar beets for biogas. If farmers opt for a supply contract of beet as biogas substrate, they prefer a short contract period and small-scale cultivation. A spring harvest of sugar beets is generally rejected.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we consider carbon transfer cost and carbon holding cost in a supply chain. A multiperiod dynamic programming model with carbon footprint constraints is presented to investigate the impact of carbon transfer cost and carbon holding cost on inventory control policy as well as the supply chain coordination problem. A two‐control limit inventory control policy is proved to be optimal and a contract with wholesale price, subsidy, and fixed setup cost is verified analytically to coordinate the supply chain. Finally, a numerical study is conducted to reveal managerial insights. We find that when the supply chain is coordinated, the chain's profit is more sensitive to carbon transfer cost while inventory level is more sensitive to carbon holding cost. Additionally, because of the complexity of the coordinated contract, when it is not easy to coordinate the supply chain, it is better to keep the values of wholesale price, subsidy, and fixed setup cost below the corresponding values for the coordinated supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Outsourcing stretches supply chains longer with added contract manufacturers responsible for the manufacturing of parts and final products. Should a firm change its quality management approach as its supply chain becomes longer with outsourced manufacturing? This paper studies a brand owner's optimal choice between two commonly used quality management approaches: an inspection‐based approach and an external failure‐based approach, in two supply chains – a dyadic supply chain and a multi‐level supply chain where the brand owner outsources manufacturing to an independent contract manufacturer. Our study finds that the brand owner's optimal choice between the two quality management approaches could be opposite in the two supply chains. Specifically, we show that if agency costs exist between the contract manufacturer and the brand owner, the brand owner may prefer an inspection‐based approach in the multi‐level supply chain in contrast to preferring an external failure‐based approach in the dyadic supply chain. In particular, inspections can be effective for the brand owner to limit the manufacturer's profit by excluding defective finished products and components, which in turn reduce agency costs in the multi‐level supply chain. Hence, the efficiency of an inspection‐based approach relative to an external failure‐based approach can be higher in the multi‐level supply chain as compared to the dyadic one. Our findings suggest that firms should adjust to changes in supply chain structures and re‐evaluate the efficiencies of different quality management approaches accordingly. </jats:p>",

When nonpharmacologic interventions to increase milk supply fail, clinicians are faced with limited options. There is no current evidence to support the use of herbal galactogogues in this population and a black box warning for metoclopramide for potential serious side effects. Thus, domperidone was the only known, effective option for treatment of low milk supply in this population. With a thorough review of the literature on domperidone and coordination with the obstetrical, neonatal, lactation, and pharmacology teams, a domperidone treatment protocol for mothers of hospitalized premature infants with insufficient milk supply was developed at our institution and is presented in this article. A comprehensive understanding of domperidone for use as a galactogogue with a standard treatment protocol will facilitate safer prescribing practices and minimize potential adverse reactions in mothers and their hospitalized premature infants. </jats:p>",

The effect of calcium removal by water softening (&amp;lt;1.0 mg Ca2+.L−1) under real-world drinking water conditions on biofilm formation was studied in a pilot plant with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and in a laboratory-scale biofilm production unit (BPU) with plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-P) and glass as substratum. The results showed a halving of the exponential biofouling rate in the RO membrane and also a halving of the exponential carbohydrate (CH) production rate in the biofilm on PVC-P and glass in the BPU by softening of the water. In PVC-P biofilms, softening did not affect adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) production and bacterial species composition (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis). At low substrate concentrations in glass and RO membrane biofilms softening reduced significantly ATP and CH production and changed the species composition on the membrane. The importance of the two hypothesized physical or physiological mechanisms as causes for the observed Ca2+ effect on biofilm formation and the effect of Ca2+ concentration on those, needs further studies.</jats:p>",

We have previously argued that water resources planning should focus upon metrics of risk of water restrictions, accompanied by extensive simulation and scenario‐based exploration of uncertainty. However, the results of optimization subject to risk constraints can be sensitive to the specification of tolerable risk, which may not be precisely or consistently defined by different stakeholders. In this paper, we recast the water resources planning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem to identify least cost schemes that satisfy a set of criteria for tolerable risk, where tolerable risk is defined in terms of the frequency of water use restrictions of different levels of severity. Our proposed method links a very large ensemble of climate model projections to a water resource system model and a multiobjective optimization algorithm to identify a Pareto optimal set of water resource management plans across a 25 years planning period. In a case study application to the London water supply system, we identify water resources management plans that, for a given financial cost, maximize performance with respect to one or more probabilistic criteria. This illustrates trade‐offs between financial costs of plans and risk, and between risk criteria for four different severities of water use restrictions. Graphical representation of alternative sequences of investments in the Pareto set helps to identify water management options for which there is a robust case for including them in the plan.</jats:p>",

The buyer periodically orders each type of item from the suppliers according to a select inventory control policy. Processing the order, each supplier enforces the policy that an order from the buyer must meet a predetermined minimum order quantity (MOQ). Therefore, the buyer must decide how much to order from each supplier considering the current inventory level, demand forecast, and MOQ requirement. The buyer's problem is formulated as an integer programming model and an efficient implementation strategy is suggested to apply the model to real problems. Numerical experiments are performed to test the validity of the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the implementation strategy. The experimental results show that this model combined with the implementation method yields a considerable cost reduction compared to the most efficient policy currently available.</jats:p>",

Many such approaches focus exclusively on a limited range of peptide lengths, typically 9 aa and sometimes 9–10 aa, despite multiple examples of dominant epitopes of other lengths. In this study, we examined whether epitope predictions can be improved by incorporating the natural length distribution of HLA class I ligands. We found that, although different HLA alleles have diverse length-binding preferences, the length profiles of ligands that are naturally presented by these alleles are much more homogeneous. We hypothesized that this is due to a defined length profile of peptides available for HLA binding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on this, we created a model of HLA allele–specific ligand length profiles and demonstrate how this model, in combination with HLA-binding predictions, greatly improves comprehensive identification of CD8+ T cell epitopes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Current treatment for newly diagnosed patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and iron overload consist of weekly phlebotomy or less frequent and more personalized erythrocytapheresis. Previous observations during phlebotomy suggest an increase in intestinal iron uptake caused by lowering of hepcidin as a result of intensive bloodletting. It is not known whether such an effect is present or even more pronounced using erythrocytapheresis since a larger amount of iron is extracted per procedure. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of erythrocytapheresis on the course of iron parameters, with special focus on serum hepcidin. We performed a retrospective proof‐of‐principle observational study, comparing serum iron parameters in 12 males during the depletion phase using either phlebotomy (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 6) or erythrocytapheresis (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 6). Decreases in serum ferritin over time were similar for both treatments but more pronounced using erythrocytapheresis when expressed per treatment procedure. Hemoglobin did not change during erythrocytapheresis, whereas during phlebotomy decreased with 10%. Increase of erythropoietin and soluble transferrin receptor and decrease in transferrin saturation were similar for both treatments. Reduction in serum hepcidin was higher (50% versus 25% of initial value) and occurred more early using phlebotomy (10 versus 20 weeks after start). In aggregate, compared to phlebotomy, the less frequent and more personalized erythrocytapheresis leads to a more pronounced decrease in serum ferritin per treatment procedure, without a larger decrease in serum hepcidin. This may be clinically relevant and may prevent an increase in intestinal iron uptake and an ensuing vicious circle of more frequent treatment procedures. J. Clin.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Unlike previous studies that have revealed a link between quality improvement programs and organizational culture typologies in individual companies, this study describes organizational culture dimensions that affect the use of quality improvement tools and methodologies and how both affect supply chain company performance. Structural equation modeling methods are applied to a sample of 200 organizations in the supply chain of a Canadian multinational company. The results show that employee promotion and investment constitutes the most influential cultural dimension. Organizational objectives and an employee reward system individually affect Kaizen. When the level of formalization in an organization is high, Kaizen and total quality management tools are used more intensively. When the level of formalization is low, lean manufacturing and internal audits are used more intensively. Superior communication in an organization causes plan–do–check–act approaches, lean manufacturing methods, corrective actions and internal audits to be used less intensively. Generally speaking, most quality improvement tools and methodologies positively influence business performance. These results suggest that organizations can improve business performance levels by selecting appropriate quality improvement programs depending on existing organizational culture dimensions and may thereby develop an organizational culture that enables successful quality improvements in a supply chain context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article connects the science of sustainability theory with applied aspects of sustainability deployment. A suite of 35 sustainability indicators spanning 12 environmental and socioeconomic categories has been proposed for comparing the sustainability of bioenergy production systems across different feedstock types and locations. Information on sustainability indicators and associated measurements for the feedstock production and logistics portions of the biofuel supply chain was available from a recent demonstration‐scale switchgrass‐to‐ethanol production system located in East Tennessee. Knowledge pertaining to the available indicators was distributed within a hierarchical decision tree framework to generate an assessment of the overall sustainability of this no‐till switchgrass production system relative to two alternative business‐as‐usual scenarios of unmanaged pasture and tilled corn production. The relative contributions of the social, economic, and environmental information were determined for the overall trajectory of this bioenergy system's sustainability under each scenario. The results show that, within this East Tennessee context, switchgrass production is an attractive option for improving environmental and social sustainability trajectories without adverse economic impacts, which can lead to enhanced sustainability overall. Although external trade does not yet exist for this switchgrass commodity, our economic modeling indicates that switchgrass production can still be beneficial to the counties surrounding the biorefinery in terms of dollars earned and jobs created. The opportunity to use inactive equipment and laborers is a potential benefit captured indirectly by the sustainability evaluation framework. Given the early stage of cellulosic ethanol production, it is currently difficult to determine quantitative values for all 35 proposed sustainability indicators across the entire biofuel supply chain. This case study demonstrates that integration of qualitative sustainability indicator ratings may increase holistic understanding of a bioenergy system in the absence of complete information.</jats:p>",

Five heifers (<jats:italic>Bos taurus</jats:italic> × <jats:italic>Bos indicus</jats:italic>) with an average live weight of 295 ± 19 kg were allotted to five treatments consisting of increasing levels of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content> (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4% <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content>/kg <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DM</jats:styled-content>) in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Dry matter intake (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DMI</jats:styled-content>) was similar (p &gt; 0.05) between treatments containing 0, 1, 2 and 3% of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content>/kg <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DM</jats:styled-content> and it was reduced (p &lt; 0.05) to 4% <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content> (5.71 kg <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DM</jats:styled-content>/day) with respect to that observed with 0% <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CT</jats:styled-content> (6.65 kg <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DM</jats:styled-content>/day). Nitrogen balance, purine derivatives excretion in urine, microbial protein synthesis and efficiency of synthesis of microbial nitrogen in the rumen were not affected (p ≥ 0.05) by the increase in the levels of condensed tannins in the ration. Energy loss as <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CH</jats:styled-content><jats:sub>4</jats:sub> was on average 2.7% of the gross energy consumed daily.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A common problem faced by many firms in their supply chains can be abstracted as follows. Periodically, or at the beginning of some selling season, the firm needs to distribute finished goods to a set of stocking locations, which, in turn, supply customer demands. Over the selling season, if and when there is a supply‐demand mismatch somewhere, a re‐distribution or transshipment will be needed. Hence, there are two decisions involved: the one‐time stocking decision at the beginning of the season and the supply/transshipment decision throughout the season. Applying a stochastic dynamic programming formulation to a two‐location model with compound Poisson demand processes, we identify the optimal supply/transshipment policy and show that the optimal initial stocking quantities can be obtained via maximizing a concave function whereas the contribution of transshipment is of order square‐root‐of T. Hence, in the context of high‐volume, fast‐moving products, the initial stocking quantity decision is a much more important contributor to the overall profit. The bounds also lead to a heuristic policy, which exhibits excellent performance in our numerical study; and we further prove both the bounds and the heuristic policy are asymptotically optimal when T approaches infinity. Extension to multiple locations is also discussed. </jats:p>",
