Two additional lines will run from the Progreso booster station to the towns of Chelen and Chicxulub located, respectively, west and east of Progreso. Because of construction problems, all pipe is laid at a depth of about 2 ft, which is sufficient to provide traffic protection. Asbestos‐cement pipe is primarily used throughout the system. Control of the booster stations within Merida will be by means of magnetic couplings on the pumps, so that the pressure conditions will always meet the demand. Elevated storage, located at Progreso, Chelen, and Chicxulub, will fill the reservoirs and shut down the system at times of low flow.</jats:p>",

This report is limited primarily to engineering considerations as it is expected that subsequent papers by state and federal health personnel will describe the epidemiology in full. The report does, however, present limited epidemiologic data to provide background information and to support reasoning on which engineering investigations were based. Elements discussed in the article related to the engineering investigation include a sanitary survey, hydraulic analysis, reservoir examination, inspection of wells, and findings of the well study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a methodology to evaluate various aspects of logistics supply support of space bases. It is assumed that there exists at the space base a schedule of operations that reflects the day-to-day living, build-up, and scientific experimental activities that are to be carried on. These activities, in turn, set a series of demands or requirements for products over a time spectrum. The supply system must deliver products so as to meet the amounts and times of the product requirements. Each product or module has an earliest and latest time by which it must be delivered. A mathematical model is developed that plans a series of trips, the dates at which each is to be sent, and the composition of the cargoes on each trip that satisfy the series of requirements over a time spectrum imposed by the activities at the space base. The series of trips are an expression of an efficient plan that simultaneously considers demands for different products at different future times and observes the various constraints of the system (e.g., cargo capacity of spaceships). The mathematical formulation of this scheduling problem is a simple nonlinear discrete programming problem. An algorithm has been developed for its solution, and a description thereof is presented. The model is illustrated by showing how it would supply a long-term lunar base. Various uses of the model are described. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The blood supply to the periodontal membrane of 84 human tooth sockets was studied by determining the number and size of the perforations in the alveolar wall. A special impression and duplication technique was used to produce a relief of the alveolar wall. This was next drawn on paper in a stereo‐microscope. By means of the measure‐and‐weigh method, calculations were made of the number and size of perforations per unit surface area in different regions of each alveolus and in different alveoli, and of the number of perforations per sq. mm. After it had been demonstrated that, in the rat, correlation existed in the alveolar wall between both the number and the size of perforations and the vessels that they carry, the size and the number of perforations were taken as a measure of the blood supply to the periodontal membrane.</jats:p><jats:p>The results, which were all tested statistically, showed that the blood supply to the periodontal membrane increases gradually from tooth to tooth towards the posterior sections of the dentition, and this increase is similar in both jaws. The blood supply of the individual periodontal membrane is greatest in the gingival and least in the middle third. There are no significant differences in the blood supply to the four surfaces of a socket.</jats:p><jats:p>The number of small perforations with a diameter of less than 150 μ is considerably greater than the number of large ones, and the latter are most frequently located in the gingival and apical thirds of the alveolus. The significance of these findings is discussed.</jats:p>",

The anastomosis between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries and hence the ability of the superior thyroid artery to supply a portion of the oesophagus, was noted. In general, the blood supply of the entire oesophagus was adequate with free anastomosis between its various branches. Nevertheless, it will not tolerate extensive mobilization during surgery. The relatively unsafe sites for anastomosis have been pointed out. The influence of haemodynamics has not been taken into account, in this review, and may be worthy of further investigation.</jats:p>",
