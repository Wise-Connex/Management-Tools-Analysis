Two farm models are developed, one with a fixed laborconstraint, the other with a rising labor supply-curve; these are contrasted with a third model of an unconstrained farm. The constrained (free labor) and unconstrained (slave labor) models successfully predict several salient differences between northern and southern agriculture and industry.</jats:p>",

Half of the N‐deficient root system was supplied with either high NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N or high NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N for 16 hours or 6 days before <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> labeling of the shoots.</jats:p><jats:p>The distribution of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C in sugars, ethanol‐soluble nitrogen and organic acids in roots appeared to be related to the N content of the tissue. Supply of high NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N for 6 days resulted in significant internal translocation of N into the low N supplied root half. Both root halves also had similar patterns of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C distribution among soluble and insoluble metabolites. However, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N supply for 6 days did not result in a significant increase of N in the low N supplied roots, thus only the high NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N supplied roots displayed stimulated sugar metabolism, similar to that in both root halves in the high NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N supply treatment.</jats:p><jats:p>Percent transport of <jats:sub>14</jats:sub>C assimilates from shoot to root was influenced by form and level of N supplied to root halves. Root halves supplied with either high N source for 6 days accumulated greater amounts of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C assimilate than the corresponding low N root half. However NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N supply appeared to make roots stronger sinks since NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> supply resulted in significantly greater <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C accumulation in both the high NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> supplied and the low N root halves than did NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N supply in corresponding root halves.</jats:p><jats:p>The data suggest that factors other than root metabolism, such as N mediated metabolism in the shoot, may also influence the percent transport of assimilates to the root. Internal distribution of the incoming assimilate within the root system could be regulated by the metabolic activity or assimilate demand of the roots.</jats:p>",
