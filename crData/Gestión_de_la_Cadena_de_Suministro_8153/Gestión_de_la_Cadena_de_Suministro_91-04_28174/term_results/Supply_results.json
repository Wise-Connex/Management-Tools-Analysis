One of the major problems with which city authorities had to deal was the maintenance of adequate supplies of water to satisfy the domestic, public, recreational, and industrial demands of the inhabitants. The Romans were particularly renowned for their hydraulic technology in general and the construction of aqueducts in particular, often bringing water from great distances. The geographer Strabo praised the engineering skills of the Romans, maintaining that veritable rivers of water flowed by means of aqueducts through the city of Rome. Close on a century later the first curator of Rome's water supply and one-time military governor of Britain, Sextus Julius Frontinus stated the same, if a little more pointedly, when he compared the achievements of the Romans in the field of water supply with the ‘idle pyramids of the Egyptians or the glorious but useless monuments of the Greeks’.</jats:p>",

The initial erosive impact of these floods and subsequent constructional effects are examined along the Burdekin and Barron delta coasts. Human interference in the coastal catchments has caused increased sediment yield especially with extensive clearance of tropical rainforest and with some agricultural practices; but when dams and weirs trap sediment and sand is extracted from river beds a decrease occurs.</jats:p>",

Grain yield was limited mostly by sink capacity, with little variation in single grain weight among cultivars, but an old cultivar showed some ability to adjust single grain weight. Sink capacity was very sensitive to variation in assimilate supply immediately after anthesis. Reduction in assimilate supply in the anthesis to early grain filling period reduced filled grain percentage and grain yield, particularly in high yielding cultivars with a large number of grains per panicle.</jats:p>",

In 1989, the initial spring growth of leaves was independent of the current N supply at either 1.0 or 6.0 mol N m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, and depended only upon the N supplied in 1988. A net loss of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N from perennial tissues and recovery of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N in the growing leaves confirmed that the current N supply had no effect on the remobilization of N from winter stores in the roots and stem.

Plants preconditioned to 6.0 mol N m <jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>in 1988, but receiving only 1.0 mol N m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>in 1989, were unable to sustain previous leaf growth after 22 May and there was a decrease in leaf mass and area due to leaf abscission.

Although leaf number increased, mean area per leaf decreased.</jats:p><jats:p>The trees were inefficient at withdrawing N from senescing leaves in both years, allowing most of the N to fall from the tree with the leaves.

The resulting network has become known as the Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme. The expansion of the Scheme is currently under consideration. An ex ante cost benefit analysis of the proposed expansion is undertaken. An earlier analysis which focused on the benefits of the reduced necessity to cart water was rejected by farmer groups because of the inability of the analysis to properly account for domestic benefits and risk reduction. To overcome these criticisms a hedonic model of farm land values is formulated in which the independent variables are the characteristics of a property, including whether or not the property is connected to the Scheme. The implicit marginal price (or value) of Scheme connection is then derived. An advantage of this technique is that it estimates the value that the farmers allocate to Scheme water in the market place. The conclusion is that the benefits of Scheme water are considerably less than the costs.</jats:p>",
