      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article develops a theoretical conceptualization of supply chain uncertainty, based on the foundation provided by contingency theory, classical organization theory, and information processing theory. We develop a theoretical analogy between a supply chain and an organization, then highlight key differences, which leads us to hypothesize that there are three key types of supply chain uncertainty. Micro‐level uncertainty is based on the variability of inputs to the technical core of a supply chain, corresponding to the traditional operationalization of uncertainty in the supply chain and operations management literature. Meso‐level uncertainty is the lack of information needed by a supply chain member, corresponding to the information processing theory perspective. This is often due to the conflicting pressures of differentiation and interdependence in a supply chain, where members may withhold information that they feel could compromise their interests. Macro‐level uncertainty, based on the equivocality construct, is related to unclear and ambiguous situations faced by supply chain members in rapidly changing external environments. We propose that all three types of uncertainty coexist in a supply chain and may interact with each other. Based on contingency theory's focus on alignment of process and structure with the environment, we test the relationship among supply chain integration (process), centralization, formalization and flatness (organization structure) and the dimensions of uncertainty (environment). Hypotheses are tested using hierarchical regression on data collected from 339 globally distributed manufacturing plants. It reveals that, as hypothesized, micro‐level and meso‐level uncertainty are positively related to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCI</jats:styled-content> and that macro‐level uncertainty is inversely related to it. The organization structure variables of centralization and formalization had a moderating effect, strengthening or reducing the main effects of uncertainty. The results are discussed in terms of their consistency with the theoretical foundation, implications for decision makers facing supply chain uncertainty and future research opportunities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relational contracts are key to supply chain collaboration. The literature has focused on the role of trust stemming from prior business with current suppliers. However, the role of expected future business volume on the make‐or‐buy decision has been relatively neglected. This paper contributes to the literature by examining how the level of expected future business volume affects the make‐or‐buy decision, that is, the choice to produce the product or service internally rather than to outsource it. Using regression analysis of secondary data from 12,272 construction projects and controlling for endogeneity, our results show that expected future business volume promotes outsourcing and that this impact is larger when the level of prior business with external suppliers is stronger and there is more specificity in the relationship. Our results are consistent with a game theoretic logic in which informally promising future interactions to sustain collaboration is more credible to external suppliers than to internal units because the former can use their assets elsewhere. Also, our results suggest that trust stemming from prior business reinforces the calculativeness logic that stems from the expectation of future business.</jats:p>",

The water supply network is a demonstration site of Vitens, a Dutch water company that has several district metering areas where flow, pressure, electrical conductance and temperature are measured and logged online. Three different machine learning approaches are tested for their feasibility to detect anomalies. In the first approach, day-dependent support vector regression (SVR) models are trained for predicting the measurement signals and compared to straightforward models using mean and median estimates, respectively. Using SVRs or the averaged data as real-time pattern recognizers on all available signals, large leakages can be detected. The second approach utilizes adaptive orthogonal projections and reports an event when the number of hidden variables required to describe the streaming data to a user-defined degree (energy-level threshold) increases. As a third approach, (unsupervised) clustering techniques are applied to detect anomalies and underlying patterns from the raw data streams. Preliminary results indicate that the current dataset is too limited in the amount of events and patterns to harness the potential of these techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing popularity of service‐based strategies among manufacturers, such as solution provision, makes service triads commonplace within business. While there is some consensus that “relational” (i.e., close or collaborative) relationships are beneficial for the performance of individual actors and the triad as a whole, there is little known about what exactly affects the service performance of an actor in these triads. In this study, we investigate the influence of the manufacturer–service supplier relationship on the performance of the service supplier toward the manufacturer's customers. As this phenomenon is causally complex and context dependent, we assume that there will be alternative configurations of relationship characteristics and contingent factors that lead to high service performance. To uncover potential configurations, we deployed fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis, on data collected from 38 triads within the network of a large <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">A</jats:styled-content>nglo‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">G</jats:styled-content>erman commercial vehicle manufacturer. Our research shows that—in this context—superior service performance cannot be generalized to one relationship configuration and is also contingent upon exogenous factors—that is, contract support and service site size. We uncovered four “core” configurations of relationship dimensions and two exogenous factors. Three of the configurations exhibited relational properties, while the fourth configuration had transactional properties. This is counter to extant research findings. We extend the perspective that within triads, service performance is not an outcome of a single “close,” or “collaborative” relationship and is a combination of multiple configurations consisting of varying relationship dimensions and exogenous factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To minimize negative consequences, bad products must be removed quickly once found within supply chains. This makes traceability—the ability to track the flow of a product—a key issue. Unfortunately, firms struggle to create traceability and little interdisciplinary research has been conducted in this area. Accordingly, we conducted a grounded theory investigation that transcends functional and organizational boundaries. Although past literature tends to consider a firm's ability to trace products as one‐dimensional and inherently good or bad, we find that a firm's ability to trace products varies based on contextual factors. Specifically, our study reveals that traceability is hindered by temporality (i.e., time pressures that strain a firm's ability to track products), supply chain permeation (i.e., supply chain flow characteristics that represent the degree of bad product infiltration), and product information ambiguity (i.e., product characteristics that create vagueness about what to trace). We provide prescriptive advice about how firms can overcome these traceability barriers and thus enhance their ability to identify and recall tainted products. Broadly, our findings support the need to manage traceability from a nuanced approach and to seek boundary‐spanning supply chain solutions.</jats:p>",

The results of the research showed that the reuse of post-coagulation sludge was an effective method to maintain high and stable coagulation effectiveness under both polyaluminium chloride (PACl) overdose and underdose conditions. Recycled sludge contains a large portion of insoluble aluminium hydroxides that could be utilized in underdose PACl conditions. Post-coagulation sludge recycled to a flocculation tank enabled the reduction of a dose of low basicity PACl by 15% compared to a dose required in conventional coagulation. In periods of coagulant overdosing, sludge addition prevented an increase in the number of fine particles in an outflow from sedimentation tanks that could not be retained in a filter bed.</jats:p>",

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested.

With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Findings</jats:title><jats:p>We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1.

This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE).

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The offshore wind industry is experiencing significant global growth and with the first offshore wind project in the United States currently under construction, the budding U.S. market is poised for growth. One of the significant differentiators between new entrant markets such as the U.S. and the established European market, is the existence of an established and relatively mature supply chain. Even with the developed supply chain in Europe, there is still significant opportunity for cost reduction and effective supply chain management can be a key factor for realizing these opportunities. Construction of offshore wind projects requires a robust supply chain management system to manage the complex logistics and flows of goods and services. The serial nature of the manufacturing and installation of offshore wind farm components combined with the large sizes of the components necessitates specialized equipment and approaches to supply chain management. In emerging markets such as the U.S., additional challenges associated with vessel restrictions (e.g the Jones Act[1] and the Cargo Preference Act[2]), port infrastructure limitations, and limited domestic manufacturing of key components increase the need for strong supply chain management to ensure successful projects. The installation and transportation infrastructure, equipment, and logistics represent critical areas of the supply chain and there are numerous areas where the U.S. market can build upon experience from European experience. As the offshore wind industry develops in North America, effective supply chain management will be critical to delivering the first projects and ensuring offshore wind can be a competitive contributor to the energy supply mix.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the majority of textbooks supply inadequate information and illustrations can be misleading in many instances. None of the textbooks describe a segmental pattern of blood supply when in actual fact a basic segmental pattern does exist. The reason for inadequate information is the perpetuation of facts since the work of the pioneers Cooper and Manchot from one textbook to another. A paucity of research studies thereafter and the fact that the results of some of these studies did not find their way into textbooks is another contributing factor.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The findings of research studies since the descriptions by Cooper and Manchot are analyzed and compared in an effort to find common ground and its clinical implication.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Researchers concurred on the main sources of blood supply; these are internal thoracic, lateral thoracic, anterior intercostal, and acromiothoracic (thoracoacromial) arteries.

Since then, technologies for the construction and use of several types of cisterns have been developed. In Crete during the Minoan era, water cisterns were very well practiced as a basic means for water supply in several settlements. The Minoan water cistern technologies were further developed, mainly by enlargement of the scale of water systems, at subsequent stages of the Hellenic civilizations. Furthermore, more advanced water cistern technologies were invented, with a peak during the Hellenistic period which followed Alexander the Great, during which time they spread over a geographical area from Hellas to the west and to the east. The Romans inherited the cistern technologies and further developed them mainly by changing their application scale from small to large. Characteristic paradigms of Cretan cisterns are considered which justify the significance of that technology for water supply in areas with low water availability during the whole Cretan history. Herein, nowadays climatic conditions and water resources management in Crete are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

A centralized, a decentralized, and a joint bargaining coordination decision models in a PV supply chain are formulated and analyzed. Using the world PV industry data, the numerical and sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the impact of key parameters on the decision models. The research result has shown that a joint bargaining coordination mechanism is optimal for the studied PV supply chain. Both a PV system assembler and a c-Si module supplier gain more profit from the joint bargaining coordination model than that from either the centralized or the decentralized decision model.

Due to poor economic situation and lack of law implementation, most wastewaters in Serbia are released directly into a surface water recipient without any, or a limited, treatment. This practice has created numerous highly polluted surface waters in the region. Therefore, we conducted seasonal monitoring of the bacteriological quality of the Nišava River located in southeastern Serbia in order to assess the extent of its organic and faecal pollution. A total number of heterotrophs, Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci counts were determined by standard cultivation methods in samples from five locations along the river. In most instances, bacteriological quality of Nišava water belonged to the classes of low or moderate organic and faecal pollution. The samples taken downstream of the city of Niš were the most polluted. Intestinal enterococci and E. coli counts indicated a moderate faecal contamination. Since bacterial counts can reveal a presence of faecal pollution and therefore presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, a proper microbiological monitoring of surface waters used as a source of drinking water, like the Nišava River itself, is critically important.</jats:p>",

In our model buyer makes the promotional decision and undertakes the promotional sales effort cost. It is shown that in decentralized channel the results are sub-optimal. It is found analytically that the revenue-sharing contract coordinates pricing decision but not promotional decision for all values of the promotional effort cost. It is also found that the cost-sharing contract fails to coordinate channel. The profit-sharing contract is demonstrated to coordinate both the pricing and the promotional decisions in the channel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Results revealed that maize production is globally competitive and, therefore, can successfully substitute its import. Maize production is also profitable at the farm level (Benefit Cost Ratio = 1.21) with no adverse influence of farm size on yield and profitability. Maize farmers are also responsive to changes in market prices of inputs and outputs. A 1% increase in maize price will increase output supply by 0.4%. The most dominant driver of maize supply and other input demands is land. A 1% increase in available land will increase maize supply by a substantial 3.9%. In addition, landless laborers will benefit through an increase in hired labor demand when land area increases. Policy implications include investments in R&amp;D, tenurial reform to consolidate land holding and smooth functioning of the hired labor market in order to increase maize production and profitability in Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, even though these technologies are, in some cases, economically advantageous, they have a significant handicap compared to the centralized urban water management options: it is not easy to estimate a priori the extent and the rate of the technology spread. This disadvantage is amplified in the case of additional uncertainty due to expansion of an urban area. This overall incertitude is one of the basic reasons the stakeholders involved in urban water are sceptical about the distributed technologies, even in the cases where these appear to have lower cost. In this study, we suggest a methodology that attempts to cope with this uncertainty by coupling a cellular automata (CA) and a system dynamics (SD) model. The CA model is used to create scenarios of urban expansion including the suitability of installing water-aware technologies for each new urban area. Then, the SD model is used to estimate the adoption rate of the technologies. Various scenarios based on different economic conditions and water prices are assessed. The suggested methodology is applied to an urban area in Attica, Greece.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper attempts to pin down the key drivers of demand for and supply of real private sector credit in Pakistan. I use both the equilibrium and disequilibrium econometric frameworks, specifically tackling the issue of lack of consistency and/or efficiency of joint estimators in the former via the three‐stage least squares technique. On the demand side, I find that higher economic activity provides stimulus to credit whereas inflation dampens it. The stock market seems to play a dual role: as a source of alternative financing, a bullish market negatively impacts credit while, as an indicator of economic expectations, it provides a positive impetus. On the supply side, banks' lending capacity is found to be the major driver of credit while government borrowing has a crowding‐out effect. Pakistan currently faces supply constraints, which might put an additional check on capacity utilization by firms, thus damaging growth prospects. The results have important policy implications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Healthcare is undergoing unprecedented change as it transitions to a system that rewards the value, rather than the volume, of care delivered. The rules are changing, with new payment methodologies that levy stiff financial penalties on healthcare providers that fail to deliver quality care, along with incentives to improve efficiencies, care coordination and patient satisfaction. As the system changes, so, too, must the strategies and skill sets of those charged with leading their organisations through this disruptive conversion. The newly released final rule on Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model provides insight into the changing nature of healthcare reform under bundled payment programmes and can be used to assess the kinds of leadership strategies and skills that will be needed to succeed in a value-based healthcare market. Hospital leaders will be measured on their ability to improve collaboration and coordination across internal functions and with outside partners whose financial and clinical performance will have a real impact on hospital reimbursement. This level of coordination will require investments in underlying technology and care coordination to link financial expenditures and process improvements with outcomes data. To achieve these fundamental objectives, healthcare executives can learn from essential traits of leaders in iconic firms outside of healthcare, from Tesla to Netflix, the application of design thinking and open innovation, and a supply chain mindset that organises care around the demand – the patient – in contrast to a more traditional supply-driven system that is focused primarily on hospitals and physicians.</jats:p>"

It is known that, when quality is exogenous, encroachment could make the retailer better off. Yet, when quality is endogenous and the manufacturer has enough flexibility in adjusting quality, we find that encroachment always makes the retailer worse off in a large variety of scenarios. We also establish that, while a higher manufacturer’s cost of quality hurts the retailer in absence of encroachment, it could benefit the retailer with encroachment. In addition, we show that a manufacturer offering differentiated products through two channels prefers to sell its high-quality product through the direct channel. Contrary to conventional wisdom, quality differentiation does not always benefit either manufacturer or retailer. Our results may explain why, despite extant theoretical predictions, retailers almost always resent encroachment. These findings also suggest that firms must be cautious when adopting quality differentiation as a strategy to ease channel conflict caused by encroachment. </jats:p>",

Thus, the present study analyses the effects of three different scenarios using Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model to evaluate the plausible future water scenarios of water availability in Selangor. The first scenario is business as usual which is later referred to as reference in this study. Second, higher population growth and the third is the application of the demand side management onto the reference and higher population growth scenario. These scenarios were then used to calculate the impact on the supply – demand gap by the year 2050. Two catchments were used namely Selangor and Langat to illustrate the water supply and demand in the state of Selangor. The study then generates information for use in managing water allocations amongst economic sectors in Selangor as the explicit accounting in the description of the water supply and demand among the urban and industry water usage is advocated. Such detailed scenario simulation and the inclusion of previously unaccounted for factors like the higher population growth and water savings management can help to create awareness of potential future problems, inform water practices and suggest management alternatives. Results show that with proper water savings measures, water deficit within Selangor will be significantly reduced.  </jats:p>"

These were complemented with an inquiry to business agents, whose data were subject to statistical treatment. Besides the identification of an important set of deficits of institutional nature, inhibitors of innovation performance, the study also allowed formulating various proposals for the purpose of territorial governance, highlighting the need to strengthen the transfer of knowledge to the micro and small companies engaged in agricultural activities. In general, this paper proposes an analytical framework to a better understanding of innovation dynamics in any region according to its specificities including the role of public institutions in this process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Understanding the oil price changes through the demand and supply dynamics is a challenging problem. Traditional models based on stochastic process and aggregated supply and demand have been successful in explaining the price trends in short periods of time where there is no big changes in either supply or demand sides of oil market. However, these models usually failed to capture the big shocks of oil price in circumstances where there are unexpected influential events, such as reports on the economic growth of the non-OECD members.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, we propose a revised model of oil price based on the supply and demand dynamics. Particularly, we inspect the effects of unconventional parameters on the oil price, many of which have been ignored in the traditional models. Our model investigates the effects of these expectational parameters on the major factors that shape the supply and demand. Particularly, the oil price is still modeled to follow the supply to demand ratio, however, the supply and demand are replaced with their expected trends in the model. In other words, based on the influential events that can happen in either demand or supply sides, related variables are initiated which subsequently affect the expected trend of supply or demand, and the oil price eventually.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our model is a system dynamic model that mathematically relates the determinants of the oil price based on the underlying causal relations. The whole model numerically solves differential equations relating the marginal parameters and the main factors including the oil price, demand and supply. We separate the oil supply into US, OPEC and other non-OPEC countries supplies whose parameters differ due to conventional and unconventional resources. Moreover, we separate the oil demand into OECD, Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) and non-OECD countries’ demands due to the difference in the dependence on the economic growth and oil consumption in those group of countries. We build our core model based on regression analysis on the historic data of WTI oil price, OECD and BRIC economic growth and demand, US, OPEC and other countries supply data. Then we train other parameters of the model using the historic reactions of the market to unexpected events that have occurred in the past.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Finally, we simulate the model to analyze a case study of the events occurred in the 2015 including the deceleration of the growth in Chinese economy, speculations on American shale productions, speculations on the OPEC’s decisions, and conflicts in the Middle-East region. Our results show that our model can be used to reproduce the price trends compliant with the past data, and provide predicted trends of supply, demand and their influences on the price.</jats:p>",

Two performance indicators were calculated: water saving efficiency (RSE) – proportion of water used supplied by the RWH system; and rainwater use efficiency (RUE) – proportion of rainwater actually used. The maximum storage capacity and WSE decreased with increasing number of residents for a given roof area, and with an increasing roof area for constant number of residents. For variable storage volume, RUE increased with increasing storage capacity and reached a maximum with an increase in residents’ number and a decrease in the roof area.

However, properly documented examples of successfully implemented SCM initiatives, particularly at the lower tiers of the supply chain, are scarce. The purpose of this paper is to extend the existing debates by adopting an alternative approach focusing specifically on the internal SCM organisation of both main contractor and subcontractor organisations, and their direct inter-relationships. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study sets out to explore the enablers and barriers to the implementation of SCM at the lower tiers of the construction supply chain, particularly the problematic collaboration between main contractors and subcontractors.

WSPs consist of five implementation steps, followed by evaluation. To date, approximately 90 countries have implemented WSPs; however widespread uptake is limited by lack of documented outcomes and impacts. We conducted a systematic review to collate outcomes, impacts, and lessons learned from WSPs developed in general, rural, and three case-study country contexts. Overall, 53 documents met inclusion criteria. In general contexts, the need for institutional support during WSP implementation was highlighted. In rural applications, the need to simplify the WSP process and provide community support was emphasized. In case-study countries, we found the WSP process was selectively adapted and integrated within existing programs. In outcome and impact evaluations, financial outcomes have the clearest evidence base, while operational outcomes are documented most frequently, particularly in relation to infrastructure improvements. However, evidence is lacking on institutional and policy outcomes and impacts of WSPs. To ensure WSPs reach their potential for improving water delivery and management, support should be provided to implementers, outcomes and impacts of urban, peri-urban, and rural WSP implementations should be evaluated, and adaptation of WSPs locally encouraged.</jats:p>",

According to that fact, the aim of our study was to determine if the increased use of antihypertensive drugs&lt;br /&gt;correlates with the decreasing mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension (HT).&lt;br /&gt;Methods. The analysis is based on data on annual national sales (million units) of four types of antihypertensive&lt;br /&gt;drugs in 2000–2010. For the same period standardized mortality rates were calculated based on the data available&lt;br /&gt;from the Central Statistical Office in Poland. Data analysis involved correlation analysis between annual mortality&lt;br /&gt;rates due CVD and HT and country-wide annual sales of antihypertensive drugs (2000–2010).&lt;br /&gt;Results. In the period 2000–2010, standardized mortality rates of CVD in the whole population followed a&lt;br /&gt;decreasing trend. Analysis of correlation of CVD with specific drug provided the following findings: diuretics&lt;br /&gt;(r=-0.97; p&amp;lt;0.0001) beta-blockers (r=-1.0; p&amp;lt;0.0001) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (r=-0.72 p=0.01)&lt;br /&gt;calcium-channel blockers (r=-0.82; p=0.001) Standardized mortality rates for the HT showed fluctuating trend.&lt;br /&gt;Correlations of that mortality with global sale of these drugs were no longer negative: r=0.54; p=0.08, r=0.56;&lt;br /&gt;p=0.08 r=0.55; p=0.07; r=0.63; p=0.03, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions. In Poland, in 2000–2010, an improved access to pharmacological control of HT was associated&lt;br /&gt;with an apparent reduction in mortality from CVD but not from HT. The latter findings might reflect imprecise&lt;br /&gt;definition of HT as a cause of death or the fact that HT leads to other cardiologic events usually reported as a&lt;br /&gt;cause of death.&lt;br /&gt;KEY WORDS: antihypertensive drug therapy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Cost effective and reliable process of condition monitoring of induction motor is very important. It is found that unbalance voltage supply is one of the major factors that produce uneven heating due to reverse current and leads to inter-turn short circuit. The issue regarding unbalanced voltage supply has attracted the attention of researcher and engineers in recent past. In this paper, a new effective non-invasive (online) method is proposed that only use rotor harmonic current signature for the detection of unbalance voltage supply instead of main line current signature. This is a sensor-less and online approach that accomplishes the reliable and accurate analysis of the induction motors. Moreover, it allows a continuous real time tracking without disturbing the normal operation and guarantees the overall production process. Additionally, this method recognizes the unbalance and estimate the severity of the unbalance in the voltage source. The effects of unbalance voltage supply are investigated through experiments. In order to perform the analysis and detect the asymmetry due to unbalance voltage, an experimental set up is designed that can accurately repeat the measurements. In the proposed work, unbalance voltage supply is diagnosed through experimental hardware setup. To validate the propose methods an experiment is performed that confirm that motor operating under unbalance voltage supply give a significant rise in the rotor harmonic while under balance voltage supply there is so such a rise in the rotor harmonic.</jats:p>"

Building green supply-chain management has become a major challenge for corporations as they strive to contribute to sustainable societies. Meanwhile, supply chain management has recently become a new research topic in tourism studies. This study proposed integrating the balanced score card (BSC), a widely used strategic tool, with the analytic network process (ANP) model to develop tourism green supply chain management (TGSCM) indicators. The results indicated that current market dynamics and growth potential can be understood through the TGSCM. Selecting key factors using the BSC can help identify the balance point between a company’s revenues and its responsibility for environmental protection, thus enabling a unique tourism operations model by which companies can profit while protecting the environment.</jats:p>",

However, for developing countries such as Nepal, it is more challenging to achieve this goal given its poor infrastructure and high population growth. To assess the water crisis in the most developed and populated area of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley, we estimated available water resources and domestic water demand in the valley. We estimated a supply deficit of 102 million liters per day (MLD) in 2016, after completion of the first phase of the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). If the MWSP is completed within the specified timeframe, and sufficient treatment and distribution infrastructure is developed, then there would be no water deficit by 2023–2025. This indicates that the MWSP will make a significant contribution to the valley’s water security. However, emphasis must be given to utilizing all of the water available from the MWSP by developing sufficient water treatment and distribution infrastructure. Alternate mitigation options, such as planning land use for potential recharge, introducing micro- to macro-level rainwater harvesting structures, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources, and water demand-side management, would also be helpful.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The article investigates the factors that make businesses postpone integrating the performance dimension of sustainability in global agrifood supply chains. Based on literature‐based conceptual reasoning, the article conceptualizes a double company lens distinguishing between substantial supply chain management and mere public relations endeavors as a major obstacle for businesses pursuing comprehensive supply chain performance in global agrifood chains. We point out that many supply chain performance attributes represent, in fact, credence attributes that cannot be verified by the consumer, hence entailing an information asymmetry between the company and its consumers. Rational business responses to this situation tend to focus on symbolic actions and communication efforts by means of sustainability reports and other brand‐enhancing marketing tools that may be decoupled from substantial operations and supply chain improvements. The research propositions developed have partly been corroborated by a content analysis of annual and sustainability reports of four major agrifood companies (Nestlé, PepsiCo, Unilever, and Mondelez International). The conceptual arguments and empirical analysis presented in the article may serve as the basis for managers and academics to develop innovative inter‐ and intraorganizational business processes that reconcile trade‐offs between various agrifood supply chain performance dimensions, thus pushing the performance frontier outward, and that provide the necessary transparency for overcoming the currently adverse setting of incentives inherent in the food production, processing, retailing, and consumption system.</jats:p>",

The degree of mixing affects contaminant spread in a water distribution system, and many studies have focused on mixing at the cross junctions; however, only a few have focused on double-Tee junctions of unequal pipe diameters. To investigate the solute mixing at such junctions, a series of experiments was conducted in a turbulent regime (Re = 12,500–50,000) with different Reynolds number ratios and connecting pipe lengths. Dimensionless outlet concentrations were found to depend on mixing mechanism at the impinging interface of junctions, where junctions with a larger pipe diameter ratio were associated with more complete mixing. Further, the inlet Reynolds number ratio affected mixing more strongly than the outlet Reynolds number ratio. Finally, the dimensionless connecting pipe length in a double-Tee played an important and complicated role in the flow mixing. The results were used to develop two-dimensional isopleth maps for the calculation of normalized north outlet concentrations.</jats:p>",

It is discovered that most of the power outage occurs randomly without any prior notice and sometime lasted for many hours. Load shedding program is not properly scheduled and not fairly distributed among all consumers. A proper scheduling program must have a clear periodic schedule, fixed outage hours, fairly distributed and alternated among consumers and most importantly solve energy deficit problem.

Service coverage is significantly lower when considering the new water and sanitation targets under the sustainable development goals (SDGs) which aspire to a higher standard of ‘safely managed’ water and sanitation. Lack of access to WASH can have an economic impact as much as 7% of Gross Domestic Product, not including the social and environmental consequences. Research points to significant health and socio-economic consequences of poor nutritional status, child growth and school performance caused by inadequate WASH. Groundwater over-extraction and pollution of surface water bodies have serious impacts on water resource availability and biodiversity, while climate change exacerbates the health risks of water insecurity. A significant literature documents the beneficial impacts of WASH interventions, and a growing number of impact evaluation studies assess how interventions are optimally financed, implemented and sustained.

Recent trends of weather extremes in Saxony, Germany also enhance drought risks for agricultural production. In addition, signals of longer and more intense drought conditions during the vegetation period can be found in future regional climate scenarios for Saxony. However, those climate predictions are associated with high uncertainty and therefore, e.g. stochastic methods are required to analyze the impact of changing climate patterns on future crop water requirements and water availability. For assessing irrigation as a measure to increase agricultural water security a generalized stochastic approach for a spatial distributed estimation of future irrigation water demand is proposed, which ensures safe yields and a high water productivity at the same time. The developed concept of stochastic crop water production functions (SCWPF) can serve as a central decision support tool for both, (i) a cost benefit analysis of farm irrigation modernization on a local scale and (ii) a regional water demand management using a multi-scale approach for modeling and implementation. The new approach is applied using the example of a case study in Saxony, which is dealing with the sustainable management of future irrigation water demands and its implementation.\n                    </jats:p>"

We consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a newsvendor retailer selling a seasonal product to strategic consumers, who may choose to wait for clearance sales to maximize their intertemporal utility. Under a prenegotiated supply contract, the retailer chooses retail price and ordering quantity simultaneously. After that, the strategic consumers, who may be heterogeneous in their patience levels, make purchasing decisions. We find that strategic consumer behavior can hurt the supply chain efficiency due to severe double marginalization, and that a simple buyback contract can coordinate the supply chain. Nevertheless, we show that the supply chain does become more difficult to coordinate when strategic consumers are present: the set of buyback contractual terms that coordinate the chain shrinks as consumers are more willing to wait, and the chain profit cannot be arbitrarily allocated between the firms. Contrary to popular intuition, this result implies that the retailer may enjoy some benefit from consumers' strategic waiting. In addition, we find that the retailer's gain is the highest when impatient and patient consumers are comparably mixed in the population. </jats:p>",

Grey water from bathtubs/showers and washbasins is treated and reused for flushing toilets. Raw and membrane bio-reactor (MBR) treated grey water quality was monitored throughout one academic year using parameters to characterize organic matter (COD/BOD), suspended solids (TSS/VSS), nutrients (N/P) and microbiological indicators (total/fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus). For raw grey water, all mean concentrations are below the characteristic concentrations for weak conventional domestic wastewater in terms of physicochemical parameters. However, total coliform concentrations were 7 logs, which is compatible with weak/intermediate conventional domestic wastewater and the mean concentration of fecal coliforms was 6 logs, corresponding to intermediate/strong conventional domestic wastewater. Results of this work revealed that organic matter and microbiological indicators were the important pollutants for this specific grey water. After treatment in an MBR system, grey water quality complied with standards given for reuse as flush water. The student residence hall was a successful example of conversion to grey water as a flush water source. As such, 25% of the wastewater could be revaluated and 25% of the regular daily water supply could be saved.</jats:p>",

The extent to which foregone profits from exports dominate domestic rents depends on Canada's comparative advantage, domestic market elasticities and the extent of supply management distortion in the domestic market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine operational and incentive issues that conspire to reduce the quality of milk—via deliberate adulteration by milk farmers—acquired by competing collection intermediaries in developing countries. Broadly speaking, three main forces in the milk supply chain lead to the low quality of milk: high testing costs, harmful competition among stations, and free-riding among farmers. The goal of this study is to provide recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing. Interestingly, some intuitive interventions—such as providing stations with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities) or subsidizing testing costs—could hurt the quality of milk in the presence of competition. To save testing costs we utilize mixed testing, where the milk combined from multiple farmers is tested once. However, mixed testing makes the system vulnerable to free-riding among farmers. We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station conducts only one mixed test and no further testing. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

It gave daughters equal inheritance rights as sons. However, five states in India had earlier amended the same Act in favor of daughters. Using this exogenous variation created by legislation of inheritance property rights, we exploit a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to estimate the impact of reform on female education, labor force participation and daughters’ educational attainment. The study finds that women who were exposed to the reform experience have greater average schooling years, and average months of employment. It is interesting to note that this positive effect is also observed for their daughters’ educational attainments. These finding are explained by improvement in their bargaining power in the household that further improves women’s autonomy in decision making. Results obtained from this study are consistent with the non-cooperative household bargaining models that which treats changes in inheritance laws as a positive shock to distribution factors which impact the intra-household bargaining. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications.</jats:p>",

The study argues that the impact of SCI on financial performance is through value creation and is depended upon longevity of product life cycle. Using primary data from 79 firms in Ghana, the study finds that value creation is a short-run consequence of SCI while financial performance is a long-run outcome of SCI. Additionally, results show that the financial performance outcome of SCI is experienced more from integrative efforts than from the value creation outcome. Results further indicate that firms whose products stay relatively shorter on the market are more likely to experience lower positive impact of SCI on value creation, and thus firms’ ability to become proactive, monitor, and collect market information on product performance throughout its life cycle is key for coming out with strategies that will enable them maximize product’s life span so as to experience greater benefits that come with pursuing integration with other channel members.</jats:p>"

However, a low inventory level will cause the company to have little buffer to face the unforeseeable demand surge, which strengthens the close relationship between the stage of production and distribution. This paper probes an integrated production and distribution scheduling problem in which jobs are first produced by a set of unrelated parallel machines and then directly distributed to the corresponding customers by vehicles with limited capacity, with no inventory kept at the production stage. The objective is to find a joint production and distribution schedule such that the total cost, considering both customer service level and total distribution cost, is minimized. This paper integrated the earliest available machine first (EAMF) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) to solve the two-stage scheduling problem and used EAMF, which considers the load of the unrelated parallel machine to generate a set of production schedules to be systematically optimized by VNS, along with optimized routing, and applied a shaking mechanism of VNS to escape from the local optimal solution. The results of the computational experiments showed that the proposed method is better than ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic methods in the computation time and solution quality.</jats:p>",

We predict the credit risk of China’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for financial institutions (FIs) in the supply chain financing (SCF) by applying the above models. In the empirical analysis, the quarterly financial and non-financial data of 77 listed SMEs and 11 listed core enterprises (CEs) in the period of 2012–2013 are chosen as the samples. The empirical results show that: (i) the “negative signal” prediction accuracy ratio of the ANN model is better than that of LR model; (ii) the two-stage hybrid model type I has a better performance of predicting “positive signals” than that of the ANN model; (iii) the two-stage hybrid model type II has a stronger ability both in aspects of predicting “positive signals” and “negative signals” than that of the two-stage hybrid model type I; and (iv) “negative signal” predictive power of the two-stage hybrid model type III is stronger than that of the two-stage hybrid model type II. In summary, the two-stage hybrid model III has the best classification capability to forecast SMEs credit risk in SCF, which can be a useful prediction tool for China’s FIs.</jats:p>"

An ASC is a dynamic alliance of member enterprises, the adaptation of which is likely to introduce velocity, responsiveness and flexibility into the manufacturing system. In ASC management, supplier/partner selection is a key strategic concern; influenced by various agility-related criteria/attributes. Therefore, evaluation and selection of potential supplier in an ASC has become an important multi-criteria decision-making problem. The purpose of this paper is to report, a supplier selection procedure (module) in the context of ASC. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – During supplier selection, subjectivity of evaluation information (human judgment) often creates conflict and bears some kind of uncertainty. To overcome this, the present work attempts to explore vague set theory to deal with uncertainties in the supplier selection decision-making process. Since, vague sets can provide more accurate information as compared to fuzzy sets. It considers true membership function as well as false membership function which give more superior results for uncertain information. In this procedure, first, linguistic variables have been used to assess appropriateness rating (performance extent) as well as priority weights for individual quantitative or qualitative criterions. Second, the concept of degree of similarity and probability of vague sets has been used to determine appropriate ranking order of the potential supplier alternatives. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A case empirical example has been provided.

Trends were assessed by urban/rural residence, administrative region and education. The study found increases in access to improved water supplies and reductions in open defecation; however, no progress was observed in the use of improved sanitation. Rural households that reported drinking untreated surface water went from nearly one-third in 2000 to one-fifth in 2011. No improvements were found regarding the reported time spent collecting water. Inequities in WS&amp;S remained high across the country, highlighting the need to focus on these differences and target resources towards sub-populations that lack this fundamental necessity.</jats:p>",

According to Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007), building theory from case studies is an increasingly popular and relevant research strategy that involves using one or more cases to create theoretical constructs, propositions, and/or midrange theory from case-based empirical evidence. Therefore, the research gap to be filled with this manuscript is: “How does the involvement of the logistics area in the key business processes of the GSCF model occur?” The research question of the present study is: “Which activities are performed by the logistics area in the key business processes of the GSCF model and how to implement them?”. This study bridged the research gap and answered the research question by creating a theoretical construct through a conceptual framework to guide the implementation of the logistics activities for each key business process of the GSCF model. This paper aimed to extend the existing theory since the available literature has yet not addressed this research question at all.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

In order to evaluate the removal of DBP precursors, the uniform formation condition was used to estimate the formations of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Effluent water from anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes (A2O water) was fed through soil columns at different HRTs. Sand with low organic content and less specific surface area was selected to represent the ‘worst available case’ of subsurface environment in Japan. Overall, annual data (n ≥ 14) indicated that the average concentrations of THMs and HAAs for water passed through SAT with HRT less than 7 days were below the standard of drinking water. However, risks of exposure to THMs and HAAs were observed. Increasing HRT to 30 days resulted in the concentrations of regulated THM and HAA species lower than the 10% of the drinking water standard values, except for dichlorobromoform. Therefore, a treatment unit for bromide ion removal (e.g., anion exchanger) prior to chlorination is recommended to lower the risk levels of exposure to dichlorobromoform.</jats:p>",

Utilizing detailed data from hospitals in the State of California, we investigated the potential mitigating effects of affiliation with multi‐hospital systems while controlling for service performance. We argue that these arrangements potentially influence managers' confidence in their supply chains, which in turn impacts inventory accumulation. Results suggest that while affiliation with local, regional, and national systems has mitigating effects under weak logistics services infrastructure, the mitigating effect is greatest for affiliation in local systems. The results also point to potential for improved operating efficiency with system affiliation, a factor that is often not considered in policy discussions regarding hospital system formation.

The analysis takes account of thresholds in price adjustments toward their long‐run equilibrium. The first stage considers the price dynamics between international and Indian domestic cotton prices. The second stage considers price transmission from domestic to farm gate cotton prices in Vidarbha. Results from the first stage indicate that Indian and international cotton markets are well‐integrated. In contrast, the second stage reveals significant threshold‐type nonlinearities as well as asymmetries in price transmission between domestic and farm gate prices. The short‐run dynamics suggest that the pass‐through from domestic to farm gate prices is larger when domestic prices decrease than when they increase. Moreover, back of the envelope calculations suggest that the loss in revenue for a typical farmer from a decrease in domestic price is larger than the gains from an increase in domestic price of the same magnitude. The implication is that traders benefit from price fluctuations at the expense of farmers. Evidence from fieldwork in Vidarbha suggest that asymmetries revealed in this analysis may be linked to trader's market power and inadequate market information among farmers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>France is the second largest exporter of cereals in the world. Although the cereal supply chain is an asset to the country's economy and employment, it is at the same time responsible for a number of pressures on the local and global environment including greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and stresses on water quality and quantity. This article aims at evaluating this situation from an environmental point of view by linking production occurring in French regions with consumption occurring in France and abroad. Based on previous work on material flow analysis, we use an absorbing Markov chain model to study the fate of French cereals and link worldwide consumption to environmental pressures along the supply chain, that is, induced by production, transformation, or transport. The model is based on physical supply and use tables and distinguishes between 21 industries, 22 products, 38 regions of various spatial resolution (22 French regions, ten countries, six continents), and four modes of transport. Energy use, GHG emissions, land use, use of pesticides, and blue water footprint are studied. Illustrative examples are given in order to demonstrate the versatility of the results produced, for instance: Where and in what form does local production end up? How do regions compare relative to their production and consumption footprints? These results are designed to be a first step toward scenario analysis for decision‐aiding that would also include socio‐economic indicators. Examples of such scenarios are discussed in the conclusion.</jats:p>",

Contrary to practices by many management agencies, conflict frequency was not reduced by hunting or removal of problem individuals.

To further investigate this blood supply, dissections (n = 9), corrosion casts (n = 4), and computed tomography (n = 8) of canine temporal regions/ears were performed. The goal of this study was to identify and describe branches of the external carotid and maxillary arteries in close proximity to the TMJ that supply the middle ear of the dog. Specific focus was placed on the constancy and origin of the canine rostral tympanic artery since this artery was anticipated to arise from the maxillary artery and enter a foramen at the medial aspect of the mandibular fossa adjacent to the TMJ. New anatomical variations of three canine arteries are described in this study. (1) The rostral tympanic artery is a branch of the temporomandibular ramus and is accommodated by a small foramen located within a depression medial to the temporomandibular joint. (2) A pharyngeal branch of the caudal deep temporal artery was identified. (3) The origin of the caudal auricular artery occurred opposite the lingual artery in 25.8% of dissected specimens, contrary to published descriptions.

Simulation results showed that pond water level changed moderately for conditions without using its water for irrigation, whereas pond water level changed dramatically for conditions with using its water for irrigation. A reasonable ratio of pond size to irrigated soybeans land was 1:18 if the irrigation rate was 2.54 cm/d (or 1 inch/d) and the low limit of the pond water level was drawn to near zero (0.08 m). For the ratio of 1:18, our simulations further revealed that a 1-ha soybeans land could save about 542 m3 groundwater each year.

We begin by incorporating a regime state variable into a well‐established stochastic dynamic programming model. We then simulate and compare optimized release policies—with and without the regime state variable—to understand how regime shifts affect operating performance in terms of meeting water delivery targets. Our optimization approach uses a Hidden Markov Model to partition the streamflow time series into a small number of separate regime states. The streamflow persistence structures associated with each state define separate month‐to‐month streamflow transition probability matrices for computing penalty cost expectations within the optimization procedure. The algorithm generates a four‐dimensional array of release decisions conditioned on the within‐year time period, reservoir storage state, inflow class, and underlying regime state. Our computational experiment is executed on 99 distinct, hypothetical water supply reservoirs fashioned from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Hydrologic Reference Stations. Results show that regime‐like behavior is a major cause of suboptimal operations in water supply reservoirs; conventional techniques for optimal policy design may misguide the operator, particularly in regions susceptible to multiyear drought. Stationary streamflow models that allow for regime‐like behavior can be incorporated into traditional stochastic optimization models to enhance the flexibility of operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A low noise and high precision linear power supply was designed for use in rare event search experiments with macrobolometers. The circuit accepts at the input a “noisy” dual supply voltage up to ±15 V and gives at the output precise, low noise, and stable voltages that can be set between ±3.75 V and ±12.5 V in eight 1.25 V steps. Particular care in circuit design, component selection, and proper filtering results in a noise spectral density of 50nV/Hz at 1 Hz and 20nV/Hz white when the output is set to ±5 V. This corresponds to 125 nV RMS (0.8 μV peak to peak) between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, and 240 nV RMS (1.6 μV peak to peak) between 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz. The power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of the circuit is 100 dB at low frequency, and larger than 40 dB up to high frequency, thanks to a proper compensation design. Calibration allows to reach a precision in the absolute value of the output voltage of ±70 ppm, or ±350 μV at ±5 V, and to reduce thermal drifts below ±1 ppm/∘C in the expected operating range. The maximum peak output current is about 6 A from each output. An original foldback protection scheme was developed that dynamically limits the maximum output current to keep the temperature of the output transistors within their safe operating range. An add-on card based on an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller is devoted to the monitoring and control of all circuit functionalities and provides remote communication via CAN bus.</jats:p>",

This article describes a global case‐study framework for reconciling top‐down with bottom‐up approaches so they are mutually reinforcing for identifying and evaluating the effectiveness of different scenarios describing potential future actions. A strategic selection of cases makes it possible to distinguish and represent concrete characteristics of both common and atypical situations, whereas a global model is needed to provide an integrating conceptual framework based on a theory of consumption, production, and international exchanges that captures interdependencies among activities across regions. I discuss how the results of global analyses can be useful for framing case‐study questions and selecting cases, whereas the cases, in turn, identify concerns of specific stakeholders and provide detailed information, including technical data, to supplement economic databases with their accounting origins. I describe ways to enhance collaborations between top‐down and bottom‐up researchers, using global, multiregional input‐output databases to play a mediating role, while avoiding rigidities of premature closure and incorporating diverse perspectives. Responding to the high‐priority global challenge of vastly expanding effective sanitation services in developing countries is used to illustrate these ideas.</jats:p>",

The morphological variations that occurred in the gas vacuoles according to the applied pressure were investigated using transmission electron microscopy images. The settleability of both cyanobacteria species increased statistically significantly (P = 0.000) with increasing pressure, whereas the gas-vacuolated area of both species decreased significantly (P = 0.000) with the magnitude of the applied pressure. The removal ability of cyanobacterial cells from the water layer increased with high pressure treatment.

Thus, the lack of a sustainable large-scale supply has been an important challenge facing chemists and biologists involved in marine-based drug discovery. In the current review we describe the main strategies aimed to overcome the supply problem. These include: marine invertebrate aquaculture, invertebrate and symbiont cell culture, culture-independent strategies, total chemical synthesis, semi-synthesis, and a number of hybrid strategies. We provide examples illustrating the application of these strategies for the supply of marine invertebrate-derived anticancer agents. Finally, we encourage the scientific community to develop scalable methods to obtain selected metabolites, which in the authors’ opinion should be pursued due to their most promising anticancer activities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of fault diagnosis in potable water supply networks is addressed in this paper. Two different fault diagnosis approaches are proposed to deal with this problem. The first one is based on a model-based approach exploiting a priori information regarding physical/temporal relations existing among the measured variables in the monitored system, providing fault detection and isolation capabilities by means of the residuals generated using these measured variables and their estimations. This a priori information is provided by the topology and the physical relations between the elements constituting the system. Alternatively, the second approach relies on a data-driven solution meant to exploit the spatial and temporal relationships present in the acquired data streams in order to detect and isolate faults. Relationships between data streams are modelled using sequences of linear dynamic time-invariant models, whose estimated coefficients are used to feed a hidden Markov model. Afterwards, a cognitive method based on a functional graph representation of the system isolates the fault when existing. Finally, a performance comparison between these two approaches is carried out using the Barcelona water supply network, showing successful and complementary results which suggest the integrated usage in order to improve the results achieved by each one separately.</jats:p>",

In addition, this study investigates the degree of importance that enterprises attribute to the electric vehicle market and their perceptions about the development of this market, also evaluating which types of electric vehicles and body styles are receiving the most relevant investment.Design/methodology/approach: An empirical investigation has been carried out to examine the above-mentioned aspects. Data have been collected through an on-line survey and analysed by a descriptive statistical analysis, confirmatory factors analysis, and cluster analyses.Findings: Market penetration of electric vehicles is mainly influenced by technological choices of car makers and battery manufacturers and by the ability to organize and manage the integrated actions of stakeholders, also including component suppliers, and manufacturers of vehicle management systems. Stakeholders have to exploit economies of scale, to make use and expand long-time competencies in electric engineering with automotive know-how, and to build up cooperation with experts in the new value chain to facilitate the required transfer of know-how. Alliances and joint ventures can provide manufacturers access to the know-how, technology, and production capacity of battery suppliers. Outsourcing, especially as regards research and development, will occur even more frequently in the near future. An agile supply chain should be adopted to manage a fluctuating market demand.Originality/value: This preliminary study contributes to provide an outlook of some of the most important changes that traditional Italian automotive supply chain would need to promote the introduction of electric vehicles and their critical components with an emphasis on production aspects. </jats:p>"

Along with a constant pressure on forestry to increase its productivity, this development has led to the search for new procurement methods and new assortments.\n The present study assessed innovative supply chain practices, with a particular focus on the integrated supply of stemwood and residual tree parts. The assortments considered included tree sections, long tops, saw logs with stump cores and small whole trees from thinnings. The assessment included\n geographically explicit modelling of the supply chain operations and estimation of supply cost and energy use for three industrial locations in Northern Sweden. The innovative supply chains were compared to conventional, separate, harvest of stemwood and logging residues. We conclude that\n integrated harvest of tops and branches with stemwood assortments, as well as whole-tree harvest in early thinnings, has a significant potential to reduce the supply cost for the non-stemwood assortments. Stump wood generally remains the most expensive assortment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Green or closed-loop supply chain had been the focus of many manufacturers during the last decade. The application of closed-loop supply chain in today’s manufacturing is not only due to growing environmental concerns and the recognition of its benefits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and meeting a more strict environmental regulations but it also offers economic competitive advantages if appropriately managed. First-order hybrid Petri nets represent a powerful graphical and mathematical formalism to map and analyze the dynamics of complex systems such as closed-loop supply chain networks. This article aims at illustrating the use of first-order hybrid Petri nets to model a closed-loop supply chain network and evaluate its operational, financial, and environmental performance measures under different management policies. Actual data from auto manufacturer in the United States are used to validate network’s performance under both tactical and strategic decision-making, namely, (1) tactical decision—production policies: increase of recovered versus new components and (2) strategic decision—closed-loop supply chain network structure: manufacturer internal recovery process or recovery process done by a third-party collection and recovery center. The work presented in this article is an extension of the use of first-order hybrid Petri nets as a modeling and performance analysis tool from supply chain to closed-loop supply chain. The modularity property of first-order hybrid Petri nets has been used in the modeling process, and the simulation and analysis of the modeled network are done in MATLAB<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> environment. The results of the experiments depict that first-order hybrid Petri nets are a powerful modeling and analysis formalism for closed-loop supply chain networks and can be further used as an efficient decision-making tool at both tactical and strategic levels. Unlike other researches on modeling supply chain networks that focus on evaluating individually cost, operational, or environmental aspects, the research here shows how first-order hybrid Petri nets can be extended to assess simultaneously operational, financial, and environmental network’s performance measures at different managerial decision-making levels. The results particularly are compelling for researchers and industrial practitioners who can use the same methodology in evaluating their network’s performance and making educated management decisions based on the performance results and the impact of their selected supply chain and manufacturing strategies. </jats:p>",

This information is required as forests provide goods for various sectors like the timber industry or the bioenergy sector. The effect of applying different thresholds to the three restriction classes (environmental, social and economic restriction) within the proposed reference definition for FAWS was evaluated. We applied the reference definition for FAWS to national data sets provided by five European National Forest Inventories using harmonized thresholds. The effects on FAWS area and growing stock were evaluated for each restriction and threshold. All countries within this study could report on protected areas. Social restrictions were not applied in any country, data on other restrictions are available but definitions vary. The application of common thresholds for restrictions proved difficult as effects vary between countries. The economic restriction is the most challenging to assess as many countries do not have corresponding data for direct calculation of, e.g., harvesting costs. Using proxies for harvesting costs was difficult, as common thresholds may not be applied in different countries.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transport costs are one of the major costs in the supply chain of stumps for fuel. Stump parts are bulky and it is impossible to achieve full tonnages on trucks and trailers even though the load space is completely full. The transport economy for stumps is also negatively affected by\n the large amount of contaminants in the loads. Grinding the stumps at the landing and sieving of the produced hog fuel has the potential to increase load weights and reduce both the amount of contaminants and the transport costs. To evaluate such a system a series of studies were made. Results\n show that coarse grinding and sieving reduced both moisture and ash content in the produced fuel, thus increasing the heating value per ton delivered fuel and transforming a soil contaminated material to an acceptable fuel. Transport payloads increased substantially compared to transports\n of stump parts, but a transport distance of 110 km was needed before the coarse grinding system provided lower cost than the standard system with transports of stump parts and grinding at the heating plant. Further studies are needed to evaluate the total energy efficiency in the two\n systems. Coarse grinding and sieving is a feasible way to increase fuel quality and improve transport economy. However, total costs will in most cases be higher than for the loose stump system which renders the method preferable only in cases where the sieving process converts a non-acceptable\n material into an acceptable fuel.</jats:p>",

Decision support concerning such systems is commonly provided using operations research (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OR</jats:styled-content>) methodologies. The quality of respective models depends on the appropriateness of both mathematical representation of the focal system and data input. Concerning this matter, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OR</jats:styled-content> faces severe criticism as groundwork is commonly neglected. This results in a lack of holistic understanding and in insufficient modeling of real‐world problems. Crucial characteristics of the underlying system are often over simplified due to single‐discipline assessments. Particularly, in the context of complex sustainability challenges, multiple nonacademic competencies and expertise are required. Although latest research indicates that collaborative research settings are highly beneficial regarding <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCM</jats:styled-content>, a dearth of integration between disciplines exists. Therefore, we develop a conceptual framework that helps to overcome these shortcomings based on the paradigm of transdisciplinary research (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TDR</jats:styled-content>), which needs substantiation to enhance collaboration and to ensure applicability. Accordingly, we propose appropriate methodologies for each step within the framework. Overall, the framework enables holistic analysis of a focal system by providing a sound approach for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCM</jats:styled-content>‐oriented <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TDR</jats:styled-content> projects.

Drawing on contingency theory, we analyze firm‐level antecedents and consequences associated with CSCOs being appointed to top management teams (TMTs). We conceptually develop the role of CSCOs and hypothesize that CSCOs are most likely to be appointed to TMTs at firms where supply chain‐related integration and differentiation pressures are high. The results from a matched sample of S&amp;P 1500 firms over a 21‐year period reveal that financial leverage, internationalization, and diversification all predict CSCO appointment to the TMT. Our results also suggest that these same contingencies positively moderate the effect of CSCO presence on firm performance, with CSCOs proving beneficial when leverage, internationalization, and diversification levels are high, but detrimental when leverage, internationalization, and diversification are low. In addition, we find post‐hoc evidence that suggests institutional forces may also be a factor in CSCO appointments. Our results reveal that most of the contingency performance effects manifest only for early adopters of the CSCO role, suggesting that late‐mover elevation of the supply chain function to the TMT is a form of mimetic isomorphism. This study extends research on CSCOs and their emergence in TMTs, as well as the role of operations management in corporate strategy.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We also find that this credit supply shock restricted the availability of mortgage and automobile credit.

Random stratified-cluster sampling was used to study Li and Han communities of rural Lingshui County with regard to water quality and environmental sanitation. Water samples were evaluated for microbial contamination using National Standard of the People's Republic of China and World Health Organization drinking water standards. Data were compared between ethnic groups. Li communities had more contamination than Han. The correlation between the frequency of diarrhea among children and the presence of microorganisms in the water was positive, for both total coliforms and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Regression analysis showed the substandard risk factors of total coliforms for source water were type of water supply (OR = 3.508) and garbage disposal methods (OR = 2.430). For E. coli, risk factors included the source of water supply (OR = 2.417); depth of wells (OR = 0.536) and distance of wells from the cesspit (OR = 0.723). The content of bacterium in drinking water source was high in the rural county. Water from open wells had higher contamination rates than water from centralized systems and tube-well sources. Improvement of water supply and environmental hygiene would decrease diarrheal diseases among children under five.</jats:p>",

Unlike the other optimisation techniques, this technique is based on matrices calculations, which makes it effective during load dynamics. The proposed control scheme is implemented for mitigating multiple power quality issues such as load balancing, reactive power compensation and harmonics suppression in power factor correction and zero‐voltage regulation modes under linear and non‐linear loads.</jats:p>",

Despite this general decline, the demand profile has changed significantly with the demand for O D negative <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RBCs</jats:styled-content> being maintained; whereas B D positive and AB D positive\n<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RBC</jats:styled-content> demand has been reduced. In 2015, the blood type O D negative was seen in 6·3% of the combined first time donors among the five American Blood Centres involved in this study and 7·4% of first time Australian donors in 2014/2015, whereas O D negative distributions accounted for 10·5% of all red cell units issued by the American centres and 13·9% by the Australian centres. Inventory can therefore be of sufficient overall quantity but may not be adequate for the demand for units with specific blood types. Recruitment of new donors may need to become more targeted and/or financial or inventory control measures could also be required to ensure inventory matches demand. Blood Services will need to consider the available options in order to ensure that sufficiency of supply is secure and the donor panel is optimised to meet the new demand paradigm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In northern Chile, <jats:italic>Pyura praeputialis</jats:italic> is an invasive species inhabiting rocky intertidal and subtidal habitats restricted exclusively to the Bay of Antofagasta where it forms extensive aggregations. The negative impact of <jats:italic>Pyura</jats:italic> gathering on mid‐intertidal abundances of this species has recently been reported at the south‐eastern end of this bay. In the present study we have increased sampling sites to cover the entire bay toward the north‐western end and the northern section, where a coastal marine reserve for the scallop fishery partially restricts shellfish gathering. Therefore, the sampling sites were chosen to represent different levels of shellfish gathering access along the northern shore of the bay. Long‐term monitoring (1999–2014) of changes in tunicate cover and the abundances of larvae and recruits at seven sites are reported. The opening of a remodelled artificial and recreational beach in 2012, on the central‐eastern shore of the bay, has increased accessibility to rocky intertidal platforms that started to be massively visited by <jats:italic>Pyura</jats:italic> gatherers from the summer of 2013. This allowed for the implementation of an intensive short‐term monitoring program of changes in tunicate cover and the abundances of their larvae and recruits. When gathering access was present the reduction in intertidal cover was generalized to the entire bay and followed by reductions in larvae and recruits. However, these reductions were not found in sites with more restricted gathering access. We conclude that continuous extraction by <jats:italic>Pyura</jats:italic> gatherers followed by reductions of conspecific larvae and recruits are the main drivers behind the reduced abundance of <jats:italic>P. praeputialis</jats:italic> in the entire bay of Antofagasta. Thus, if gathering is not stopped important ecosystem services provided by this tunicate in the bay may be threatened. Similar consequences may be expected if other massive and irreversible reductions in other species of the <jats:italic>Pyura</jats:italic> complex, that inhabit other coasts in the southern hemisphere, occur. The controversy concerning the impacts of invasive species and whether they cause negative, positive or neutral impacts to original ecosystems and fisheries is discussed.</jats:p>",

There is a need for a metric that allows for the differentiation of traded agricultural commodities according to how sustainably they were produced. In this context, this paper develops two single metrics, based on a Total Factor Productivity indexing approach, for benchmarking products in terms of their sustainability performance. Both metrics are adjusted to internalize the social and environmental externalities of food production, and to account for the sustainability effects of stages along agri‐food supply chains. Key aspects such as data availability, the selection of variables, and the selection of sustainability standards and targets are discussed.</jats:p>",

Its effects on the plant host are highly context dependent, with the greatest benefits often observed in phosphorus (P)‐limited environments. Mycorrhizal contribution to plant nitrogen (N) nutrition is probably less important under most conditions. Moreover, inasmuch as both plant and fungi require substantial quantities of N for their growth, competition for N could potentially reduce net mycorrhizal benefits to the plant under conditions of limited N supply. Further compounded by increased belowground carbon (C) drain, the mycorrhizal costs could outweigh the benefits under severe N limitation. Using a field <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AM</jats:styled-content> fungal community or a laboratory culture of <jats:italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</jats:italic> as mycorrhizal inoculants, we tested the contribution of mycorrhizal symbiosis to the growth, C allocation, and mineral nutrition of <jats:italic>Andropogon gerardii</jats:italic> growing in a nutrient‐poor substrate under variable N and P supplies. The plants unambiguously competed with the fungi for N when its supply was low, resulting in no or negative mycorrhizal growth and N‐uptake responses under such conditions. The field <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AM</jats:styled-content> fungal communities manifested their potential to improve plant P nutrition only upon N fertilization, whereas the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>irregularis</jats:italic> slightly yet significantly increased P uptake of its plant host (but not the host's growth) even without N supply. Coincident with increasing levels of root colonization by the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AM</jats:styled-content> fungal structures, both inoculants invariably increased nutritional and growth benefits to the host with increasing N supply. This, in turn, resulted in relieving plant P deficiency, which was persistent in non‐mycorrhizal plants across the entire range of nutrient supplies.</jats:p>",

Additionally, our proposed model tries to provide an optimal number of shipments m and lower cost. Furthermore, this article offers the detailed discussion of two preventive maintenances of the production run period which are named as perfect preventive maintenance and imperfect preventive maintenance. Also, in this study, we develop various special cases that consider the failure rate such as Weibull, geometric and learning effect. Based on the results, the demand and production ratio influences the holding cost and purchase cost and has the highest impact on the integrated model. </jats:p>",

The perception of the performance of food systems is determined by these specific perspectives, and a wide variety of policies responding to different aims are proposed and implemented accordingly. This paper sets out to demonstrate that the pre-analytical adoption of different narratives about the food system leads to non-equivalent assessments of the performance of food supply chains. In order to do so, we (i) identify a set of relevant narratives on food supply chains in Spanish and Catalan contexts; (ii) identify the pertinent attributes needed to describe and represent food supply chains within the different perspectives or narratives; and (iii) carry out an integrated assessment of three organic tomato supply chains from the different perspectives. In doing so, the paper proposes an analysis of narratives to enable the analyst to characterize the performance of food supply chains from different perspectives and to identify the expected trade-offs of integrated assessment, associating them with the legitimate-but-contrasting views found among the social actors involved.</jats:p>"

The result indicates that there is a unidirectional relationship from inflation to money supply growth. However, considering structural changes in two series, we find that short‐run relationships using full‐sample data are unstable, which suggests that full‐sample causality tests cannot be relied upon. Then, we use a time‐varying rolling‐window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationship, and the results show that money supply growth has both positive and negative impacts on inflation in several sub‐periods, and in turn, inflation has the same effects on money supply growth for China. These findings are basically consistent with the modern quantity theory of money from the perspective of money supply and price level. When money supply growth does not outweigh output growth, inflation should not be curbed only by decreasing money supply. It notes that a stable money supply growth is critical to price level stability and economic development in China.</jats:p>",

Relative concentrations of ROS transported to the bottom were evaluated using absorbance measurements. The results indicated that ROS supply to the bottom is markedly enhanced by the plasma jet irradiation at shorter irradiation distances, whereas similar results could not be obtained for the O3 exposure. In these cases, the liquid mixing in the depth direction was also enhanced by the plasma jet irradiation only, and the supply of reactive atomic oxygen to the liquid surface was markedly increased as well.</jats:p>",

In order to identify molecular routes affecting intrinsic P utilization, we address processes covering P intake, uptake, metabolism, and excretion. In particular, the interrelation of bone tissue and immune features is of interest to approximate P intake to animal's physiology and health status. German Landrace piglets received different levels of digestible phosphorus: recommended, higher, or lower amounts. At multiple time points, relevant serum parameters were analyzed and radiologic studies on bone characteristics were performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected to assess differential gene expression. Dietary differences were reflected by serum phosphorus, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Bone reorganization was persistently affected as shown by microstructural parameters, cathepsin K levels, and transcripts associated with bone formation. Moreover, blood expression patterns revealed a link to immune response, highlighting bidirectional loops comprising bone formation and immune features, where the receptor-activator of NF-κB ligand/receptor-activator of NF-κB kinase system may play a prominent role. The modulated P supplementation provoked considerable organismal plasticity. Genes found to be differentially expressed due to variable P supply are involved in pathways relevant to P utilization and are potential candidate genes for improved P efficiency.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the objective of this study is to scrutinise the relationship between changes in unemployment rate and transport indicators in the intercensal period 2001–2011. Both primary and secondary data are used in the analysis. Rate of car ownership and commuting data were taken from national censuses in 2001 and 2011 which surrounded the 2008 crisis. Primary data came from 1,023 interviews. The relationships among indicators are identified with the help of several statistical techniques whose results are analysed. Further, analyses have confirmed the dominant importance of passenger car ownership and car use in relation to decreased unemployment. It is particularly important in economically weaker areas with a poor access, that are endangered by social exclusions. Furthermore, it is necessary to emphasise the importance of public transport as a means of preventing social exclusion.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon resource orchestration theory and the literature on fit assessment methodologies, our study employs both a contingency and a configuration perspective to conceptualize and operationalize “fit.” The results of a survey of 196 firms in China provide the first empirical evidence for the existence and nature of interrelationships between multiple components of SCI and IT competency and their effects on firm performance. In particular, fit as “moderation” approach indicates that IT competency could strengthen the relationship between SCI and both operational and financial performance. Fit as “profile deviation” approach further reveals that the more similar the IT competency configurations are to those of the top performers in the high‐level SCI group, the higher their operational and financial performance are. However, in the medium‐ and low‐level SCI groups, the SCI‐IT competency fit is significantly positively associated with financial performance and insignificantly associated with operational performance. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study are discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous studies show that increasing species richness leads to higher ecosystem productivity. This effect is often attributed to more efficient portioning of multiple resources in communities with higher numbers of competing species, indicating the role of resource supply and stoichiometry for biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. Here, we merged theory on ecological stoichiometry with a framework of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning to understand how resource use transfers into primary production. We applied a structural equation model to define patterns of diversity–productivity relationships with respect to available resources. Meta-analysis was used to summarize the findings across ecosystem types ranging from aquatic ecosystems to grasslands and forests. As hypothesized, resource supply increased realized productivity and richness, but we found significant differences between ecosystems and study types. Increased richness was associated with increased productivity, although this effect was not seen in experiments. More even communities had lower productivity, indicating that biomass production is often maintained by a few dominant species, and reduced dominance generally reduced ecosystem productivity. This synthesis, which integrates observational and experimental studies in a variety of ecosystems and geographical regions, exposes common patterns and differences in biodiversity–functioning relationships, and increases the mechanistic understanding of changes in ecosystems productivity.</jats:p>",
