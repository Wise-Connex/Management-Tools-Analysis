      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Intermittent water supply (IWS) is a typical characteristic of cities in developing countries like India. One of the factors responsible for IWS is unaccounted for water (UFW). Factors like increase in population, upward trends in water demand, water scarcity due to climate change, and asymmetric distribution of water resources are also equally important. However, social relations of water are poorly understood and camouflaged under technicalities associated with IWS. Thus, in this paper, we examine IWS in Indian mega cities and secondary cities with an ethno-economic framework by bringing the data together from various administrative sources like government agencies, allude to its parameters from logistical perspectives, e.g. distances, capacities, population strength, etc., and try to position the water issue with challenges associated with caste, class, gender, religion, region, and governance. The ethno-economic perspective is an attempt to not only complement but also supplement the scientific studies from other disciplines by understanding the real nature of demand and supply problems in urban water management. This paper demonstrates IWS as a multi-dimensional problem and stresses the human drivers of intermittency.</jats:p>",

The data collection used a question­naire designed with a 7-point Likert scale in GoogleForm and printed format and distributed through social media, email, WhatsApp, and mail posts. Of the 266 population, as many as 112 responses were received and were considered valid for further processing. The data analysis used the partial least square technique (PLS) utilizing SmartPLS. The analysis showed that information sharing directly affects supplier quality mana­gement, supply chain agility, and supply chain innovation. Furthermore, supply chain agility, supplier quality management, and supply chain innovation directly affect operational performance. The exciting result of this study is the indirect effect of information sharing on operational performance through the mediating role of supply chain agility, supplier quality management, and supply chain innovation. This result offers solutions to practitioners to pursue information sharing, supplier quality management, supply chain agility, and supply chain innovation in improving operational performance. The main theoretical contribution of this research is the mediating role of supply chain agility, supply chain innovation, and supplier quality management toward the relationship between information sharing and operational performance.</jats:p>"

However, pursuing social impact is often at odds with financial viability, and social enterprises need to engage with a wide range of stakeholders to access tangible and intangible resources to overcome this tension. Although the current literature emphasizes the need for social capital within social enterprises' supply chain relationships, it does not consider the costs associated with the development of such capital. This article examines how social enterprises develop social capital in their supply chain relationships and how this social capital affects their ability to pursue impact and viability. Using data from in‐depth interviews with nine social enterprises, the findings indicate that the roles and positions of beneficiaries in supply chains determine the appropriate forms of social capital needed to sustain simultaneous impact and viability. The empirical insights highlight that structural and relational capital are most valuable within core supply chain relationships, whereas cognitive capital is most beneficial within peripheral relationships aimed at enhancing competitiveness. Further, social enterprises sometimes relinquish power in their supply chain relationships to prioritize impact but develop relational capital to mitigate threats of opportunism. This study advances a contingent view of social capital in cross‐sectoral supply chain relationships and provides valuable implications for managers pursuing impact.</jats:p>",

These databases provide secondary data on buyer–supplier relationships that have been publicly disclosed. Despite the growing use of these databases in supply chain management (SCM) research, several potential validity and reliability issues have not been systematically and openly addressed. This article thus expounds on challenges of using these databases that are caused by (1) inconsistency between data, SCM constructs, and research questions (<jats:italic>data fit</jats:italic>); (2) errors caused by the databases' classifications and assumptions (<jats:italic>data accuracy</jats:italic>); and (3) limitations due to the inclusion of only publicly disclosed buyer–supplier relationships involving specific focal firms (<jats:italic>data representativeness</jats:italic>). The analysis is based on a review of previous studies using Bloomberg SPLC, FactSet Supply Chain Relationships, and Mergent Supply Chain, publicly available materials, interviews with information service providers, and the direct experience of the authors. Some solutions draw upon established methodological literature on the use of secondary data. The article concludes by providing summary guidelines and urging SCM researchers toward greater methodological transparency when using these databases.</jats:p>",

To perform this particular research, a quantitative method of research was applied. The process of data collection was performed by using the questionnaire technique. As it was impossible to collect data from every member of the targeted population thus, a sample of data was calculated using G*power software and obtained a sample size of 129 respondents. It was concluded that supply chain artificial intelligence, adaptive capability, and supply chain collaboration have a positive and significant influence on supply chain resilience and supply chain performance. At the same time, supply chain resilience also has a positive impact on supply chain performance. Thus, organizational and supply chain performance can be enhanced by adopting supply chain resilience and other organizational dynamic capacities. This particular research study provides insight to the practitioners and managers of manufacturing firms for improving their level of resilience in the supply chain. This specific research study plays a significant role in literature by highlighting the concept of supply chain resilience &amp; supply chain performance of organizations.</jats:p>",

As a result, many business representatives rallied in a single cluster with the aim of organizing the supply of humanitarian aid in extremely difficult conditions. At the same time, logisticians have faced many significant problems and challenges, which has caused an increase in attention to humanitarian logistics. The military aggression of the Russian Federation created a large number of humanitarian threats, in particular ecocide. The scale of the destruction exceeded the worst forecasts of world experts. An important factor in the organization of humanitarian supply chain management processes in the conditions of this war is the high threat to people's lives. Due to the fact that air transport is not possible for obvious reasons, all deliveries are long and at high risk of disruption or physical destruction. Therefore, it is critically important to analyze the peculiarities of the organization of humanitarian supply chains, the main problems and challenges that logistics companies of Ukraine had to face in the conditions of martial law. It is important to perform such an analysis in order to take into account the specifics of the structure of the logistics system of humanitarian aid delivery, as well as the efficiency of its key elements. The search for solutions to establish a regular supply of humanitarian aid to Ukrainians in difficult war conditions requires a thorough analysis not only of supply channels, but also of possible threats to their organization.</jats:p>"

Moreover, we analyze the relationship between the ratio of private capital to public capital and changes in the general price level. The results show that when the monetary growth rate that maximizes the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is selected, the elasticity of the ratio of private capital to public capital with respect to monetary growth depends on the private capital elasticity of GDP. If maximizing social welfare is equivalent to maximizing economic growth, the elasticity of the ratio of private capital to public capital with respect to the share of expenditure on infrastructure investment is zero. When the initial value of the ratio of private capital to public capital is at a sufficiently low (high) level, inflation (deflation) occurs during the transition path. \n<jats:bold>JEL classification:</jats:bold> E52; H54; O40</jats:p>"

It was hypothesized that supply chain systems were failing because they lacked adequate architecture to handle the demands of the business environment in which they operate. Because of global sourcing and distribution, manufacturing has become more interdependent, dynamic, and unpredictable. Pharmaceutical supply chains have become more complicated as a result, increasing the number of parties involved and the degree of uncertainty that may be placed on the networks that deliver pharmaceutical goods. Only when it comes to timely delivery and the correct location at the right time is this sector truly relevant. A difficult and competitive business environment has resulted from this reality; pharmaceutical businesses are now looking for operational status that will help them improve their supply chain operations. The impact of SCR (Supply Chain Reliability) in Pakistan's pharmaceutical business is the focus of this article. It is the goal of this study to identify approaches and generate information about the degree of supply chain resilience and the determinants of relational competences of upstream and downstream supply chains, as well as the role of internal integration in making the pharmaceutical supply chain robust.</jats:p>"

In recent years, have the supply chains undergone significant changes as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which has forced companies to change the way of their operating in order to make their supply chains more efficient. The COVID-19 crisis has therefore made companies realize that they need to move to a circular economy, as it has shown the disruption or vulnerability of current supply chains. About sustainability is more and more speech and also more and more companies are recognizing its importance, because sustainable supply chain affects to the entire production process, from the sourcing of raw materials to the recycling of products or raw materials, if this is possible. A sustainable supply chain increases a company’s competitiveness and also reduces costs for the company.</jats:p>",

Through the sample data test research model of 351 managers of manufacturing enterprises, it is found that information technology (IT) system integration can effectively promote the information sharing level of green supply chain enterprises. Supply chain dynamic capability partially mediates the influence of IT system integration and information sharing on supply chain process ambidexterity. Moreover, networking ability positively moderates the relationship between absorptive capacity, innovation capacity, and supply chain process ambidexterity, but does not play a significant role in the relationship between adaptive capacity and supply chain process ambidexterity.</jats:p>"

The research results find out that China is the net importer of virtual land in the cotton trade and the trade is highly geographically concentrated. Domestic supply meeting demand tends to be the cotton consumption trend, and the net import of cotton virtual land is affected by both external and internal factors. Finally, the researchers suggest that China should promote the diversity of cotton import in the context of securing cotton import, raise global cotton trade efficiency through establishing standardized cotton tariffs, accelerate multilateral free trade, build premium global cotton value chain, establish friendly international relations, actively implement the cotton “go global” strategy and stimulate domestic market liberalization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nepal's farmers report fertilizer shortages yearly, especially for rice, wheat, and maize production. A reliable and established approach to estimating the actual demand for fertilizers for different crops and cropping seasons is lacking. Therefore, it is difficult to project the types and quantity of fertilizer to import and allocate across various regions in the country. With the direct involvement of the Government of Nepal (GoN) in fertilizer import, price (subsidy), and distribution, together with the high affinity of farmers for the subsidy, there is no incentive for the private sector to import and distribute fertilizers. Thus, farmers’ access to fertilizers in the country depends primarily on the subsidy budget, quantity and types of fertilizers imported, and their distribution management. In this study, the fertilizer demands, both at the national and sub-national levels, were estimated through a survey of cooperatives that distribute subsidized fertilizers in the country. Our estimate suggests that the fertilizer supplied in 2018/19 was only 60% of the total effective demand in the country. With this estimate of the demand-supply gap and the price variability across provinces, short, medium, and long-term policy recommendations are made to improve the supply of chemical fertilizer in the country\nSAARC J.

The authors have determined their own vision of priorities in the management of supply chains in modern conditions in Ukraine, based on seven characteristics (criteria) of the supply chain proposed in the study \"Logistics landscape-2022+\". The characteristics of supply chains that according to the authors received the first three advantages are: 1) safety, 2) reliability, 3) flexibility of supply chains. It is emphasized that the mechanisms, tools, methodology, technologies, strategies for managing supply chains in conditions of disruptions / restoration of logistics should be based on digitalization of management of logistics business processes. It is proposed to pay special attention to the introduction of a procedural approach to managing the competitiveness of the logistics business. Conceptually, three interrelated blocks of indicators are proposed, their systematic assessment will allow to monitor and control the progress of operational, management and supporting business processes in supply chains. In the context of Ukraine's European integration steps, the advantages and problematic issues of including Ukrainian logistics routes in the Trans-European Transport Network TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) - a network of highways, railways, airports and waterways in the European Union, are considered. The authors hypothetically expressed the opinion that there is a close relationship between the position of Ukraine in the World Competitiveness Ranking and the state of its logistics infrastructure, taking into account the fact that the determining factors of competitiveness according to the results of 2021 were: level of innovations, digitalization, supportive policies and social cohesion. The authors see a retrospective analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships of the pre-war state and functioning of the Ukrainian logistics industry and forecasting its development in the perspective of European integration in post-war times as directions for further research.</jats:p>"

It also aims to reveal what are the challenges food companies face in their sustainable supply chains. In addition, it is aimed to show which points should be focused on in sustainable supply chain management.\nMethodology - For this purpose, sustainability pages on the corporate website of 30 food companies operating in Turkey were analyzed with content analysis by adopting a qualitative research paradigm and an interpretive framework. While analyzing the contents, first of all, it was investigated at which dimensions the food companies attach importance to in the Triple Bottom Line approach. Secondly, the elements that food companies pay attention to while they integrate the supply chain into their sustainability practices were examined. Lastly, it was analyzed in which dimension of the sustainable supply chain management the food companies are located.\nFindings - The findings of the study indicated that 23 of the food companies were found to be sustainable businesses according to the Triple Bottom Line approach. However, it was demonstrated that the same companies could not provide sustainability in supply chain management. In this sense, it was understood that one of the biggest reasons for this is that companies ignore the concept of “risk management”. \nConclusion - As a result, the points that food companies have difficulty in sustainable supply chain management have been revealed. With this study, practical contributions were provided to the companies in terms of enabling them to evaluate themselves on this issue. In addition to this, the study also contributes to the field by building on the studies investigating sustainable supply chain management and providing a different perspective with the investigation of the issue from a TBL approach\n</jats:p>"

The focal points of the analysis and the synthesis of the new system are the end-user and their supply of sustainable electrical energy. Building upon the first step, a second step presents suitable organisational structures for the new system. \nElectrical energy, as a desired user product, is not a natural product; it must be anthropogenically produced. Numerous variables with technical, social, and economic origins influence electrical energy supply, generating a high level of analytical complexity. The guiding principles in this article describe neither means of saving energy nor any technological system, but rather exclusively describe the user requirements in the context of the supply of electrical energy. They are based on an equally valued trinity of energy supply, national economic integrity, and environment. \nSelf-sustaining electrical energy cells accessing ubiquitous and cost-free primary energy form the underlying structural elements. Combined, these elements realise a comprehensive and sustainable electrical energy supply system. Instrumental for achieving system goals is a new form of regulation. The current regulation primarily covers the energy transport networks, technically designed as large-scale power grids. The new regulatory system focuses on the supply of useful electrical energy according to the needs of the user. Derived from the formulated user requirements is a transition process, whose key milestones are the integration of current energy generating facilities into regulation, realisation of national electrical autonomy, reduction of risks to the national economy, establishment of climate-neutral primary energy conversion, and user-defined design of the supply of electrical energy.</jats:p>"

It is the cheapest source with no input cost and very low administrative cost .It is the best natural way of producing energy. No noise, no pollution and many associated benefits. This source cost wapda less than Rs1 per unit. In 1994 IPPs came into action using thermal power generators running on diesel. After purchasing electricity from IPPs the purchase price of Wapda increased up to Rs 6 and 12 per unit depending on the deals with different IPPs. This method proved to be very costly and full of pollution. Due to price hike of diesel in the past, the input cost (cost of diesel) increased by many fold. So the economy was hit and the balance of payment was disturbed badly. Actually this method was meant for short term solution. But due to political instability we lost our sight from the real scene and based our future energy plan on a very costly method. Why? Answer is, as a nation including politicians, bureaucrats, policy makers and everybody enjoy their present leaving and passing these queries, fears and problems to the next generation hoping that all will be well. More than 35 years past away and no concrete solution appeared. But the people of Pakistan specially our new generation are facing this bitter truth i.e., load shedding We have lost rather wasted our precious 35 years. We cannot makeup this gap. Whenever we will try to make a deal with the foreign investors regarding any power generation project, it will always be unfair. unfair why? Because, when somebody knows that you are dying for what he has, he will blackmail you and make u go his way. This is called business. We have lost both the time and competitiveness. If we go on making deals with IPPs now known as “Rental power houses” which will provide us electricity as high as Rs19 per unit. We will lose a lot in all fields. Such as:</jats:p>"

Tarımsal ürünlerin üreticilerden nihai tüketicilere ulaşıncaya kadar kalite ve miktar düzeylerinin izlenmesi ve sürdürülebilirliğinin sağlanması giderek daha önemli hale gelmeye başlamıştır. Çalışma, geleneksel tarımsal gıda tedarik zinciri modeline alternatif olarak blok zincir destekli akıllı tarımsal gıda tedarik zinciri modelini tartışmayı ve farkındalık oluşturmayı amaçlamaktadır.  Böylece ülkemiz açısından geleceğin modern tarım faaliyetlerinde blok zincir teknolojisinin sağlayabileceği avantajlara dikkat çekilmek istenmektedir. Çalışmada öncelikle blok zincir teknolojisi ve akıllı sözleşme kavramları incelenmiş, daha sonra, blok zincir destekli akıllı tarımsal gıda tedarik zinciri konusunda literatürde yapılmış çalışmalar Vosviewer programı yardımıyla analiz edilerek 2021 yılında Jaswitha ve arkadaşları tarafından önerilen çiftçi odaklı tedarik zinciri modeli değerlendirilmiştir.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n Phramongkutklao Hospital is one of the largest military hospitals in Thailand. Beginning in 2016, an institutional policy was implemented in which medication prescription length was increased from 30 to 90 days. However, there have been no formal investigations into how this policy has impacted medication adherence among patients in hospitals. As such, this study evaluated how prescription length impacted medication adherence among dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients who were treated at Phramongkutklao Hospital.\nMethods\n This quasi-experimental study compared patients who received prescription lengths of 30 and 90 days based on information recorded in the hospital database between 2014 and 2017. Therein, we used the medication possession ratio (MPR) to estimate patient adherence. Focusing on patients with universal coverage insurance, we employed the difference-in-difference method to examine changes in adherence from before and after policy implementation, then conducted a logistic regression to test for associations between the predictors and adherence.\nResults\n We analyzed data from a total of 2,046 patients, with equal amounts of 1,023 placed into the control group (no change to 90-day prescription length) and intervention group (change from 30 to 90-day prescription length). First, we found that increased prescription length was associated with 4% and 5% higher MPRs among dyslipidemia and diabetes patients in the intervention group, respectively. Second, we found that medication adherence was correlated with sex, comorbidities, history of hospitalization, and the number of prescribed medications.\nConclusion\n Increasing the prescription length from 30 to 90 days improved medication adherence in both the dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients. This shows that the policy change was successful for patients in the hospital considered for this study.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this research is to analyze and assess the unique supply chain resilience of the Uzbek automotive industry during the pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used in the research; a case study consisting of semi-structured interviews with the supply chain department staff of an Uzbek car manufacturing company. The results show that owing to supply limitations, lockdowns, and increasing prices, the Uzbek car manufacturing company faced shortages and declining production volume. However, because of its inventory redundancy capability and attentive teamwork, the company remained open, while a multitude of large corporations were forced to shut down production. To our knowledge, this is the first research work to identify and assess the supply chain resilience of the Uzbek automotive industry during the COVID-19 disruption. The findings of this paper are expected to contribute to car manufacturing operations in Uzbekistan and in general because they suggest a resilience readiness beyond the conventional risk management supported by the industry experts.</jats:p>",

The model describes the geometric evolution of the tumor region and is derived from taking the incompressible limit of a cell density model, which leads to the pressure vanishing on the free boundary. We investigate the boundary behaviors under two different nutrient supply regimes, in vitro and in vivo, where in the former case the supply is adequate, and in the latter case the supply is deficient. Our main conclusion is that by investigating typical solutions of the tumor-nutrient model with the asymptotic analysis with respect to the domain perturbation, the tumor boundary in the in vitro regime is shown to be stable regardless of the nutrient consumption rate. However, boundary instability occurs when the nutrient consumption rate exceeds a certain threshold in the in vivo regime, and the bifurcation threshold has a monotonic dependence on the frequency of the domain perturbation.\nMathematics Subject Classification (2010). 35R35, 92C10, 70K50, 74G10</jats:p>"

An increase in the interest spread implies that either the depositor or the borrower or both stand to loose. In the context of developing economies, the lack of alternate avenues of financial intermediation aggravates the adverse impact of increase in spread.1 Interest spread also has implications for the effectiveness of the bank lending channel. For example, with a commitment to market based monetary policy, the central bank influences the yield on treasury bills (T. bill hereafter) that in turn affects the deposit and lending rates.2 The change in these rates influences the cost of capital that in turn affects the level of consumption and investment in the economy. If the pass-through of the changes in yield on T. bill rate to the deposit and lending rates is asymmetric then this changes the spread, for better or worse, depending upon the nature of asymmetry. If the increase in spread is due to lower return to depositors then this discourages savings; alternatively if it is due to higher charge on loans, investment decisions are affected. In either case the increase in spread has an adverse bearing upon the effectiveness of bank lending channel of monetary policy and has therefore important implications for the economy......</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural and war disasters lead to stagnation in economic, social and, yes, health development. During the war, the own production of medicines was significantly reduced or even completely stopped due to the destruction of factories, the impossibility of securing raw materials for the production of medicines, and due to the difficulty of importing, transporting and distributing medicines. Even during the war, chronic non-communicable diseases that require daily intake of several groups of drugs are common, the therapy is long-term, and it is necessary to provide a large amount of drugs for these patients. (Abrams J. Nitroglycerin and long-acting nitrates. N Engl J Med 1980; 302:1234). Under these conditions, humanitarian organizations are often the only ones who are able to secure and deliver medicines to certain war-affected areas, which was the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Frequent scientific and non-scientific discussions indicate that the medicines donated through humanitarian organizations are outdated and inadequate in relation to the needs of the population. In my research related to the humanitarian organization \"Igasa\", which included a clinic and a pharmacy and provided help through diagnostics and therapy mainly to chronic internal medicine patients, and for the period from January 2, 1994 to December 31, 1995. I found the following data: 12,839 patients with (CVD, GIO and diabetes mellitus) sought help in this clinic and pharmacy. Of these, 68.00% had CVD, 17.00% GIO and 15.00% diabetes mellitus. Of the total number of patients, 59.00% were women, and 41.00% were men. A significant difference was recorded in the number of patients with CVD according to GIO and diabetes mellitus (p = &lt; 0.001). The highest consumption of drugs was for the treatment of CVD patients (75.00%), while the number of drugs for the treatment of GIO and diabetes mellitus amounted to (25.00%) of the total drug consumption, this is shown by a significant difference (p = &lt; 0.001). The total monetary value of medicines issued in the period 1994 and 1995 in the humanitarian pharmacy \"Igasa\" is 369,816.28 KM. There was a significant difference in the consumption of medicines as well as the difference in the monetary value of the dispensed medicines between the humanitarian pharmacy \"Igasa\" and the civilian pharmacy \"Bascarsija\".\n</jats:p>"

A positive correlation between economic growth and rate of water utilisation has also been observed in a growth model with water as a productive input for private producers [Barbier (2004)]. In addition, high per-capita consumption (PCC) of water is regarded as an indicator of the level of economic development where per-capita water consumption is defined as the average of water consumed by a person in a day. The declining availability of water supply, mainly due to global climate change, is one of the important issues faced by many developing countries at the present time. It is estimated that nearly two third of nations across the globe will experience water stress by 2025.1 Thus, the safety and availability of clean water is an on-going concern within the global village</jats:p>"

The flow process begins at the source of raw materials until it reaches the final customer. A corollary to the newly emerging challenges of both social and environmental management of increasingly complex supply chains is the issue of sustainable supply chain management. The meat industry, along with its entire supply chain, is subject to cyclical crises, with different foundations and negative effects on individual links. One of the reasons for the crises in the meat industry is the management of supply chains based primarily on economic objectives to the exclusion of social and environmental aspects. The purpose of the article is to assess the level of sustainable supply chain management in the meat industry. The research problem is to determine the involvement of meat industry companies in the various dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. Therefore, a special online survey questionnaire was created, where potential respondents representing 93 meat companies were identified and purposely selected.  After receiving and verifying the completed questionnaires, 85 completely completed questionnaires were qualified for further analysis and a coding process was carried out using Excel software, then the data was imported into Statistica statistical software, where the main statistical analyses were carried out.</jats:p>"

As proxy measures of supply chain trade, the author applies domestic value added (DVAFX) included in gross-foreign exports, and foreign-value added included in domestic exports (FVA) from the Eora MRIO database while constructing the ICT variable by using confirmatory factor analysis. Furthermore, as a proxy variable for the country’s technological development, the author applies the economic complexity index developed by Harvard’s Growth Lab, conducting her analysis based on the structural gravity model estimated with the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Estimator (PPML). Together with the standard gravity regressors, the model includes the bilateral position of countries in the supply chain. Our panel dataset covers the 2000-2019 period, including 130 world countries. To control for the potential source of endogeneity, the model includes reporter and partner country fixed effects, yearly fixed effects, and country-pair fixed effects. The results confirm a statistically significant relationship between the country’s technological development and supply-chain trade. Technological development enables a country to produce more complex, higher value-added products and thus to be more upstream positioned in the supply chain. The more upstream the country is in the supply chain, the higher the domestic value added is included in its exports.</jats:p>",

First of all, consumer price inflation is particularly pronounced in goods and less so in the case of services. Energy and food are the most relevant components of rising consumer prices, accounting for almost three-quarters of total headline inflation. The fact that price pressure comes mainly from sectors with a high import content suggests that disruptions along international supply chains may play a key role. The paper then focuses on producer prices at the sectoral level and presents a methodology to decompose the rise in inflation between supply and demand impulses. It finds that, in the present context, supply factors are the main driver and account for at least 80% of the current increase in producer prices in industry and in each one of the manufacturing sectors with the highest price pressures. There are nevertheless some differences across countries. These findings imply that, if repairing supply-side problems and disruptions along supply chains is the priority, then promoting the right investment may be more urgent than cooling demand down. Country heterogeneity in the relative importance of demand and supply factors, then, may lead to different degrees of effectiveness of monetary policy and to a risk of divergences.</jats:p>"

However, irrigation also has negative impacts, including the production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from groundwater pumping. To lessen this environmental problem, management methods that minimize agricultural GHG emissions from groundwater pumping should be identified. This work aims to compare measures that decrease agricultural groundwater withdrawal GHG emissions. A comparison among different energy supply and demand management choices for groundwater pumping was made to identify the most effective measure. Results indicated that the best agricultural groundwater pumping management practices are affected by the type of pump (e.g., electricity, natural gas) and source of pumping energy (e.g., coal, natural gas, oil, wind, solar). Due to their higher operational pump efficiency (OPE), electric pumps consume less energy than natural gas pumps to extract an equal volume of groundwater under similar conditions. Nevertheless, natural gas pumps produce less GHG emissions than electric pumps using the U.S. Central and Southern Pains electricity mix. Hence, groundwater pumping energy demand management through improving the OPE)of natural gas pumps will save more GHG emissions (7600 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-eq year<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>) than switching to electric pumps using the electricity mix applied to this study (2800 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-eq year<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>). Additionally, switching to cleaner energy sources (wind and solar) can save significantly higher amounts of carbon than just improving OPE. This analysis can guide policymakers and individuals to assist in meeting global GHG emission reduction goals and targets while satisfying increasing food demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Almost every industrial supply chain operation has an environmental impact, ranging from pollution caused by industrial processes to waste generated by overproduction. The increased emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming, demanding the use of sustainability initiatives in industrial supply chain models to reduce the emissions produced by their operations. The objective of this research study is to give a complete overview of integrating sustainability criteria into inventory management models to help researchers and practitioners make market-specific decisions. This study investigates simple and complex supply chain structures, as well as the incorporation of various green initiatives to improve the resiliency of supply chain models. The literature review highlights the sustainability constraints in inventory models by considering the industry's environmental and societal consequences. Finally, through a detailed analysis of the existing literature and related limitations, this paper provides potential research insights for future research directions in the domain.</jats:p>"

ZARA is facing the new fast fashion market in a way that is somewhat at odds with the expectations of the media and society about this company, which may affect customer satisfaction. Therefore, this article has chosen this topic for research and development. This paper examined this in-depth analysis as a means of helping ZARA improve its market performance and some of its internal strategies, and used company-related information, including third-party papers and interview transcripts, to obtain preliminary information. The report mainly includes how ZARA's supply chain strategy works with recommendations on two of the major issues, while references are attached at the bottom.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Exchange market pressure (emp) reflects disequilibrium in money market. The traditional approaches used to examine the disequilibrium in money market include the monetary approach to balance of payments and monetary approach to exchange rate. Under the former approach the variation in foreign reserves helps restore the equilibrium while under the latter one the change in exchange rate does the needful.1 The idea of this study stems from the fact that under the managed float exchange rate regime, changes in foreign reserves or changes in exchange rate in isolation are not a sufficient guide to characterise the external account situation of an economy. For example, exchange rate depreciation can be partially avoided or at least delayed if the central bank injects foreign currency in the forex market by letting its foreign reserves deplete. Alternatively, central bank can build up foreign reserves by purchasing foreign currency from the market against domestic currency. Such intervention would curb the exchange rate appreciation demanded by fundamentals. Therefore, focus on either of the two, that is, movement in exchange rate or variation in foreign reserves, to the complete exclusion of the other, is bound to portray a misleading picture of the external account situation. Given the foregoing a composite variable, that incorporates changes in exchange rate as well as variation in foreign reserves, over a certain period, is needed to characterise the condition of external account. The requisite composite variable has been developed by Girton and Roper (1977) as ‘simple sum of exchange rate depreciation and variation in foreign reserves scaled by monetary base’. They refer to it as exchange market pressure (emp).</jats:p>"

They participate in different mega FTAs such as the RCEP and the CPTPP.

Particularly, the trade conflicts between the U.S. and China have continued since 2018, and the U.S. negated the TPP that turned to CPTPP without the U.S., while India withdrew from the RCEP in Nov. 2019. This paper deals with Mega FTAs as well as East Asian collaboration and competition. It also argues what are East Asian countries’ economic interests by participating in the RCEP and the CPTPP as well as how to overcome the newly emerging protectionism caused by the new U.S. trade policy and trade conflicts between G2.

To this end, we propose game theory based models for the cases where the actors do not have the ability of revising their decisions (Case NR) and the actors have the ability of revising the decisions (Case R). After obtaining the equilibrium decisions in both cases, we compare the decisions under various parameter settings.

One of the many decisions made during the planning of a construction project is the choice of how to control the logistics system of supply. It is impossible to indicate a universal system that will optimally meet the needs of many construction projects due to the individual nature of each project. Properly selected type of logistic service and structure of logistic system allow one to reduce risk in supply chain management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Covid-19 Pandemic affects not only populations around the world but also the environment and natural resources. Lockdowns and restricted new lifestyles have had wide-ranging impacts on the environment (e.g., air quality in cities). Although hygiene and disinfection procedures and precautions are effective ways to protect people from Covid-19, they have significant consequences for water usage and resources especially given the increasing impacts of climate change on rainfall patterns, water use and resources. Climate change and public health issues may compound one another, and so we used a DPSIR Framework (no previous use to examine the actual and potential impacts of Covid-19 and climate change on water consumption and resources) to scope the main factors that may interact to affect water use and resources (in the form of reservoirs) using evidence from Istanbul, Turkiye, with some discussion of the comparative situation in elsewhere. We modified initial views on the framework to account for the regional, city and community level experiences. We noted that water consumption in Istanbul has been increasing over the last two decades (except, it appears, in times of very low rainfall/drought); that there were increases in water consumption in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic; and, despite some increase in rainfall, water levels in reservoirs appeared to decrease during lockdowns (for a range of reasons). Through a new simple way of visualising the data, we also noted that a low resource capacity might be recurring every 6 or 7 years in Istanbul (same finding from Thames Reservoir in London). We made no attempt in this paper to quantify the relative contribution that climate change, population growth etc. are making to water consumption and reservoir levels as we were focused here on scoping those social, environmental and economic factors that appear to play a role in potential water stress and on developing a DPSIR Framework that could aid both subsequent quantitative studies and the development of policy and adaptive management options for Istanbul and other large complex conurbations. If there are periodic water resource issues and temperatures rise as expected in climate projections with an accompanying increase in the duration of hot spells, the subsequent additional stress on water systems might make managing future public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, even more difficult.</jats:p>"

The concept of supply chain (SC) has made a name for itself in the production systems in the past years, and it provides efficiency, time management, customer satisfaction, coordination, etc. It has been drawing attention that SC applications are frequently used in service systems in recent years. The use of this applications, especially in service systems, will make a difference in the health sector, which serves an important purpose and is seen to be at a more important point in speed and plan compared to other sectors. Because speed is very important in the health sector from procurement decision to purchasing, from purchasing to storage, from storage to transportation of products and finally to the final consumer. The fact that the speed factor can be at the desired level requires all stakeholders to be in coordination. Ensuring the flow of information of the coordinated stakeholders through a common system is very important for the flow of material information and needs. For this reason, in this study, SCM of health industry is mentioned first. Afterwards, a comprehensive literature study was shared. Finally, the part of how this subject can be shaped in the future is discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The globalization of markets has resulted in the need to develop supply chains and ensure efficient connections between entities in various remote locations. The dissemination of information technologies has made it possible to increase the excellence of the supply chain, responding to the needs arising from globalization and thus influencing the efficiency of the processes carried out by optimizing the use of resources and implementing new management strategies. Information transfer between its links significantly impacts the supply chain's reliability, safety, and costs of material flow. The introduction of electronic communication significantly accelerated and facilitated the transfer of information and, in some areas, made it possible to abandon traditional paper documentation. Modern digital technologies such as blockchain have the potential to eliminate paper documentation while increasing the security and certainty of the transferred data. This article analyzes the current flow of information and documents in the supply chain. The article presents the characteristics of the supply chain operation in terms of the flow of information accompanying the flow of cargo and the digitization of document circulation in the digital supply chain in the context of using electronic data interchange (EDI) or blockchain. The ELECTRA tool was presented concerning the discussed area, which is being developed as part of the ongoing project (Electronic Waybill for Combined Transport and Forwarding) in the EUREKA initiative, financed by the National Center for Research and Development. This tool combines the latest technological solutions to improve the flow of transport documents. The article ended with a summary, pointing to the potential of using modern solutions and the lack of technological barriers. However, the existing legislative barriers were emphasized.</jats:p>",

Ever since the launch of Windows 95 and Intel Pentium chip, the Internet has grown at an exponential rate, never witnessed before in any industry. At the turn of the century as many as 387 million people were hooked to Internet [UNCTAD (2003), p. 2]. As this bubble of Internet expanded, it started engulfing every aspect of life and business. The sheer difference of processes on Internet resulted in new terms as e-commerce and e-business to be coined up. In five years since 1995, Internet grew from simple information searching to controlling under sea robots. The biggest market penetration however, has been online retail stores and business to business (B2B) commerce. Online shopping has its potential because of its easy access by the customers and B2B commerce has its attraction in the savings achieved by implementing e-processes. Another advantage of doing business on Internet is the audit trail, with which any dubious transactions, from anywhere in the world could be traced back to its originator.</jats:p>"

Evaluation of ecological economic balance is of great importance in sustainable ecosystem management. This paper was conducted to develop the ecological economic balance structure based on the water supply and land cover changes. Land use was considered in four time periods from 2000 to 2021 with seven-year intervals to evaluate the process of land cover change and water availability. The results showed that the southern and eastern regions addressed a negative trend in the ecological economic balance.

We firstly explore the historical production of climate injustice through extractive economies of colonial control, the accumulation of climate debts, and ongoing patterns of uneven exchange. We develop an account which highlights the relationship between the production, exchange, and consumption of fossil fuels and historical and contemporary inequalities around race, class, and gender which need to be addressed if a meaningful account of climate justice is to take root. We then explore the role of resistance to the expansion of fossil-fuel frontiers and campaigns to leave fossil fuels in the ground with which we are involved. We reflect on their potential role in enabling the power shifts necessary to rebalance energy economies and disrupt incumbent actors as a prerequisite to the achievement of climate justice.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a methodological contribution to the system dynamics and supply chain research communities by developing a novel framework for supply chain models by combining three classic modeling methods: co‐flow differential equation structures, spot price discovery, and multinomial logistic choice modeling. The relative economic values of possible dispositions of goods, including outright disposal, are considered. For work‐in‐progress, development is considered in terms of the economic value that an additional unit of time will bring to the finished good, and the interplay of these considerations drive goods through, or out of, supply chains. Incorporating these mechanisms can produce materially different behavior modes and can be applied to multiple levels of aggregation within a production process. © 2022 The Author. <jats:italic>System Dynamics Review</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of System Dynamics Society.</jats:p>",

Survey methods have been deployed based on the constructs obtained from the literature. Data collection through a survey resulted in 202 valid responses. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirms the constructs and the mediating effect of the DSCs through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The study is among the few studies that examine the I4TE impact on DSCs and S.P. The results show that industry 4.0 technologies enhance the sustainable performance of firms. Results also show a complete mediation of DSCs on the inter-relationship between I4TEs and S.P. Those DSCs with I4TE inclusion can transform an organization’s strategic decision-making. For the authors, this study is the first of its kind. Although some of the literature explored different aspects of the concept of industry 4.0 and digitalizing supply chains, studies have yet to specifically evaluate the potential impacts of digital supply chains on sustainable performance. The novelty of DSCs is their support of firms in improving their preparedness, agility, and transparency to strengthen their sustainable performance. These DSCs will provide agile, collaboration, responsiveness, end-to-end visibility, and resilient supply chains to diminish supply risk and enrich preparedness and responsiveness to recuperate quickly from uncertainty amidst the pandemic. The study will help managers re-designing their strategic planning, resulting in new cost reduction and resilience models for supply chains. The study calls for firms to employ multiple DSCs once they have set clear strategic priorities. The overall findings of the work fill the literature gaps of studies in the digitalization of supply chains.</jats:p>"

Currently, the highest power capacity for the IPT system is 1 MW by Korea RailRoad Institute for high in-motion charging of speed trains. However, for stationary charging applications, maximum power capacity implemented using IPT is only up to 200 kW accomplished by Bombardier PRIMOVE for bus charging. For marine application, charging can take place at quay, therefore only static charging is possible. In this paper, the specifications of MF Ampere ferry have been used for the feasibility study. Through analytical calculations and PSIM Simulation, it was established that several low powers (100 kW IPT systems) need to be paralleled for 1 MW power transfer. Building a single unit of 1 MW is not feasible due to involved voltage and current stress across the components and limited space available onboard as well as onshore. 100 kW power level can be implemented despite of involved misalignments. However, if primary is somehow kept stationary with respect to secondary, for example using vacuum pad mooring technology developed by Wärtsilä and Cavotec, then a single unit of 200 kW could be implemented without any forced cooling. 10 units of 100 kW (without any mechanical mooring assistance) or 5 units of 200 kW (with mechanical mooring assistance) are the two proposed solutions for implementing a fast charger for 1 MW level.</jats:p>"

To proxy financial development, the Financial Development Index (FDi) of IMF and its eight sub-indices are chosen. The findings of this work show that the FDi Granger causes per capita income in Turkey. Therefore, one can say that the SLH holds for the Turkish economy at the aggregate level.

Many economies have adopted or planned for strategies to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic goods and materials. The benefits of reductions in waste generation and GHG emissions need to be evaluated for setting the priority to select policy instruments for managing various plastic materials, products, and wastes. Several studies have made evaluations for the circulation of plastic using different models. However, many models for the circular economy focused on the effect on the macroeconomy rather than the detailed supply chain effects of an individual policy proposal. The reason could be the lack of an environmental assessment model with sufficient clear resolutions in the sectors, waste types, and waste treatments. In addition, the structure of the models limits many studies in modeling the scenarios diverting end-of-life products from waste treatments to recycling and reuse as secondary materials. To bridge this gap, this study adopted the waste input-output analysis methodology and compiled the models of baseline and four scenarios using the data of Taiwan with reference to a classification of four kinds of circular intervention from a review paper. We provide the details about the modeling results and settings for diverting plastic to the solid recovered fuel for power generation, closing the loops of plastic bags, extending the life of plastic cabinets and other plastic products, and improving the plastic products supply chain’s resource efficiencies. In the illustration of the results of GHG reductions in the supply chains and waste treatment activities, we present Sankey diagrams, which make the analysis of supply chains more straightforward. The developed method to render the Sankey diagram from the modeling result of an input-output-based model is presented in this article.</jats:p>"

As regards the supply side, the relative prices and capacity variable are important in determining the textile and clothing exports, however, the real wages have significant but small effect on textile and clothing exports supply.

The traditional supply chain management system has high storage costs and poor timeliness. In contrast, the application of big data technology in the supply chain management system will provide customers with more personalized services, so that the supply chain can achieve lean production and lean management, and the supply and demand response is more rapid. This thesis gives examples of three different companies to analyze the big data technology that they are using, which are Walmart, Toyota, and Amazon. After a series of comparative processing, it can be found that big data technology promotes production efficiency and plays an increasingly important role in the process of enterprise management. Although in the early stage of big data technology, enterprises will experience many unknown difficulties, such as loss of confidence, and the tools for processing data are not efficient enough. However, by using the data center constructed by big data technology, it can better explore the hidden value of various data and provide a stable and efficient platform for enterprise development.

The data analysis used descriptive analysis, marketing margin, and breeder's share. The study showed that there are six distribution channels for cattle and beef cattle in Gorontalo regency, one of which are Channel: Breeder-Collector-Kalimantan Island. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there had been a change in this channel, namely Breeder-Collector - PT. Rizki Mandiri-Social Assistance.  Neither the delivery time nor the quota sent can be precisely predicted. The only weakness is there is no written agreement at the breeders’ level. The information on the price is not well integrated. The number of slaughtered or sold cattle was higher before the pandemic than that during the pandemic. On the other side, the prices for beef cattle and beef have increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of all the beef cattle distribution channels, channel 1 has the largest marketing margin value at IDR 5,500,000/head, and the smallest farmer's share is 38.8 percent.</jats:p>"

To reduce the impact of emerging risks, it is necessary to identify priority risks for further risk mitigation actions. This study aims to identify risks seen from the perception of each sustainable supply chain actor and evaluate the highest priority risk of each sustainable supply chain actor in mango commodities. The study uses primary data by conducting interviews and filling out questionnaires by informants from businessmen, farmers, and collector of mango commodity in Gresik District. Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FFMEA) technique is used to determine the priority of risk mitigation efforts. The results show that there are 16 risk components for UD WN Mango Sultan and collectors, and 11 risk components for farmers. Meanwhile, the priority risks for farmers, collectors, and UD WN Mango Sultan are operational risk (5,355), social risk (7,414), and environmental risk (7,917).</jats:p>",

Current approaches for addressing this challenge, which has the potential to result in catastrophic outcomes for consumptive needs and economic growth, rely on increasing the efficient use of existing resources. However, the availability of freshwater resources is rapidly declining due to over-exploitation and climate change and, therefore, is unlikely to sustainably address future needs, which requires a rethink of our solutions and associated investments. Here we present a bold departure from existing approaches by establishing the viability of significantly increasing freshwater through the capture of humid air over oceans. We show that the atmosphere above the oceans proximal to the land can yield substantial freshwater, sufficient to support large population centers across the globe, using appropriately engineered structures. Due to the practically limitless supply of water vapor from the oceans, this approach is sustainable under climate change and can transform our ability to address present and future water security concerns. This approach is envisioned to be transformative in establishing a mechanism for sustainably providing freshwater security to the present and future generations that is economically viable.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the objective was to evaluate feeding strategies during a prolonged feed availability shortage in group-housed finishing pigs and assess the impacts on pig performance. A total of 1,407 mixed-sex pigs (92 ± 11 kg BW) were randomly allocated to one of five treatments across 60 pens (N = 12 pens per treatment, 22 pigs per pen) and were blocked by initial body weight (BW) within the replicate, over a 21-d test period. Treatments were fed for 14 d (P1), and thereafter all pens returned to ad libitum access to a standard commercial diet for 7 d (P2). Treatments included: 1) Pens fed ad libitum (CON); 2) Pens fed at 1.45X ME maintenance requirement daily of CON diet (1.45X); 3) Pens fed 2X ME maintenance requirement daily of CON diet (2X); 4) Tightened feeders to the lowest setting, fed ad libitum of CON diet (CF); and 5) whole corn kernels, fed ad libitum (WC). P1 and P2 BW and feed disappearance were recorded to calculate ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Data were analyzed with pen as the experimental unit and least-squares means values reported by treatment. Compared to CON, pens fed 1.45X, 2X, CF, and WC treatments had significantly reduced P1 ADG (1.09 vs. 0.02, 0.34, 0.72, 0.41 kg/d, respectively), ADFI (3.21 vs. 1.42, 1.90, 2.49, 2.40 kg/d, respectively) and G:F (P &amp;lt; 0.05). During P2, ADG and G:F were increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) compared to CON across all treatments. However, ADFI increased only in the 2X, CF, and WC diet from the CON (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Overall (days 0 to 21), all strategies attenuated BW, ADG, and ADFI (P &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to CON. However, G:F was only reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in 1.45X and WC, but not 2X and CF (P &amp;gt; 0.05) compared to CON. In conclusion, all strategies explored could extend feed budgets. Even though these strategies were successful, increased BW variability was reported with more restrictive strategies. Further, adverse pig behaviors and welfare implications needs to be considered in adopting any restrictive feeding strategy.</jats:p>",

The second approach consisted in modeling the load switching behaviour taking into account the event of the mission flight sequence. The article also analyses the state of the energy balance based on the events of the mission flight sequence, as well as predicts the effect of power peaks on battery discharge behaviour. Busbar regulation was implemented, the converter block and converter efficiency were modeled using resistive resistance in parallel to its input ports. It is noted that the fill factor of the converter was controlled using a PI controller and a comparator, which measure the load voltage and compare it with the reference value.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the significant changes made by the Government of Tanzania over the last two decades is mainstreaming of civic engagement mechanisms into water supply management. This instigation is motivated by the belief that civic engagement would contribute to greater voice and oversight of government functions through shared decisions, responsibility, transparency, trust and respect of public input. However, little evidence affirms the capability of citizens to articulate their voice in water service decision-making spaces. It is obvious that citizens’ ability to articulate their voice is associated with the extent to which their voices are mainstreamed in water service decision-making spaces. This study, therefore, examined the extent to which citizens’ voices are mainstreamed in water service decision-makings spaces. A mixed-method approach was used to generate data through survey of 376 households, 4 focus group discussions, 14 in-depth interviews, and field observations. The result shows that the spaces for decision making are moderately open for citizens but they are less capable to influence the pre-determined position of the public officials. There is also a lack of citizens’ readiness to engage with government to some provided responsibilities in National Water Policy of 2002 and National Water Resources Management Act of 2009. All these hold-ups are a result of unclear ownership of water infrastructure and, therefore, citizens assumed it the responsibility of the government alone to deliver and maintain water sources. The author recommended for citizen’s empowerment for creating awareness and capacity interventions for effective water supply management. </jats:p>"

To realize sustainable development, firms established an environment-friendly economic development model by building a circular supply chain and implementing a green innovation strategy, which is expected to save resources and protect the environment by recycling resources. Based on this background, this study aims to determine the relationship between the uncertainty of economic policy, green innovation strategy, and circular supply chain performance. It divides green innovation strategies into green product innovation, green process innovation, green service innovation, and green logistics innovation to explore their different impacts on the performance of the circular supply chain. Simultaneously, the moderating effect of uncertainty of economic policy between green innovation and the performance of the circular supply chain is explored. Using survey data collected from 308 manufacturing firms in China, we empirically test the theoretical model and proposed hypotheses through the structural equation modeling approach. Our findings demonstrate that green product innovation, green process innovation, green logistics innovation, and green service innovation have a positive impact on the performance of the circular supply chain. Moreover, we also find that, contrary to our expectations, economic policy uncertainty plays a positive role in moderating the relationship between green innovation and circular supply chain performance. We believe that this paper has a clear contribution to the research on green innovation and circular supply chain management. This study provides a new perspective for the research on the integration of green innovation and circular supply chain, deepens firms’ understanding of green innovation strategy and circular supply chain, and provides important implications and guidance for manufacturing firms to better manage green innovation and circular supply chain practice as well as the risk of economic policy uncertainty.</jats:p>"

Focusing on business environments, we examine if information sharing between distinct partners can be a mutually beneficial option. In principle, information affects the preferences and the actions of decision makers and usually contributes to inefficiencies for the entire system. A supply chain with two rational firms is considered; the firms have conflicting objectives and possess information that cannot be verified. Real-time communication through a cloud platform is allowed, before the firms finalise their strategies. During the communication phase, both firms are free to report whatever information optimises their individual objectives, even fake. Misinformation seems a plausible option, especially in competitive environments, since the firms may take advantages from such behaviour. We demonstrate that sharing the actual information can be beneficial for both, under the implementation of an appropriate mechanism that considers the welfare of the entire chain. Despite the individualistic behaviour of independent decision makers, it is doable to eliminate entirely information asymmetry and misinformation. This happens by including sufficient incentives on a mechanism that induce firms to reveal their information, because it is in their self-interest to do so. The value of information and the expected benefits of the voluntary information sharing are calculated, indicating the potential improvement.</jats:p>",

The proposed framework covers all phases of risk management, namely, risk identification, risk miti-gation and control. In the risk identification phase of the framework, the supply chain is decomposed into either material-level or product-level sub-networks according to the decision maker’s preference. Afterwards, the most crit-ical sub-network is modelled to evaluate different risk mitigation strategies. In particular, a combination of redun-dancy and flexibility strategies is considered for risk mitigation. These strategies are evaluated by simulation models in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency. While inventory holding cost is used as efficiency measure, effective-ness of the strategies is measured by premium freight ratio. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive and reliable decision support since it covers all phases of risk management and relies on quantitative data, and statistical analysis in risk modelling. Moreover, it is flexible as it can be easily adapted to any change in supply chain environ-ment and strategy. In order to show the applicability of the framework, a practical demonstration is presented for a European automotive company. The results indicate that the proposed framework improves the supply chain perfor-mance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, despite being completely managed ecosystems, the valli da pesca have conserved typical elements of transitional water environments that the other parts of the lagoon have lost. By evaluating nine ESs using a spatially explicit approach, we found that the valli da pesca, despite covering 17% of the surface, are contributing for 38% of the ESs total capacity, and for 24% of the ESs total flow, in comparison to the open part of the lagoon. Moreover, the management that aims to maximize in a perspective of sustainability some provisioning ESs, such as extensive aquaculture, can positively influence the presence of factors on which other ESs capacity is also based. As a result, the open lagoon benefits from a sort of spill-over effect for lifecycle support, hunting, and cultural ESs such as tourism, information for cognitive development, and birdwatching. Such significant contributions could be endangered in the context of a lagoon subjected to increasing pressures from anthropic activities, where adaptations to impacts, as well as to climate change and sea-level rise effects, in the long run, will modify the lagoon hydrodynamics and the sea-lagoon connectivity, threatening the valli da pesca and so their ESs supply.</jats:p>"

This article begins by describing the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 and the initial ‘priority-rated’ contracts agreed to under Operation Warp Speed in 2020 to expedite manufacturing and achieve scale, which succeeded in producing hundreds of millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines by early 2021. However, a puzzle soon emerged, as the scale of US vaccine production was shortly thereafter overtaken by plants in the European Union and India. The paper investigates the trade-offs US policy-makers faced in early 2021—once much of the initial uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of many Covid-19 vaccines had been resolved—about whether to recalibrate contracts to expand production capacity to help meet global, instead of US, vaccine demand. It also examines the emergence of input shortages and assesses whether both the price constraints implicit in the 2020 DPA contracts and business decisions made to quicken the process of bringing new vaccine plants online globally inadvertently exacerbated them. It also explores the potential need for complementary, input capacity-enhancing policies in the face of highly fragmented, cross-border Covid-19 vaccine supply chains.</jats:p>",

To maintain the core function of supplying food to end consumers, a new framework must be developed to investigate the strategies for coordinating a new supply chain comprised of multiple suppliers with random output. Thus, in both decentralized and centralized systems, this paper constructs a supply chain model of a retailer procuring from multiple suppliers and characterizes each party’s optimal decisions. These results show that: (1) the optimal order quantity, profit of each part, and overall profit of the supply chain in the concentrated situation are better than those in the decentralized situation, and the transmission mechanism is slightly different from the classic newsboy model; (2) a supply chain coordination contract consisting of price discounts and compensation is designed, which can realize the coordination of a retailer and multiple suppliers with random yield in the endogenous price situation. These results imply that managers can develop sustainable food supply chains during uncertain times by ordering from these multi-suppliers with random yield. This paper adds to the literature on random yield assembly systems by taking into account that multiple suppliers have random component distributions.</jats:p>"

Shortage of electronic components was first noticed in car factories, and then in the entire electronics industry. The US, Taiwan and China are the largest markets for semiconductor manufacturers, which are no longer able to meet the everincreasing demand for chips. Lack of production capacity is mostly felt by consumers of final products. Ensuring a steady supply of chips is an important task for major manufacturers. In order to ensure the supply of chips, it is important to establish criteria by which semiconductor manufacturing countries can be arranged. The ranking will help identify the countries that are worth investing the most in the short term. The European Union, the United States and major telecommunications companies will invest billions of dollars in 2022 to replenish the market. The article analyzes the criteria for investing in chipproducing countries. The main focus of this analysis is the chip supply chain. Each of the analyzed countries has at least one stage of chip production: design, manufacturing or assembly. Data analyzed: gross domestic product, net exports, price of one dollar in relation to the national currency, monthly average wages, Oxford COVID-19 government response severity index and semiconductor export volume. These criteria allow us to rank countries from the most attractive to the least attractive for investment. The TOPSIS method was chosen for ranking, but comparative data analysis and analysis of scientific literature and other sources of information were also applied. Method principle, formulas and application – to be described. It was determined which country is the most favorable for short-term investments, taking into account the given criteria.</jats:p>",

During its use, also groundwater radon is adsorbed on activated carbon where it radioactively decays to Pb-210 within a few days. The intermediate stages of radioactive decay produce gamma radiation outside the filter, which can be harmful to health. In addition, EU legislation sets a clearance level of 1 kBq/kg for the Pb-210 concentration of waste, above which disposal of carbon waste can be complicated, depending on national legislation. This study focused on activated carbon filters from two groundwater plants. Measurements were made over the service lifetime of the activated carbon and included measurements of adsorption of radon from water to carbon, radiation dose rates outside the filters and Pb-210 concentrations in the carbon. The study observed a rapid decrease in the radon adsorption rate of activated carbon during the first year of use. This phenomenon has a significant effect on the concentration of Pb-210 in the activated carbon waste at the end of service life. The calculated forecast model clearly showed that the risk of exceeding the clearance level of Pb-210 increases if the radon concentration in the raw water exceeds 100 Bq/L.</jats:p>",

A novel equation was also proposed using gene expression programming to predict the water surface profile. In order to evaluate the performance and efficacy of these models, statistical indices are used to validate the produced models for the experimental analysis. The findings demonstrate that the suggested ANN model accurately predicted the water surface profile, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.999, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.003, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.107%, respectively, when compared with GEP, SVM, and previously developed methods.

Here the stochastic production frontier and technical inefficiency effects model are estimated based on the data gathered from 800 smallholder dairy farms in Pakistan. The results suggest that the technical inefficiency of the participating farms is significantly reduced. A strong impact of the supply chain is also detected in reducing technical inefficiency of farms that are located in remote areas and on those that have larger herd-size. Experienced farmers upto the age of 36 years have the advantage of reducing technical inefficiency. The remaining differences in relative inefficiency of dairy farms are accounted for by severe long-term depressive disorders.

Applications of green supply chain management in companies could help to minimize the impact of environmental pollution. However GSCM performance measurement has not been widely carried out in the rubber processing industry, especially those located in South Sumatra.

Inductive voltage transformers were exposed to specific working conditions in the form of ferroresonance oscillations with the participation of measurement and protective transformers. The disadvantage and negative significance of the phenomenon contributed to the development of the most convenient elimination methods, which is the main goal and achievement of the publication. The analysis of the proposed solutions were carried out on a theoretical model of a 30 kV power network model created and run in the Electromagnetic Transients Program/Alternative Transients Program (EMTP/ATP). The article presents several results of computer simulations carried out together with their complete characteristics (phase voltage waveforms on the primary side of voltage transformers), which allowed us to indicate the disadvantages and advantages of the solutions developed, and choose the most favorable methods to eliminate nonlinear oscillations. In the article, we present an analysis of all aspects contributing to the solution to the problem. This has permitted an appropriate conclusion to be made indicating the advantage of the method based on the use of a damping resistor in the open delta circuit compared to other solutions. Current solutions are largely based on a product using active variation of the resistance of an open delta attached resistor. The concept in this paper is based on a fixed resistance value, which is a different approach to the problem. By using a switch, the resistor is only connected when a fault occurs. Thanks to this solution, the secondary winding of the open delta is not additionally loaded (despite the very high resistance) at all times during the operation of the power network, as is the case with the available solution.</jats:p>"

It is shown that in the literature there are data on the energy consumption of different treatments: turning - 2 kJ/cm3, milling - 9 kJ/cm3, grinding - 60 kJ/cm3, electrospark treatment - 3000 kJ/cm3. At the same time, the specific energy consumption of steel grinding is 60 kJ/cm3. And the specific heat of fusion of steel is 0.64 kJ/cm3. As a result, 100 times more heat is pumped into the steel during grinding than is needed to melt it. That is, there is a contradiction.\nTo find ways to resolve this contradiction, it is more accurate to estimate the specific energy consumption of diamond-abrasive machining of superhard materials through additional consideration, in addition to productivity and effective machining power, wear of the working layer of the wheel.</jats:p>"

This study aims to present the barriers that impede the application of CE concepts in the food supply chain (FSC) which received limited literature recognition. A systematic literature review is utilized to scrutinize challenges, resulting in 17 factors that burden CE adoption. The challenges were categorized under six subsets and were prioritized based on two perspectives: literature importance and empirical importance. A combination of literature frequency analysis and Field-Weighted Citation Impact was employed to derive the rankings related to literature importance. The pragmatic importance of challenging factors is derived using the Fuzzy Best-Worst method. Both rankings reveal that cost efficiency consideration is the most critical barrier that hinders the transition to CE in FSC. Thus, this paper highlights similarities and differences in the perspectives of academia and practicality by comparing the two prioritizations. The findings can be used to remove obstacles, create policies and strategies, and assist governments in implementing circular practices throughout FSC.</jats:p>"

Since the recent evolution of the technology, blockchain promises a high potential ability to guarantee and track the originality of products, also effectively managing the supply chain. Moreover, blockchain has been recognized as one of the eight major technologies that can change our lives if used in the right direction for the benefit of society and countries' economies. In Kazakhstan, there is a lack of infrastructure to support food supply, as well as a number of issues regarding increased control over prices by the government. The purpose of this study is to identify the benefits of blockchain, which facilitates the effective management of the food supply chain, the ability to meet the needs of all stakeholders, and a comparison with the traditional supply chain system. The article uses factor analysis, taking into account economic, political, social, technological interests, through which the existing problems at the moment are uncovered. The results show that the application of blockchain in the food supply chain leads to positive demand from the government, producers and end consumers. The value of the work lies in the theoretical study, which drew on the experience of recent research around the world, adaptation in Kazakhstan and the possibility of application in the context of food security.

In the Econometric modelling lag occupies a central role.

Friend-shoring, a contraction of “friends” and “offshoring”, suggests developing partnerships with close friend countries, stopping the relocation of industrial activities to the other side of the planet based solely on the criterion of low labour costs. The key idea is to build regional value chains, which could ultimately be much more sustainable. The objective of this short communication is to highlight the conditions of appearance of the friend-shoring concept and its main economic and environmental issues in a value chain perspective, and then to insist on the limits of its implementation. Given the current absence of friend-shoring experiments, the chosen methodology relies on a speculative approach based on the exploration of scientific knowledge about regional supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phosphorus (P) is the most important substance in inorganic fertilizers used in agriculture industry. In this study, a multi-product and multi-objective model is presented considering economic and environmental concerns to design a renewable and sustainable P-fertilizer supply chain management (PFSCM). To handle complexities of the proposed model, an ensemble knowledge-based three-stage heuristic-metaheuristic algorithm utilizing heuristic information available in the model, whale optimization algorithm, and variable neighborhood search (named H-WOA-VNS) is proposed. At first, a problem-dependent heuristic is designed to generate a set of near-optimal feasible solutions. These solutions are fed into a population-based whale optimization algorithm which benefits from both exploration and exploitation strategies. Finally, a single-solution metaheuristic based on variable neighborhood search is applied to further improve the quality of the solution using local search operators. The objective function of the algorithm is formulated as a weighted average function to minimize total economic cost, while increasing crop yield and P use efficiency. Experimental results over five synthetic datasets and a real case study of the P-fertilizer supply chain confirm the superiority of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art techniques. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in optimizing both the economic cost and environmental issues.</jats:p>"

The specificity of the examined waste processing company requires the knowledge about the size of potential deliveries because the delivered waste must be properly managed and stored due to its toxicity to the natural environment. In the article, hidden Markov models were used to assess the level of supply. They are a statistical modeling tool used to analyze and predict the phenomena of a sequence of events. It is not always possible to provide sufficiently reliable information with the existing classical methods in this regard. Therefore, the article proposes modeling techniques with the help of stochastic processes. In hidden Markov models, the system is represented as a Markov process with states that are invisible to the observer but with a visible output (observation) that is a random state function. In the article, the distribution of outputs from the hidden states is defined by a polynomial distribution.</jats:p>"

Attention was drawn to the fact that the study of the problems of EU cooperation with third countries, in particular within the framework of the Energy Community, meets the most important needs of today and is of significant importance for the further development of the EU energy sector.&#x0D;\nIf we take into account the energy sphere, the growing shortage of energy carriers and the rise in their prices emphasize the continuing importance of safe and affordable energy, and the hostilities in Ukraine are expected to significantly affect the state of security of energy supplies to the EU.&#x0D;\nThe author analyzed the main obligations of Ukraine to ensure and maintain an adequate level of gas supply, as well as the scope of recently proposed and adopted changes to the EU regulatory framework. By adopting the Treaty on the Energy Community, Ukraine undertook to adopt the main energy legislation of the EU, the so-called «acquis communautaire». The European Commission immediately informs Ukraine of amendments to any EU acts transforming the EU acquis, and Ukraine, in turn, reflects changes in the EU legal framework in its national legislation regulating the energy sector.&#x0D;\nSome attention is also paid to the study of possible obstacles to reducing the EU's dependence on the supply of energy resources from Russia as a result of military aggression towards Ukraine, and the importance of overcoming such dependence is substantiated.&#x0D;\n The author comes to the conclusion that all these legislative changes will undoubtedly be important for the energy sector of Ukraine, as our state is not only a transit state for the EU in the field of energy supply, but also a candidate for joining the EU.&#x0D;\nIt was concluded that member states should cooperate in order to promote regional and bilateral solidarity, since EU member states alone will not be able to effectively deal with the risk of serious economic difficulties as a result of significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas. It was determined that minimizing the negative consequences of crisis situations due to improper gas supply is impossible without effective coordination and unification of actions of all EU member states.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the supply chain flow consisted of material flow in the form of green beans that flowed from upstream to downstream, the flow of information in the form of information (quantity, price, and quality of green beans) that flowed from upstream to downstream and from downstream to upstream, and financial flows in the form of cash payment transactions that flow from downstream to upstream. The performance of coffee supply chain management in Ciamis Regency has an average category with a value of 56.91. The most significant farmer's share value is found in the distribution channel from farmers to inter-regency traders, ending with outside-regency traders.</jats:p>",

Supply chain relationships have been evaluated in earlier research to demonstrate how concentrations of customers and suppliers may either favorably or adversely impact innovation. These metrics, however, only take into account how closely a firm is connected to its direct customers or suppliers. This study integrates the top five suppliers and customers of Chinese listed manufacturing firms and considers the relationship embeddedness of each firm’s direct customers and suppliers, as well as the structure embeddedness among the customers’ customers, customers’ suppliers, suppliers’ customers, and suppliers’ suppliers to reveal the true impact of supply chain relationships on innovation performance. The top five suppliers and consumers of each firm are chosen to build a supply network for each year using panel data of listed Chinese manufacturing firms from 2013 to 2020. Social network analysis is used to determine network centrality and structural holes. The results show that in the supply network, network centrality and structural holes are significantly negatively correlated with innovation performance, especially in small and medium-sized firms, non-state-owned firms, and firms in recession phase. According to the moderating effect model, digital transformation is an efficient way to reduce the negative effect of supply network position on innovation performance. The research results will further improve the supply network cooperation mechanism, which is of great significance for improving supply chain resilience and firms’ innovation.</jats:p>"

Some laboratory experiments were performed in a mobile-bed flume for both of steady an unsteady flow to validate the proposed model. For improving the simulation, first, the role of sediment transport formulas, coupled–uncoupled approaches and simplification in the mass continuity equation are investigated. Comparisons between experimental data and model performance highlight the advantage of coupled method over the uncoupled method, domain role of sediment transport model in the bed morphological simulation and inaccuracy of aggradation processes due to simplifying the mixture continuity equation. Second, the importance of changing alluvial roughness is established by testing the model with calibrated and optimized friction factors. The inverse problem of estimating alluvial flow roughness is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization model coupled with alluvial flow model. The study demonstrates that the application of GA in the search for optimal values of roughness coefficients can significantly reduce computational errors and improve the computed water stage hydrographs. Role of the choice of the objective function is also mentioned.</jats:p>",

Supply chain integration has a critical impact on operational performance. Nevertheless, this impact has not been consistent and showed mixed results throughout the literature. This study aimed to examine the impact of technology management in terms of supply chain integration on operational performance. The research model was empirically validated using 317 valid survey responses from the Jordanian food and beverage industry, which were subjected to quantitative research design and regression analysis. Results showed that supply chain integration had a direct significant impact on operational performance, and all three dimensions of the theoretical model contributed significantly to operational performance. This study suggests the critical need to create and implement proper supply chain integration strategies and technologies, both internally and externally, to enhance their performance and competitive advantage.

The minimum and maximum nodal chlorine concentrations and water ages at each α-cut level were obtained by the genetic algorithm (GA) based on EPANET hydraulic and water quality simulation toolkit. The fuzziness of nodal chlorine concentrations and water ages were measured using the fuzziness measure (FM) proposed in this paper. The method was applied to four networks to analyze the fuzziness of nodal chlorine concentrations and water ages. The results indicated that the distribution of nodal chlorine concentrations does not follow typical trapezoid distribution, while the distribution of nodal water ages follows typical trapezoid distribution. In addition, the chlorine concentration and water ages of nodes farther from the source are affected by uncertain parameters to a greater extent. The greater demands of nodes lead to less effects of uncertain parameters on chlorine concentration, and greater effects of uncertain parameters on water ages. This study would help in analyzing the fuzziness of hydraulic and water quality simulation results in WDS under uncertain conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To create cavities when dissolving rock salt, it is most expedient to supply the solvent through the nozzles of a perforated pipe in the form of submerged jets. This article examines the physical dissolution of a cavity with water from a stationary nozzle with a diameter of 0.004 m at two constant velocities at the nozzle cross-section. The efficiency of cavity dissolution, which has an almost cylindrical shape with a semi-cylindrical bottom, was analyzed at a nozzle cross-section speed of 8.85 m/s. The obtained results are explained on the basis of the fact that the formed cavity is a short dead-end channel where longitudinal compression acts. The flow in such a channel is caused by the back pressure exerted by its end. And the back pressure, in turn, hinders the development of the jet that flows out of the stationary nozzle, limiting its range. The cessation of significant expansion of the jet is indirectly confirmed by the use of an empirical formula for the distribution of the maximum water velocity along the axis of the jet. Its value at the end of the section of the most intense dissolution of the cavity becomes 8.85 times smaller compared to the speed at the nozzle cross-section. The boundaries of the area of the most intense dissolution of the cavity are determined by the relationship between the depth of the cavity, the diameter of the nozzle, the velocity at its cross-section, and the time of dissolution, which can be used to model the dissolution of cavities at different values of the velocity at the cross-section of the nozzle at its constant diameter. It was found that the relationship between the radius and depth of the cavity is linear. The angle between the boundary of the cavity size change and the axis of the nozzle is 20°23'. These results show that the dissolution of cavities is effective in a limited range of their dissolution time, the limits of which depend on the velocity of the solvent at the nozzle section. To confirm the obtained results, it is necessary to investigate the geometric characteristics of the cavities for other values of the nozzle diameters.</jats:p>"

Many changes in public policy and health measures were developed and implemented with the intention of slowing the spread of the novel virus. Disruptions from the global pandemic created major supply chain consequences due to stockpiling of essential goods (alcohol-based hand sanitizers and surface disinfectants), impacts on trade routes, and limitations on modes of transportation due to border closures. Rapid increase in the use of hand sanitizers and surface disinfectants significantly affected the production capacity of high-quality ethanol (e.g., USP and FCC grade) resulting in regulatory changes in countries facing shortages. Prompt enactment of government policies allowed for use of alcohol with higher impurities to offset heightened demand and increase commercial availability. Changes in monitoring methods were also observed, where many agencies began to track viral shedding through municipal wastewater. In this chapter, we will discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on public policies and health measures, economics as it relates to supply chain disruptions, and the implementation of novel monitoring methods to survey the spread of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In developing countries, most water distribution systems (WDS) are operated as intermittent water supply (IWS) systems. A significant share of them also delivers water to consumers in irregular and unreliable ways. To meet water demands under such inconsistent WDS operations, IWS consumers commonly adapt to flexible consumption behaviors characterized by storing the limited water available during shorter supply periods in intermediate storage facilities for subsequent usage during more extended non-supply periods. Towards accounting for this characteristic behavior in understanding the IWS behavior more realistically, this paper presented the development, functioning, and application of a novel open-source PYTHON-based simulation tool (EPyT-IWS) for WDS, virtually acting like an IWS modeling extension of EPANET 2.2. EPyT-IWS integrates EPANET 2.2 solver with an independent hydraulic solver to mimic the water withdrawal during supply periods, storage in intermediate storage facilities, and subsequent use. The applicability of the simulation tool was demonstrated by performing extended-period hydraulic simulations on a typical WDS with representative IWS attributes. The simulation outcomes showed that practicing the typical consumption behavior, involving storing water within underground tanks and later pumping it into overhead tanks, allows consumers to cope with the intermittent water availability and meet their demands very suitably. Besides the water supply duration, the clock time of water supply in IWS systems was predicted to influence consumers' ability to fill the intermediate storage tanks and meet water demands. This study's overall findings can advance the state-of-the-art for planning, designing, and operating WDS with IWS characteristics.</jats:p>"

We conduct a multimodal critical discourse analysis of a broad range of sources, including videos and interviews. We show that through its discursive strategies, the RSPO allocates the responsibility for social and environmental issues to the two extremes of the supply chain: objectifying consumers at one end and smallholders at the other, hence reproducing and even exacerbating the traditional imbalanced power dynamics in supply chains.

Indeed, the role of leucine in the postprandial activation of protein synthesis has been clearly established, even though supplementation studies aimed at taking advantage of this property are rather disappointing. Furthermore, there is ample evidence of an association between the elevation of their plasma concentrations and insulin resistance or the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, although there are many confounding factors, starting with the level of animal protein consumption. After a summary of their metabolism and anabolic properties, we analyze in this review the factors likely to increase the plasma concentrations of BCAAs, including insulin-resistance. After an analysis of supplementation or restriction studies in search of a direct role of BCAAs in insulin resistance, we discuss an indirect role through some of their metabolites: branched-chain keto acids, C3 and C5 acylcarnitines, and hydroxyisobutyrate. Overall, given the importance of insulin in the metabolism of these amino acids, it is very likely that small alterations in insulin sensitivity are responsible for a reduction in their catabolism long before the onset of impaired glucose tolerance.</jats:p>"

Also, new opportunities for UPS systems have emerged with the development of novel storage technologies, power electronic topologies, rapid electronic devices, high-performance digital apps, and other technological advances. Servers and storage systems, personal computers, medical equipment, telecommunication systems, and industrial equipment all require clean, stable, and uninterrupted power supply from UPS systems. Several recent studies have focused on the design of UPS systems to provide continuous power under normal or abnormal power conditions, including power outages. Such UPS systems use energy storage technologies such as batteries or flywheels to provide power to loads in the absence of applied power. Typically, static power electronics such as fast-switching high-current insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are used to convert power.

This study integrates exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and explores the determinants of spatial patterns of Airbnb supply in 2019 with spatial regression models. The results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis show that the spatial distribution of Airbnb supply in Los Angeles is positively clustered and shows a geographical logistical trend over time. The distribution of Airbnb supply has a clear center–periphery pattern. The high–high (HH) clusters are concentrated in the central areas of Los Angeles, while low–low (LL) clusters predominate in the peripheral areas. In addition, with spatial regression analysis, several determinants affecting the spatial distribution of Airbnb supply are identified such as resident population, housing units, income, rent, point of interest (POI), and the distance to Hollywood.

Reliability and design cost are two contradicting objectives that are optimized. The evolutionary technique multi-objective (MO) Jaya, hereafter referred as MO-JAYANET, is developed for the optimal design of WDN. EPANET is used as a hydraulic network solver in this study. The concept of constraint violation, dominance, non-dominance and crowding distance is used to develop MO-JAYANET. As the Jaya algorithm is a parameter-less technique, and with the concept of constraint dominance involved in the MO model, the penalty parameter required to penalize the non-feasible solution is also dropped. This makes MO-JAYANET a completely parameter-less technique, requiring no tuning at all. MO-JAYANET is applied on two benchmark networks from the literature using three different reliability indices that are Resilience Index, Network Resilience Index, and Modified Resilience Index. MO-JAYANET is found to be very easy and efficient for WDN optimization. The present work obtains a smooth Pareto Front (PF) that overlaps the best-known PF. The maximum reliability diameters obtained by the MO-JAYANET for the three indices are also simulated for both hydraulic and mechanical failures under different scenarios to identify a better-performing index.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The management of the prefabricated building supply chain involves the entire process of prefabricated buildings. There are many uncertain factors, and the risk factors in any link will affect the overall operation of the supply chain. In order to achieve the “dual carbon” goal as soon as possible and promote the sustainable development of the building supply chain, it is very important to study the risk management of the assembly building supply chain. The risk management of the prefabricated building supply chain involves risk recognition, risk prediction, risk assessment, and risk response. In this study, on the basis of literature research, the WBS-RBS (Work Breakdown Structure–Risk Breakdown Structure) method comprehensively uses the working link and risk type of the prefabricated building supply chain to establish an indicator system for risk factors in the prefabricated building supply chain. Then, the risk prediction and evaluation model of the neural network of BP (Back Propagation) through Python software is established to predict the risk of prefabricated building supply chains. After verification, it was found that the accuracy of the training set and test set reached 100% and 96.6667%. The results showed that the BP neural network had good effects on the risk forecast of the prefabricated building supply chain, which provided certain risk predictions for the risk prediction of the prefabricated building supply chain. For reference, on the basis of risk prediction, in order to explore the importance of risk factors to the results of BP neural network prediction results, the characteristic importance algorithm of machine learning replacement features further analyzes the risk factors of the prefabricated building supply chain. Finally, based on the prefabricated construction project of enterprise A, risk prediction and evaluation of its supply chain management were carried out, countermeasures for targeted risks were proposed, and we provided new research on the sustainable development of the assembled building supply chain to provide new research ideas.</jats:p>"

Elections without competition are associated with the façade nature of elections in undemocratic systems. There are, however, exceptions to the belief that in a democratic system every election must be competitive. We can also observe them in Poland, particularly in small communes with up to 20,000 inhabitants. They take two forms: non-competitive elections of commune leaders and councillors. The latter case is known in the literature under the legal term of filling seats without voting. In 2018, as many as 8% of Polish councillors obtained their mandate without votes. In 2018 compared to 2014, the number of such cases increased by 77% and compared to 2010, the increase was nearly 300%. In extreme cases, local elections become a ritual with a known result, and the voter loses the ability to influence their representatives. At the same time, from 2002 to 2018, the number of candidates for municipal councils fell by 38%. Both phenomena may be a signal of problems that harm Polish local democracy. The article analyses them through the prism of the mechanisms for selecting candidates for councillors.</jats:p>"

According to the proposed technology, industrial wastewater after the existing grease trap and concentrator is pumped to reactive flotation using an alkaline reagent and coagulant - aluminum sulfate, with the production of coagulant flakes as a result of coagulation, removal of pollutants from water and separation of phases in the form of flotation sludge and sediment and purified water with quality indicators in accordance with regulatory requirements. The flotation sludge formed during wastewater treatment is diverted to a collector and taken away, and the sediments are recommended to be dewatered on a filter press and taken away. On the basis of the performed experimental studies, it was established that when aluminum sulfate is used as a coagulant at a dose of 250-300 mg/dm3 at a pH of 7-7.5, the effects of cleaning industrial wastewater of a meat processing plant are: water - 460-670 mg/dm3; suspended substances - 90-95%, the content of suspended substances in purified water - 10-23 mg/dm3; SPAR - 88%, SPAR content in purified water - 0.43-0.08 mg/dm3; phosphates - 62-65%, phosphate content in purified water - 3.6-5.4 mg/dm3; ammonium nitrogen - 40-42%, ammonium nitrogen content in purified water - 15.3-17.0 mg/dm3.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The opioid crisis in the United States has had devastating effects on communities across the country, leading many states to pass legislation that limits the prescription of opioid medications in an effort to reduce the number of overdose deaths. This study evaluates the impact of two categories of PDMP and Pill Mill regulations on the supply of opioid prescriptions at the level of dispensers and distributors (excluding manufacturers) using ARCOS data. The study uses a difference-in-difference method with a two-way fixed design to analyze the data. The study finds that both of the regulations are associated with reductions in the volume of opioid distribution. However, the study reveals that these regulations may have unintended consequences, such as shifting the distribution of controlled substances to neighboring states. For example, in Tennessee, the implementation of Operational PDMP regulations reduces in-state distribution of opioid drugs by 3.36% (95% CI, 2.37 to 4.3), while the out-of-state distribution to Georgia, which did not have effective PDMP regulations in place, increases by 16.93% (95% CI, 16.42 to 17.44). Our studies emphasize that policymakers should consider the potential for unintended distribution shifts of opioid drugs to neighboring states with laxer regulations as well as varying impacts on different dispenser types.</jats:p>"

More than half of this amount of gas is burned in the communal household sector, which includes the population. The largest number of devices intended for burning gas are installed in the population and are household gas stoves used for cooking. The total consumption of gas used by these devices makes up the main part of the gas used in the country in the summer period of the year. In connection with the significant increase in the price of energy carriers and the transition to paying for gas in units of energy, the issue of energy-efficient gas consumption is becoming more and more relevant. In this work, an analysis of the study of the use of gas at different pressures in domestic gas stoves is carried out. A comparison of the efficiency of gas use compared to the use of electrical energy is made. It has been determined that the optimal pressure in front of the gas stove burner, at which combustion has the most economical effect, is 2400 Pa. At this pressure, compared to electrical energy, efficiency increases by 20.8%. When the gas pressure deviates from 2400 Pa, there is a decrease in combustion efficiency, and at a pressure of 1800, the use of natural gas becomes economically impractical (compared to the use of electrical energy for cooking). Combustion of gas, ensuring the necessary completeness of combustion, has a positive effect on the environment as a result of reducing the content of carbon monoxide both in the indoor air of kitchens and in the environment of populated areas. Increasing the energy efficiency of burning natural gas will lead to a decrease in its consumed amount, and as a result, will positively affect the amount of payment for consumed gas, reduce the need for it and increase the level of energy independence of the state.</jats:p>"

The interviews were taken from the different organizations of Karachi. Secondary data is also used by collecting data from past articles, websites, journals and research papers.&#x0D;\nAfter content analysis of in-depth interviews, researcher came on conclusion that there is need to create awareness about the usage of recycled materials and triple bottom line among the corporate world. Also there is no proper guideline for the organizations to follow for the betterment of the environment. The concept of close-loop supply chain and triple bottom line of supply chain professionals of Karachi is vague.

It is this goal that causes a constant increase in the requirements for resistance to heat transfer of the external enclosing structures of buildings in climatic conditions, where the design temperature of the outside air is at the level of -20ºС. Increasing the resistance of non-transparent enclosing structures is achieved by available means that allow guaranteed achievement of the designated resistance to heat transfer. Increasing the heat transfer resistance of transparent (or translucent) enclosing structures has limitations that limit the maximum values. The analysis of window designs that are offered on the construction market of Ukraine in the context of the requirements of DBN V.2.6.31-2021 \"Thermal insulation and energy efficiency of buildings\" was carried out. To increase the resistance to heat transfer of windows, the manufacturer has (today) three constructive means - an increase in the number of chambers, the use of selective coatings and filling the chambers with an inert gas argon. It should also be taken into account that the production of windows is a multicriteria task, in which the achievement of a certain level of resistance to heat transfer is one of the factors among others, no less important. The results of the analysis show that the fulfillment of the requirement Rqmin≥0.9 m2•ºС/W for the first temperature zone of Ukraine requires the use of all technical means available from manufacturers. A sample of eighty-two window designs that are actually offered on the Ukrainian construction market was analyzed. Compliance with the requirements for the second temperature zone was achieved for forty-three percent of window designs. Compliance with the requirements for the first temperature zone was achieved for seventeen percent of window designs. The complexity and increased cost of such structures may necessitate additional control measures at the completion of construction and during the operation of buildings.</jats:p>"

The herbicide imazamox, combined with imazamox-resistant (IMI-R) sunflower hybrids, is a technology known as the Clearfield production system and successfully controls weeds. The mechanism of action of the herbicide imazamox is related to blocking the AHAS enzyme, which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). In the present study, we investigated the effect of the supplementary addition of BCAA to imazamox-treated IMI-R sunflower plants and antioxidative metabolism. Our results showed that the additional application of BCAA has a beneficial effect on both the total protein content and the activity of the antioxidant defense system of plants. This amelioration is probably a secondary effect of the enhanced protein metabolism and the supposed direct involvement of the three amino acids in the overall protein turnover.</jats:p>",

Despite the fact that the country's needs are almost completely covered by potatoes produced on the territory of our state, in recent years more and more attention has been paid to increasing the yield of the crop. Pre-sowing treatment helps to increase the yield of crops. The main method of pre-sowing preparation of potatoes is to treat the planting material with drugs to protect against pests and diseases.\nThe main method of pre-sowing seed preparation is poisoning with chemical preparations against pests and diseases. It is widely used in intensive agricultural technology and allows to reduce potential crop losses by 50-55%. The applied technical means, which ensure uniform and complete coverage of the surface of the seed material, have distributors that create drops of different diameters. In the best case, it is possible to control the average particle size, and large weight fractions of different particle sizes reduce the processing efficiency and negatively affect the uniformity of the coating. In this regard, one of the main tasks of the used technical means is to obtain drops of the same (monodisperse) size. Moreover, their size should be within 20 - 50 μm.. It is quite time-consuming to select the correct parameters of a technical device to achieve these aerosol sizes experimentally, therefore it is necessary to develop mathematical models of seed processing with different types of sprayers, which will tell in which direction scientific developments should be conducted .\\\nFor the model of the technological process of processing, the design and technological parameters and operating modes of the spraying system can be used as initial conditions, and the parameters of the distribution system of aerosol droplets, seed material and drug as boundary conditions (the speed of the air flow created by the fan, the amount of working fluid that provided, design parameters of the processing chamber).</jats:p>",

A systematic approach is therefeore required to manage the risks. Of many methods, supply chain risk management (SCRM), as a part of supply chain management (SCM), is offered in this paper to address this challenge. The SCRM increases supply chain resilience agains many uncertainties. An important key of SCRM is risk assessment as risk-impact ordering method which can deliver solution with the lowest risks. Of many methods applied for risk assessment, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) provides several advantages, e.g. it can be used as multi-criteria decision making, it can be used with high flexibility and it can be used as subjective assessment.

The proposed system produced a magnetic induction (magnetic field) <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>0</jats:sub>\n                  <jats:italic>H</jats:italic> of 15.6 T with the 33.6 mF capacitor and an excitation voltage of 600 V. Further, we designed a new power supply system and a pulse magnet using the commercially available pulse magnet and power supply. We found that the duration time of the magnetic fields (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>d</jats:sub>) and the generated magnetic fields were three and four times larger than those for a conventional system, respectively. We also performed magnetization of a NEOMAX permanent magnet; the coercivity (<jats:italic>Β</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>CJ</jats:sub>) was 2.0 T, and the magnetization saturated at ∼4.0 T. These results suggest that we can magnetise a permanent magnet such as NEOMAX with strong magnetic fields using this system. Further, the magnetic measurements of these magnets can be performed as well. The merit of our system is that the capacitance of the capacitor bank is larger than that of other studies or general commercial power supplies. Therefore, relatively high magnetic fields with long duration time can be generated. We also performed experiments on the magnetization process (<jats:italic>M-H</jats:italic>) of Gd to investigate the magnetocaloric effect in high magnetic fields. The magnetic entropy change was comparable to the result of former investigation. We believe that our research can contribute to the development of permanent magnets and magnetic materials for scientific and industrial use because our system allows the generation of strong magnetic fields at room temperature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The conducted analysis of modern biotechnologies in the field of groundwater treatment showed that one of the development trends is the direction of biological iron removal, which has not only a long history and fundamentality of research into the physiology, ultrastructure and life mechanisms of ferrobacteria, but also a wide implementation of the method at water treatment plants in Europе, Australia, Canada, USA, Japan. The introduction of modern technological equipment at such stations calls for the need to forecast their work using methods of mathematical modeling of processes with their subsequent computer implementation. The work provides a brief analysis of existing mathematical models, most of which are based on the kinetics of enzymatic reactions and are presented as modifications of the Michaelis-Menten and Monod equations.&#x0D;\nDespite the large number of studies on this topic, until now there is no comprehensive model that would take into account all the processes that take place in the contact loading of bioreactors, in contrast to the physicochemical mechanisms in the filtering process, for which modern multicomponent mathematical models have been developed.&#x0D;\nThe aim of the work is to development of a mathematical model of the kinetics of the process of biological iron removal groundwater in bioreactors and verification of its computer implementation with the data of experimental studies. The mathematical model is represented by the Cauchy problem for a nonlinear system of differential equations in partial derivatives of the first order. The system of the Cauchy problem consists of five equations with five unknown functions, which describe the distribution the concentration of ferrum cations, bacteria and the matrix structures in two phases (movable and immobilized) both in space and time The inverse influence of the characteristics of the process, in particular, the concentration of matrix structures in the inter-pore space, as well as characteristics of the medium with the help of coefficients of mass exchange and porosity, were taken into account. The model makes it possible to predict changes in cleaning efficiency depending on the duration of the filter cycle, filtration speed, Fe2+ concentration, the content of iron bacteria and their matrix structures in the interpore space, and to determine the optimal time of operation of the bioreactor between washings&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The COVID‐19 pandemic has exposed many vulnerabilities of global supply chains, but it also unearthed unfair supply chain practices. Yet, some firms are developing new initiatives to address various supply chain fairness issues, potentially creating strategic values.

When economic sanctions were applied to Russia, the issues of food supply and import substitution become the most important task of the country’s economic development. The provision of federal funds to agricultural firms in the form of subsidies allows us to realize such goals as: partial compensation for crop insurance costs, for the purchase of compound animal feeding stuff materials, for the payment of interest on loans, as well as for reclamation and for the involvement of unused land in agricultural turnover. At the same time, the restrictive nature of subsidies provided contributes to their rational use. The use of state support for land reclamation organizations not only increases the financial and economic opportunities for their development, but also leads to the replacement of the own funds of organizations with state financial resources, which often results in an increase in the effectiveness of their work. In this regard, the implementation of legislation regulating the development of the reclamation industry of the agroindustrial complex of Russia in 2019–2022 by federal districts is assessed. The analysis made it possible to identify the leaders and outsiders among the subjects of the flows of government subsidies in the territory of the country, to identify the patterns and reasons for the subsidy development, to identify the most characteristic problems of the implementation of state financing in the reclamation industry in the territories. The article emphasizes that, despite the variety of subsidies to the reclamation industry of the country, they are not enough to increase dramatically the productivity of national agriculture.</jats:p>",

This study aims to identify risky activity factors, plan appropriate strategies to minimize risk factors that occur in the company and provide solutions that can improve supply chain performance. The method used in supply chain risk mitigation at PT.

From the results of risk identification at PT. VUB BM Pandaan was found that the highest risk occurred in the variable lack of K3 implementation in the production process with a risk rating value of 420 which has a very high risk factor because it can cause work accidents to employees. And the results of risk analysis with the criteria of raw material suppliers, production processes and distributors using the AHP method obtained 7 alternative supply chain risk mitigation strategies.

For such devices, it is highly important to ensure safe primary power supply connection, including protection against reverse polarity. The conventional solution to the reverse polarity problem, involving the use of Schottky diodes during system redundancy or increasing power by combining two or more power supplies in the OR-ing circuit due to a large voltage drop, results in significant power losses at high currents, heat dissipation problems, and an increase in the mass and size of the equipment.

The circuit simulation of ideal diodes based on p- and n-channel transistors with superior technical parameters allows the characteristics and voltage and power losses in the protected circuits to be specified along with a presentation of the proposed technical solution simplicity.

In addition, it is necessary to consider the delivery schedule and additional environmental load due to the need to maintain the storage temperature conditions. It has been proven that the main factors of sustainability related to local products are determined by the desire of consumers to support the local producer, the sale of higher-quality products of local production, and the efficiency of logistics management and sale of goods. Methods to analyze the sustainability of food product transportation are considered. It is emphasized that very few studies have been conducted on analyzing the logistics of the delivery of dairy raw materials and products in countries with a weak economy, especially for enterprises of local importance whose vehicle fleet is represented by outdated equipment. That is why the study of the sustainability of logistics delivery chains was conducted based on the data of two dairy enterprises. The work presents in mathematical terms an integrated model for calculating the sustainability of logistics chains, which consists of four groups of criteria: resources, climate, economic efficiency, and impact on society. The company was evaluated according to the specified criteria by a group of independent experts in dairy technology using the Delphi method to ensure the objectivity of the obtained data. The calculation of fuel costs and CO2 emissions into the atmosphere per kilogram of food products in the transportation logistics chain was carried out. This approach will ensure the objectivity of assessing the negative impact on the environment because of the use of petroleum products, the increase of greenhouse gases, and air pollution in general. The concepts of \"local food\" and \"food miles\" are tools of the protectionist policy of restoring local agriculture and alternative sources of food production. The results obtained in the work confirm the need to use individual criteria in LCA for an objective assessment of the sustainability of logistics transportation and its impact on the environment.\nKeywords: \"food mile\", food products, environment, sustainability indicators, temperature regimes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable development and environmental pollution have become valuable stimulating factors for the resource recovery of end-of-life products through reverse logistics. E-waste is considered in reverse logistics. Electronic waste is solely responsible for environmental hazards and contains valuable raw materials that can be recycled/repaired, so reverse logistics is essential to minimizing their inappropriate disposal. This paper presents the mathematical model for multi-electronic products, considering multi-manufacturers and multi-retailers. After the end-of-life product, the reverse logistics network collects the e-waste in return processors where testing, sorting, and disassembling are carried out and then sent to the repair and recycling units. Components that are not repaired/recycled are shipped to the secondary manufacturer as raw materials. An electronic product’s reverse supply chain is employed to incorporate the idea of e-waste nullification. The fixed point iteration technique is used to solve the proposed model. A numerical example is analyzed to demonstrate the model’s efficacy where the total cost is minimized. The model’s validity and usefulness in reducing e-waste are validated through managerial insights into the model and sensitivity analysis of the key factors. The proposed policy suggests that the e-waste nullification strategy might be a useful apparatus for managers in ensuring long-term sustainability.</jats:p>"

The connection of Kondratiev cycles with technological systems was studied and it was shown that the current state of the economy in the world corresponds to the fifth system predicted by the scientists with its features and corresponding characteristic conditions.\n\nIt is proved that the development of the economy at its current stage corresponds to the predicted trends, that is, the development of the world economy and some countries (such as, for example, Ukraine) has reached a level where globalization processes, including global warming, an ecological component, the level of socio-economic development of mankind, cannot develop as separate entities, but is an integral system of the development, where integral connections can be managed only as part of it. The system, in turn, is managed largely thanks to information communications, information technologies, etc.\n\nIt was determined that the production, distribution, movement and consumption of goods (including such a specific product as information), works, services is no longer possible by conventional means; the previously established logistical routes cannot keep up with changes in the modern dimension (especially in the period from December 2019, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and from February 24, 2022, with the beginning of the military aggression of the russian federation against Ukraine), therefore the use of tools, methods , the means offered by the digitalization of the modern economy are to a greater extent ways of solving issues that require immediate intervention.\n\nIt was noted that a number of problems arise when implementing digitalization in the modern economy, and even more so in the conditions of an aggravating economic crisis. These include: sharp deterioration of logistics service, disruption of established supply chains, lack of typical ready-made models for the use of information and communication technologies for companies, enterprises, and small businesses; lack of basic Internet coverage in some areas, insufficient number of computers in farms, ignorance of managers and insufficient number of specialists.\n\nAreas of comprehensive systemic overcoming of the mentioned problems have been identified, which will contribute to improving the situation in the modern economy. The key to solving these issues should be logistics, which combines all the elements of the economic system into supply chains, and only their management in the modern economic conditions of digitalization will allow the economy to get out of the global crisis and enter a new cycle of its development.</jats:p>",

This paper is a synthesis of the energy audit results performed for a district heating network that uses geothermal energy as its primary source of energy. The location of the heating system is inside a university campus. The first part explains the necessity of a comprehensive study on district heating networks and introduces the defining elements that characterize the analyzed equipment and installations. The complex energy balance methodology that has been developed and applied to this district heating system is presented in the second part of the paper. Next, the methodology for collecting the input data for the energy and mass balance is explained. In the final part, the numerical values of the performance indicators and the technical measures that must be applied to improve energy efficiency are shown, and conclusions are drawn.</jats:p>"

Ordering and replenishment decisions of each organization or stage contribute to supply chain performance. A simulation study and experimentation were conducted in this study to determine the impact of ordering decisions on supply chain performance. The ordering decisions at each stage are taken by intuition for experimentation and are taken by inventory policies for simulation. Under customer demand distribution information sharing, the performance of a supply chain is evaluated and compared between those two conditions. A supply chain role play game software package is used to evaluate supply chain performance by intuition, and simulation is used to evaluate different inventory policies. Fixed order policy, Order Up-to Level (OUL), Modified OUL (MOUL), (r, Q) and (r, S) inventory policies are considered in this study. The performance measures used are the total supply chain inventory per period, bullwhip effect and supply chain fill rate. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is used to identify the best method to take decisions in supply chain. Results show that supply chain performance is best under MOUL policy. Based on the results of this study, supply chain members are encouraged to identify the best inventory policy and use that rather than making decisions based on intuition.</jats:p>"

Para politikasının isabeti ve etkinliği parasal büyüklüklerdeki değişmeler ile mevcut ve gelecekteki harcama/gelir ve enflasyonun hareketlerinin doğru yorumlanmasına bağlıdır. Para politikalarının temel amacı enflasyonu kontrol etmek olan merkez bankası, para ve kredi arzının büyüme oranını etkileyerek, ekonomideki mal ve hizmetlere yapılan toplam harcamalara müdahale edebilmektedir. Bu çalışmada, Merkez Bankası açısından hem bir ara hedef hem de bir bilgi değişkeni olan para arzı toplamlarından reel M2 serisinin ex-post öngörüsü ve ayrıca Reel M2 ile Sanayi Üretimi arasındaki ilişki incelenmiştir. Bu çerçevede, zaman serisi analizi ile bazı öngörü modelleri oluşturularak söz konusu modellerden elde edilen sonuçlar tartışılmıştır. MA(1) ve ARMA(0,0) kullanarak RM2’nin öngörülmesi makul sonuçlar vermiştir. Ayrıca, çeşitli VAR modelleri kullanılarak sanayi üretimi (dlY) ve reel para arzı (dlrM2) birlikte belirlenmiştir. En iyi VAR modeli, içsel değişkenler olan dlY ve dlrM2’in gecikmeli değerlerini içermektedir. Granger Nedensellik Testi, RM2'nin Y'ye neden olmadığını ancak Y’nin RM2'ye neden olduğunu göstermektedir. Bu sonuç, Merkez Bankasının ekonomik aktivite seviyesine bakarak para arzının büyüklüğünü belirlediğini göstermektedir. Örneğin yaz aylarında ekonomi daha yoğun faaliyet içermektedir (turizm, ihracat, ithalat) ve Merkez Bankası ekonomik aktiviteye göre para arzını artırmaktadır.</jats:p>"

Closed or open irrigation networks are built on the fields. In a closed network, water under pressure is supplied through pipes and hydrants to irrigation machines or installations. The open network is laid in the form of temporary pipelines, channels or trays, from which water is supplied by pumps to sprinklers and watering machines. Near cities and large livestock complexes, fields are irrigated with wastewater, which is also used with fertilizers.\nWater is supplied to the soil by sprinkling, surface, and subsoil and drip irrigation. Water is broken into drops and distributed over the irrigated area in the form of rain. The size of the drops should not exceed 1...2 mm. Rain intensity should be no more than 0.1...0.2 mm/min for heavy soils, 0.2...0.3 mm/min for medium loams, 0.5...0.8 mm/min for light soils. Under such conditions, raindrops do not damage plants, compact the soil less and do not destroy soil clods, water has time to soak into the soil, and puddles do not form on the surface of the soil. It is important to evenly distribute water over the irrigated field and ensure the specified irrigation rate. Fertilizers are applied at the same time as watering.\nWater is also supplied in furrows, in strips or by flooding the entire irrigated area. When irrigating the subsoil, water is fed into the soil through pipes with holes, through mole holes located at a depth of 40...50 cm. Through soil capillaries, water rises into the upper layers of the soil. This method is not recommended for use on sandy and loamy soils.\nProposed design of a wind-driven power generation and water supply installation.</jats:p>",

They are the two basic paradigms of the businesses that help them to build strategies and to gain a competitive advantage. This study aimed to explore the emerging research topics and the main research trends within agile and lean supply chain (SC) paradigms in recent years and to explore the interrelationships between them. A word co-occurrence analysis technique was adopted in this study. A data set of 526 publications, obtained from the Web of Science database, had been analyzed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the construction industry, the reverse logistics supply chain (RLSC) is one of the measures used to effectively manage demolition waste. However, there are still many problems associated with its operation, including inaccurate calculation of demolition waste supplies and insufficient interaction between supply and demand information, and waste suppliers usually choose transportation alternatives associated with high carbon emissions to obtain economic benefits. These issues have hindered the sustainable development of the RLSC. This paper proposes a waste recycling facility selection system (WRFSS) that integrates building information modeling (BIM), web map service (WMS), and an application programming interface (API) plug-in. Compared to the actual transportation scenario, the transportation distance of the WRFSS was reduced by 30.6 km and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 0.0259 tons. This selection system realizes an optimal selection mechanism for waste recycling facilities and develops the shortest transportation plan, thereby reducing carbon emissions during transportation and achieving sustainable development.</jats:p>"

To reduce this risk, timely detection of arterial hypertension, control of blood pressure levels and effective drug therapy for high blood pressure are necessary. Relevance. Study of population consumption of drugs used for hypertension in the retail sector of the pharmaceutical market in the Russian Federation for the period from 2017 to 2021. Methods. We used the methods of retrospective, predictive, structural, logical, comparative, graphic, marketing, pharmacoepi- demiological analyzes when conducting this study. The results were processed using the normalization method and methods of mathematical statistics. Results. The analysis of the structure and study of the characteristics of the population consumption of drugs used for arterial hy- pertension in the territory of the Russian Federation for the period 2017-2021 was carried out. The main share of sales falls on monopreparations: 92.04% - in physical terms, 74.55% - in monetary terms. In the rare pharmacy sales of antihypertensive drugs in the Russian Federation, the share of fixed combinations is 7.96% in physical terms and 25.64% in monetary terms. The most popular antihypertensive drugs in both in-kind and monetary terms over the estimated period are ACE inhibitors and β-blockers. In the subgroup of fixed combinations, “angiotensin II receptor blocker + diuretic” and “ACE inhibitor + diuretic” are in the lead. In the total consumption of antihypertensive drugs, the share of multicomponent fixed combinations accounts for only 0.44% in physical terms, but in monetary terms this figure is 2.51%. According to the results of the survey, doctors were more likely to be conservative in prescribing antihypertensive drug therapy, preferring single drugs, and medical specialists receive information about new drugs mainly at conferences, when meeting with medical representatives, and also from the Internet. Conclusion. Based on the results of the study, an educational program for medical and pharmaceutical specialists “Modern range of drugs prescribed for the prevention and treatment of hypertension” was developed.</jats:p>",

Project management professionals globally have attributed multiple requests for cost, scope, or schedule changes to classical project management issues, including cost overruns, schedule overruns, and scope creeps when managing traditional-driven projects. In post-conflict countries, including Liberia, multiple change requests or variation orders are prevalent in various types of projects often driven by political interests, corruption, and other fraudulent practices. In this paper, the author examined some critical change management and control issues, especially regarding little or non-existent institutional framework for change control as well as the lack of a structural and systematic approach for managing and controlling changes during project implementation. To mitigate these situations, the author proffered recommendations aimed at helping project organizations minimize budget and schedule overruns due to scope creep as well as project delays resulting from unregulated change management and control practices in Liberia.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, many of these artisans do not know where to go and lodge their complaints when they are served expensive electricity bills. Therefore, this paper is aimed at evaluating the legal framework for electricity supply dispute resolution in Nigeria. It also examines the effectiveness of this legal framework. This paper employs a quantitative research approach by using a survey design for data collection and descriptive statistics for data analysis of the 15 stakeholders who were surveyed. The review showed that a dispute resolution outlet is provided for customers who may wish to express their complaints about easy access and quick settlements. The finding also revealed that the industry has moved to other more result-oriented dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, arbitration, and conciliation, among others. There is a regulatory commission charged with the dispensation of justice on dispute resolution. However, what is left is public enlightenment to enable people to explore these available dispute resolution outlets in order to minimize the settlement period.</jats:p>",

This period corresponds to the labor market entry of a radically increasing number of college-educated labor stimulated by China’s higher education expansion program initiated in 1999. This study examines how cohort-specific relative supply of college-educated labor affects the cohort-specific college wage premiums and the overall BA–HS wage gaps in the labor market. Incorporating an aggregate labor supply model with imperfect substitution across labor with the same education level but in different age groups, changes in age-group-specific BA–HS wage gaps over time are decomposed into changes in aggregate and age-group-specific relative labor supply and demand factors. Findings suggest that the substantially expanded opportunities to attend college contribute to the falling BA–HS income inequality among young post-expansion cohorts: a 1-percent increase in the relative supply of BA-educated workers within one’s own cohorts depresses cohort-specific BA–HS wage gap by 0.2%. Policies that substantially boost educational attainment for certain cohorts could reduce education-related wage gaps for these cohorts and have spillover effects to the wage structure in the labor market.</jats:p>"

Using survey data collected from 318 firms in China, we empirically test our arguments and hypotheses through the structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that the relative advantages of enterprise artificial intelligence technology, supply chain collaboration, and environmental uncertainty are the three major factors affecting the adoption of artificial intelligence technology, which subsequently provide a positive impact on supply chain resilience and supply chain performance.

This analysis seeks to help inform the OMFV program's decision on round size by evaluating the supply chain aspects of each round. From stakeholder analysis, the primary supply chain concern is related to the casing material, with the 30 mm round using aluminum and the 50 mm round using steel. The manufacturing process for each round type was modeled in ProModel, including the supply chain issues related to steel and aluminum. The results indicated that both types of rounds are bottlenecked by steel limitations, since both rounds use steel projectiles.

It was noted that the most promising for thickening dairy products are film-type vacuum-evaporation units with mechanical compression of secondary steam. The heating chamber of the evaporator is made in the form of a vertical shell-and-tube heat exchanger with the supply of heating steam into the intertube space and with the downward movement of product solutions in the vertical boiling tubes. Based on the analysis of known studies on hydrodynamics and heat exchange of film processes (condensation, film heating and evaporation and steam separation), a conclusion was made about the lack of data for calculating pressure losses in the steam circuit of the evaporator with sufficient accuracy. To solve this problem, improved methods of calculating the hydraulic resistance of the intertube steam path of the heating chamber and the two-phase flow of the product film and secondary steam in evaporative boiling tubes have been developed using the published results of hydrodynamic resistance research. Pressure losses for the movement of secondary steam in the lower chamber of the evaporator include losses for acceleration of the steam released from the falling film of the product. It is shown that the hydraulic depression of the movement of steam in the intertube space of the heating chamber, depending on the type of scheme, can be from 2.3% to 77% compared to the working temperature pressure of the heating surfaces. The four-way flow scheme of the heating steam used in the design of the vacuum-evaporation unit ensures a reduction of hydraulic losses by up to 15%. A technical and economic analysis of the costs of operating a vacuum-evaporation unit with a productivity of 10 t/h of vaporized steam was performed, according to which the lowest reduced costs were established at a temperature drop of 5˚C on the compressor. The results of the research were used in the development of structures and the manufacture of vacuum-evaporation units with mechanical and mixed (mechanical and thermal) compression at PrJSC \"Kalyniv Machine-Building Plant\" (Kalynivka, Vinnytsia Region). 10 vacuum evaporation units with a capacity of 5 to 20 t/h of evaporated moisture were manufactured and put into operation.</jats:p>"

A self-start circuit is added to make the circuit start up quickly out of the simple bias point. The simulation results show that the bandgap reference voltage source has a constant 1.25V reference voltage with a temperature coefficient of 8.55ppm/°C in the temperature range of -40 to 125°C.

To test the model data were collected from pharmaceutical companies of Pakistan. A total of 150 responses were received. Smart PLS 3.4 is used to perform structural equation modeling and results proved the impact of reverse logistics innovation directly and as a mediating variable between resource commitment and supply chain performance. Study limitations and future research directions are given at the end.</jats:p>"

The results of studies on nitrate ion contamination of sources of drinking water supply in 5 regions of Ukraine are presented. Physico-chemical analysis was carried out for water sources from wells in rural areas, city limits and in the territories adjacent to cities. The relevance of the problem of water pollution with nitrate ions, which requires the search, implementation and improvement of water purification methods from nitrates, has been proven. A comparative analysis of the advantages, disadvantages and features of the use of various methods of removing nitrate ions from drinking water, including water from non-centralized sources of water supply, was carried out. Biological, ion-exchange, adsorption, electrochemical methods, as well as baromembrane methods, in particular the reverse osmosis method, are used to purify water from nitrate ions. The regularities of the reverse osmosis process during the removal of nitrate ions from model solutions and water from wells were studied. Reverse osmosis membranes manufactured in the USA by Filmtec type TW30-1812-50 were used for experimental studies. Model solutions of Mg(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2 and, directly, water from non-centralized sources of water supply were used as the tested water. Membrane selectivity and permeate selection coefficient were determined according to the known method. Parametric curves of the dependence of the selectivity of the membrane in relation to NO3- on the increase of the working pressure from 0.5 MPa to 1.9 MPa for model solutions of different concentrations were constructed. The dependences of the change in the concentration of nitrate ions in well water and the selectivity (φ, %) of the membrane in relation to NO3- on the working pressure were obtained. On the basis of the research results, a conclusion was made about the high efficiency of water purification from nitrates by low-pressure reverse osmosis (in the range from 0.5 MPa to 1.9 MPa) and the parameters of the researched process were determined, which would allow reaching the MPC standards for nitrates in drinking water.</jats:p>"

The hydrological model SWAT was used to simulate future streamflow simulations under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the medium term (2025–2055) and long term (2056–2086). The land use land cover change was projected using land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet software for the future period. Climate model simulations were taken to predict future streamflow at the regional scale, and an attempt was made to reduce the uncertainty associated with future predictions. According to the findings, streamflow was influenced by climate change (68.07%) and land use change (31.92%), with climate change having a higher contribution rate. The findings suggest that the combined impact of climate and land use change would increase streamflow in the future. The annual average streamflow is expected to decline (5.9%) in the medium term (2025–2055) under RCP 4.5 scenario and rise by 5.3% under RCP 8.5 scenario with reference to the observed streamflow for the period 1987–2017. However, in the long term, it is expected to rise by 10.56% under RCP 4.5 and 22.61% under RCP 8.5.</jats:p>",

The method is based on the approximation of a partial frequency response for the phase-frequency characteristic of the gas generator of the water saving system in terms of frequency. This approximation is used to construct a mathematical dependence, which is used in determining the time parameter of the gas generator. In the quality of the cob data, when the hourly parameter of the gas generator is determined, the phase-frequency characteristic of the gas generator and the allowable values of the parameters of the characteristics and the parameters of the hourly parameter of the gas generator and the approximation of the first dynamic characteristic are recorded. To determine the frequency parameters, tolerance criteria for accuracy are used, with the help of such gains of analytical reliability of these frequency parameters in the form of variances. It is shown that the phase-frequency characteristic of the gas generator of the system for saving and supplying water is mainly carried out from the variation of the transitional function. For this purpose, an array of experimental data, obsessions, as a result of vimiryuvan in a discrete moment and time, is scored by the Kotelnikov-Nyquist-Shannon theorem. For the implementation of the method, a sequence of procedures was induced to ensure the determination of the hourly parameter of the gas generator. Verification of the method is marked by the way of the completion of the test task. It is shown that the change in the hourly parameter of the gas generator of the system for saving and supplying water does not exceed 1.0%.\nKeywords: water supply saving system, gas generator, clock parameter, phase-frequency characteristic.</jats:p>",

Nature of this study is quantitative and nature of data was cross-sectional. Primary data was collected through questionnaire. Population of this study comprised of organizations’ directors, managers. Snow ball sampling technique was used to select sample. Total 250 questionnaires were distributed and total 152 questionnaires were received which were then used in the analysis of data inSPSS. The response rate was 60.8%. Cronbach alpha and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to test reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Mediation analysis was run in process file using resample rate of 5000 bootstrapping at 95% confidence interval. Cronbach alpha and factors loadings met the threshold. Information leakage mediated between supply chain and operational performance. It was also evident from the indirect effects that information leak could have worse effects on supply chain and operational performance. It is concluded that leak of information whether intentional or accidental both have effect on operational performance. It is therefore mandatory for professionals to take great care while dealing with supply chain partners so that it may not affect their performance. Managers have to raise awareness to secure the information confidential and to maintain secrecy. Doors for further research are open for professionals, scholars and academicians. They may add other variables in this model and extend the body of knowledge of supply chain, operational performance and leak of information.</jats:p>"

By considering these government carbon policies and consumer preferences, this paper constructs a revenue-sharing contract and a two-part contract model for an embedded low-carbon service supply chain using the Stackelberg game to investigate the contractual coordination between the manufacturer and energy service company and their optimal decision making. The equilibrium decisions and the selection of contracts in the supply chain with different parameter levels were obtained. The model’s validity was verified through numerical simulation analysis, and the impacts of the main parameters on the equilibrium decisions and expected utility for the supply chain were analyzed. The results showed that both contracts would enable manufacturers and low-carbon service providers to achieve profit maximization goals when the parameters meet certain constraints. Changes in consumers’ low-carbon and low-price preferences can cause manufacturers to change their business strategies. In addition, the level of technology of ESCOs affects the selection of the type of contract between manufacturers and energy service companies.

As well as middle economic units that bear business risks, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are also affected. Nonetheless, SMEs can take advantage of the disruption in order to compete with large, industrial businesses rather than invest overseas. Amidst a very gloomy economic climate, digitalization is considered one of the best alternatives and suggestions to ensure that businesses can survive. Agricultural and livestock sectors, especially micro-farmers in suburban and rural areas, have been hardest hit. As well as the challenges they have long faced with digitalization, the number of products they require has decreased drastically as well. From this point of departure, this study is conducted to assess the readiness of micro-farm entrepreneurs (MLEs) towards digitalization embrace digitalization and examine the impact of digital adoption on their business operations. A random sampling method was employed on the MLE in various sub-towns in Selangor, namely Kuala Selangor, Sabak Bernam and Hulu Selangor, from 2020 to 2021. Using the method of analysis, instruments are verified and coefficients tested. The results showed that MLEs are using digital platforms to promote their products and connect with their business ecosystem. In spite of this, they face the challenge of ensuring further improvements to their infrastructure and the capabilities of digitalization in contributing to value without posing high risks or costs.

The partial least squares (PSL) structural equation modeling (SEM) method was applied in combination with SmartPLS v3.3.6. The package was employed to obtain information through a survey of SC Pakistani professionals using the snowball sampling technique. Traceability plays a crucial role in enhancing transparency and ultimately the performance of SC through BCT, SIoT, and AI. Therefore, the study recommends starting the digital transformation of the SC because this is a complex process that involves a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. The study findings show the importance of technologies of traceability and transparency as an analytical multidisciplinary approach to enhance the SC sector, although with certain limitations this can be taken into account by stakeholders. This study will be useful for decision makers investing in technologies of traceability and transparency in the SC. The study raises the awareness of traceability and transparency in the SC process, and also reveals research gaps and provides opportunities for further research. Despite the prevalence of studies in supply-chain traceability (SCT) and transparency, there is a dearth of empirical proof on how the digital transformation of the SC could lead to transparency and ultimately performance.</jats:p>"

The household survey questionnaire was used to collect primary data from 1040 households. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis was applied to understand the relationship between economic benefit and factors that can affect economic benefit in the household. The empirical result shows that income (1.103**), storage capacity (0.574***), water price (32708.9***), age of rainwater harvesting (100.083***), and total cost (1.627***) positively impact economic benefit while the number of children (35.531**) has a negative relationship. The finding confirms the validity of statistical hypotheses. In addition, heterogeneity analysis was employed to test the model's strength and robustness check to validate the structural function and efficiency of the regression model. The finding concludes with policy recommendations, especially for rain-intensive countries that focus on (i) formulating and implementing rainwater harvesting policy; (ii) integrating rainwater harvesting as a tool for poverty reduction and achieving sustainable development goals; (iii) minimizing mismanagement of (rain) water that causes floods; (iv) initiating programmes and taking the necessary steps for providing financial and non-financial incentives for rainwater harvesting in commercial, and non-commercial buildings.</jats:p>",

Mining enterprises must invest in green technology to reduce the environmental pollution caused by flying dust and soil erosion and are subject to increased scrutiny to be socially responsible when conducting their business. To address this issue, we consider a competitive mining supply chain system consisting of two excavators and two exclusive retailers. Among them, the excavators have a certain sense of corporate social responsibility (CSR), that is, in addition to pursuing economic profits, they also consciously pay attention to the interests of consumers. We establish three different game models that two excavators exhibit no CSR behaviour (NN), two excavators exhibit CSR behaviour (SS) and one excavator exhibits CSR behaviour (SN). We examine the optimal decision-making strategies and analyse the impact of social responsibility. Analytical results show that the optimal strategies of mining supply chain are different under different supply chain structures. The optimal decisions of the mining supply chain members are the same in each case under the <jats:italic>NN</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SS</jats:italic> models. In the <jats:italic>SN</jats:italic> model, the optimal decision strategy value of mining supply chain members is always greater than non-socially responsible supply chain members. In SS model, when the intensity of social responsibility competition is low, two excavators reduce the wholesale price, and retailers reduce the sales price; when the intensity of social responsibility competition is strong, two excavators will increase the wholesale price, and retailers will increase the sales price. These help to promote product sales and increase the profits of the supply chain system. In SN model, with the increase of social responsibility competition intensity, the wholesale price of two excavators and the sales price of retailers first increased and then decreased. Finally, numerical examples illustrated to justify the proposed model.</jats:p>"

Compared with other grain supply chains, rice supply chain has more complex structure and data. Using digital means to realize the dynamic supervision of rice supply chain is helpful to ensure the quality and safety of rice. This study aimed to build a dynamic supervision model suited to the circulation characteristics of the rice supply chain and implement contractualization, analysis, and verification. First, based on an analysis of key information in the supervision of the rice supply chain, we built a dynamic supervision model framework based on blockchain and smart contracts. Second, under the logical framework of a regulatory model, we custom designed three types of smart contracts: initialization smart contract, model-verification smart contract, and credit-evaluation smart contract. To implement the model, we combined an asymmetric encryption algorithm, virtual regret minimization algorithm, and multisource heterogeneous fusion algorithm. We then analyzed the feasibility of the algorithm and the model operation process. Finally, based on the dynamic supervision model and smart contract, a prototype system is designed for example verification. The results showed that the dynamic supervision model and prototype system could achieve the real-time management of the rice supply chain in terms of business information, hazard information, and personnel information. It could also achieve dynamic and credible supervision of the rice supply chain’s entire life cycle at the information level. This new research is to apply information technology to the digital management of grain supply chain. It can strengthen the digital supervision of the agricultural product industry.</jats:p>"

The solutions are based on the assumption that the member, which takes into account the effect of the flow variation along the pass, is neglected. The concept of a fictitious infinitely long collecting drainage pipeline or a pipeline with an infinitely large amount of the pipe walls permeation is used in the analysis. It is assumed that the actual flow at the end of this pipelines is replaced by a conditional flow, which is collected at the fictitious end section of the pipeline. The flow in the end section of the fictitious pipes is assumed to be zero. The introduced assumptions allow to use formulas for calculation of the mentioned pipelines with a certain approximation which are applied at calculation of pipelines operation without transit.

Current deep retrofits are carried out on a limited-scale production, which may result in climate targets not being met in time. To tackle the need for rapid renovations, prefabricated insulation elements with integrated intelligent technologies, manufactured in novel smart factories using mass customization, could offer a solution. This approach is also followed by the Interreg project INDU-ZERO. The project examines a far-reaching automated production and develops a blueprint for a smart construction factory in the NSR that can produce 15 000 renovation packages per year. This paper aims to quantify the acceleration potential of the supply chain by improving its production, logistics, and on-site mounting processes for Dutch single-family terraced houses. First, the design of the renovation packages and smart construction factories are introduced. Then, the procedure is elaborated on how the supply chain can be abbreviated. The results show that the renovation cycle time can be completed within two weeks through coordinated efforts between production, logistics, and mounting.\n\n\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Circular supply chains comprise the industrial production and supply chain systems used by companies to eliminate waste and recover value in products and materials. There are a variety of circular strategies including recycling in waste management, returns and repair in consumer-facing industries, and reusable packaging in supply chains. Successful implementation and management of these circular strategies requires the ability to measure and report on progress across different functions and processes. In this paper, we propose a new set of metrics to measure the performance of reusing items in a circular supply chain. We review the literature on metrics in circular supply chain management and reusable packaging in supply chains. We then classify the proposed metrics based on whether they measure the circularity of a circular supply chain initiative or impact of implementing the initiative. They also are segmented based on the level of detail they incorporate from the product level to the system level. We then demonstrate the use of the proposed metrics through a case study with an omnichannel retail company. We find that product-level metrics facilitate the comparison of different types of reusable and single-use packages with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. We also find that measuring system-level Total Logistics Costs helps identify potential challenges with the feasibility of a reusable packaging system including the implications of not recovering packages and amortizing initial costs across multiple use cycles. Our aim in this paper is to address the gap in circularity and impact metrics focused on reuse strategies in supply chains. This new set of metrics provides companies with a tool to measure and report on progress toward a circular economy. It also suggests future avenues for research to assess the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability.</jats:p>"

The aim is to understand the interdependencies between lead-time guarantee, price, and safety stocks. We modeled the problem as an unconstrained stochastic non-linear programming problem, maximizing the expected profit per-unit time and obtaining a closed-form solution. The price is a function of the lead-time guarantee. Based on the sensitivity analysis of problem parameters, we found that lead-time competitiveness is adversely affected by a low safety stock level, MTO production rate (i.e., low supply capability), and product price (i.e., high demand volume). A shorter lead-time requires higher safety stock through reduced product and inventory holding costs. A higher price for a shorter lead-time in a lead-time-sensitive market reduces the safety stock. In a price-sensitive market, lead-time is decreased instead of the price. Demand variation results in longer lead-time and higher safety stock (provided the holding cost is low). For a higher price premium, price increases and lead-time decrease (safety stock increases). The integrated operation-marketing model captures the complex trade-offs not seen in a hierarchical model to produce better solutions.</jats:p>"

The diagnostic criteria of oils allow identifying defects in the operation of technological equipment. The purpose of the work – to increase the reliability of the operation of oil-filled power equipment by improving the monitoring of the physical and chemical properties of power oil TP-30. The main attention is devoted to increasing the reliability of the operation of oil-filled power equipment by improving the monitoring of the physical and chemical properties of TP-30 power oil. Experimental studies were conducted by chromatography, and gas and liquid extraction using appropriate laboratory equipment. When exploring the content of chemical elements in the segments of the thrust bearing of the cooling tower pumping unit, which is based on Sn, an increase in the content of copper Cu and Sb was observed, which exceeded the standard by an average of 1.2 and 1.1 times, respectively. Most of the analysed physical indicators of oil quality (water content, kinematic viscosity, flash point, acid number) did not demonstrate deviations from the standard values. Only an increase in the mass fraction of mechanical impurities by 0.0026% relative to the standard was noted during the incoming inspection of TP-30 oil. The results of the operational control of the oil in terms of a set of physical indicators fully complied with the established technological standards. The highest content of soluble gases in the oil (0.56% by volume) was recorded for propylene (C3 H6 ). It is recommended to use the relative content of soluble gases in Tp-30 oil to C3 H6 when identifying degradation processes. The absence of residuals of circulating power oil TP-30 in the surface waters of the Styr River during the operational event was established. Generalisations have been generalised about the necessity of expanding the diagnostic criteria for the quality of TP-30 oil, in particular, expanding the list of its physical indicators. In practical terms, the results obtained can be useful for monitoring the quality of other brands of petroleum oils in the systems of turbine units of nuclear power plants, which is important in terms of the safe operation of heat exchange equipment</jats:p>",

Irrigation and power production for a typical small-size citrus farm located in southern Iran is simulated. The system consists of monocrystalline photovoltaic panels (CS3K-305MS, 305 W), absorbent glass material batteries (8A31DT-DEKA, 104 Wh), inverters (SMA Sunny Boy 2.0, 2000 W), and a pumping storage system. The key concepts of water shortage probability (WSP) and loss of power supply probability (LPSP) are used in conjunction with users’ tolerances and sizing of the system. A genuine MATLAB code was developed and validated before the simulations. A specific electricity consumption pattern for a rural home and a variable irrigation water profile were considered. The main objective of the study is to size a system that provides both electricity for domestic use of a home as well as the energy required for running the irrigation pumps with respect to investment cost, LCOE, WSP, and LPSP. The main findings of the research are that LPSP and WSP threshold tolerances can have a preponderant effect on the cost and sizing of the system. Interestingly, results reveal that there is a minimum variation of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) versus the number of PV panels. For the optimal configuration, the study indicates that shifting from an LPSP of 0% to 3% (or about ten days of potential yearly shortage) makes the LCOE drop by about 55%, while the WSP decreases by about 36%.</jats:p>"

We find that the supply function is flatter for the high cost producer and that the supply function for shale oil producers becomes more responsive to demand shocks when adjustment costs decline. On the empirical side, we apply an instrumental variable approach using estimates of demand‐driven oil price changes derived from a standard structural VAR of the oil market. A main finding is that global oil supply is rather vertical, with a short‐term elasticity around 0.05. A rolling sample reveals that the shale oil boom does not appear to have fundamentally changed the contours of global oil production, but there is evidence for the oil supply curve to become more vertical in Saudi Arabia and more price responsive in the United States.</jats:p>",

Reasonably handling the collaborative relationship between farmers and service providers is a key issue in platform scheduling. Based on the analysis of the operation characteristics of the agricultural service platform, this study redefines the core issue of handling the collaborative relationship—the coordination degree—from the special characteristics of agricultural services, then analyzes it in depth and proposes a portrayal method. On this basis, a multi-stage and multi-objective scheduling optimization model, which integrally reflects the service utility and service combination operation efficiency, is constructed, and an improved genetic algorithm is proposed for solving it. Then, this study designs a numerical experiment which describes the multi-stage decision making of farmers, and the simulation results show that the optimization model can provide a balanced multi-objective supplier scheduling solution for them. Further, the validity and feasibility of the model and algorithm are verified through comparative tests of optimization effects and sensitive analysis. This study contributes to research on sustainable agriculture by modeling collaboration between smallholder farmers and agricultural service providers, and provides an effective decision-making tool for agricultural service platforms.</jats:p>"

The meta‐frontier model and the two‐stage residual inclusion approach are utilized to examine the association between SSC participation, comparable TE, and TC. Accounting for selection bias, we show that SSC participation significantly decreased the comparable TE of cucumber production but accelerated TC. The disaggregated analysis reveals that the comparable TE for SSC participants was generally smaller than that for nonparticipants. Furthermore, comparable TE for nonparticipants consistently increased year‐over‐year, whereas, for SSC participants, it increased during some years and decreased during others. Last but not least, TC for both SSC participants and nonparticipants increased over time. [EconLit Citations: Q12, D24].</jats:p>",

In order to achieve China's targets of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, and to study the emission reduction path of the logistics industry under green supply chain management, this paper uses the scalable STIRPAT model and ridge regression to analyze the influencing factors of carbon emissions in the logistics industry; Taking the relevant data from 2000 to 2020 as an example, combined with the scenario analysis method, this paper conducts an empirical study on the development trend of carbon emissions in China's logistics industry in the future. The results show that: under the low-carbon and enhanced low-carbon scenarios, China's logistics industry can achieve the carbon peak target of 876.6 MtCO2 and 817.02 MtCO2 respectively. Carbon emissions can be reduced to 234.9 MtCO2 by 2060 in the Enhanced Low Carbon Scenario. There is still a certain distance between neutralization. In the meantime, according to the forecast results, this paper, from the perspective of green supply chain management, from the three directions of carbon trading, reverse logistics and emission reduction costs, gives suggestions on the emission reduction path of China's logistics industry under the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals: consider early Incorporate the logistics industry into the carbon trading market; increase support and accelerate the development of reverse logistics; increase scientific research investment in clean energy, and promote new energy vehicles. This paper innovatively stands in the perspective of supply chain management, and improves the analysis of influencing factors. For the single industry of logistics industry, the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals goal is put in a model, which can better reflect the complete trend and target Provide low-carbon directions and suggestions.

Installed magnetic sludge separators with magnetic inserts. The technology of water softening with anti-corrosion protection using Redox filters has been introduced. Gravimetric corrosion sensors of our own design have been developed and installed. The database of processing and statistical analysis Access \"Corrosion damage of pipelines of heat networks\" was created and put into operation. The experience of modernizing the water treatment system has shown that work in this direction increases the reliability of operation of district heating systems by reducing the consumption of energy carriers and material resources. In addition, the problem of improving the operational reliability of the heat exchange equipment of thermal stations needs to be solved. The projected start of the use of heat recovery devices on water heating boilers in operation, in condensation or partially condensation modes, will also bring with it a number of problems with the neutralization of condensate and its return to the heat supply system.

Finally, the proposed evaluation model is tested. The test results show that Suzhou University's greenness fuzzy evaluation score is 58.2 points, which is a medium level. The resource factor scored 61 points, the energy factor scored 52.9 points, the environmental factors scored 59.8 points, the economic factor scored 62.7 points, and the social factor scored 55.5 points. The company has obvious advantages in terms of resources and economy, but the level is not very high. The higher the cost synergy between enterprises and customers, the greater the environmental cost synergy. Therefore, manufacturing enterprises should strengthen communication and cooperation with customers. The higher the cost synergy control of manufacturing and waste recycling enterprises, the greater the synergy effect of environmental cost control. Therefore, increasing cooperation with waste recycling enterprises is conducive to developing environmental cost control and coordinated benefits. The proposed scheme provides some ideas for applying information ecology theory in the university supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As in many regions across the world, southeastern Kazakhstan is subjected to ongoing water-resource depletion. The livestock sector is already a major natural water resource consumer, with groundwater use becoming its water supply strategy. Remote pasture infrastructure development requires new water resources to allow pasture area circulation. The distant pastures in the middle reach of the Aksu River consist of three pastures, with a total area of 32,450 ha and a permissible number of 3245 livestock heads. The HYDRUS-1D water transport model and MODFLOW groundwater-flow model simulated complex water infrastructure prospect hydrogeological scenarios to allow the consumption of 302.4 m3 per day for livestock keeping on pasturelands. During pumping for livestock watering, projected production well drawdowns were quantitatively evaluated. The findings show that the projected pumping flow rate equals 288 m3/day during the water consumption season and 95 m3/day outside the water consumption season. While the production wells on pastures No. 2 and No. 3 can be considered reliable, on pasture No. 1, an additional production well is needed. To maintain the production wells’ drawdowns to less than 6 m, a projected pumping flow rate reduction to 216 m3/day and 70 m3/day, respectively, is required.</jats:p>"

However, there is an ongoing debate on whether workers’ remittances serve as a ‘political curse or cure.’ Additionally, remittances influence the domestic labour supply left behind by migrant workers. Our study aims to utilise the ARDL bounds test and Granger causality to examine the long-run and short-run relationship between remittances, institutional quality, and labour supply from 1990 to 2018 in India. The results from the ARDL bounds test indicate a cointegrating relationship when institutional quality is treated as the dependent variable. The Granger causality test further supports unidirectional causality from remittances and labour supply to institutional quality in India. In the short run, findings indicate bidirectional causality between remittances and labour supply. The study contributes to the literature by constructing a composite index for a more accurate measure of institutional quality. Furthermore, the study includes relevant break dates as dummy variables, as it allows for country-specific structural breaks to be considered. Contrary to prior studies, we find no evidence of a public moral hazard problem created by India’s remittances. We argue that inbound remittances improve the well-being of recipients and pressure policymakers for more political accountability and better governance.</jats:p>"

The research method used in this research was a qualitative case study with a semi-structured interview as the source of primary data, where the population of this research was stakeholders of the company, with the method of purposive sampling for attaining the information. The study was imperative to learn the effectiveness of the company’s CSR in supporting stakeholders of the upstream supply chain. The result showed that the company has effectively implemented CSR for local communities in the Muara Laboh mining area. Moreover, local communities have had a good relationship and felt helped since the company came to their villages.  However, there has been some expectation discrepancy between the company and local people. The distinction happened because the locals wanted material things such as donations and infrastructure. Nevertheless, they need more economic empowerment programs that can support sustainability or programs that can generate long-term benefits, not only material things that will run out if not used properly</jats:p>"

The study extends existing investigation by proposing BDACs enable firms to produce insight that may help strengthen the dynamic capabilities, which positively influence radical and incremental innovation capabilities. In order to test our proposed hypothesis, we used survey information from 185 chief officers and the managers operating in Italian firms. By way of partial least squares structural equation modeling, outcomes verify our assumptions about the indirect impact which BDACs have on development abilities. Particularly, we discover that dynamic abilities fully mediate the result on both radical and incremental innovation capabilities. Additionally, under conditions of higher environmentally friendly heterogeneity, the effect of BDAC's on powerful features, and in sequence, incremental innovation ability is improved, while under conditions of high environmentally friendly dynamism the impact of powerful abilities on incremental innovation abilities is amplified.</jats:p>"

A viable supply chain is often characterized by resiliency, sustainability, and agility in its network design. Resiliency is essential because disruption and demand fluctuations are forced upon SCs, and the effects of these for many managerial supply chains are unknown. In addition, applying novel technology in the supply chain, such as blockchain, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) as agility tools can assist and enable the transition to lean production.

Recent research has shown that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithms, in particularly data driven Bayesian Network (BN) models, are very suitable as a tool to predict future food safety risks and hence allowing food producers to take proper actions to avoid food safety problems to occur. Such models become even more powerful when data can be used from all actors in the supply chain (e.g., farmers, food producers, authorities) but data sharing is hampered by different interests, data security &amp; data privacy. Federated learning (FL) may circumvent these problems as demonstrated in various areas of the life sciences mainly using linear models. \nIn this research, a federated BN was developed for food fraud to demonstrate the potential of FL for the whole food safety domain. This concept consisted of three geographically different data stations hosting different sets of food fraud data which have been made FAIR (e.g., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable &amp; Reusable). It is demonstrated that a BN model can be trained on the data of different data stations while the data never leaves its data station abiding security and sensitivity requirements and that this BN model performs like the BN model trained on the complete data set pulled into one data station. We demonstrated for the first time the applicability of the federated BN in food safety and anticipate that such concept may support stakeholders in the food supply chain for better decision-making regarding food safety and food fraud control.</jats:p>"

During the two-month period, 418 samples were taken at 22 previously defined differentsampling spots. Free chlorine values were reduced from the initial 0,18 mg/L tothe final 0,08 mg/L at the outlet, while values at some remote sampling sitesreached only 0,01 mg/L of free chlorine. Microbiological analyses of samplesshowed that the drinking water met the limit values in the regulations, despitethe low values of free chlorine. Based on the results, a modified chlorination ofdrinking water was introduced in the tested supply area, and the introduction ofa similar regime in other supply areas is being actively considered. In this way,we reduce the consumption of disinfectants and ensure the supply of qualityand healthy drinking water to consumers.</jats:p>",

Scouring below spillways may endanger a dam's stability and even lead to dam destruction. As a result, it has undesirable environmental effects due to dam failure. Hence, reliable and accurate scour depth estimation below spillways is an exciting topic for researchers. For this purpose, the published and reliable prototype data related to scour depth below ski jump bucket spillways (Ds) was used to develop data-driven models. This study employed two widely used decision tree (DT) methods, including the M5 model tree (M5MT) and the classification and regression tree (CART), and also multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) for the estimation of (Ds). The proposed methods provided explicit and clear equations with straightforward applications for estimating scour depth. For the quantitative assessments of the developed formulas, three common statistical metrics, namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (CC), were used. Moreover, comparison results with previous approaches existing in the literature indicated the efficacy of the suggested methods. The obtained results revealed that the MARS technique was the best approach for the estimation of scour depth.</jats:p>",

Especially in the case of the agri-food supply chains, the need to ensure that they are capable of responding to such disruptions has started to lead to the implementation of new practices considering the creation of more resilient and adaptable agri-food supply chain systems. This transitioning can be complicated as the integration of new practices involves the overcoming of certain barriers that occur. The aim of this research is to identify and discuss the critical success factors for the creation of resilient agri-food supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organic food supply chains are faced with heavy pressure to increase their output to meet the global demand. This confronts various challenges including scandals, adulteration, contamination, and growing regulations. As an alternative to third-party certification, Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) are popular community-based quality assurance system that integrates the social verification context into the organic certification process. As PGS is a local community-driven system, it has inherent limitations in the scalability of reaching consensus as the size of participants increases. The organic food industry has the potential to grow globally therefore, an appropriate scalable consensus mechanism is needed to deal with community-level consensus as an alternative to the existing PGS system. Blockchain architecture with hybrid consensus mechanisms seems to be the potential solution to address the trust and scalability issues in the organic food supply chain. This paper proposes a socially inspired hybrid blockchain architecture for the organic food supply chain to address the scalability issues via hybridizing two consensuses’ mechanisms with the combined advantages of Proof of Authority (PoA) and Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). In the proposed architecture, much eminent aspect of community-level trust is integrated into the consensus process. Furthermore, this paper presents a concept-level validation as a qualitative analysis of the proposed architecture based on experts’ opinions. Concept-level validation of the proposed model acknowledged that, in the context of social verification, the credibility of the organic products would be enhanced, and hybridization of the consensuses would mitigate the scalability issues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade, solar energy showed rapid development. So, in 2021, production volumes increased by 19 percent, which is the highest rate among renewable energy sources, and in the last ten years, by 714. And this growth will continue. And according to forecasts, similar development will continue in the coming years, the projected growth of total capacity over the next five years is from 112 to 188 percent, and the growth of investments until 2050 will be 68 percent. This, as well as the introduction of green tariffs, which encourage the use of renewable energy sources by purchasing surplus energy obtained with their help, increases the number of installed solar power plants and power supply systems based on them. But the use of renewable energy sources obliges users to report on the projected level of production. Computer modeling is one of the methods of analyzing processes in electrical systems in real time and is less complicated than mathematical calculation methods.\nThe work presents a structural diagram of an autonomous power supply system based on solar panels, as well as a description of its main elements. The stability of the solar panel-boosting pulse-width converter system was investigated using the Nyquist criterion. A block diagram of the method of selecting the maximum power from the solar panel based on the current at the output of the solar panel, which is used in the simulation, was also given, a set of positions of the maximum power points depending on the insolation with a discreteness of 50 W/m^2 is shown, the function of the dependence of the current on insolation using the cubic interpolation method, compared the results obtained using this dependence with previous data, estimated the average absolute error of the method. A model of the stand-alone power system is assembled in MATLAB Simulink, which can be used for real-time forecasting. Simulations were carried out using data for a day from a real household and insolation data from the LARES laboratory in Zagreb with a discreteness of 1 min, oscillograms of the output power of the solar panel, power consumption, as well as an oscillogram of the change in the state of battery charge during the day with such data are given. The simulation results were analyzed and recommendations were given regarding the behavior of users of such an autonomous power supply system during certain periods of the day when the generation capacity exceeds consumption or vice versa, affecting the state of battery charge.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intisari— UKM Mina Indo Sejahtera merupakan UKM yang menjual produk frozen food yang praktis dan menyehatkan karena pengolahan produk dilakukan tanpa menggunakan penyedap rasa, tanpa pengawet, tanpa pewarna buatan, dan tanpa antibiotik. Guna menakar kinerja terhadap manajemen rantai pasok, salah satu strategi perusahaan yang diterapkan adalah dengan meningkatkan kinerja Supply Chain Management (SCM) supaya mampu bekerja lebih optimal, sehingga menciptakan kualitas produk yang baik dengan memanfaatkan model Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) yang dibantu dengan Metode Perbandingan Berpasangan guna menetapkan bobot di tiap metrik (Irfan, 2008). Dari hasil perhitungan tersebut dapat diketahui yang mana indikator kinerja perusahaan yang tergolong rendah, dengan cara ini dapat diberikan saran perbaikan, serta metrik apa saja yang mempengaruhi kinerja pekerja pada perusahaan. Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) merupakan model referensi pada operasi rantai pasok dengan 5 atribut yang digunakan yaitu plan, source, make, deliver, dan return (Pujawan, 2005). Sedangkan Metode Perbandingan Berpasangan berguna menentukan bobot pada tiap metrik, jadi dalam penelitian kali ini Metode Perbandingan Berpasangan yang telah diadaptasi dari (Saaty, 1993) akan dipakai. Indikator pengukuran kinerja rantai pasok dengan pendekatan SCOR terdiri dari 3 level, level 1 (Kriteria Proses) terdiri dari 5 proses, level 2 (Konfigurasi Proses) terdiri dari 9 proses, didalam terdapat proses Atribut Kinerja yang terdiri dari 30 atribut kerja dan level 3 (Matriks) terdiri dari 35 matriks. Nilai akhir kinerja rantai pasok adalah 68,01 (Average). Secara keseluruhan kinerja rantai pasok berjalan dengan baik sesuai rata-rata, namun perlu dilakukan pengembangan pada indikator-indikator yang perlu diperbaiki agar kinerja rantai pasok di UKM Mina Indo Sejahtera dapat meningkat lebih baik lagi ke kategori diatasnya. Prioritas terendah level 1 adalah Make (meningkatkan kualitas, membuat inovasi terbaru, memberi penghargaan pekerja), prioritas terendah level 2 adalah Agility pada Make (meningkatkan kemampuan merespon perubahan pasar), dan prioritas terendah level 3 adalah Waktu Siklus Pengiriman (penambahan armada pengiriman dengan sistem pengiriman sentralisasi).&#x0D;\nAbstract-- Mina Indo Sejahtera UKM is an UKM that sells frozen food products that are practical and healthy because the product is processed without using flavorings, without preservatives, without artificial coloring, and without antibiotics. In order to measure the performance of supply chain management, one of the company's strategies implemented is to improve the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM) so that they are able to work more optimally, thereby creating good product quality by utilizing the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model assisted by the Pairwise Comparison to assign weights to each metric (Irfan, 2008). From the results of these calculations, it can be seen which company performance indicators are classified as low, in this way suggestions for improvement can be given, as well as any metrics that affect the performance of workers in the company. Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) is a reference model for supply chain operations with 5 attributes used, namely plan, source, make, deliver, and return (Pujawan, 2005). While the Pairwise Comparison Method is useful for determining the weight of each metric, so in this study the Pairwise Comparison Method which has been adapted from (saaty, 1993) will be used. The supply chain performance measurement indicator with the SCOR approach consists of 3 levels, level 1 (Process Criteria) consists of 5 processes, level 2 (Process Configuration) consists of 9 processes, in which there is a Performance Attribute process consisting of 30 work attributes and level 3 ( matrix) consists of 35 matrices. The final value of supply chain performance is 68.01 (Average). Overall, the supply chain performance is running well according to the average, but it is necessary to develop indicators that need to be improved so that the supply chain performance at Mina Indo Sejahtera SMEs can improve even more to the above categories. The lowest priority level 1 is Make (improve quality, create the latest innovations, reward workers), the lowest priority level 2 is Agility on Make (increase the ability to respond to market changes), and the lowest priority level 3 is Delivery Cycle Time (addition of delivery fleet with the system) centralized delivery).</jats:p>"

By Swiss law, pharmacists are allowed to supply prescription-only drugs in exceptional situations without a physician’s prescription. Because eligibility for HC can change, women at risk for complications, such as serious side effects, need to be identified. We aimed to develop a protocol to assist pharmacists in clarifying and documenting eligibility for HC. (2) Methods: We conducted a survey using the Delphi method to identify relevant clarifications and develop a protocol for pharmacists. Proposed material was created based on the literature and existing toolkits/protocols aimed at verifying eligibility for HC. A multidisciplinary expert panel, consisting of gynecologists and pharmacists, reviewed the proposed material and provided anonymized feedback over two survey cycles. (3) Results: This Delphi survey revealed items essential to the clarification of eligibility for HC in pharmacies for women who are already using it. This resulted in a protocol that maps “best practices” regarding these ad interim supplies of HC given without a prescription in Switzerland.

In this experimental study, the effect of weir height as well as the height and arrangement of the baffles located on the outlet key slope on the amount of dissipated energy were examined in trapezoidal piano key weirs (TPKWs) and APKWs. Experiments were performed on models with two weir height to the width of a cycle ratios equal to 0.9 and 1.2, three baffle height to the width of a cycle ratios equal to 0.06, 0.12 and 0.18 and two A and B-arrangements. The results showed that with the increase in discharge, the amount of relative energy dissipation decreases. The amount of relative energy dissipation is higher in weirs with higher height and also in weirs with larger baffles.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>.Every company certainly has operating equipment that usually runs continuously and relies on electricity as an energy source whose distribution must be appropriate to be efficient in its use. Every company that has important activities that use electronic devices, of course, must have a power backup so that sudden power cuts do not occur, because if this happens frequently it will cause damage to electronic devices, one of which is using a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is an electronic device capable of providing temporary backup power when the main power supply is cut off. This UPS is also an electronic device that can protect all types of electronic equipment that is vulnerable to current or voltage instability. The purpose of this study is to understand and know the working principle and how to maintain the use of UPS. The method used is the method of observation in the company to obtain research data. At PT. ASDP Indonesia Ferry uses two types of UPS which have different capacities, namely 0.8KVA and 3KVA to supply power to each electronic device that is used regularly. Of the two types of UPS, it can be used to back up electrical power when the main power source is suddenly cut off.\n \n </jats:p>"

This article serves to provide an overview of the development of a burn-in test station for a Phase-II upgrade LVPS component known as a Brick. These Bricks are radiation hard transformer-coupled buck converters that function to step-down bulk 200 V DC power to the 10 V DC power required by the on-detector electronics. To ensure the high reliability of the Bricks, once installed within the TileCal, a burn-in test station has been designed and built. The Burn-in procedure subjects the Bricks to sub-optimal operating conditions that function to accelerate their aging as well as to stimulate failure mechanisms. This results in elements of the Brick that would fail prematurely within the TileCal failing within the burn-in station or to experience performance degradation that can be detected by followup testing effectively screening out the ’weak’ sub-population. The burn-in station is of a fully custom design in both its hardware and software. The development of the test station will be explored and the preliminary burn-in procedure to be employed will be presented. The commissioning of the burn-in station will be presented along with a summary and outlook of the project.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When multiple retailers hold inventory to satisfy random demand, retailer inventory-sharing strategies can potentially reduce the supply-demand mismatch and increase overall supply chain performance. In this paper, we experimentally investigate alternative inventory-sharing strategies in a two-tier supply chain with an upstream manufacturer and two downstream retailers. In one setting, retailers act as if they are centralized and use a single quantity to fulfill joint demand. In the other, retailers are decentralized and face separate demands, but they can transfer inventory after demands are realized. In this latter decentralized scenario, we also consider whether the manufacturer or retailers have decision authority over the inventory transfer price. One key result is that when the retailers are decentralized and the manufacturer sets the transfer price, both retailers and the manufacturer earn higher profits than in the centralized retailer strategy, which runs counter to theory. We also find that when retailers are decentralized and set their own transfer price, the most equitable distribution of profits is achieved. In an effort to account for these results, we find that a model of fairness captures decisions well. Overall, by investigating how different inventory-sharing strategies affect the distribution of profits in a two-tier supply chain, our results provide guidance to firms considering how, if at all, they should enter such arrangements.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Jay Swaminathan, operations management.</jats:p><jats:p>Funding: The authors acknowledge financial support from Cornell University and the University of Virginia.</jats:p><jats:p>Supplemental Material: The data files and electronic companion are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4323 .</jats:p>",

This transition will require overcoming numerous technical challenges related to increasing battery energy density, as well as logistic challenges related to the lithium supply chain, which is already stressed due to high demand for electric vehicles. We have estimated that lithium demand for electrified aviation may raise lithium demand in the range of 10–250%. The uncertainty in these estimates show the importance of quantifying the impacts of electrified aviation and designing batteries to mitigate additional demand. In addition, most reviews on electrified aviation do not include information on the localized social and environmental impacts caused by lithium demand, despite their importance to enabling technology necessary for emissions reductions. This review seeks to fill this gap by presenting an overview of environmental and social research in context with one another to encourage researchers in the field to consider these dynamics as part of electrified aircraft design. Given that the high energy density batteries necessary to enable large-scale electrification of aircraft are still under development, continued progress in this field should emphasize sustainable governance for lithium extraction and a circular battery economy to reduce social and environmental stressors.</jats:p>"

It occurs as a result of the impact on the metal of mechanical impurities contained in the working environment. Erosion often occurs together with corrosion. The type of destruction under the influence of mechanical impurities is determined by the fluid flow rate, and the intensity and rate of erosion depends on the concentration and composition of mechanical impurities. Solving the problem of effectively determining the degree of adverse environmental impact depending on various parameters requires the development of new approaches, such as modeling. Modeling of hydrodynamics to determine critical flow rates and calculation of expected zones and erosion rates is due to the importance of solving the problem of anti-erosion protection. In this paper, CFD modeling of hydrodynamics and erosive wear of the control valve of the suspension line of the catalytic cracking unit is performed in the ANSYS Fluent software package. The flow velocities are calculated, and the areas affected by critical velocities at which corrosion erosion occurs are also shown. The effect of density and content of mechanical impurities on the erosion rate is shown.</jats:p>",

This paper examines theoretically and empirically the current supply chain practices, integration with customers and suppliers and organizational performance in the dairy companies in North Macedonia. Cost savings, increased revenues and overall organizational performance was examined and various practices of local companies were evidenced. The study also highlights the evolution, determinants and practical implications of supply chain management efficiency in strategic and operational contexts and especially in regards to achieving competitive advantage. A self-administered survey was conducted and data were collected through a random sampling of local dairy companies in North Macedonia. The findings of this study show that the quality, speed, dependability, flexibility and cost associated with economic benefits in the dairy industry can be achieved through technological innovation, effective business processes and high level of information sharing and introducing the SCM practices into more cooperative organizational relationships. Currently, there is a strong need to find better practical solutions that will help decision makers in the dairy industry to plan their supply chain activities more efficiently and effectively by managing the posed challenges and barriers. This will serve as also to make better strategic decisions with end-to- end supply chain optimization mode.</jats:p>",

The research was based on the qualitative data collected on site. The hand-dug well sites were evaluated using 10 parameters, and the roof water harvesting schemes were analysed using 12 parameters. The main non-functional aspects of the scheme are lack of community ownership, drying up of water sources, lack of maintenance and rehabilitation, poor coordination of beneficiaries and school roofs blowing off. Most schemes still require minor to major maintenance and rehabilitation. According to the research, the solutions for water supply are identified in relation to the desired objective.</jats:p>"

Therefore, a growing number of research activities are investigating the integration potential of the ES concept into real-world policy- and decision-making processes. These research activities are often confronted with conceptual challenges and methodological obstacles when applying different ES mapping approaches. This study is reporting those challenges encountered during a research project in Germany. In this research project, two urban regions, Rostock and Munich, were selected as case-study areas. In both urban regions, dynamic urbanisation processes occur across the urban administrative boundaries and threaten the supply of multiple ES in the periurban landscapes. The research project invited local stakeholders from the two urban regions to workshops and online meetings to discuss ES-related topics. For those events, maps visualising the spatial patterns of multiple ES were needed for communication and awareness-raising of the ES concept. We chose commonly used and relatively easy-to-apply mapping methods such as: (1) expert-based ES matrix approach, (2) simple GIS mapping with proxy indicators and data, and (3) simple ES models such as InVEST. We encountered several challenges during the mapping processes: The expert-based matrix approach provided valuable results for ES supply, but had limitations in assessing expert estimates for ES demand. Alongside other factors, evolving barriers related to the conceptual complexity of ES demand. Data unavailability/inaccessibility resulted in difficulties mapping all selected ES with proxy indicators at the targeted regional scale. So far, only a few individual ES can be modelled with InVEST models. Despite these challenges, the resulting maps were helpful for communication with local stakeholders. The discussions with stakeholders provided valuable insights into the future needs for ES research and identified existing barriers and challenges. We want to summarise and share our experiences and provide recommendations for future research on mapping ES supply and demand in urban regions.</jats:p>"

Some observers consider this to be remarkable and a model of development in the non-socialist world. However, the brief growth experience of the 1960's, after the long stagnation during the 1950's, can hardly be a basis for definitive conclusions about long-run development. Observation of a longer period and evidence of certain basic conditions are necessary for such extrapolation. The dependence on foreign aid continues to be large and the domestic saving rate is relatively low. It is too early to talk of self-sustaining growth.</jats:p>"

Keeping the service level based on target was accompanied by a decrease in working capital as one of the goals of PT. XYZ was establishing a tower in its supply chain concept. This research was conducted at PT. XYZ owns the largest market share of heavy equipment in Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to analyze the increase in the supply chain control tower in reducing the inventory of heavy equipment spare parts at PT. XYZ. Method: This research uses mixed methods, a stage of research combining two types of research methodologies, namely qualitative and quantitative.  Result: The analysis results at SCOR level 1 show that all strategic metrics are below the set targets. So that at SCOR level 2, an in-depth analysis is carried out with Geographic maps and Thread diagrams that show potential problems in Enable Process (sE2), Plan Source (sP2) and Delivery (sD1) activities. Finally, the results of SCOR level 3 analysis using a fishbone diagram reveal that the root cause of the problem is a leak in internal company supply chain management. We recommend the enhancement of the supply chain control tower at PT XYZ. Conclusion: This Research primarily aims to evaluate the element supply chain control tower at PT XYZ as a stocked business product with SCOR Model 12.0. The result shows that the performance of the Supply Chain Control Tower in Tower Tanjung Area (TAD) does not achieve the target.</jats:p>"

It shows the importance as well as necessity of good water system, as a whole, to them, which could solve manifold problems. Pilot survey as well as final survey were conducted in the three districts of dryland area of West Bengal on 450 households and bids were set in such a manner which could be bearable for the people of these areas. Over 65% were willing to participate in the improvement of the water supply system in the area. Those who were “protest bidders”, showed socio-economic reasons for their decisions. We have followed the procedure suggested by NOAA (1993) panel for applying the CVM with full randomness being taken care of in the different stages of survey. What we have found is that apart from the amount of bid, several socio-economic variables play a part in people’s decision on selection of a bid.</jats:p>",

It is a type of design optimization issue that exists in logistics implementations such as supply chain planning in healthcare or agriculture. Along with concerns regarding PD delivery time manner for connecting logistics centers and customers, recent studies have considered the zero-one location design model. This research discussed a route selection model for the 2S-ZOPS that did not exist in the published studies by taking into account the level of risk associated with physical appearance. The mathematical models were developed in response to a PD supply chain design that occurred in Thailand’s National Health Insurance Program. By combining the virus optimization algorithm (VOA) with a large neighborhood search (LNS), we created a hybrid metaheuristic method for solving the 2S-ZOPS. Experiments with real-world data demonstrated that the hybrid algorithm was efficient in terms of time consumption and solution quality, saving approximately 6% on total costs. The presented practice benefits not only the healthcare industry but also various other businesses.</jats:p>"

The changes in production caused by the fourth industrial revolution have also resulted in fundamental changes in the supply chain and have converted it to supply chain 4.0. Organisations must be receptive to supply chain 4.0 to maintain their competitive advantage. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationships among supply chain 4.0 technologies so that, by learning and understanding these connections, industries can pave the way for the implementation of these technologies in their supply chains and use them in problem-solving. The literature review was used to identify the supply chain 4.0 technologies, and the Delphi technique was applied to extract them, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), augmented reality, virtual reality, and simulation. The relationships of supply chain 4.0 technologies were examined using the DEMATEL technique and based on interpretive structural modelling (ISM), their deployment map was drawn. The type of technologies was determined using the MICMAC method. The MICMAC analysis found that the artificial intelligence technology is independent and, based on the findings through the DEMATEL technique, this technology is related to simulation, which belongs to the first level of the interpretive structural modelling technique, and IoT, cloud computing, big data, and blockchain technologies, which are at the second level. Based on the ISM method, RFID, virtual reality, augmented reality and simulation technologies are located at the first level; IoT, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, big data and blockchain technologies are situated in the second level; and artificial intelligence technology belongs to the third level. According to the related literature, few studies have been conducted on the issues of supply chain 4.0 and the technologies that affect it.</jats:p>",

An approach that is based on a literature review is used to discover and summarize the various research that have been conducted on the subject. After that, this information is combined into the building of a conceptual model in order to highlight the primary elements that influence China's acceptance and execution of circular economy methods. Elements that are institutional, technological, economic, and social have been combined into the model that has been provided. Additionally, this research investigates the role that collaboration within environmental supply chains can play as a moderating factor in the relationship between the previously mentioned components and the Chinese circular economy. According to the findings, environmental supply chain cooperation plays a crucial role in supporting the adoption and implementation of circular economy practices in China by encouraging collaboration and coordination among a wide variety of stakeholders. This helps to ensure that circular economy practices are successfully adopted and implemented. In order to reach this goal, it is necessary to fortify the partnerships that exist within the environmental supply chain.

The primary data were collected from 50 farmers, 15 wholesaler,15 retailer,6 commission agent,6 trader,3 private companies of Vadodara city total sample size is 95 while the secondary data were collected from different Private and Government publications to include Review Paper, Literature, and Journals. The following districts in Vadodara City such as Padra, Karjan, Waghodia, Aklav, and Savli talukas were the selected venues of the study. The respondents of the study were randomly selected such as the farmer, wholesalers, retailers and private companies from the above area. The descriptive research design was used for the research. Non-probability sampling method and convenience sampling technique was used. In channel I, very small proportion of the agricultural commodities which moved directly from producers to consumers. Channel II is the most common supply chain for okra during the period of June and July. Both Channel III &amp; IV are working at rural level. Channel I has the best marketing efficiency out of these six marketing channels, but it is not realistic to sell all produce through this channel. However, channel V marketing efficiency is around 68% and is a practically feasible channel due to the lower number of intermediaries. Therefore, the lesser the number of intermediaries the higher will be the marketing efficiency. The most common problem encountered by farmers are lower price which can be solved by collectivism and contract farming.</jats:p>"

The growing interest in Agricultural Supply Chain Management (ASCM) can be attributed to two main factors: agricultural industrialization and the uncertainty brought on by differences in product quality and safety. The study objective was to identify different marketing channels of banana in Vadodara city, to estimate the price spread of banana and to identify problems faced by producers and intermediaries. Primary data were collected from 40 farmers, 15 wholesalers and 25 retailers to accomplish these objectives. Secondary data were collected from different private and government publications, review papers, literature, and journals. For the study descriptive type of research design was used. In the research sampling method was non-probability sampling method and sampling technique was convenience sampling technique were used. Channel-IV was the most effective way to reach consumers because it has the shortest route. Channel-I was less effective than the others because its marketing cost was the highest. The study reveals that the existing supply chain has a serious problem of lower prices faced by farmers. A significant problem for wholesalers is the lack of a ripening chamber. The major problem for retailers is that they suffer from higher post-harvest losses due to the lack of storage facilities, forcing them to sell products quickly to maximize profits and minimize losses. After doing certain changes like developing a ripening facility in marketing channel IV company may adopt this channel because its channel has the highest marketing efficiency and more share of producer in consumer rupee. To overcome these problems, there is a need to develop infrastructures, cold storage facilities, set up ripening chambers, processing facilities and use refrigerated vehicles for long-distance transportation, etc.</jats:p>"

The institutional environment and the economic basis form a complex institutional and economic mechanism for regulating the agro-food market, which includes the following mechanisms: the development of tools for regulating the supply and demand of agricultural products and food, interregional trade, regulation of the agrarian sphere, which allows for the formation of a strategic approach in the development of the agro-food market.\nThe institutional and economic mechanism of liberalization and regulation of trade in agricultural goods allows determining the ways and methods of achieving the goals of the state's agro-food policy, which do not contradict the requirements of the WTO multilateral trade system and take into account national economic interests.\nMethods. In the process of conducting the research, general scientific and special methods of economic research were used, in particular: systematic approach, comparative, dialectical and abstract-logical.\nThe results. Directions for improving the institutional structure of the agri-food market based on the development of legal regulation of the functioning of self-regulatory organizations are proposed, which will ensure the formation of optimal economic relations between subjects and the balancing of the interests of the state and agribusiness, as well as contribute to the effectiveness of its regulation tools.\nDiscussion. Taking into account the evidence of the leading countries of the world, the role of self-governing organizations in the development of the national strategy for the development of the agrarian sector of Ukraine and the formation of regional comprehensive programs for the development of rural areas needs further research. In addition, in the current difficult economic conditions caused by Russia's aggression against our state, the role of professional associations in overcoming crisis phenomena in the activities of farms in the corporate sector of the agrarian economy requires consideration.\nKeywords: institutional environment, self-governing organizations, agrarian chamber, agrarian sector, food security.</jats:p>",

FTIR spectra for sulfonated polymers illustrated the appearance of characteristic peaks at 100–1200 cm−1 indicating that the copolymers were successfully sulfonated. The influence of different experimental factors (i.e., contact time, pH, NH4+ concentration, adsorbent dose) on ammonium ion adsorption was investigated; three adsorption isotherm models including Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin were used to study the adsorption mechanism. The results indicated that the equilibrium of adsorption can be reached within 30 min; the highest adsorption capacity can be achieved around pH 7. Furthermore, Freundlich isotherm was the most suitable for fitting the experimental data which might expose the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface. The regeneration and reusability studies were also implemented, and results showed that P(AA25/PSS75) was stable and regenerable using (1 M) sulfuric acid as a desorbing agent over five cycles.</jats:p>",

A retrospective analysis of 44 medical records of patients aged 0 to 17 years, inclusive, with complaints characteristic of osteopenia, who were prescribed a 25(OH)D test. A content analysis of vitamin D preparations in the pharmaceutical market of the Russian Federation was carried out and the costs for 3 months of treatment were calculated. Results. 6 models of complex treatment of osteopenia in children and adolescents were formed, in relation to the diagnosis and the detected level of 25(OH)D. Each included vitamin D supplementation, a calcium-rich diet, and various physical therapy modalities. Treatment outcomes were monitored every 3 months based on X-ray data and blood 25(OH)D testing. It has been established that the cost of non-drug therapy is more than 80% of the total. The cost of paid treatment for various skel- etal deformities consists of the costs of medical services, non-drug and drug therapy and amounts to 25805.4 rubles. ± 488.1 rub. Conclusion. Real medical practice in the treatment of osteopenia in children and adolescents is based on current clinical algorithms and recommendations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reviews the institutional reforms in agricultural commodity markets in India and examines their implications for spatial efficiency in supply chains of the markets. In order to remove inefficiencies in the traditional supply chain, the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act was revised, and a Model APMC Act 2003 was introduced with the provisions for establishing private markets/yards, direct purchase centres, farmers markets for direct sale, contract farming and promotion of public–private partnership in the management and development of agricultural markets. Initiative has been taken to set up a National Agricultural Market as an all-India electronic trading portal to develop a ‘common national market’ for agricultural commodities. The institutional reforms in agricultural marketing system since the early 1990s appear to have contributed towards improving the spatial efficiency in rice and wheat markets. The finding of an increase in the extent of spatial integration of markets after the reforms and the tendency of the prices to move towards a common stochastic trend lend support to the idea of setting up a ‘common national market’ for agricultural commodities. Further reforms in the marketing system with better infrastructure facilities would strengthen market integration and improve efficiency in the supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL classification: O13, Q13, Q18. </jats:p>",

Enterprises and governments have taken various measures to enhance the resilience of the FSC and to achieve sustainable development. Product traceability systems are an important tool for improving the resilience of the FSC and for dealing with its risks. In this study, we developed a two-stage supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer to investigate how government subsidies, power structures, and consumer preferences affect the decisions involved with FSC traceability. Manufacturer–Stackelberg (MS) and retailer–Stackelberg (RS) power structures—with and without government subsidies—were constructed using game theory, and the equilibrium solutions of the four models were compared and analyzed. The research shows that (i) government subsidies have a positive effect on FSC traceability investments, benefiting both the manufacturer and the retailer; (ii) a retailer-dominated supply chain is more conducive to product traceability, which will benefit the retailer, and when the consumer traceability preference reaches a certain threshold, the manufacturer will also benefit; and (iii) government subsidies have a significant incentivizing effect on retailer-dominated supply chain traceability. Finally, we provide an example to analyze and compare the differences between decision-making processes and profits under various consumer preference scenarios. In conclusion, the government should provide subsidies, and the retailer needs to dominate the supply chain and improve consumer traceability preferences. The research in this paper provides insight into the implementation of traceability in the FSC for management.</jats:p>"

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengembangkan sistem pengelolaan sampah yang ramah lingkungan dan berkelanjutan dengan menggunakan teknologi pengolahan sampah berbasis maggot Black Soldier Fly (BSF). Penelitian ini menggunakan metode\r\n \r\n \r\npenelitian deskriptif kualitatif dengan mengumpulkan data dari sumber-sumber primer dan sekunder. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan maggot BSF dapat menjadi solusi alternatif dalam mengolah sampah organik dan menghasilkan produk yang bernilai tambah, seperti pupuk organik dan pakan ternak. Pengelolaan maggot BSF memerlukan pemilihan jenis dan kualitas maggot yang optimal, serta pengelolaan budidaya maggot BSF yang tepat. Selain itu, diperlukan juga sistem manajemen logistik dan distribusi produk akhir yang efektif dan efisien. Dampak sosial dan lingkungan dari green supply chain pengelolaan sampah berbasis maggot BSF juga perlu dievaluasi dan dikelola dengan baik. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan kebijakan dan regulasi yang mendukung pengembangan green supply chain pengelolaan sampah berbasis maggot BSF. Penelitian ini memberikan rekomendasi terkait strategi pengembangan green supply chain pengelolaan sampah berbasis maggot BSF yang dapat diterapkan di berbagai skala, mulai dari tingkat rumah tangga hingga tingkat industri besar. Dengan mengoptimalkan green supply chain pengelolaan sampah berbasis maggot BSF, diharapkan dapat dihasilkan solusi pengelolaan sampah yang ramah lingkungan, berkelanjutan, dan dapat memberikan manfaat ekonomi dan sosial bagi masyarakat.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet of things (IoT) technology is poised to change the flow of data handling for tangible and intangible assets in textile production and utilization industries. It is reinventing global textile manufacturing operations, product distribution, and how manufacturers exchange value. For example, IoT technology helps gather operational data, store it, process it, and improve business efficiency. However, IoT technology-based textile production and its supply chain's information systems are highly vulnerable to security, privacy, and trust-related issues. This chapter presents the basic design and operation constraints that intelligent textile industries expect to experience within modern wireless data communication networks (e.g., 4G, 5G) with IoT technology and how blockchain technology can mitigate these constraints (e.g., privacy and security). The advantages of blockchain-based computing are its ability to scale rapidly, store data remotely, and provide service in a dynamic environment. Finally, this chapter presents a hybrid (i.e., IoT, blockchain, service-oriented computing) data processing architecture for the textile industries.</jats:p>",

This study uses data from the Indonesian Plantation Business Household Survey and multinomial logistic analysis methods. The number of respondents analyzed was 21 361 coffee farmers scattered throughout Indonesia. Coffee farmers in Indonesia sell to collectors, markets, village unit cooperatives, and plantation companies. The percentage of farmers coffee sales is through collectors due to distance, cost, ease of cash, and ease of transaction. In contrast, farmers who deal with the company will tend to sell coffee to the company because of the partnership. improvement of quality consistency and production continuity is carried out such as with Geographical Indications (GI) of production center areas. This can be done by various supply chain actors such as the Community Concerned for Geographical Indications (MPIG) in conducting counseling and mentoring for farmers.

This idea was moulded along the folds of the rise of economic growth and industrialisation, as experienced by East Asian developmental states such as Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. There would be an attempt to channel the state’s administrative capacities, policies and resources towards attaining national development goals. A developmental state plays an active role in guiding economic development and using the country's resources to meet the needs of the people. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) were meant to be the catalyst in the National Development Plan’s (NDP) bid to reignite the country’s stagnant economy. However, the country's state institutions, administrative capacities and resources have been challenged by the state capture debacle that shed light on the corrupt relationship between the political and business elite. As a lack of effective leadership, mismanagement and a complex regulatory framework appear to be at the core of the crisis at Eskom in particular, the main objective of this paper was to determine to what extent the aforementioned constructs perpetuated the energy crisis at Eskom and in turn, negatively impacted the socio-economic aims of the NDP and South Africa’s endeavour to become a developmental state. To achieve this objective, the paper pursued a qualitative research approach where secondary information about the crisis at Eskom, and South Africa’s goal to become a developmental state, were perused. One of the article’s recommendations was that Eskom's grip on the regional power economy must end and that independent power plants must be enabled.</jats:p>"

A spur dike is a hydraulic structure placed at the channel bank projecting outward to guide or divert the flow away from the bank, thus protecting it from erosion. The stability of the riverbed and banks is influenced by turbulent characteristics such as three-dimensional velocity distribution, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds shear stress, turbulent intensity, and bed shear stress. The researchers found that these turbulence parameters are instrumental in sediment movement along the channel's bed and from its banks. Spurs dikes are a significant river training structure provided along the river bank to protect from erosion. Several aspects related to spur dikes, such as their geometry, physical features, design considerations, flow and scour patterns, etc., are critically reviewed in this paper. Despite the numbers of literature in the field of turbulent characteristics and scour depth around spur dike, the role of vegetation and the effect of seepage around spur dike still remains an unexplored area. These knowledge gaps of spur dikes in field conditions are discussed for future studies.</jats:p>",

In Belarus, the Soligorsk, Lyuban, Petrovich, Pogost and other multifunctional reservoirs are </jats:p><jats:p>used for irrigation.  The useful (regulating) volume of a multifunctional reservoir consists of separate components calculated for each consumer in the basis of a hydrological and feasibility study. Thus, the useful volume of water intended for irrigation should provide the required irrigation capacity and capacity of the irrigation system. When determining the useful (regulating) volume of a multifunctional reservoir, the total water requirements for various purposes (water supply, irrigation, hydropower, etc.) are calculated. For each consumer, the required design supply is assigned and the appropriate method for determining water consumption is used.  Reservoirs intended for water supply count on 95–97 % availability of runoff, and for irrigation purposes – on 75–80 % availability in zones of moderate and excessive moisture. In arid, desert and semi-desert regions of China, where lack of water in dry years can lead to large crop losses, irrigation reservoirs are expected to be 90–95 % secure. The volumes and costs of water in the reservoir for irrigation purposes must cover the needs of plants in water within the established time frame for the year of estimated availability. The paper provides a formula for determining the weighted average irrigation rate and the volume of water required for irrigation. A methodology is presented for calculating the useful volume of a reservoir intended for industrial water supply and irrigation, for which flow regulation is calculated for two supply of water consumption. A method is proposed for determining the flow rate of entrained sediments for various stages of their movement.

Measurement data were compared with earlier periods and the standard period of 1961-1990. The statistical characteristics of the series of changes in solar radiation have been determined. Comparison of the characteristics of solar radiation with the normative data of SSU NBV .1.1-27-2010 was made. It has been shown that in recent years the annual amounts of direct radiation have increased by 18-23%. The total annual radiation in 2020 increased by 6% according to the period 1961-1990. The analysis of the calculated results of determining hourly values and daily sums of direct and scattered radiation obtained using empirical dependencies of engineering methods is carried out. The efficiency of using the sustainable potential of solar energy depends on the climatic characteristics of this area or region. Inconsistencies in regulations can therefore create a problem where the best places for energy production lack public interest, infrastructure and cost-effective consumption. Depending on the regional climatic conditions of Ukraine, the solar energy potential varies from 1400 MJ/m2 in the western regions to 1950 MJ/m2 in the eastern regions. An important characteristic of solar energy resources is the duration of sunshine. For the conditions of Kyiv, the average monthly value of the actual duration varies from 180 hours in March to 120 hours in November. The possible annual duration of sunshine varies accordingly from 4452 hours (2011) to 4481 hours (2020). The maximum values are observed in June (331 hours) and August (334 hours). In the southern regions of Ukraine, the actual annual duration of sunshine for Odesa conditions varies from 2387 hours (2011) to 2709 hours (2020). The criterion for the expediency of using solar energy is the annual number of clear days of more than 200. The number of clear days is not given in SSU.</jats:p>"

This study determines potential impediments from literature and in consultation with experts. Further, a fuzzy VIKOR approach is practiced to prioritize the impediments of product recovery and CSC. Then, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the robustness of the framework attained. The results from the study reflect that “lack of collaboration from supply chain performers”, “lack of tax policies for facilitating CSC models” and “limited expertise, technology, information on CSC practices” are the critical impediments to product recovery in CSCs.

As a result, the manufacturing sector experienced a significant decline which is indicated by the greatly decreasing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) in April and May 2020. Therefore, supply chain resilience (SCR) becomes essential for a company to minimize risk, reduce negative impact, and quickly adapt to the business condition. This research aims to analyse the relationship between variables that can increase SCR, namely information management capability (IMC) and collaboration, and the relationship between SCR and company performance. This research was conducted by collecting primary data using questionnaires and analysing the relationship among variables using the PLS-SEM method. This research indicates that IMC and collaboration significantly affect SCR. SCR also has a significant effect on company performance. However, IMC does not significantly impact company performance, while collaboration significantly affects company performance. This research also indicates that collaboration mediates the relationship between IMC toward company performance.</jats:p>"

EPSA was chosen as it was the major public pharmaceutical procurer and distributor in Ethiopia. Institution-based descriptive and explanatory cross-sectional study designs with mixed approaches were employed. Descriptive findings reveal that vehicle tracking is the most practiced activity. Correlation and regression analysis show that maintenance, fuel, and tracking activities have significant association and predictive power for fleet performance. Qualitative findings show that delay of vehicle maintenance was the major challenge. EPSA higher officials may emphasize having a well-organized workshop. The findings can be considered as input by policymakers in the transport sector. The limitation was the use of a homogenous purposive sampling method for the qualitative study. Thus, future study can be conducted using other reliable methods.</p>",

The descriptive statistics showed the financing gap very clearly. The constraints of SMEs on access to finance are found in policy and operational levels on both the demand and supply sides. There is a huge scope of modern technology to reduce the constraints towards expanding access to finance for SMEs in rural areas. The major constraints area includes the policy measures, lending approach and use of technology, rate of interest, availability of collateral with SMEs, risk-mitigating measures, the position of financial literacy, stage of SMEs’ market development and their business incomes, regulatory compliances, general price level, and development of the physical infrastructures.</jats:p>"

The algebraic component of the implementation of the problem solution is used as an auxiliary calculation technology.A full factorial experiment was conducted. According to the results of the work, the set goal was achieved - the total number of factors was reduced. Based on the methods of statistical analysis, the following conclusions were obtained: a statistically significant relationship was established between the use of concrete pipes at a low speed and the largest number of pipeline accidents. The material of the pipeline and the speed in it turned out to be the most influencing factors on the life of the pipeline and the number of accidents on the pipeline.

Harvested rainwater collected from galvanized iron (GI) and tile roofs containing iron concentration of 0.46 and 0.38 mg/L respectively, were treated by two nano sorbents, CaCO3-nZVI and PUF/CaCO3-nZVI with the intention of making the iron concentration conform to drinking quality standards. The nano sorbents were synthesized and characterized using BET (Brunauer-–Emmett–Teller surface area), SEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). CaCO3-nZVI achieved iron removal efficacy of 88.69% and 89.21% for harvested rainwater from GI sheet roof and tiled roof respectively and the efficiency increased to 95.65% and 95.78% when treated with PUF/CaCO3-nZVI. In addition, the nano sorbents were found to have appreciable removal efficiency for other metals (Pb, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd and Cr) present in the collected rainwater. The use of FTIR and EDX to characterise spent nano sorbents divulged that the iron was removed through sorption process. This study thus explored the potential of CaCO3-nZVI and PUF/CaCO3-nZVI for treating heavy metal contamination in roof-harvested rainwater.</jats:p>",

Ignoring the effect of the initial soil water content on the soil wetting pattern affects the accuracy of the estimated results to a certain extent. This research aimed to develop a soil wetting pattern estimation model for drip irrigation that included four easily measurable parameters (i.e., initial soil water content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, total volume of applied water, and emitter discharge rate) based on dimensional analysis theory. In this study, the wetting front advance data of 12 typical soil textures were obtained in Hydrus-2D/3D. The estimated values were then compared with measured or simulated wetting front advance values. For different experiments, the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean relative error varied from 2.77 to 4.69 cm, 6.20 to 10.61 cm, and 5.61% to 10.51%, respectively. Compared with the existing models, the proposed model was more consistent between the measured and simulated values. Therefore, the proposed model of this study is efficient and simple, which can help accurately estimate the soil wetting pattern of drip irrigation with a variety of soil textures.</jats:p>",

Some of these activities may result in environmental problems. Therefore, measurement of its supply chain management (SCM) performance related to environmental conditions is critical. The green supply chain management (GSCM) concept can help the company to assess the supply chain's performance conditions that could harm the environment. This study aimed to assess the current SCM and measure its performance, as well as to evaluate the potential implementation on GSCM in the PMKP Sukun Ponorogo.  The analytical network process (ANP) was used in this study, consisting of 36 key performance indicators (KPI) from five categories of plan, source, deliver, make, and return. The study results show that all KPIs from the responsiveness dimension in the deliver category have the lowest weight, thus require priority for improvement. The results of the scoring system using the objective matrix (OMAX) method indicated two KPIs were in the red category (or need improvement), including on-time delivery of raw materials to production site and the rejection rate of raw materials. This study suggested to improve the estimated delivery time for avoiding any delays during the production process. This improvement may support the company to continuously offer on-time production process and product’s distribution.</jats:p>",

Adopting IT helps companies stay competitive globally. Many researchers have highlighted the influence of IT on supply chain management and performance. It facilitates the linkages between components in the supply chain, minimizes operating costs, and enhances supply chain performance. Furthermore, IT helps increase the speed and quality of information exchange between partners in the supply chain, increasing competitiveness. To develop tourism, the application of information is a prerequisite for success. Currently, most tourism organizations in Vietnam have applied IT in operating their activities. However, new technologies' application and updated processes have not been synchronized. In Vietnam, literature reviews have indicated that there was no research demonstrating the role of IT in the supply chain performance of the tourism industry. This study was conducted to demonstrate the influence of IT on tourism supply chain performance in Vietnam. The level of impact is presented through the intermediary of “information sharing” and “electronic data interchange”. Research data was collected from 154 domestic and international travel agencies. The study has applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to prove the positive impact of IT on information sharing and electronic information exchange, thereby improving the efficiency of the supply chain. Research results have confirmed the significant role of IT in tourism supply chain performance in Vietnam. It concludes that tourism managers need to pay special attention and adequately invest in IT to improve the performance of the tourism supply chain continuously</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water Distribution Network earlier will have challenge in fulfilling the growing need of water supply. Forecasting and monitoring the flow, pressure, demand, and quality of water in water distribution network are key requirement for sustainable and reliable water supply. Lekhnath city, due to the recent merger with the biggest metropolitan city of Nepal, Pokhara, has created the rapid growth of population resulting to haphazard pipeline extension in this area. For hydraulic analysis of Lekhnath Small Town Water Supply Distribution Network, one of the networks i.e., Shishuwakhudi distribution network was faced with problem analysis. This hydraulic analysis is a part of on-going doctoral research and Youth-led Initiative ‘drinkPani’ on ‘Water Supply and Quality Monitoring using Emerging Technologies’ where capacity building of Youth and Women through data-driven engagements (Water-informatics) is one of the core targets in the overall project-work package. The preliminary analysis of water quality was also derived from Young Water Volunteers (YWVs) under the research work on Youth-led Participatory Sensing (YPS) Model to enhance drinking water security of the study area. The Shishuwakhudi Water Distribution Network (WDN) supplies water to 1138 household at present and consisting of 41 junction nodes and 11.2km distribution pipeline distributing water from a reservoir. With field survey, households at each node of the network were determined. Demand driven analysis using EPANET was done to determine the pressure deficit at various nodes. Demand pattern based on design guideline was adopted for analysis. At present scenario, four nodes at end of the network showed negative pressure at peak hours (5 am- 7am). At other times, the pressure was above 10m head. Demand was forecasted for 10 years from now by projecting the household population based on growth rate of census 2011. When projected to future scenario, the existing pipeline showed only 17% reliability with a minimum pressure requirement of 10 m head as per norms of urban water supply project in Nepal. Genetic algorithm was used for optimization of the Shishuwakhudi Network with total cost of replacing pipes as an objective function with pressure constraint of minimum 10m head. With 500 generation of run, the optimal diameter for each pipe was obtained that gave optimal cost of NRs 4,21,50,917 (USD 359,690.64). This optimization helps in selecting the proper pipeline network for future expansion to fulfil the growing need of water demand.</jats:p>"

The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of droughts in Henan Province were analyzed using run theory and Moran's I, and drought prediction was carried out using grey disaster theory. The results show that: (1) During the period 1987–2020, the overall drought in Henan Province shows a slow intensification trend, and SPEI-12 has a certain adaptability in the drought characterization of Henan Province; (2) The frequency of droughts in the northern and eastern regions of Henan Province is high, the southern region is prone to continuous drought, the drought ephemeris and intensity show a strong positive correlation, and the spatial spillover effect of autumn drought is the most obvious; (3) The grey disaster prediction model has excellent accuracy and predicts that the next possible drought in Henan Province will be in the east of Henan Province in the spring of 2023.</jats:p>",

Another important factor is the deterioration of products. Products can deteriorate during storage or transportation, which badly affects each supply chain player. This study develops a three-echelon supply chain model through which products can be delivered to customers easily. In this model, one producer and multiple buyers are considered, and each buyer has a separate group in which multiple suppliers have been taken. Inflation is also added to the model for inflationary fluctuations. To understand this model in real life, a numerical example is discussed and the total profit from the supply chain is extracted. Sensitivity analysis is also shown at the end of the model to find out the effect on the model due to changes in some parameters that affect this model highly. After developing this model, it was found that if the inflation rate falls, then the total profit will increase continuously. On the contrary, if the inflation rate increases, then, in this situation, the total profit will decrease continuously. At present, vaccine makers’ total profit can support the economy of any country, and in this model, the inflation rate decreases as profit increases.</jats:p>"

Although the relationship between FDI, financial developments, and international trade for NICs has been analyzed in many studies, incorporating renewable energy supply’s impact in this linkage has been relatively narrow. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by investigating the effects of renewable energy supply on FDI, financial development, and international trade for newly industrialized countries using panel causality and panel cointegration analyses between 1990 and 2019.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global production created by the mankind has an intensively increasing harmful effect on the environment. As a result, we are facing the problem of the saving of natural environment and now the global community tries to find solution for this environmental problem. The power generation sector is the most environmentally aggressive of all industry branches. Technical power engineering facilities differ by a high degree of complexity making it difficult to increase the level of their environmental friendliness. In particular, centralized heat supply systems are rather complicated and responsible components of the power engineering industry. These differ by a high level of environmental aggressiveness. Hence, these need to increase a degree of their environmental friendliness. The purpose of this research was to analyze the condition of the interaction of the power generating sector with the natural environment and search for harmonization solutions of available contradictions of such an interaction. An increase of the environmental friendliness of the worn-out power equipment used by centralized heat supply systems is a topical problem. The purpose of this scientific paper was to suggest a solution for the problem of the environmental interaction of the centralized heat supply systems with natural environment using an approach of their partial renewal. The most environmentally aggressive elements of these systems are the boiler plants that emit heat and harmful substances into the environment. Domestic boiler plants have completely been worn-out. Therefore, the development of the domestic boiler building industry is of vital importance. It will enable the production of modern boiler plants instead of worn-out boiler systems. This process is impeded at the moment by the insufficiency of available resources. Contemporary requirements to the technological level of the functioning efficiency of the centralized heat-supply systems are rather high, especially as for its environmental component. Available centralized heat-supply systems have low efficiency due to a high wear-out level of their elements on the whole. There is an urgent need for an increase in the efficiency of these systems. One of the available ways of such an increase in the efficiency is a partial renewal of the equipment. The program of the partial renewal of available boiler plants allows us to provide an appropriate increase in the environmental friendliness of the worn-out equipment used by centralized heat-supply systems. The coverage of the entire fleet of the equipment available for the centralized heat-supply systems by this partial renewal program will allow for an increase in the level of its ecological friendliness on the whole.</jats:p>"

It is on this basis that this study examined the nexus between city livability and transportation in the Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria. Anchored on the concept of livability, the study descriptively and inferentially analyzed the results of 1264 questionnaires administered to residents based on key livability themes. The study revealed low satisfaction with the livability key performance indicators. Similarly, the study revealed that most of the assessed transportation infrastructure facilities are in poor condition and thus hinder the ease of commuting and livability in the city. The result of the regression analysis revealed that transportation infrastructure statistically influenced the livability of the Lagos metropolis. The study recommends the need for expedited proactive measures, particularly structural improvement in transportation infrastructure, towards improving the livability of the Lagos Metropolis.</jats:p>",

This sometimes makes it difficult for the puskesmas to manage the availability of drugs at the puskesmas. The application for forecasting the amount of drug supply at the UPTD Sukamerindu Health Center in Bengkulu City was made using the Visual Basic .Net programming language by applying the Multiple Linear Regression Method for the forecasting process. In determining the results of the forecast for the following month and year, there are 3 supporting variables used, namely demand, use, and supply of drugs in the previous month and year. Based on data on the 500 mg Amoxicillin Capsule, where there were 36 data analyzed from January 2019 to December 2021, the prediction results for the number of drug supplies in January 2022 using the Multiple Linear Regression Method were 13066, with a prediction error rate of 7.10%. .

This is achieved by organizing individual accounts of digital agriculture in livestock systems according to four broad types—commodity-based; value seeking; subsistence and nature-based. Each type presents contrasting modes of value creation in downstream processing; as well as from the perspective of One Health. The ideal result of digital technology adoption is an equitable and substantial diversification of supply chains, increased monetization of animal product quality, and more sensitive management to meet customer demands and environmental threats. Such changes have a significance beyond the immediate value generated because they indicate endogenous growth in livestock systems, and may concern externalities imposed by the pursuit of purely commercial ends.</jats:p>"

The general objective is to understand how the relationship between the local government and the vendors who are licensed to sell at this market is established as a vehicle for food supply. We follow the history of this market from the time when places to buy food first appeared in the city and its inauguration up to its most recent configuration and relationship with the city government, in a longitudinal and theoretical-historical setting. The study is exploratory and descriptive and combines a qualitative approach with some quantitative elements; bibliographic and documentary research, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews were utilized. The municipal market was seen to play an important role in supplying the city, and also as a bearer of memory and cultural heritage. Many people were seen to circulate within this type of space, which is permeated by interests that add complexity to the relationships established there. The directors of the market are appointed by the municipal government, which consequently influences the operational structure of the market, but informal rules dictate the relationships between public bodies and officially authorized people, affecting their regulatory and supervisory functions with market vendors.</jats:p>"

In markets with nonexclusive‐contracting‐cum‐linearly pricing, we show that the EFC model, graphs, and lessons all go through, essentially unchanged. In markets with selection on moral hazard, we show that two natural notions of adverse selection—notions that coincide in the basic EFC framework—may diverge. This divergence is a result of the fact that, with moral hazard, the average cost curve measured by EFC can no longer be interpreted as a supply curve. Finally, in a two‐tier market, we show that the lessons depend on whether contracts are offered “simultaneously” or “sequentially,” where coverage is purchased in layers.</jats:p>",

A case study was considered in a rural community in Cameroon. The parameters of the assessment of the system were reliability, represented in the present work by the system supply deficiency (SSD), and economic accessibility, represented by the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The obtained results showed that for 0% SSD, the optimal configuration of the system was composed of 438 PV modules of 235 W, an immersed solar motor pump of 35 kW, a hydroelectric turbine of 51.7 kW, an upper reservoir of 2307.1 m3, an inverter of 25.27 kW, and a total dynamic head of 88 m. The corresponding LCOE to this configuration is 0.224 USD/kWh. The economic accessibility of the designed system was evaluated by comparison with a PV-system-based battery energy storage. The optimal design configuration of the studied PV-system-based battery energy storage was a PV generator (120 PV modules of 235 W), solar motor pump (15 kW), upper reservoir (590.4 m3), battery capacity (351.78 kWh), inverter (25.27 kW), and total dynamic head (81 m). The corresponding LCOE to this configuration was 0.1857 USD/kWh. Although the PV-system-based battery storage appeared to be economically more cost-effective than the PV-system-based water-pumped energy storage, the sensitivity analysis revealed that there was the possibility for the PV-system-based water-pumped energy storage to be economically more profitable than the PV-system-based battery energy storage. This economic outperformance occurred when the project lifetime was a multiple of 7.5 years or when the costs of the storage components were reduced from 20% to 60%.</jats:p>"

While significant progress has been achieved in the direction of sustainable growth, many nations still rely on nonrenewable energy sources. This study explores the viability of investing in green technology to achieve the optimal decisions (lot sizes, lead time, and green investment amount) in a two-echelon supply chain system by considering human error with two carbon emission strategies: carbon taxes and limited carbon emissions. It entails the inspection of every shipped lot by the buyer to identify defective products that could have resulted from the vendor’s production process. We show a constrained non-linear program and design a calculus-optimization technique to solve it. The methodology used in this research is the quantitative method, which is based on the principles of operations research, and the models are built on mathematically oriented inventory theory. The results imply that an outsized ecological carbon footprint can be reduced without compromising customer service by designing optimal inventory strategies. The findings also confirm that green investment is the greatest economical method for reducing carbon emissions and system costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The phenomena of technology and digitalization have developed rapidly most recently, leaving traces in all branches of industry. With the prevalence of Industry 4.0 and with digitalization being on the rise, companies have expanded more and more successfully. Thus, in addition to global supply chains, their own supply chains have also started to develop considerably. The aim of our research is to discover the factors characterizing the digital transformation of companies in the Central and Eastern European region. This article assesses the conditions, key drivers, and barriers of digital transformation and the benefits expected by companies operating in the agricultural and food supply chains. The research is based on a questionnaire survey of over hundred companies. From the answers, models were created to each group of questions by using factor analysis. The results show that the most important motivating factors are quality improvement, market pull, and technological push impacts. The barriers identified are largely consistent with those reported in the contemporary literature. Companies expect benefits mostly from “sales and customer relations”, followed by “logistics and marketing”, and “production and sourcing”.</jats:p>"

The model was built in the laboratory with a scale of 1:10, consisting of two siphons, each with a diameter of 0.3 m and a length of 14 m for the model scale. Several scenarios were considered for the physical modeling, of which the focus was on analyzing the discharge capacity, sediment flushing, flow pattern, and pressure. Using  the (prototype) design  discharge  of  6.36  m3/s  and  some  variations  of  sediment  size  for  the  original configuration of the model,  we  observed the  insufficient hydraulic capacity of the  siphons. Several  modifications were thus applied to the original design, namely by modifying the upstreamchannel and extending the upper wall of the downstreamchannel.  The  result  showed  that  the  hydraulic  performance  increased  after  applying  such modification scenarios, where the siphons were able to discharge 6.36 m3/s. In addition, we observed that the flushing pipe diameter of 0.5 m was faster to flush the sediment inside the siphons. The results of this study are useful for the related stakeholders to increase water supply productivity.</jats:p>"

One of the analytical tools that can be used to control inventory is the \"Economic Order Quantity\" (EOQ). From the calculation results, it was found that the optimal number of fuel supply purchases from palm oil shells using the EOQ method is 352 tons with a purchase frequency of 3 times in one period (1 year) so that the company can save fuel procurement costs. . The total inventory cost of raw materials with an EOQ of Rp. 32,845,640 while the cost incurred by the company without using EOQ amounted to Rp. 34,731,000.

To solve this problem, this paper proposed a new technical demand-supply matching method based on electric power technical field feature. First, the improved TF-IDF algorithm was used to extract technical field feature, then scientific and technological achievements with higher relevancy were retrieved based on technical field feature to build a background library of electric power technological achievements, and the matching degree of electric power technological achievements based on word vector was used to verify the matching efficiency of this method. We adopted the China smart grid technical transaction service platform and the text message of electric power technical demand and technological achievements on Keyi net for application, and the results indicate this method has raised the matching efficiency by 23.4% compared to traditional methods. In this paper, a new idea of taking technical field feature as the demand-supply matching basis of electric power technology transfer platform was proposed, which opens a new perspective for the research of demand-supply matching efficiency on electric power technology transfer platform, helps to promote the matching efficiency of technical demand and technological achievements, and further raises the success rate of electric power technology transfer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents an approach for integrating conflicted cells in a chain-like structure based on a measurement of the level of integration of this structure. The authors’ prior experience suggests an assumption that conflicts always arise when cells are connected by a flow of materials, information, and money, although at different intensity levels. Usually, the intensity levels of said conflicts depend on the cooperation culture within a supply chain. This is a highly multidi-mensional problem, reflected by the literature referred to in this paper and related to this subject matter. The proposed approach treats technological processes between conflicted cells as an area of potential integration of these cells. Then, the integration becomes a problem of selecting the appropriate variant of realizing a technological process conducted in an area common for potentially conflicted cells of a company. The same approach may be used for cells belonging to separate production and distribution companies operating within a mutual supply chain. The paper proposes a method for measuring the integration level of neighboring cells, as a difficult-to-measure feature, by deter-mining an integration loss index. Also, the paper presents a multi-criteria method based on the fuzzy set theory for selecting a preferred variant of a technological process. A presented example uses this method in a supply chain to maximize the integration level between Shipping and Recipient cells/links. It has been assumed that the preferred realization variant of the flow process will be based on the following criteria: 1) shipping cost; 2) shipping quality; 3) shipping time. Also, an algorithm is shown for applying the presented methodology, which is helpful for managers interested in increasing the integration level of a supply chain. The methodology allows for increasing the integrity of conflicted cells both in newly designed supply chains as well as in existing ones when remodeled or reorganized. Moreover, the paper indicates some problems associated with the efficient implementation of the proposed method.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recovery of mimic function after facial nerve transection is poor. The successful regrowth of regenerating motor nerve fibers to reinnervate their targets is compromised by (i) poor axonal navigation and excessive collateral branching, (ii) abnormal exchange of nerve impulses between adjacent regrowing axons, namely axonal crosstalk, and (iii) insufficient synaptic input to the axotomized facial motoneurons. As a result, axotomized motoneurons become hyperexcitable but unable to discharge. We review our findings, which have addressed the poor return of mimic function after facial nerve injuries, by testing the hypothesized detrimental component, and we propose that intensifying the trigeminal sensory input to axotomized and electrophysiologically silent facial motoneurons improves the specificity of the reinnervation of appropriate targets. We compared behavioral, functional, and morphological parameters after single reconstructive surgery of the facial nerve (or its buccal branch) with those obtained after identical facial nerve surgery, but combined with direct or indirect stimulation of the ipsilateral infraorbital nerve. We found that both methods of trigeminal sensory stimulation, i.e., stimulation of the vibrissal hairs and manual stimulation of the whisker pad, were beneficial for the outcome through improvement of the quality of target reinnervation and recovery of vibrissal motor performance.</jats:p>"

The database used is taken from IBGE's Municipal Livestock Production Survey. The results indicate that there was a rapid expansion of sugarcane production, which followed a similar direction as corn and soybeans, but with beans maintaining a very slow production rate. Sugarcane production is heavily concentrated in a single mesoregion of Goiás, which highlights a series of alerts regarding the spatial heterogeneity of this crop's production. The work concludes that there are strong indications that sugarcane is substituting rice production, but the same has not happened with beans.</jats:p>"

It is currently being built on top of a hill about 120m from sea level to avoid the impact of storm surges, sea-level rise, and flooding. With the city’s continued expansion, water demand further worsens the supply gap. This study focused on determining the carbon footprint of the proposed water supply scarcity solution. This solution includes the construction of a reservoir to receive runoff water from the watershed where the CSCMP is located. Results of the study show that the reservoir can supply the water requirement for the entire city. However, the carbon footprint of the recommended solution is between 123% and 557% due to water treatment of heavily contaminated runoff water and the power consumption in distributing water to higher elevations. There is a need for the city to design a harvesting system that will reduce the need for more intense water treatment (i.e., reducing exposure of runoff water to contaminants) and the use of renewable energy in powering pumps and other treatment activities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transition to a circular economy offers a promising approach to sustainable resource management in energy supply chains, particularly within the context of reducing environmental impacts and enhancing resource efficiency. A circular economy model focuses on minimizing waste, maximizing resource utilization, and promoting the reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing of materials. This paper explores the application of circular economy principles in energy supply chains, highlighting their potential to transform traditional linear supply chains into more sustainable, closed-loop systems. In the energy sector, the circular economy can be implemented through various practices such as extending the lifecycle of energy infrastructure, reducing carbon emissions, and optimizing resource extraction and consumption. Key strategies include the recycling of energy materials (such as metals and plastics), repurposing equipment and infrastructure, and promoting energy efficiency across the entire supply chain. Moreover, the role of renewable energy systems, such as solar, wind, and bioenergy, is crucial in supporting circular economy models by offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels and enabling the reduction of environmental footprints. The paper also addresses the importance of designing energy products and services with circularity in mind, ensuring that materials and components can be recovered and reused after their useful life. Technological innovation, particularly in digitalization and artificial intelligence, plays a critical role in optimizing the management of resources in circular supply chains. Through data analytics and predictive modeling, energy companies can better track and manage material flows, ensuring higher efficiency and reduced waste. Additionally, collaboration among stakeholders, including suppliers, governments, and consumers, is vital for fostering circularity in energy supply chains. By implementing circular economy models, energy companies can not only enhance sustainability but also realize cost savings, improve resilience, and meet regulatory compliance. This paper concludes with recommendations for the energy sector to accelerate the adoption of circular economy practices, ensuring a sustainable and resource-efficient future.</jats:p>"

The study was performed based on data collected from 305 groundwater sample stations in the Narmada River Basin. Hydrochemical evaluation illustrated that cationic ions in the upper and middle Narmada Basin were dominated by Ca2+; however, in the lower basin it was dominated by Na+ ions. Similarly, anionic ions were dominated by HCO3− throughout the basin. A Chadha plot drawn from the collected data inferred that most groundwater belonged to the recharge water category (Ca-Mg-HCO3 type). Base-exchange indices of the collected data confirmed the presence of Na+-SO42− type of groundwater. Meteoric genesis indices indicated deep meteoric percolation groundwater. Further, Gibbs plots categorized groundwater samples in the rock dominated section, while chloro-alkaline indices confirmed direct as well as reverse ion-exchange reactions governing groundwater quality. Water Quality Index values showed that groundwater ranged from excellent to very poor. Human health risk of the Narmada River confirmed the non-carcinogenic risk for Nitrate (NO3−) and Fluoride (F−) ions. However, several indices justified that groundwater was ideal for irrigation. However, groundwater treatment is recommended before direct consumption such as drinking.</jats:p>",

To continuously improve speed, accuracy, efficiency, and quality, it was necessary to drastically change the information flow and improve the optimization processes. The complex and complicated tasks of supply chains belong to the difficult-to-solve, np-hard complexity class. In many cases, metaheuristics are used to solve these problems, which can provide results much faster than exact methods, but in many cases, they fall short in terms of accuracy. According to the authors, the use of metaheuristics should be treated as part of some kind of trade-off. These algorithms are usually compared to each other, not to a different kind of optimization procedure, and they do not observe the point that can determine which method is the more favorable, more profitable procedure. The authors present the above topic in this chapter, which helps to reveal further research gaps and new research directions.</jats:p>",

Interrelationships between essential nutrients are one of the most important issues in terms of effectiveness in plant mineral nutrition. A pattern in leaf nutrient accumulation throughout the growing period is required to indicate a suitable sampling time for the purpose of nutrient diagnostics and controlled plant feeding. The experiment was conducted on two commercially available cultivars of kiwiberry, ‘Weiki’ and ‘Geneva’, during the 2015–2016 growing seasons with an increasing soil N fertility (30–50–80 mg N kg−1 soil DW) to test the relationship between soil N level and leaf/fruit micronutrient concentration. The leaf Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn concentrations significantly increased with a higher N supply in ‘Geneva’, while in ‘Weiki’ only Mn increased. Leaf B, Fe, and Mn gradually increased throughout the growing season, while Cu decreased. Between mid-July and the beginning of August, the lowest fluctuations in the micronutrient contents were recorded. The effect of the growing season on leaf micronutrient accumulation was highly significant; except for Fe, significantly higher micronutrient levels were revealed in 2016. Compared to the leaves, the growing season effect was smaller in the case of fruit micronutrient concentrations. Irrespective of cultivar, the increase in N fertilization resulted in a higher fruit Mn concentration and was insignificant in the case of other micronutrients. The results indicate that the N dose may affect the accumulation of micronutrients within a certain range depending on the tissue type and the genotype.</jats:p>"

Knowledge on the morphologic peculiarities will allow to identify main contributors especially blood flow ultrasound examination for the purpose of ovary preserving surgery. This study aimed at identifying landmarks especially for so-called low-flow tubal vessels. Arteries of 17 female Thiel-embalmed bodies were studied along three preselected paramedian segments and measurements taken. A section was made through the center of the ovary perpendicular to uterine tube, then the mesosalpinx tissue distance was divided into 3 equivalent zones: upper, middle and lower thirds. The surface area of the mesosalpinx averaged 1088 ± 62 mm2. 47.7 ± 7.1 % of the mesosalpinx zones included macroscopically visible vessels. The lower third segment of mesosalpinx was the thickest averaging 2.4 ± 1.5 mm. One to three tubal branches were identified in the middle third of the mesosalpinx. Arterial anastomoses were found in the upper segment of the mesosalpinx, but no presence of a marginal vessel supplying the fallopian tube could be found. Statistically significant moderate positive correlations were established between the diameters of the mesosalpingeal arteries between the three zones. The mesosalpinx, uterine tube and the ovary form areas of segmental blood supply. Variants of tubal vessels appear to be a sparse source of blood supply.</jats:p>",

However, some difficulties are presented in the structure like high cost, privacy issues and distortions. Thus, new secured information sharing for SCM is proposed in this work and deals with the introduction of privacy preservation of data transfers among supply chains. Initially, a supply chain is constructed and the data transfer among the diverse levels takes place via blockchain technology. In the blockchain, security being a crucial factor, a new privacy preservation method is introduced. The initial information is converted to a sanitization procedure prior to transmission via blockchain technology, in which the information is turned into sanitized data. Similarly, the sanitized data is restored on the receiving end to obtain the original data. More importantly, key generation has a significant role in both processes, and it must be ideally chosen. The key is optimally chosen for this study using a new optimization algorithm called Fitness‐based Self‐adaptive Sea lion Optimization (FSA‐SLnO), which is a better variant of the conventional Sealion Optimization technique (SLnO). In terms of security, the proposed protected information sharing in SCM using block chain technology is evaluated by comparing it with traditional approaches.</jats:p>",

Secondly, the optimal resource scheduling scheme is designed based on the principle of H∞ cybernetics, which is called the hierarchical scheduling of complex dynamic supply chain in this paper. Finally, a numerical example shows the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. Through this model, the production of manufacturers, the inventory of manufacturers and distributors, and the order quantity of distributors can be arranged in advance, which improves the robustness of the closed-loop dynamic supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High Voltage High Pulse Power Supply (HVHPPS) is designed with the goal to match fixed load, so thatprecise pulse output can be achieved. Generally the loads involve magnetron, klystron, and particle accelerators etc. The HVHPPS output pulse shape changes with load impedance variation due to various reasons. Due to changes in impedance, the performance of Pulse Power Supply degrades and reflects the power at the source end which causes component failure and system shut down. To overcome such problems, a scale down High Voltage High Pulse Power is designed and developed to match the dynamic impedance variations upto 25 % of mismatch. In earlier days, all HVHPPS were designed using microcontrollers where the problem of pulse to pulse monitoring and computational speed was compromised. The availability of variable and self-defined, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) controller, which provided flexibility to design the pulse to pulse shaping and various vital parameter monitoring, made it possible. This paper presents the design and implementation of HVHPPS over an FPGA platform to meet the fast response requirement. This paper provides a solution for impedance mismatch problems associated with such types of power supply, and also presents specifications for major components in a high voltage pulse power system for various types of load ranges. An experimental test hardware was designed and developed for HVHPPS to implement dynamic impedance algorithm and validate the results.</jats:p>"

Because of these advancements, organizations are now facing new challenges in the form of cybersecurity risks that are partly caused by these technologies. In recent years, there has been a spike in the number of cyberattacks, and organizations are taking steps to minimize the impacts of these attacks. To address this critical issue, in this article, we discuss possible future research directions that production and operations management (POM) researchers can undertake to help organizations, supply chains, and governments develop robust strategies for reducing the number of attacks and their repercussions. In particular, we identify several avenues for future research in the following domains of POM: (1) global operations strategy, (2) healthcare operations management, (3) public policy, (4) management of technology, (5) supply chain management, and (6) disruptive technologies. Research on the topic of cybersecurity is not only an opportunity for operations management researchers but also critical for industry and society to overcome the challenges of cybersecurity risks.</jats:p>",

Under different government subsidy strategies, the PIR decision and coordination of the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) of authorized competition remanufacturing are studied. This paper constructs five centralized and decentralized decision models of CLSC and analyzes the influence of government subsidy strategy and PIR input entity differences on the competition and cooperation relationship between manufacturers and remanufacturers and the performance of CLSC. A fixed license fee contract is designed to realize CLSC coordination and to improve the performance and operational efficiency of the CLSC. It is found that patent licensing fees can always play a role in sharing government subsidies between the manufacturer and remanufacturer, and making changes in government subsidy strategies only affects formulation of patent licensing fees. Manufacturer PIR input mode is more conducive to improving the market demand for new products, while remanufacturer PIR input mode is more conducive to improving the PIR input level, remanufactured product market demand, CLSC members and overall performance. Moreover, government subsidies can produce better efficiency and effects under remanufacturer PIR input mode. A fixed license fee contract can coordinate a CLSC effectively. The increase in government subsidies and PIR input effect can effectively expand the negotiation space between the manufacturer and remanufacturer, which is conducive to achievement of coordination contracts. Finally, the main conclusions are verified by numerical analysis.</jats:p>"

Resting T-cells primarily use the oxidation of higher fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria for their energy needs, whereas activated T-cells switch to aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis, using glucose, and glutamine as substrates, respectively.\r\nAIM: To determine the metabolic activity and energy supply of peripheral blood lymphocytes in predominantly healthy northerners by measuring the intracellular content of HIF-1 (hypoxia-induced factor 1), SIRT3 (sirtuin 3), and ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 volunteers, residents of the Arkhangelsk region (23 women and 16 men, 2362 years old), were selected, and examined for this experiment. We established the total number of peripheral blood lymphocytes with CD-typing of lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD71+) by indirect immunoperoxidase reactions, the content of HIF-1 and SIRT3 in the lymphocyte lysate employing enzyme immunoassay, the concentration of ATP by luminescent analysis through luciferin-luciferase reaction. Statistical analysis was conducted in \"Statistica 10.0\", cluster analysis was applied using the k-means method. Mean values (M) and standard deviations (SD) were calculated, the normal distribution was tested by the KolmogorovSmirnov and Lilliefors criterion. Student's t-test was calculated, and the differences were considered statistically significant at p 0.05.\r\nRESULTS: The study revealed that the metabolic activity of lymphocytes associated with HIF-1 regulation differs significantly in the examined volunteers,, while in the group with a lower total number of lymphocytes and their subpopulations (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD71+) there is a predominant glycolytic orientation of metabolism with proliferated cells energy supply.\r\nCONCLUSION: Metabolic activity which can be determined by the HIF-1/SIRT3 ratio, and the energy supply of lymphocytes have a substantial impact on their differentiation, proliferation, and functioning.</jats:p>"

First, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is adopted to determine the importance weight of the intelligent cognitive factors of ISS. Then, based on the evaluation grade, the membership matrix of intelligent cognitive factors of ISS is constructed, and an individual cognitive ability evaluation model combining qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis is established. Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 25.0 and Smartpls software are further used to determine the questionnaire items about the participation intention in ISS training. A structural equation model among individual participation intention, theoretical factors of planned behaviour and participation behaviour is constructed. After analysing the data obtained from the survey, the final results are as follows. (1) Harbin's largest number of ISS participants is 18–29 years old, accounting for 44.8%. Undergraduate education accounts for 47.5%. The number of participants whose monthly income is 6001–12,000 is the largest, accounting for 25%. (2) The number of people participating in skating is the highest, reaching 59.7%. The proportion of people who have participated in ISS for one year or less is the highest, reaching 45.8%. From the consumption amount perspective, the people spending 1000 yuan and below account for the highest proportion, so the consumption degree of ISS is mainly experiential consumption. (3) The correlation coefficient between subjective norms and individual participation intention is 0.598, indicating that the relationship between the two is significantly positive, that is, subjective norms will have a certain impact on individual participation intention. The correlation coefficient between behaviour attitude and participation intention is 0.697, indicating that the relationship between them is significantly positive. The correlation coefficient between perceived behaviour control and participation intention is 0.745, indicating a significant positive correlation between them. The research content provides a theoretical basis for the follow‐up ISS training intelligent cognition. It can also provide a reference for the further development of ISS in China.</jats:p>",

In this study, smart water solutions (GSWaterS) were implemented to enhance the efficiency of the water supply system in the city of Aracatuba, Brazil. They were used to monitor and analyze the operating conditions of the water supply system in real time, thus allowing for the effective management of water supply assets. GSWaterS also supports the design and optimization of district metered areas, the reduction and management of water losses, real-time water network analysis, and big data analysis using artificial intelligence.

Due to the complexity of the aeration jet, it is still a big challenge to understand the aeration mechanism at the water-air interface. This study applied the two-fluid model to simulate three-dimensional entrainment characteristics of jet flow, and also analyzed effects of bubble size, wall roughness, drag force model, turbulence model, and numerical model dimension on clear-water length. Results reveal that the two-fluid model can accurately and effectively simulate clear-water length, thickness variation, and average cross-section air concentration of jet flow with maximum error of 4.1%, 6.5% and 4.2% (x = L1, defining clear-water length with 1% air concentration as L1), respectively. Wall roughness height has a crucial influence on clear-water length. Taking L1 as an example, clear-water length decreases by 13.9% when roughness height increases from 0 to 3 mm. The drag models and bubble particle sizes affect clear-water length only when the profile aeration concentration is greater than 15%. Turbulence model and numerical model dimension have a minor effect on clear-water length.</jats:p>",

The frequency-modulated signal of the speed of rotation of the crankshaft is chosen as a source of input information. With the use of nozzles that have piezoelectric control means, the conceptual principles of software movements of hardware devices to ensure the identity of work cycles have been developed. Direct digital control and feedback control methods are used to design the hardware architecture. The torque of an individual cylinder was approximated on the basis of the Fourier transform taking into account the sequence of their work. A mechanical system with four degrees of freedom is proposed as a deterministic mathematical model of the torque circuit of the power unit. The movements of the masses of the model are described by a system of differential equations, provided that friction is taken into account. The parameters of the system are normalized and the Laplace transform under zero initial conditions is used for its solution. The information links between the torques and the measurement information signal were established using the method of determinants and the theory of signal graphs. It was found that these methods give almost identical calculation results. Algorithmic support for assessing the identity of work cycles is built on the solution of a redefined system of algebraic equations with optimization of the result based on the method of least squares. The Monte Carlo method was used as a mathematical tool for the computer simulation of random disturbances. Computer modeling of the effects of interference on the measurement information signal and on the phase delays of individual cylinders established the requirements for the metrological characteristics of the hardware</jats:p>"

As SCs are operating across regional boundaries, their dynamics need to be aligned with the paradigm of industry 4.0 technologies. Blockchain is one among those, which promises to enhance product traceability and bring transparency to its operation. But, the adoption of blockchain is not getting much attention, which indicates the need of an analysis of its drivers. As the avenues of information technology are getting attention, drivers of blockchain adoption are identified in this study. Furthermore, to reveal the mutual interrelationships between the drivers interpretive structural modelling-Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (ISM-MICMAC) analysis is exercised. Driving factors are further analyzed by the Neutrosophic-based robust ranking, resulting in the primacy of the drivers. The outcomes of the present work substantially outrank the drivers, relative to its impact in the adoption of blockchain operations in SC performance systems.

This study examined the most important challenges and barriers to the implementation of GSCM in the construction industry. In this paper, the components and sub-components of GCSCM were identified using the literature review and opinions of the experts according to the supply chain management. The opinions of construction experts and project managers were collected through focus group meetings. The components were categorized into five main and supporting groups, with “Green Design”, “Green Procurement”, and “Green Production” as the main components and “Green Management” and “Green Information” as the supporting components. Subsequently, the sub-components, in regard to each component, were distinguished. Finally, the fuzzy best–worst method (BWM) was utilized to determine the importance weights of the identified components and sub-components through the opinions of five experts with practical relevant experience. The findings of the fuzzy BWM method show that “Green Design” is the most important component, followed by “Green Management” and “Green Implementation”. Additionally, “Lack of designers, contractors and planners” was ranked the first among the identified sub-components.

However, the quality of the meat available on the market and the prices charged are far from satisfactory for consumers. There is therefore clearly a problem of physical and financial accessibility to quality beef for the Cameroonian consumer (in a country where 37.5% of the population lives below the poverty line). Methods: To analyze this problem, a qualitative exploratory study based on interviews and on-site observations was conducted. Results: In the article, we are interested in the Supply Chain (SC) of beef in Cameroon, with the aim of understanding its dynamics and highlighting the main obstacles that prevent the actors involved from ensuring consumers, the availability of quality meat at a reasonable price. Through the qualitative exploratory study conducted with the main actors involved (breeders, livestock traders, modern and traditional slaughterhouses, butchers, etc.), we show that the SC of beef in Cameroon is plagued by technical, financial, managerial and cultural constraints that prevent them from satisfying their customers and to take full advantage of their activities. Conclusions: Despite the methodological limits related to sampling and an essentially qualitative approach, the quality and richness of the information collected through in-depth interviews edify the main difficulties and challenges encountered by the actors and lead to managerial implications and prospects of research.</jats:p>"

Combining the tools of ‘create fishnet’ and ‘inverse distance weight’ in ArcGIS, the spatial distribution map of the comprehensive trophic index of Junshan Lake was generated. The results show that: (1) The water quality of Junshan Lake was deteriorating year by year. The comprehensive nutritional index (TLI) of Junshan Lake in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 24.12–31.93, 25.27–35.84, and 26.15–46.87, respectively. The nutritional status of Junshan Lake was dominated by Grade I (Oligotropher) in 2018, and by Grade II (Mesotropher) in 2020; the proportion of water in Grade II (Mesotropher) rose from 24.5% in 2018 to 78.6% in 2020; (2) Aquaculture makes a great contribution to the increase in the lake nutrition level, and the comprehensive nutritional index of the aquaculture area is relatively high; (3) The comprehensive nutritional index value of the water body in the southern part of Junshan Lake is higher than that in the northern part, and the risk of converting to Grade III (light eutrophication) is higher.</jats:p>",

The research was performed with drought-exposed and irrigated variants during the grain filling phase. RWC of the flag leaves of Vostorg, Murov 2, Tale 38, and Gyrmyzy gul 1 genotypes was higher both under drought and irrigated conditions. There was a positive correlation between RWC and earing time, and a negative correlation between RWC and plant height. The average difference in RWC between irrigated and drought-exposed variants for all genotypes was 10.1%. In 12thIWWYT no. 9 and 12thIWWYT no. 20 lines, this difference was high (26.5 and 19.6%), while in Gyzyl bughda, Murov 2, and Ferrigineum 2/19 genotypes, it was low (3.5, 3.6, and 2.9%). The highest values of the rate of photosynthesis were observed in the drought-exposed genotypes Sheki 1, Aran, Tale 38, and Zirva 85 (14.2, 14.8, 14.1, and 14.3 µmol CO2m−2 s−1), and in the irrigated genotypes Aran, Vostorg, and 12thIWWYT no. 9 (24.9, 23.4, and 24.0 µmol CO2 m−2s−1).

The classification of logistics centers are carried out and approaches to their definition are systematized. The stages of evolution of sales and distribution of agricultural products on the basis of cooperation, logistics distribution centers are analyzed and the conclusion on the need to create such centers in the sale of agricultural products is made. The foreign practice of creation of logistic distribution centers of agricultural products is generalized, and also criteria of their characteristic are allocated. It is argued that the main purpose of creating logistics distribution centers for agricultural products is to establish economic partnerships between producers and consumers, reduce transaction costs, create conditions for the inclusion of small producers in competitive supply chains, ensuring transparency of food, quality and safety. It is proposed to consider the logistics distribution center of agricultural products and food as an object of providing comprehensive logistics services and coordination of transportation, finishing (drying, sorting, etc.), storage, sales, as well as support for financial, customs operations, marketing research, providing information support, etc. The factors hindering the inclusion of small producers in agri-food supply chains are systematized, and the requirements of retail chains for the supply of agricultural products are highlighted, which highlights the existing difficulties that can be solved by creating logistics distribution centers. Models of formation of logistics centers are considered and the formation of a logistics distribution center of agricultural products on the basis of public-private partnership is substantiated, which unites in one chain all logistics, production processes, as well as sales, including and commodity exchange.\nKey words: logistics distribution center, agri-food supply chains, small producers, logistics services.</jats:p>",

However, our systematic literature review indicates that little is known about how different types of ties influence the intention of firms to adopt B2B platforms and improve international performance. This study aims to explore the important role of political and business ties in the development of supply chain management capability by arguing that political and business ties are positively related to the development of supply chain management capability, which is proposed to shape the intention of firms to adopt B2B platforms and their international performance. Furthermore, we also attempt to develop a framework between potential strategic needs for a firm’s supply chain capability development and different ties. Using survey data collected from a sample of 369 firms in China, we test these proposed arguments empirically through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Results demonstrate that political and business ties contribute positively to developing a firm’s supply chain capability, positively related to the firm’s intention to adopt B2B platforms and international performance. In addition, our study also reveals that supply chain risk significantly modifies the relationships between political or business ties and supply chain capability development. This study provides important contributions to the literature by extending prior research on supply chain management and offers important insights into our understanding of the successful development of supply chain management capability, intention to adopt B2B platforms, and international performance improvement. We believe our findings can help inform how firms can develop supply chain management capability by utilizing different ties.</jats:p>"

Moreover, we evaluate the economic feasibility of AM for slow-moving automotive spare parts by comparing the costs of the traditional manufacturing (TM) spare parts supply chain (SPSC) with centralized, outsourced AM SPSC. Data from a multiple case study of an OEM in the automotive industry regarding SPSC is utilized. The supply chain costs of 14 individual spare parts were analyzed, and the total SPSC cost for the AM and TM, were compared. Three of the fourteen parts showed potential for cost-savings, if they were produced with AM instead of TM. In this context, AM polymer parts showed greater potential than metal to replace TM as the more economical option of manufacturing from a total supply chain cost perspective. This study shows that the AM competitiveness to TM, from a financial perspective, increases for spare parts with low demand, high minimum order quantity, and high TM production price. The SPSC cost model included: cost of production, transport, warehousing, and service costs. This study contributes to the emerging field of part identification for AM and the existing literature regarding cost modeling in SPSCs.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the effectiveness of the existing methods of sorption water purification, which contain compounds of heavy metals, was carried out. Highly effective magnetic sorbents were obtained by electroerosion dispersion, which contains polyvalent iron oxides.&#x0D;\nThe effect of the method of introducing the sorbent into wastewater on the degree of its purification was investigated. The most effective results in water purification were achieved with the use of freshly obtained powder of electroerosion dispersion of iron in water in the form of a suspension, which allows to achieve a high degree of water purification from zinc ions - more than 99%. Such water meets the standards for washing parts in galvanic production with regard to the content of nickel ions. The expediency of recycling spent nano-sorbents in the composition of powder paint and varnish materials is shown. When a coating chemically stable in water treatment waste, which has ferromagnetic properties, is included in the composition, in quantity15% by weight high corrosion resistance of the coating is ensured and shielding of electromagnetic radiation increases approximately 3 times compared to the standard sample. The use of research results at enterprises will prevent environmental pollution with toxic substances, change outdated production technologies, ensure efficient and rational use of water, raw materials and energy in the industrial production system.</jats:p>"

Cause-related marketing (CRM), as an effective marketing tool for enterprises to fulfill their social responsibility, is rapidly being applied to all stages of the supply chain. However, there is no conclusive evidence on the implementation strategy of CRM for supply chain members. In this paper, we study the decision and pricing strategies of CRM for the manufacturer and the retailer by constructing models for two scenarios: the manufacturer implements CRM, and the retailer implements CRM. We conclude that the donation percentage and the pro-sociality of consumers have a significant impact on the strategic and pricing decisions for supply chain members. The wholesale and selling prices will be higher when the manufacturer implements CRM. Our result also shows that the manufacturer and retailer are profitable in CRM only when the donation amount exceeds a certain percentage. In addition, to maximize profits, the manufacturer is more likely to allow a retailer to implement CRM, and the retailer is only optimally positioned to implement CRM when the pro-sociality of consumers is high or when the donation percentage is high.</jats:p>",

Block chain technologies have significant potential as a new basis for all types of transactions, even though its initial purpose was to support new kinds of digital currency enabling simpler and more secure payments. By using this technology as a platform to carry out \"smart contracts\" for transactions, particularly for high-value products, agribusiness stands to become a primary benefactor. Prior to further discussion, it is crucial to make a distinction between private digital currencies and the underlying distributed ledger and block chain technology. Since digital currencies like Bitcoin are dispersed and international in nature, central banks are unlikely to be able to effectively regulate their underlying protocols. Instead than being able to monitor and control the money itself, monetary authorities are more concerned with comprehending the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" that make up the linkages to the conventional payments system. Contrary to the block chain's digital currency component, the distributed ledger feature has the potential to be widely used in agricultural and trade financing, particularly if processes involve several partners and there is no reliable central authority.</jats:p>"

State wise area, production and yield (APY) data for the year 2018-19 indicates the typical concentration of rice cultivation in the eastern and southern Indian states but lowest yield in eastern states. During 1950-51 to 2018-19, rice production witnesses an average growth of 2.45 per cent per year. The study projects the future demand and supply of rice for the year 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 based on historical data on APY; NSSO data on per capita consumption of rice and population forecasts of the United Nations (UN) for India. Projected estimates indicates that Indian rice production may attain about 160 million tonnes by the year 2030 and 259 million tonnes during 2050. Further, the supply-demand differences for future indicates that, India would retain surplus of about 62 million tonnes of rice by the year 2050 after meeting the consumption demand of 1.65 billion population. Further, on the policy issue on dipping rice area in the country, it was also assessed that had the rice area remains the same as in 2018-19, yield level need to be increased by about 1.83 t ha-1 and if rice area decreases by 15 per cent, incremental yield to fed the burgeoning population would be around 2.62 t ha-1 during the year 2050.</jats:p>",

This study examines the effectiveness of community participation as a bottom-up approach. The narrative review is employed to describe 16 cases of community participation. Three themes emerge from the case studies: the success story and failure of community participation from outside of Indonesia, lessons learned and best practices of community participation from Indonesia, and self-supply as an alternative water provision. Then a discussion of the findings based on the themes found in the literature was carried out. The study found that community participation would be successful if the participatory elements were satisfied, including sufficient capacity and knowledge of the community involved to ensure meaningful participation, involving local government in the education of how to manage and conserve water supply, and involving women in project sustainability. Hence, a pure community participation approach, particularly in disadvantaged urban areas, cannot be achieved. Therefore, a holistic approach combining a top-down and a bottom-up approach is recommended. Self-supply water provision emerged as another method that has largely been ignored by the government and academia but serves as a common practice, particularly in developing countries.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the benefits of IoT in closed-loop logistics operations’ effects on the goals of CSR for a sustainable environment and how the use of smart technology impacts the operations of CLSC to meet the goals of CSR for a sustainable environment. For data, we get the data of firms that are on close-loop logistics and firms that are using smart technology for their operations. regression for analysis in STATA. Results show that firms that are using smart technology for their operations are achieving more CSR goals for a sustainable environment. The Internet of Things will not instantly contribute to the accomplishment of CSR targets, despite the fact that it has a direct and positive influence on closed-loop supply chains (CLSC). The CSR goals are not directly relatowith the internet of things; nevertheless, the internet may be utilized as regulatory or assisting tools in order to achieve them.

Only 10% of samples were in the very poor category for drinking purposes, which increased to 95% in the post-monsoon period due to elevated U, As, Ni, F and NO3 concentrations. Further, the average cumulative risk posed by the contaminants in the drinking water was &amp;gt;1 for almost all the samples indicating a higher risk of non-cancerous health issues. The average carcinogenic risk to males, females, and children due to ingestion of groundwater laden with As, Ni, Cr, and Pb was 1643 × 10−6, 1415 × 10−6, and 3066 × 10−6 during pre-monsoon and 2091 × 10−6, 1802 × 10−6, and 3904 × 10−6 during post-monsoon period respectively.

In total, 298 Chinese pharmaceutical company supply chain managers were surveyed and Structural equation analysis was conducted using SPSS26.0 and AMOS24.0. The results show that digital transformation significantly and positively impacts sustainable supply chain performance. Traceability plays a mediating role. The mediating role of information sharing is not significant. However, information sharing and traceability as two separate trends can have synergistic effects that together affect sustainable supply performance. The conclusion is that the pharmaceutical supply chain should accelerate digital construction, eliminate the uneven development of digital technology among supply chain members, and reduce the impact of technological uncertainty on performance. Companies are enhancing supply chain security management through information sharing and traceability systems, and are continuously focusing on the role of digital transformation as a driver for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, modern gas supply systems are complex. They consist of gas distribution stations; high-, medium-, and low-pressure gas networks; gas installations; and control points. These systems are designed to provide natural gas to the population, including domestic, industrial, and agricultural consumers. This study is aimed at developing methods for improving the calculation of gas distribution networks. The gas supply system should ensure an uninterrupted and safe gas supply to consumers that is easy to operate and provides the possibility of shutting down its individual elements for preventive, repair, and emergency recovery work. Therefore, this study presents a mathematical calculation method to find the optimal operating conditions for any gas network during the period of seasonal changes in thermal loads. This method demonstrates how the reliability of gas distribution systems and resistance to non-standard critical loads are affected by consumers based on the time of year, month, and day, and external factors such as outdoor temperature. The results in this study show that this method will enable the implementation of tools for testing various management strategies for the gas distribution network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy supply chain is a critical component of global infrastructure, connecting resource extraction, production, and distribution systems to meet the ever-growing demand for energy. However, global disruptions, including geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and extreme weather events, have significantly impacted the stability and efficiency of energy supply chains. This study examines the effects of these disruptions through case studies and provides insights into strategies for enhancing resilience and adaptability in the energy sector. Key disruptions analyzed include the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused unprecedented logistical bottlenecks, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which highlighted vulnerabilities in energy dependency and supply diversification. Additionally, climate-related events such as hurricanes and floods have strained infrastructure and disrupted operations. The study identifies recurring themes, such as the need for diversification of supply sources, investment in renewable energy, and the implementation of advanced digital technologies for risk management. A major focus is placed on the role of digital transformation in mitigating disruption impacts. Tools like blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) are shown to enhance real-time tracking, predictive maintenance, and decision-making. Policy frameworks and international collaboration also emerge as critical factors in addressing global disruptions, particularly for regions heavily reliant on energy imports. The findings highlight the importance of proactive strategies, such as building robust contingency plans, fostering regional cooperation, and accelerating the transition to renewable energy systems. Case studies of countries and companies that successfully navigated recent disruptions underscore the effectiveness of these approaches. Looking ahead, the study outlines a future outlook where energy supply chains leverage emerging technologies, prioritize sustainability, and integrate geopolitical risk assessments into operational planning. These measures will be essential for ensuring energy security and resilience in an increasingly uncertain global environment.</jats:p>"

In this work, two index systems for evaluating the water supply capacity (WSC) and the water infrastructure construction level (WICL) were constructed; the water resource utilization efficiency (WRUE) was measured by applying a super slack-based measure model; the ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models were used to explore the heterogeneity of spatial relationships. The results showed that both WSC (0.15~0.67) and WRUE (0.25~1.18) had spatial heterogeneity. WSC was positively correlated with water resource accessibility and GDP per capita (R2 = 0.406, p &lt; 0.01), which represented water resource endowment and economic development, respectively. WRUE was positively correlated with GDP per capita but was negatively correlated with accessibility (R2 = 0.654, p &lt; 0.01). The relationship of WICL with accessibility and GDP per capita varied over the study’s area. We found that the WSC in the southeast, WRUE in the north and WICL in the south were mainly associated with water resource endowments. The WSC in the north, WRUE in the southwest and WICL in the north were mainly associated with the economic development level. Noteworthily, strengthening the construction of water conservancy is one of the effective ways to improve water supply. Suggestions on improving WSC and WRUE were provided based on different accessibility and economic conditions, to promote the sustainable development of water resources.</jats:p>"

Still, it has yet to achieve operational stability, in part due to the variation in the moisture content of the woodchips used as fuel. In this study, a technical and economic evaluation was performed to establish a center for the efficient production of high-quality dry woodchips within a sawmill and to determine the technical characteristics and economic viability of a system using gasification CHP, wood waste-fired boilers or an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as heat sources. The results showed that the net present values (NPVs) of gasified CHP, wood waste-fired boilers and ORC were −186 million, −402 million, and −103 million JPY, respectively. None of them were deemed profitable. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of low-quality wood prices, dry woodchips, heavy oil A, and the grid electricity charge on the NPV. The improvement of the low-quality wood price and dry woodchips sales price was effective for heat supply by gasification CHP and ORC turbines, and their combination was effective for woodchip-fired boilers.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, leather, an extraordinary example of valorization and conversion of a putrescible and polluting material, has a much longer use life than its substitutes and a far more favorable degradative fate for the environment. The war in Ukraine and the consequent repercussions on the international market are likely to further exacerbate the historic need for raw materials (crude and semi-finished) of the European and, in particular, of the Italian tanning industry; and tanneries in non-European (Asian and South American) countries, given the greater availability of raw hides and skins, could take advantage of this to reduce the competitiveness of EU tannery in the markets. So worrisome is the situation that one of the world's most important associations of tanning industrialists, the National Union of the Tanning Industry (UNIC-Unione Nazionale Industria Conciaria), in agreement with the European Confederation of Tanners (COTANCE), has planned, in the first months of the year 2022, to request the European Commission to limit the export of European raw/semi-processed hides and skins outside the EU borders.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: It is nowadays believed that the effective implementation of the principles of sustainable development in companies requires cooperation in entire supply chains. Companies are guided by various motivators and face various barriers to the implementation of sustainable supply chain practices (SSCPs); however, so far, no attention has been given to examining the relationship between them. Thus, the aim of the paper is to examine such relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the results of a survey conducted on a sample of 500 companies. The aim of the paper is achieved by examining Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Findings: In most cases, a positive correlation is observed between the motivators for and barriers to SSCPs implementation. Additionally, such dependence occurs more often for external motivators, compared to internal motivators. Research implications: The activities supporting the implementation of SSCPs should concentrate on strengthening internal motivators in companies (e.g., by propagating relevant knowledge) as well as overcoming internal barriers. The importance of external motivators seems to be reduced by the coexistence of barriers. Originality/value: This paper contributes to supply chain and sustainable development literature by identifying a positive correlation between motivators for and barriers to SSCPs implementation. Such a finding may be important to policymakers, as it suggest that concentrating merely on motivating companies to implement sustainability principles may not be sufficient if it is not accompanied by barrier-breaking mechanisms.</jats:p>"

Assessing the environmental performance of food companies is essential to provide a comprehensive view of the production processes and gain insight into improvement options, but such a tool is currently non-existent in the literature. This study proposed a tool based on the life cycle assessment methodology focused on six stages of the food chain, raw materials acquisition, supplier, manufacturing, distribution, retail and wastes. The user can also evaluate the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to reduce food waste applied in the real-world problems. The tool was validated through a case study of a food manufacturing company that prepares frozen meals via vending machines. The LCA results provided by the tool showed that food raw materials production is the main hotspot of nine impact categories. The IoT technologies’ contribution increased the company’s impact by around 0.4%. However, it is expected that employing these monitoring technologies would prevent food waste generation and the associated environmental impacts. Therefore, the results of this paper provide evidence that the proposed tool is suitable for determining environmental impacts and savings of food supply chain companies.</jats:p>"

This study focused on Kitui Town in Kenya where about 80% of the inhabitants depend on Masinga-Kitui water supply system. There are limited alternative water sources including groundwater that are not reliable due high contamination with coliforms. The aim of this study was to determine bacteriological quality of Masinga-Kitui water and establish the potential sources of contaminants.Methods: A total of 90 water samples were collected for analysis whereby, 72 were from the households’ water storage facilities selected through stratified purposive sampling technique. Additional 18 samples were representatively collected from the main distribution network/including two community water points located in Kitui Town (Kalundu and Bondeni). Water quality analysis was performed at Kenya Water Institute water laboratory in Nairobi.Results: All the analyzed water samples were grossly contaminated with E. coli and total Coliforms which exceeded the acceptable WHO/KEBS limit of zero (0) CFU/100 ml of water sample. Majority of the Kitui Town residents associated poor water quality with poor sanitation, poor waste management, poorly maintained sewage and waste waters, contamination of water at the main distribution tank at Kwa-Ngindu, poor water storage at the household and unhygienic practices. About 34% of Kitui residents were at the risk of contracting waterborne diseases due to consumption of contaminated water.Conclusions: Regular monitoring of water quality, surveillance of Masinga-Kitui water infrastructure, and enhanced awareness programme should be adopted to encourage Kitui residents to treat drinking water. </jats:p>"

Due to the great differences in geographical location, degree of development and resource endowment, the rural energy consumption scene is complex and changeable, and the energy structure configuration has problems such as single scene, poor flexibility and applicability. Therefore, this paper first puts forward the development scenario of rural energy differentiation; Then, based on the classification of rural energy development differentiation scenarios, a multi-objective planning weight allocation model is established for the three goals of economy, environmental protection and energy conservation when the system is running; Finally, in order to verify the superiority of this model, three typical rural areas are selected for verification, and the flexible and adaptive rural comprehensive energy optimal allocation results of the travel alienation scenario are obtained respectively. The simulation results show that the optimal allocation method can achieve the purpose of adapting different target weights through scene differences to configure the equipment capacity of rural integrated energy system, so as to meet the purpose of rural energy supply and demand allocation in differentiated scenes, and better achieve economy, environmental protection and energy conservation.</jats:p>",

Previously, its effect on the river community is considered to be stronger in summer, whereas weaker in winter when terrestrial invertebrates are less abundant. The movement of the terrestrial earthworms is triggered in winter, so they may be supplied to winter rivers as terrestrial resource pulse, but little is known about it. Here, we report that the massive numbers of the terrestrial earthworms were supplied intensively to an upstream of the small river in early winter. In particular, we found large numbers of megascolecid earthworms were supplied in an upstream of the small river in Northern Japan. Furthermore, we observed that supplied earthworms were consumed by salmonid fish species (masu salmon, white spotted char and rainbow trout) and aquatic invertebrates (gammarid amphipod, planarian flatworm, and stonefly larvae). These findings suggest that the terrestrial earthworms may play a key role in ecosystem functioning in winter when severe and other resources are scarce.</jats:p>",

According to the characteristics of the model, a large system decomposition aggregation dynamic programming (DADP) method is proposed to transform the N + 1 dimensional dynamic programming problem into a N + 1 one-dimensional dynamic programming problem for solution. In addition, this study also uses the real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) and DADP to compare the algorithms, and discusses the performance of the two algorithms from the optimization of the algorithm and the applicability of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

Photocatalysis has been shown to be successful in the removal of intractable chemicals and is regarded as a viable wastewater treatment technology. This work focused on the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine-B (RB) in an aqueous solution, as well as the photocatalytic behavior of niobium pentaoxide (Nb2O5) as a photocatalyst was tested. It is important to note that good photocatalytic efficiency is highly dependent on the operating conditions. There are several process parameters that influence RB photocatalytic degradation, including the amount of photocatalyst (Nb2O5) used, the concentration of RB at the start of the reaction, and the pH of the solution optimized under visible-light irradiation. According to the findings, the conditions in which the greatest amount of RB was degraded were those in which the concentration of the catalyst was 10 mg/l, the dosage of the catalyst was 1 mg/l, and the pH was 11. The results also revealed that after utilizing the catalyst three times in a row, catalyst efficiency was maintained, and the degradation rate was maintained at a greater level.</jats:p>",

Agent technology may greatly aid in decision-making during supply chain management. Due to recent changes in the seasons, fashion trends, and the requirements of various religions, particularly with regard to the ordering procedure, the supply chain for clothing has become one of the most difficult duties in this area. Because of this, it is crucial to enhance process coordination throughout the whole clothing supply chain and develop a decision-making strategy that functions best in a fluid environment. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used in this work to define the relationship between agents and simulate the supply chain process. This research incorporates enhanced African vulture optimizer, a modified bio-inspired approach, and fuzzy inference theory to assist the supply chain agent in determining the appropriate replenishment quantity and reorder point to lower the inventory cost. According to test results, the suggested AAVO-based technique may be successful in determining a target demand ordering amount while reducing the overall cost of the supply chain due to a lowered convergence trend and algorithm accuracy.</jats:p>"

Startups são consideradas empresas nascentes de base tecnológica, que atuam em um ambiente de incertezas, buscando tornar seu modelo de negócio repetível e escalável. Assim, o SC é um meio importante para coordenar o processo operacional (ciclo de vida) de startups (Walley, 2007; Rusko, 2011).  Os resultados demonstram, além de diversidade quanto a autoria dos trabalhos,  dois campos a priori de pesquisa. Um com olhar sobre o impacto das restrições financeiras, principalmente em empresas iniciantes, na coordenação da cadeia de suprimentos. O outro, com um olhar sobre a orientação empreendedora e modelo de negócio. O estudo contribui na compreensão da necessidade da busca de mais teorização e exploração da SC dentro do domínio de Startups.

Here, the effect of boiling on different kinds of iron particles (including loose deposits from the DWDS and their main components FeOOH, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4) was studied. At 10 mg/L, the turbidity values before/after boiling of Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and FeOOH were 134.00/121.00, 25.07/21.22, and 120.40/114.20 NTU, respectively. All the particles had a lower degree of crystallinity after boiling. After boiling, the number of particles in loose deposits increased and the particle size decreased, while iron oxides were on the contrary. Among the three iron oxides, the existence of Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 had different effects on disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. The activity of microorganisms was the highest under particle concentration of 0.1 mg/L than other concentrations for all the particles, but the total microbiological risks were still very low after boiling. Thus, the boiling treatment would increase the turbidity and risks of the particles. As the particle concentration under low concentration is hard to find, this risk is also hard to find.</jats:p>",

This project addresses several processes: how to create verifiable descriptions of components and platforms, which may be done by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), platform integrators, and even information technology (IT) departments how to verify devices and components within the single transaction between an OEM and a customer how to verify devices and components at subsequent stages in the system life cycle in the operational environment.

In this significant and original contribution, the authors examine a leading procurement model, the Australian Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR), for the purpose of examining whether the CPR model satisfies the necessary standards of Legal Certainty and Effectiveness for addressing the risk of trafficking occurring in public sector supply chains. The research generates new insights for countries seeking to tackle trafficking via public procurement systems and identifies pitfalls for countries to avoid if seeking to emulate the Australia CPR model, making appropriate reference to US and UK models where appropriate. The authors demonstrate how key elements of the CPR model fail to provide for the required degree of Legal Certainty and Effectiveness to tackle trafficking. System failure is demonstrated by analysis of the CPR, showing either how key CPR provisions fail to satisfy these 2 key tests, or because there is a complete absence of appropriate provisions to comprehensively deal with the risk of trafficking in public sector supply chains. This article should serve not only as a guide to countries yet to address human rights considerations in their public procurement supply chains, but also as a blueprint for countries around the world seeking to re-evaluate whether existingprovisions in their domestic procurement frameworks are fit to tackle the global scourge of trafficking in public supply chains.</jats:p>",

This paper studied the most relevant social impacts of the textile industry and how appropriately textile companies manage these social impacts, in order to achieve greater social sustainability in global supply chains. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether companies belonging to the textile product lifecycle identify and manage social impacts in keeping with the most relevant social hotspots in the supply chain of the textile industry. A consistency analysis was conducted based on the management of social indicators at the company level (identified through the analysis of contents of their sustainability reporting) connected with social impact categories defined in the Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of products provided by the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, and on the technical results obtained by the textile sector through the Social Hotspots Database. The results showed a predominant inconsistency between the main social hotspots of the textile industry showed in the footprint analysis and the social indicators specifically reported by the sector. This paper contributes to the literature about what sustainability management implies along global supply chains, emphasizing the need to advance in a consistent and science-based integration of social hotspots at the sectoral level and social management practices at the company level. In addition, the study could be relevant for companies belonging to complex and global supply chains, since it contributes towards enhancing the knowledge of science-based methodologies, as social life cycle assessments, for identifying, managing, and reporting their social hotspots.</jats:p>"

In response to changing hydrology, their altered hydraulics will significantly impact future glacifluvial erosion and proglacial channel development. This study analysis proglacial channel evolution processes at the foreland of Austria’s biggest glacier Pasterze by predicted runoff until 2050. A high-resolution digital elevation model was created by an unmanned aerial vehicle, channel bathymetry was sampled, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic-numerical model was generated, and bedload transport formulas were used to calculate the predicted transport capacity of the proglacial river. Due to the fine sediment composition near the glacier terminus (d50 &lt; 49.6 mm), the calculation results underline the process of headward erosion in the still unaffected, recently deglaciated river section. In contrast, an armor layer is already partly established by the coarse grain size distribution in the already incised river section (d50 &gt; 201 mm). Furthermore, already occurring exposed non-fluvial grain sizes combined with decreasing flow competence in the long term are indicators for erosion-resistant pavement layer formation and landform decoupling in the vertical direction. The presented study clearly shows that subsystems of ‘developed channels’ exhibiting pavement formation of non-fluvial deposits are found at the investigated glacier foreland. Thus, an extension accompanied by a refinement of the fluvial system in the sediment cascade approach was developed as a central result.\n                        </jats:p>"

Situasi yang sama pun terjadi di lingkungan PT AMMAN Mineral Nusa Tenggara (disebut PT AMNT) dimana perusahaan masih terus berupaya untuk menyeimbangkan permintaan air tawar dan pasokannya khususnya sehubungan dengan beberapa proyek ekspansi besar yang sedang berlangsung di Batu Hijau. Terdapat beberapa peningkatan permintaan air tawar apakah untuk kegiatan konstruksi maupun operasional di masa mendatang untuk mengakomodasi kebutuhan penambahan tenaga kerja, fasilitas-fasilitas baru, dan tambahan air proses. Saat ini, PT AMNT masih mengoperasikan sumur-sumur air tanah di cekungan air tanah Sejorong dengan rata-rata produksi harian sebanyak 9.000-m3/hari dimana proyek-proyek ekspansi besar ini membutuhkan tambahan air tawar hingga 4.500-m3/hari yang akan dipasok dari sumber-sumber air yang baru di luar fasilitas eksisting untuk menghindari pengambilan air tanah yang berlebihan. Pada akhirnya, teknologi desalinasi menjadi solusi alternatif sebagai pilihan terbaik dan menjanjikan dalam wawasan keberlanjutan setelah PT AMNT melakukan berbagai rencana untuk dapat mencadangkan sumberdaya air tanah.</jats:p>"

The evaluation and selection of suppliers is a complicated and common multi‐criteria decision‐making challenge. Supplier selection becomes more difficult and unpredictable as a result of the necessity for human judgment in many areas of supplier selection, such as preferences for alternatives or supplier qualities. The objective of the study was to evaluate various large cardamom supply chains based on various supply chain quality parameters. The proposed selection strategy used fuzzy logic to identify the best acceptable supplier as well as rank the various supply chain parameters. The major steps of supply chain evaluation by fuzzy modeling involve the calculation of triplets for the score of various supply chains, calculation of triplets for the score of supply chain quality attributes, and calculation of overall membership function on a standard fuzzy scale. The results revealed that the proposed fuzzy logic method was well suited as a decision‐making tool for supplier evaluation. The assessment of various supply chains showed that the best supply chain management method included material moving from producers to consumers through aggregators, commission agents, wholesalers, and retailers. Comparing the overall similarity values of each chosen supply chain, customer satisfaction was ranked top among the quality attributes of the supply chain, followed by external and internal support, internal performance, and strategic and operational coordination. Consumers monitoring the performance of the supply chain can assist in information acquisition, influence the behavior of supply chain participants, and enhance overall performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Practical application</jats:title><jats:p>Selecting a suitable large cardamom supply chain would provide a solution for regulating the flow of products and information across the supply chain network. Implementing fuzzy logic for preferred supplier selection has a significant impact on the financial perspective. In the fuzzy logic for a large cardamom supply chain, fuzzy sets or membership functions were employed to express input space to output space. Fuzzification was used to transform a vector of crisp input data acquired from a study of a large cardamom supply chain into a vector of equivalent input language variables. The fuzzy output variables are defuzzified in the defuzzification process, and the fuzzy variables are turned into crisp values or crisp output vectors.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The article identifies the main actors in the supply chains of major crops such as grains, sunflower seeds and vegetables. The study of supply chains in crop production covers three periods: (i) pre COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) the 2020-2021 COVID pandemic; and (iii) post-Russian invasion into Ukraine in 2022. The findings confirm that supply chains for vegetables were significantly and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the supply chains for production and sales of grains and sunflower seeds in Ukraine remained relatively stable. Through its global impact on the commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions, Russia's war against Ukraine is aggravating the slowdown in global economic growth. The article identifies the negative consequences of this war for both Ukraine and the world as a whole based on the example of major agricultural crops. The development of crop production industry in Ukraine requires that supply chains be restructured based on the new logistical solutions adapted to the conditions of martial law.</jats:p>",

Hence, multiple researchers have proposed control strategies aiming to improve the efficiency of systems using pneumatic drives. However, most of those developments increase the system complexity and commissioning efforts, which hinders a broad application. This paper presents alternatively a simple to implement energy‐saving measure, which relies on a novel energy‐saving speed controller.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the European Union having set ambitious environmental policy targets, company executives face mounting pressure to reach their sustainability goals. While expanding the contract-management process's utilization may hold promise for accelerating sustainable development throughout the contract lifecycle (from the pre-award through the post-award phase), the literature has afforded it little attention. Building on contingency theory and a qualitative multiple-case-study method, the paper examines how the contract-management process could proactively enhance the necessary shift to environmentally sustainable supply chains. Further, the authors explore whether contract management as a contingency variable could exert a positive influence on the sustainability practices followed in supply-chain relationships and, thereby, on sustainability performance. The preliminary findings indicate that, while expanded utilization of contract management remains modest, it already shows potential as a future success factor for companies on their journey of transformation in pursuit of sustainable supply-chain relationships. As a contingency factor, contract management might be able to make an impact by embedding sustainability in the contract process from the supplier-selection phase onward while also contributing to the final contract's solid inclusion of sustainability-related duties for the parties, whether in the main contract or via appendices. Accordingly, the authors suggest multiple, parallel avenues for future development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Market patterns and conditions can affect the economic value of fishery commodities; hence, they can contribute to postharvest losses. This paper primarily aims to provide information on the magnitude of losses incurred from changes in market supply and demand of economically important fishery commodities. Assessed capture commodities in selected landing sites and wet markets recorded an estimated loss of 3.98% and 0.44%, respectively. The total financial loss incurred in both supply chains amounted to PHP 480,160. Estimation of losses per commodity showed that landed sardines obtained the highest loss at 6.86%. This can be attributed to the oversupply of catch at the end of the closure period, leading to a drastic decrease in market prices. Minimal losses were documented in aquaculture at 0.33% and 0.23% for landing and trading, respectively, amounting to PHP 26,541. While lower retail prices could be beneficial to consumers, it could lead to a loss of revenue for fisherfolk. The government should, therefore, take measures to curb price collapses associated with market dynamics through Value Chain Analysis, the establishment of market linkages between producers and consumers, price regulating mechanisms such as the suggested retail price that should be area and species-specific, the establishment of cold storage and commercial-scale ice production facilities in strategic places, utilization of fish and fishery resources through the application of low-cost processing technologies, and provision of livelihood support to small-scale fisherfolk. These initiatives will ensure equitable benefit sharing from the fisheries industry and reduce postharvest losses and wastes across the supply chain in pursuit of food security.</jats:p>",

Derive a relationship that will predict the indoor air temperature setting of the room that is being heated as a result of changes in the operating characteristics of the water heating systems. In basis the solution to the problem of determining the temperature in the room by changing the performance characteristics of the water heating system is based on the basic equations of hydraulics and heat transfer such as Darcy-Weisbach equation to determine the hydraulic losses in the network; flow continuity equation; equation to determine the heat flux from the coolant to the walls of the heater; equation for determining the heat transfer of the heater. The resulting dependence makes it possible to predict the setting of the indoor air temperature in the room heated as a result of changes in the operating characteristics of the water heating systems. This dependence will allow at the design stage and in the process of operation of water heating systems to predict changes in the indoor air temperature in order to take measures to stabilize it. The predicted indoor air temperature is theoretically determined based on basic equations of hydraulics and heat exchange with variable operational characteristics of the water heating system network. The obtained results of indoor air temperature prediction calculations show that the parameters of the indoor microclimate change due to changes in the operational characteristics of water heating systems (changes in coolant consumption, hydraulic characteristics of pipelines). This approach will allow you to make decisions to improve the reliability of water heating systems in the process of ensuring the parameters of the microclimate in the room.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of urbanization, it is an important goal for urban green space (UGS) to meet the needs of residents’ production and life using a supply–demand evaluation method of ecosystem service (ES). However, most studies have considered all functional types of UGS as the supply side, or rely solely on a single supply or demand side to conduct ecosystem service function (ESF) evaluation, resulting in less accurate and targeted research findings. As a result, a novel methodological framework for matching each ESF with corresponding functional types of UGS, and considering both supply and demand sides have been required. Firstly, the object-oriented approach combining support vector machine (SVM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to automatically identify UGS, and integrated Point of Interest (POI), urban built-up area, road land, parcel, and socio-economic data to classify six functional types of UGS using the near-convex-hull. Next, matching the functional types of UGS with five ESFs, both supply and demand status were evaluated using the carbon sequestration and release analysis, Gaussian two-step floating catchment area, and spatial equilibrium degree methods. This method was demonstrated in Beijing, China. The results show: (1) the ES supply–demand situation provided by each functional type of UGS is different in five ESFs; (2) considering both supply and demand is more intuitive to see whether the city’s demand for UGS has been met. Our results provide a new perspective for evaluating the contribution of UGS and have practical implications for UGS planning.</jats:p>"

The growth of multichannel retailing in connection with the recent surge in on-line ordering, has forced the logistics industry to evaluate current transportation practices and make innovative adjustments.  In our work, we reflect on the changes to motor carrier transportation over time through the lens of regulation. Concerns about rates, entry to markets, and the safety of carriers were common around the Great Depression. Policy makers took notice and imposed economic and social regulation. Motor carrier strategies changed to meet these new policies and the motor carrier industry settled into decades of stability.  Midway through the 20th century many began to question the efficiency of the industry. Entry was difficult, rates were considered high, but safety issues were of little concern at the time. Deregulation became widely popular with policy makers, and the industry changed its strategies again to comply with deregulated policies.  Today, technology has become a prominent tool for all. Together, e-Commerce, Omni-Channel Distribution, Last Mile Delivery and Gig Delivery are poised to change motor carrier practices again. So, where does the industry go from here? Some think that it is headed back to economic and social regulation policies of the past.  We examine the impact of previous legislation on the transportation industry, specifically motor carriers, which led to deregulation of motor carriers in the 1990’s. Considering the growth of on-line sales, we attempt to look forward, using the past, to hypothesize how they may operate in the future.</jats:p>",

Business in the field of coffee farming has a long and complicated supply chain that is often encountered from upstream to downstream and is also one of the obstacles in developing business in the Arabica coffee sector. The success of sustainable rural agricultural development in Indonesia is very important so that the expected results can ultimately contribute to the country’s economic stability and support the country’s economic growth. Indonesia’s agricultural sector has played a major role in supporting the country’s stability, as well as in improving quality and production to meet the growing national food needs. Thus, agricultural development efforts are focused on increasing production levels through land expansion and agricultural intensification. The increasing adoption of sustainable agriculture is attracting the attention of governments and farmers, especially companies and end consumers, with the increasing awareness of sustainability in agriculture which has become the concern of the global market, many producers are competing to improve their products from year to year. On the one hand, the benefits of sustainable agriculture can also be seen from consumer interest, starting with an increasing preference for environmentally friendly products and services. On the other hand, the enthusiasm of several parties in establishing relationships with other companies that have implemented sustainable agriculture programs is an effective and good way in agriculture.</jats:p>",

Being the third deep-water port in Pakistan, it plays a significant role in trade between the Gulf States, Africa, UAE, and CARs. The load shedding of 12–16 h in Gwadar is the most concerning issue due to the non-availability of a utility grid, which is why the Pakistan imports 70 MW of electricity from Iran to fulfill Gwadar’s electricity needs. Gwadar has renewable energy resources that can be utilized for electricity generation. However, wind and solar systems were only installed for limited residential areas. Considering this scenario, a technological and economic analysis was performed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software. Three models were considered in this study. Model 1 consisted of photovoltaic (PV) cells, wind turbines, converters, and batteries. Model 2 consisted of PV cells, wind turbines, converters, and a grid. Model 3 consisted of PV cells, wind turbines, converters, and diesel generators. The annual energy generated by Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 was respectively 57.37 GWh, 81.5 GWh, and 30.4 GWh. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 was respectively USD 0.401/kWh, USD 0.0347/kWh, and USD 0.184/kWh. The simple payback period of Model 1 was 6.70 years, the simple payback period of Model 2 was 7.77 years and the simple payback period of Model 3 was 4.98 years. Because Model 3 had the lowest Net Present Cost NPC, its payback period was also less than those of the other two. However, Model 2 had the lowest LCOE and its renewable fraction was 73.3%. These facts indicate that Model 2 is the optimal solution.</jats:p>"

Firstly, in order to improve the performance of MOA, an improved mayfly optimization algorithm with an adaptive visibility coefficient (AVC-IMOA) is introduced. Secondly, AVC-IMOA is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of a BPANN (AVC-IMOA_BP). Thirdly, the trained BPANN and the statistical data are adopted to predict the pork supply in Heilongjiang Province from 2000 to 2020. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for predicting pork supply, the pork supply in Heilongjiang Province was predicted by using AVC-IMOA_BP, a BPANN based on the gradient descent method and a BPANN based on a mixed-strategy whale optimization algorithm (MSWOA_BP), a BPANN based on an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC_BP) and a BPANN based on a firefly algorithm and sparrow search algorithm (FASSA_BP) in the literature.

As a financing method of the supply chain, can credit sales effectively promote enterprises’ green technology innovation? This paper constructs an evolutionary game model between upstream and downstream enterprises. Firstly, the interaction between credit sales and green technology innovation is explored through an evolutionary equilibrium analysis. Secondly, the influencing factors of credit sales and green technology innovation decisions are analyzed through a numerical simulation. The study found that: (1) Under the condition of evolutionary equilibrium, the credit sales of upstream enterprises and the green technology innovation of downstream enterprises can form a virtuous circle mode of “financing—income generation—benefit sharing”. That is, a win-win situation can be achieved through the internal circulation of the supply chain. (2) Profit distribution is one of the key issues in the game between upstream and downstream enterprises. The willingness of upstream enterprises to provide credit sales and downstream enterprises to carry out green technology innovation is positively related to the benefits they enjoy from green technology innovation. (3) The supervision cost is an obstacle for upstream enterprises’ credit sales. A practical and inexpensive account recovery guarantee mechanism is an effective way to improve the willingness of upstream enterprises to provide credit sales. (4) The government’s green subsidy is beneficial to the whole supply chain’s “credit sales—green technology innovation” mode, which not only directly stimulates downstream enterprises’ green technology innovation but also stimulates upstream enterprises’ credit sales through benefit sharing. This paper enriches the relevant research on green technology innovation of the supply chain and provides a reference for green technology innovation and financing interaction between upstream and downstream enterprises.</jats:p>"

Profit growth rate, as a measure of an enterprise’s development ability, can intuitively reflect the change in operating profit for food enterprises. The accurate prediction of profit growth rate can provide a decision-making reference for enterprises in planning business objectives in the next stage. However, many factors affect the profit variation of a company, and it is hard to make accurate predictions using traditional statistical economics forecasting methods. Since the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model can capture nonlinear relationships in time series analysis, we propose an LSTM-based model to predict the profit growth rate of enterprises by using the operational data of four seasons ahead. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of supply chain integrity on enterprise operations is increasing. We introduce the information of the supply chain owned by the enterprise to predict the profit growth rate of the enterprise. The result of our model exhibits high prediction accuracy, which indicates that our model could provide practical guidance for companies’ production and operation activities.</jats:p>",

The AC structures and functional groups were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The efficiency of prepared AC has been investigated in the removal of Reactive Red 2 (RR2) from an aqueous solution. The effect of main variables, namely dye concentration (100–500 mg L−1), contact time (10–90 min), adsorbent dosage (0.25–12.25 g L−1), and initial pH (3–11) have been assessed on the adsorption process in order to find out the optimum conditions. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin adsorption isotherm models were applied to describe the characteristics of adsorption behavior. Kinetic data were fitted to pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-particle diffusion models. Based on the results, the highest removal efficiency (97.96%) of RR2 dye was obtained at an initial concentration of 100 mg L−1, adsorbent dose of 12.25 g, contact time of 90 min, and pH 3, which indicated a significant sorption efficiency. The rate of the adsorption fitted well to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2 = 0.99). In addition, the Temkin adsorption isotherm model was found to fit the experimental data (R2 = 0.99).</jats:p>",

Thus, as the core player, ports can integrate with inland logistics providers to improve the efficiency and resilience of maritime supply chains. This study examines the strategic options of two competing maritime supply chains consisting of ports and inland logistics providers. We investigate the impact of cooperation between ports and inland logistics providers and government regulation on the maritime supply chain by comparing members’ optimal pricing and overall social welfare under centralized, decentralized, and hybrid scenarios. Results indicate that the hybrid scenario is an equilibrium strategy for maritime supply chain, although this strategy is not optimal for governments seeking to improve supply chain resilience and maximize social welfare. Furthermore, observations show that through government economic intervention, both seaborne supplies can be incentivized to adopt an integrated strategy, and business and society can achieve a win–win situation.</jats:p>",

Rapid economic changes and increasing competitive pressure in global markets have led companies to pay special attention to their supply chains. As a result, in this research, a mathematical model is proposed to minimize closed loop supply chain costs taking into account environmental effects. Thus, suppliers first send wood as raw materials from forests to factories. After processing the wood and turning it into products, the factories send the wood to retailers. The retailers then send the products to the customers. Finally, customers send returned products to recovery centers. After processing the products, the recovery centers send their products to the factories. The considered innovations include: designing a supply chain of wood products regarding environmental effects, customizing the genetic solution approach to solve the proposed model 3-Considering the flow of wood products and determining the amount of raw materials and products sent and received.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With a mortality rate of 1 % to 5 %, surgical treatment of cardiac myxomas (CM) may be complicated by the development of intra- or postoperative bleeding, among other things.&#x0D;\nThe aim. To present an unusual case of surgical treatment of left atrial myxoma with the occurrence of intraoperative bleeding, which was due to extremely rare features of the coronary circulation with a special blood supply to the base of the CM.&#x0D;\nCase report. Female patient R., 65 years old, case record No.3686, was admitted to the National Amosov Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine with diagnosis of CM. Coronary angiography revealed unique features of coronary circulation: an arteriovenous malformation from the distal parts of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery with discharge into the right parts of the heart was revealed. On 9/20/2022, urgent operation of resection of the myxoma of the left atrium (LA) was performed. After removal of the myxoma and sealing of the heart, accumulation of arterial blood was found in the area of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the interatrialsulcus. Revision of the left atrium cavity was performed again:all intracardiac sutures in the area of the myxoma base were duplicated. After repeated resealing of the heart chambers, bleeding from the IVC region stopped after administration of protamine sulfate and tight tamponade of the space under the IVC. Tampons were removed from the pericardial cavity after 72 hours.&#x0D;\nResults. The source of the bleeding could be the site of the malformation of the coronary arteries, which is a tangle of small vessels located in the projection of the base of the myxoma below the point where the IVC meets the right atrium. During the histological examination of the myxoma, large full-blood vessels of the sinusoidal type were revealed, around which, due to damage to their thin walls, hematomas formed, giving the tumor a spotted appearance. The peculiarity of this tumor was the presence of a very large vascular plexus at its base; it had the appearance of a cluster of sections of numerous, different-sized, deformed and remodeled arteries. These data were confirmed by coronary angiography.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Studying the data of coronary angiography with the analysis offeatures of localization of coronary arteries, as well as the presence of possible coronary malformations, can provide information that allows predicting the possibility of their damage, especially in the case of localization in the place of possible surgical manipulation. In the event of bleeding, one of the optimal methods of its elimination is the use of long-term tamponade.</jats:p>"

For a comparative environmental assessment of renewable energy installations, it is necessary to take into account the emissions of the entire life cycle. Throughout the presented cycle from mining to the production of power plant structures and then the disposal of the facility, a significant part of CO2 emissions is present. The problem of dismantling and recycling of spent structures of wind power plants is becoming essential.

To assess the operating parameters of an isolated power supply system with renewable energy sources, this paper proposes to use the wavelet transform method. The Haar wavelet was used as a basic function in the paper. A mathematical model is presented that makes it possible to obtain a low-frequency (trend) component and a high-frequency component using the wavelet transform.

Consumption load as well as supply and availability of electricity to suppliers and customers is a major issue to be faced to have a balanced smart city power grid infrastructure. Balancing in this case is assumed as a well-designed supply chain management system to be applied in the Smart City (SC) of Athens, Greece. Core of such a system is the knowledge of electric power consumption load per weekly basis of a year, that is the granularity of the proposed system is one week of the system’s operation. In this paper, focus is given on the electric load forecast component of an Energy Management System (EMS) such as the Independent Power Transmission Operator (ITPO) of Greece. Concretely, stochastic data of electric energy consumption load are used to predict the demand or offering of electric power in the future. This is achieved by incorporating a machine learning second-order exponential smoothing algorithm. Such an algorithm is able to speculate near or far in the future power consumption load thus providing a promising parameter to predict smart city needs for electric power in the future. Adopted system is evaluated by the evaluation metric of Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), which assures that the system can be used for future predictions of electric power consumption load in smart cities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The adoption of blockchain technology (BCT) in a supply chain holds great potential for textile industries by executing transactions among stakeholders in a most reliable and verifiable way. Textile industries in emerging economies, like Pakistan, confront severe economic pressures and uncertain environment and strive to achieve sustainable supply chain excellence through blockchain implementation. This study is an initiative to analyze the key barriers in adopting BCT-related practices within the textile industry. This study conducts an extensive review of the literature using fuzzy Delphi approach for finalizing the barriers and applied fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for prioritizing the barriers under uncertain environment. Based on the extensive review of the literature and panel discussions with experts, a total of five main barriers and 21 sub-barriers were categorized and ranked. The results and findings prioritize technological and system-related barriers (TSB) first, and human resources and R&amp;D (HRB) barriers second among the other barrier dimensions. This paper highlights the need for an inclusive understanding of the various technological, environmental, and socio-economic perspectives to create blockchain applications that work for the textile sector. This study’s key findings and policy guidelines can assist concerned stakeholders in making strategic decisions for adopting BCT within the textile supply chain. The managerial implications are provided for the industrial decision-makers and policymakers aiming to integrate BCT into the supply chain processes. Presently, there exists no research in the context of Pakistan that highlights the challenges faced during the adoption of BCT in the supply chain. For this purpose, an approach in the form of an integrated model based on fuzzy set theory is developed. Finally, the robustness of the proposed model is checked through sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the requirements for high-quality development, the coordinated promotion of agricultural carbon emission reduction and agricultural product supply guarantee in China is crucial to hold the bottom line of national food security as well as promote agricultural green transformation and development. Based on such situation, from the perspective of decoupling effect, driving factors and the prediction, this paper uses panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020, takes the carbon emission formula, the “two-stage rolling” Tapio decoupling elasticity coefficient method, the spatial Durbin model and the Grey model optimized by the Simpson formula background value to quantify the relationship between agricultural carbon emission and agricultural product supply, analyze the driving effects of agricultural carbon emission reduction and agricultural product increase, and predict the decoupling state of agricultural carbon emission and agricultural product supply between 2021 and 2025, so as to draw a scientific basis that is conducive to the coordinated promotion of agricultural carbon emission reduction and agricultural product supply guarantee in China. The result shows that: (1) The decoupling state of agricultural carbon emission and agricultural product supply shows generally “the eastern and central regions are better than the western regions” in China, and the decoupling state has improved significantly year by year. Green technology innovation (GTI), agricultural carbon emission and agricultural product supply in China have significant spatial differences and spatial auto-correlation, which shows the spatial factors cannot be ignored; (2) Green technology innovation and agricultural carbon emission in local and adjacent provinces are both in an inverted “U-shaped” relationship, meaning that high level green technology innovation is an effective way to reduce carbon emission. Though green technology innovation and agricultural product supply in local and adjacent provinces are both in a positive “U-shaped” relationship, but the minimum value of lnGTI is greater than 0, which indicates that current level of green technology has been raised to a certain level, effectively improving the output of agricultural products; (3) Compared with those in 2016–2020 in China, it is projected that in 2021–2025 the decoupling state of agricultural carbon emission and agricultural product supply will be improved significantly, and the provinces below the optimal state will leave the extremely unreasonable strong negative decoupling state, mainly show recessionary decoupling and recessionary connection. Our findings provide Chinese decision-makers with corresponding references to formulate accountable and scientific regional policies in order to achieve high-quality development of agriculture and realize “Double carbon” target in China.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Distributing scarce resources such as COVID‐19 vaccines is often a highly time‐sensitive and mission‐critical operation. Our research was prompted by a significant obstacle that the United States and other nations encountered during the early months of the COVID‐19 vaccination campaign: Most COVID‐19 vaccines require two doses given 3 or 4 weeks apart. Given the severely limited supply and mounting pressure on many countries to reduce hospitalizations and mortality, how to effectively roll out two‐dose vaccines was a critical policy decision. In this paper, we first model and analyze inventory dynamics of the rollout process under three rollout strategies: (1) holding back second doses, (2) releasing second doses, and (3) stretching the lead time between doses. Then we develop an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model that incorporates COVID‐19 asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to evaluate these strategies in terms of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality. Among our findings, we show releasing second doses reduces infections but creates uneven vaccination patterns. In addition, to ensure second doses are given on time without holding back inventory, strictly less than half of the supply can be allocated to first‐dose appointments. Stretching the between‐dose lead time flattens the infection curve and reduces both hospitalizations and mortality compared with the strategy of releasing second doses. We also consider an alternative single‐dose vaccine with lower efficacy and show that the vaccine can be more effective than its two‐dose counterparts in reducing infections and mortality. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses related to age composition, risk‐based prioritization, supply disruptions, and disease transmissibility. Our paper provides important implications for policymakers to develop effective vaccine rollout strategies in developed and developing countries alike. More broadly, our paper sheds light on how to develop effective operations strategies for distributing time‐sensitive resources in times of crisis. </jats:p>",

The need for this flowline is fast moving but the problem that often occurs in companies is that the flowline needs cannot be fulfilled. Stock out on the 4-inch flowline pipe can cause a loss of production opportunity. To overcome the stock out, it is necessary to do proper inventory control. Forecasting the demand for the 4-inch flowline pipe using the ARIMA model to determine the amount of demand in the future period. After getting the number of requests, the requests are analyzed using the ADI-CV technique to see the demand pattern. The characteristics of the demand pattern are used to determine the appropriate type of inventory control. The result of the ADI value is 1 and the CV value is 0.04, so the demand pattern is smooth moving and uses the continuous review method. The continuous review method resulted in a total cost of Rp. 17,780,325,626, while the actual cost was Rp. 18,247,993,200. These results indicate that with inventory control, the proposed condition using the continuous review method can reduce inventory costs by Rp. 467,667,574 compared to actual conditions, and there is a saving of 2.56%. </jats:p>"

Globally, the Russian attack on Ukraine has caused the cost of gas to rise and fertilizer supplies to decline. This aggression may worsen the energy and wheat resource crisis in global supply chains. As a result of the escalation of hostilities, natural gas, oil, and coal prices have rapidly increased. In the years preceding the conflict, the agricultural sector had already begun to suffer, caused by unprecedented increases in the prices of natural gas and raw materials for the production of fertilizers stemming from Russian manipulation, especially in the gas market. Prior to the growing season, farmers were still unable to afford fertilizer prices. This situation will be exacerbated by the war. We can conclude from our results that European countries and the United States have high wheat production potential. Developed countries have significant nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer resources. Ukraine has a large yield gap, ranging between 4.5 and 7 Mg/ha. Wheat supply crises can be caused by tense geopolitical affairs, including military aggression and economic embargoes. Based on this, we recommend that decision-makers focus on crop quality to increase the country’s own production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Основной круг вопросов, составляющих содержание данной работы: рассмотрение структуры трансформаторного парка, системы электроснабжения судостроительного завода; результаты исследований, оценка и предложения по повышению эффективности трансформаторного парка завода. Электроснабжение судостроительного завода осуществляется от сети 110 кВ региональной энергосистемы через трансформаторную подстанцию 110/6 кВ.  От шин 6кВ подстанции 110/6 кВ через кабельные линии осуществляется электроснабжение цеховых трансформаторных подстанций напряжением 6/0,4 кВ. Таким образом, распределительные трансформаторы мощностью до 1600 кВА напряжением 6/0,4 кВ являются связующим звеном между электроприемниками и энергосистемой. Поэтому от эффективности работы этих трансформаторов во многом зависит качество электроэнергии у приемников электроэнергии, эффективность работы системы электроснабжения. Следует отметить старый трансформаторный парк системы электроснабжения судостроительного завода: 61,5 % работают более 40 лет; 11% - от 30 до 40 лет, оставшиеся - менее 5 лет. Новые трансформаторы, производимые трансформаторными заводами, по энергетическим характеристикам незначительно отличаются от производимых десятилетия ранее. В составе электроприемников завода значительную долю составляют искажающие нагрузки: сварочные аппараты, электротермические установки и гальванические ванны, светодиодные лампы и прочее, приводящие к искажению и несимметрии фазных напряжений. Показано, что использование трансформаторов со схемой соединения обмоток Δ/Y0 обеспечивает коэффициент несимметрии напряжений по нулевой последовательности на шинах цеховой подстанции 0,4 кВ согласно ГОСТ. Кардинальным решением по повышению энергоэффективности распределительных трансформаторов является их замена энергосберегающими на основе аморфных сплавов. Потери холостого хода трансформаторов на основе аморфных сплавов в восемь раз меньше, чем у трансформаторов с магнитопроводом на основе электротехнической стали, потери в обмотках - в два раза меньше. Снижение потерь энергии в трансформаторах на аморфных сплавах также приводит к снижению его нагрева, что следует из рассмотрения уравнения теплового баланса трансформатора. Цены на трансформаторы из аморфных сплавов значительно выше, чем на трансформаторы из электротехнической стали, поэтому производители вводят показатель «Минимизированная стоимость», складываемая из цены на данное электротехническое изделие и стоимости потерь электроэнергии в нём за нормативный срок его службы.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The main range of issues that make up the content of this work: consideration of the structure of the transformer park, the power supply system of the shipyard; research results, evaluation and proposals for improving the efficiency of the plant's transformer fleet. The shipyard is supplied with electricity from the 110 kV network of the regional power system through a 110/6 kV transformer substation. From the 6 kV buses of the 110/6 kV substation, through cable lines, the workshop transformer substations are supplied with a voltage of 6/0.4 kV. Thus, distribution transformers with a power of up to 1600 kVA with a voltage of 6/0.4 kV are the link between power receivers and the power system. Therefore, the quality of electricity at power receivers, the efficiency of the power supply system largely depends on the efficiency of these transformers. It should be noted the old transformer fleet of the shipyard's power supply system: 61.5% have been operating for more than 40 years; 11% - from 30 to 40 years, the rest - less than 5 years. New transformers produced by transformer plants differ little in terms of energy characteristics from those produced decades earlier. Distorting loads account for a significant proportion of the plant's electrical receivers: welding machines, electrothermal installations and galvanic baths, LED lamps, etc., leading to distortion and asymmetry of phase voltages. It is shown that the use of transformers with a winding connection scheme Δ/Y0 provides a zero-sequence voltage unbalance factor on the buses of a shop substation 0.4 kV according to GOST. The cardinal solution to improve the energy efficiency of distribution transformers is to replace them with energy-saving ones based on amorphous alloys. The no-load losses of transformers based on amorphous alloys are eight times less than those of transformers with a magnetic core based on electrical steel, the losses in the windings are two times less. Reducing energy losses in transformers based on amorphous alloys also leads to a decrease in its heating, which follows from the consideration of the heat balance equation of the transformer. Prices for transformers made of amorphous alloys are much higher than for transformers made of electrical steel, so manufacturers introduce the “Minimized cost” indicator, which is made up of the price of a given electrical product and the cost of electricity losses in it over its standard service life.</jats:p>",

To increase our theoretical understanding of this important relationship, this paper examines the extent to which supply chain managers perceive tensions and complementarities between both sets of practices. Using a paradox theory lens, the paper conducted in‐depth interviews with 31 supply chain managers in Western Europe and the Middle East that reveal a complex and multifaceted relationship. Namely, our findings indicate that some supply chain managers perceive the relationship as conflictive, others as synergistic, whereas a third group sees them as fundamentally orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, our findings uncover specific perceived complementarities and tension areas. Taken together, in responding to calls for research on the topic, our findings contribute to the advancement of theory regarding supply chain resilience and supply chain sustainability practices and address the need to shed more light on the tensions faced by supply chain managers when implementing distinct sets of supply chain practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Reservoir sedimentation is the gradual accumulation of the incoming sediment load from a river. With the increasing inappropriate usage of agricultural land, the amount of sediment is becoming larger due to erosion. This undesired outcome is supported by changing hydrological and climatological conditions within a river basin. Climate change has wide effects on all processes within the water cycle, which directly affects water resources. Water management in the future must be adapted for oncoming extremes accompanying climate change, such as floods or droughts. Therefore, sediment accumulation is a serious problem with severe consequences for water management, flood control and the production of energy. Unfortunately, sedimentation will be always a problem until anthropogenic activities (which are accompanied by topsoil erosion), such as overgrazing or deforestation, are strictly controlled. We analysed the effect of sedimentation on two reservoirs � Vranov and Znojmo � which are in the Czech Republic, near the border with Austria. The new measurement of each reservoir�s bottom was carried out in 2021 and 2022. Using ArcMap software, two digital models of the reservoir bottoms were developed. One model used the original measured data, and the other the new data from 2021. The storage-area-elevation curves were evaluated for both models and then compared. There was a storage loss of 7.7% for reservoir Vranov and 16.2% for reservoir Znojmo for the maximum operating water level. Since both reservoirs are water supply reservoirs and in cascade, their management has a large impact on the whole system of reservoirs. This impact was tested using a reservoir system model created in HEC-ResSim software, where the change in long-term mean streamflow was observed. The effect of reservoir storage loss was also analysed under conditions of climate change, where three different RCP scenarios were used to simulate climate change during the period from 2021 to 2060. Storage loss for both reservoirs had added an average 1.95% decrease in long-term mean streamflow to another decrease of 28.0% caused by climate change. </jats:p>",

The article outlines a three-tier food supply chain consisting of suppliers, manufacturers and retailers, based on a cooperative model in which manufacturers share the cost of emission reduction and retailers share the cost of freshness. The study finds that when the government grants the maximum amount of subsidies to the manufacturer, the government’s decision to reduce emissions, the government’s regulations to preserve freshness, and the government’s profits are not affected. The study found that when the government awarded the largest subsidy coefficient to manufacturers and the smallest subsidy coefficient to retailers, the non-specific one-off government subsidy model could lead to higher profits for suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers, increasing the amount of emission reduction while improving the preservation quality of food. When the government subsidy factor for manufacturers is minimal, the reduction in emissions is greater under the government’s dedicated abatement subsidy model but does not increase the freshness quality of the food; food supply chain players consistently produce higher levels of preservation effort and preservation quality under the government’s non-dedicated one-off subsidy model.</jats:p>"

Biomass is one of the most attractive sources of energy production, with positive effects on the economy, environment, and society, which can decrease the world's reliance on fossil fuels and deal with this universal challenge. Consequently, the biomass supply chain network design has received more attention in recent decades. Since energy and water are two significant sources for society's sustainable development and carbon emissions are essential for environmental health, the study of the water–energy–carbon (WEC) nexus is essential. In this study, a multiobjective multiperiod model for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on hybrid second‐generation (i.e., Jatropha, agricultural waste, and animal waste) and third‐generation (i.e., microalgae) biomasses is presented. The proposed multiobjective model consists of five objective functions that maximize the total energy produced and the number of jobs created and minimize the total water consumed, carbon emitted, and total costs. Case study results demonstrate the performance of the model utilizing the MINMAX goal programming approach. Based on the results, energy production from Jatropha is more appropriate in comparison with energy production from microalgae, agriculture waste, and animal waste. The findings also show that the proposed model in this research considering the WEC nexus performs significantly better than the classical model without considering the WEC nexus.</jats:p>",

Materials and methods. The object of the study was the activities of Pharmacy No. 173, a structural unit of the joint-stock company «Pharmacy» in the Tyumen region, indicators of all areas of preferential medication provision for citizens, including a new direction for providing people who have had acute cardiovascular diseases, the amount of funds allocated from the budgets of all levels for the provision of medication care , data from the regional Register of Persons, volumes of dispensed medicines for the preferential category, the number of secured prescriptions, their average cost. The following methods were used in the study: situational-logi- cal, content analysis, structural, system, computer technologies. Results. The directed activity of the pharmacy of finished dosage forms to ensure the availability of drug assistance to privileged categories of citizens, its social significance, the indicators for the number of secured prescriptions, the volume of dispensing of preferential drugs, including those who have had acute cardiovascular diseases, have been studied. Pharmacy of finished dosage forms, which carries out pharmaceutical activities in the retail trade of medicines for medical use, storage, dispensing of medicines, performs an important social function in dispensing medicines by prescription for free or with a 50% discount from the cost, includ- ing state social assistance (34, 04% of the total volume of dispensing), medications as a measure of social support in the treatment of certain diseases (58.63%), expensive drugs for the treatment of 14 nosologies (2.92%), certain drugs for the treatment of people who have had acute heart vascular diseases (4.41%). To perform this function of drug supply, a specialized pharmacy department was organized, equipped with a software product for recording incoming prescriptions, including in electronic form, for creating registers of issued prescriptions, and recording the movement of preferential drugs. The activities are carried out by pharmacists, pharmacists - technologists trained in consulting on the provision of social assistance to certain categories of citizens To comply with the regulatory and legal regulation of the provision of this activity, the standard operating procedure (SOP) «Dispensing med- icines to preferential categories of citizens» is applied. The standard operating procedure describes the step-by-step procedure for dispensing medicines on prescriptions of medical professionals to citizens who are entitled to receive free or discounted medicines. Conclusion. It should be noted the undoubtedly significant role of the pharmacy, pharmaceutical workers in the system of providing benefits in the field of drug provision. The significant role is due to the need to have knowledge of the procedure for granting ben- efits, competencies to comply with the special rules for dispensing a certain list of medicines to various categories of beneficiaries, the ability to master modern technologies for recording secured prescriptions for subsidized medicines, interacting with medical organizations in the unified state health information system (USIS Health). The professional performance of these functions in the Tyumen region largely contributes to the stability of indicators characterizing preferential drug provision, and the recognition of the social function of the pharmacy in the implementation of pharmaceutical activities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As coverage with improved water supply increases, those left behind are increasingly those most expensive to serve – households in remote areas and/or with low-density populations. Globally these are more and more resorting to their own solutions (self-supply) but in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) suffer from non-existent public and private sector services to ensure good standards. A few SSA countries are now developing such support services, realising that without including self-supply, universal coverage (SDG 6.1) cannot be achieved. Supporting self-supply cost-effectively leverages additional funds from households, builds up sustainable services with improved local technical and business skills for those by-passed by community water supplies (CWS). It is a complementary approach focussing on incremental improvements, rather than just a single donor-dependent solution. Piloting and going-to-scale show a win-win situation for local rural inhabitants and also for governments. Engineers should consider promoting self-financed supply improvements, particularly where low user numbers make CWS un-affordably expensive. </jats:p>",

Pasar di wilayah Banjarbaru sebagai salah satu tempat penjualan belut memperoleh sumbernya dari beragam pelosok baik di wilayah Kotamadya Banjarbaru maupun sekitarnya seperti Kabupaten Banjar. Pasar yang terletak pada 5 kecamatan di Banjarbaru tidak semua menjual belut sawah, karena khususnya di Kalimantan Selatan, belut merupakan hasil dari tangkapan alam bukan dari produksi budidaya.

Design/Methodology/Approach – This study aims to analyze the POSCO group, especially POSCO and POSCO chemical, which have built global supply chain management related to the secondary battery by applying the case study method. Findings – In order to secure lithium, nickel, graphite, and others, raw materials for the cathode and anode, which are major components of secondary battery, the POSCO group is securing the right to supply raw materials in the form of equity investment in companies through ownership of mines. The raw materials used are made into finished products in the form of cathode and anode materials through domestic POSCO chemical factory (facilities), which are supplied to LG energy solution and GM. In addition, it has established a cathode and anode material plant in the form of a joint venture with a finished car company to secure stable delivery processing and sign long-term supply contracts. In addition, POSCO chemical has one of the few manufacturing facilities and technologies in the world that produces both cathode and anode materials, and is simultaneously conducting product development and technology development to have a full line of secondary battery-related products.

There is a functional-targeted insufficiency of the methodology and the lack in the current federal-level regulatory and technical documents of the methods for hydraulic calculation of water supply systems for apartment buildings that provide for their design characteristics complying with the mandatory requirements of the federal laws «On Technical Regulation», «Urban Development Code of the Russian Federation» and «Technical Regulations on Safety of Buildings and Structures». Technological approaches are considered in the regulation of water consumption in the water supply systems of apartment buildings. Recommendations are presented on the development of methodological procedures, that being applied will ensure the legal legitimacy of the methods for hydraulic calculation of centralized cold and hot water supply systems in apartment buildings.</jats:p>",

A considerable challenge faced by the SC is how manufacturers collaborate with intermediaries and service partners to develop SC capabilities in order to improve SPOPSS. This paper presents a conceptual framework using dynamic capabilities theory for investigating the relationship between SC capabilities and SPOPSS. By qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with six senior managers from four motorcycle companies–manufacturers and intermediaries, the conceptual framework was validated using thematic analysis. This study identified six SC capabilities: collaboration, partner development and knowledge transfer, innovative service delivery, reflexive control, re-conceptualisation and sustainable product–service capability to improve SPOPSS, also identified microfoundation of dynamic capabilities for each six SC capabilities. The findings proposed two significant contributions to the body of knowledge; first, by developing six identified SC capabilities to improve SPOPSS; and second, by presenting qualitative empirical evidence on how these SC capabilities’ development is inseparable from the SC and could be interactively transferred from manufacturers through intermediaries to a network of service partners.</jats:p>",

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda can be used as guidelines for the coordinated development of UN member states. Every year, the number of countries that also connect aviation to a wider range of UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as 4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 and 17, is increasing. At the same time, the achievement of these goals requires working out the theoretical foundations of strategic management of global civil aviation safety. The issue of aviation safety is one of the top priority challenges from the first day of flights. Years passed, technology, avionics, engines, navigation aids changed and developed, but the problem did not lose its relevance. ICAO's purpose: to ensure the safe and orderly development of all aspects of international civil aviation. ICAO develops Standards and Recommended Practices. They are set out in 19 Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. ICAO's new strategies are the basis for further sustainable development of global civil aviation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With all these mergers and acquisitions, it is particularly important to consolidate and manage the number of vendors inherited or absorbed via these acquisitions. This is also an avenue to build strong relationships with their selected suppliers because working with fewer vendors helps to optimize their entire supply chain and improves efficiency across procurement, delivery, production, assets management, and customer satisfaction. Another benefit will come from increased discounts due to preferential, scale, and volume pricing not to mention cost reduction in the areas of their supply chain management. Some companies have production plants in Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, China, Canada, Mexico, and India, and the main aim is to identify suppliers close to those plants and streamline their logistics and distribution cost. There is also a high level of l risk associated with this exercise, If the supply is interrupted for any re-organization will face lots of difficulties meeting up demand, the absence of healthy competition will diminish the ability to negotiate SLAs (Service Level Agreements), and pricing against a supplier competitor but the business goal is to: Invest in Innovations, research and develop new products to be able to remain competitive, this cannot be achieved without the optimization of Procurement, Sourcing and Vendor Management. Be able to automate Procurement and Sourcing operations to increase business dynamism. This consolidation will reduce costs and free up funds to achieve their broader business goal and a bloated suppliers portfolio scattered all over the world conceals a lot of opportunities to get more with less. There were lots of political issues uncovered and encountered during this project which was anticipated but was carefully managed. Companies should think ahead and move from strong market position, growth, and reaching critical customers to accelerating profitable growth. Push the organization from a push/OEM channels a to pull strategy a with focus on end users. Ensure their product offering moves from a specific specialized brand to global recognition. Strong technological know-how to become a true and trusted innovative leader. Move from presence in new markets to leader in all markets. It is also advisable for companies to consider Vertical Integration which is a different alternative to Supplier Consolidation, and conduct financial and regression analyses for better decision-making and recommendations that will give a very big boast to their bottom line. This integration will avoid any supply disruption and organizations will have full control of their supply chain. Since Suppliers are known to dictate terms, pricing, and availability of materials, with this Integration, costs will be reduced, and production slowdowns caused by negotiations and other internal tussles will be prevented. This does not go without some risks because there is always a huge capital investment to set this up, to buy the factories and, to ensure that the plant is running efficiently and effectively.</jats:p>"

The effectiveness of modern management of business structures directly de­pends on the analysis of potential risks and asses­sment of the probability of their occurrence. Risk management tools are of particular importance in optimizing the functioning of supply chains of trade enterprises.  Problem. Russia’s full-scale military inva­sion of Ukraine significantly changes appro­aches to supply chains organization, requires their promptly reformatting. This necessitates an analysis of the key risks associated with the operation of martial law and the consequences of their impact on supply chains in trade.  The aim of the article is to determine the nature of the risks of functioning of trading companies’ supply chains under martial law and to substantiate the practical tools of logistics management aimed at minimizing losses as a re­sult of their occurrence.  Methods. The methodological apparatus of the research consists of general scientific met­hods (system analysis, determination of direct and reverse relations between economic pheno­mena and processes, comparative analysis) and special economic methods (statistical-analy­ti­cal, qualitative and quantitative analysis, situa­tional analysis).  Results. It was determined that the logistics industry was one of the first to feel the con­sequences of military actions and the urgent need to rebuild the established mechanisms of logistics services of trade flows. The main groups of risks that affect the operation of trade com­panies supply chains in war conditions have been studied, the main forms of their mani­festation and consequences have been assessed.  Conclusions. Considering the acute impact of the military invasion of Ukraine on the function­ning of trading companies’ supply chains, the necessity of flexible and diversified transfor­mation of their logistics strategies has been determined. The importance of risk monitoring and the development of alternative action plans for various scenarios has been proven.</jats:p>",

By establishing a model of the heat storage device and conducting numerical simulation, the air distribution law of the air supply system was studied. According to the study results, the uniformity index of the air system was effectively improved by increasing the air cabin width and the air inlet angle, and adding a static pressure box at the air supply outlet, so that the flow velocity distribution of the air supply system was more uniform, which is of great significance to the overall optimization of the solid heat storage and heating system.</jats:p>",

Sob posse dos dados coletados de produção, comercialização e oferta pode-se compreender o panorama da cadeia de peixes do município. Pode-se identificar que 96% dos entrevistados consomem peixes, sendo a tilápia a espécie preferida por 98% deles. Foi identificado que 74% dos entrevistados consomem peixes no município, compram seus produtos em supermercados, sendo encontrados como principais formas de processamento do pescado: filés, postas e eviscerados. Por meio da pesquisa realizada com os piscicultores, notou-se que as espécies presentes na maioria das pisciculturas, são, respectivamente, tilápia, patinga, pacu e carpa, com escoamento anual de produção apenas na Feira do Peixe, durante a Semana Santa. Após a análise dos resultados, foi possível identificar a falta de correlação entre o pescado consumido e o produzido no município. Diante do cenário exposto, conclui-se que a cadeia produtiva de pescado está longínqua da sustentabilidade econômica, sendo necessárias ações conjuntas entre entidades governamentais, universidades, associações e empresas.</jats:p>"

In the first, birds were fed grain–soybean meal mixtures, and in the second, two kinds of diets based on corn–soybean or corn–soybean–rapeseed meal were applied. In the experiments, we determined the levels of the blood serum thyroid hormones fT3 and fT4, as well as the morphological structure of the thyroid gland. In the second experiment, the concentration of immunoglobulins in blood serum was assayed. In both experiments, no influence of iodine source on thyroid hormone concentration was observed. However, increasing the iodine level in the full mixture and adding rapeseed meal in both experiments caused an increase in fT3 concentration. Increasing I-addition in both experiments led to a decrease in thyroid gland follicle diameter. Rapeseed meal inclusion (at a level of 10%) to the complete hen mixture led to an increase in thyroid gland follicle diameter. Applying KIO3 as an iodine source in both experiments caused a decrease in the thyroid gland height of follicle epithelial cells. Immunoglobulin concentrations in the serum were not affected by experimental factors. The results suggest that the methodologies of studies on the bioavailability of minerals and the corresponding analytical methods require unification. The lack of such standardization makes it impossible to engage in a satisfactory discussion of the results and exchange experiences.</jats:p>"

GSCM is the integration of environmental or green thinking in all the functions of SCM, from sourcing, production, and distribution (Ali et al., 2016). Though GSCM predominantly addresses environmental concerns, literature states that GSCM practices significantly influence sustainable performance, encompassing economic, environmental, and social performance (Yildiz Çankaya &amp; Sezen, 2019; Zaid et al., 2018). The food processing industry is one of the largest industries globally, generating massive waste and emitting greenhouse gases, raising environmental concerns. The Indian food processing industry is one of the largest in the world. India stands first in milk production and second in fruit and vegetable production. Having said this, forty percent of food produced in India is wasted. GSCM has recently gained momentum in developing countries like India due to increasing environmental issues. Thus, this research unearths the GSCM practices adopted by Indian food processing companies. This study aims to explore the GSCM practices adopted by Indian food processing firms and investigate the impact of GSCM practices on sustainable performance.\n\n\nKeywords: Environment-friendly practices, green supply chain management practices, sustainability, sustainable performance.</jats:p>",

However, various parameters of the compensator in CCTPSS have a huge impact on the resonance, which will possibly change the original resonance characteristic of the railway. Therefore, the parameters design of the compensator has become a difficult problem to be solved. An optimization mode method is proposed in this paper to obtain the influence of the compensator on the resonance characteristic of CCTPSS and the optimal solution of each parameter is obtained with the goal of suppressing resonance and minimizing the cost. Firstly, the impedance analysis and transfer function analysis are used to establish models for CCTPSS. It is found that the equivalent harmonic impedance of the traction substation decreases after adding the compensator, which will inevitably cause the resonance frequency to increase. By comparing the resonance points of the original traction power supply system (TPSS) and CCTPSS, the results show that the parameters of the compensator have a greater influence on the resonance point in CCTPSS. At last, taking the CCTPSS based on LCL‐type reactive power comprehensive compensator (RPCC) as an example to carry out the optimization mode method, the result proves that this method is not only beneficial to the suppression of harmonic resonance, but also helpful for reducing the cost of the RPCC.</jats:p>",

The SC stakeholders in this investigation are Suppliers, Production / Remanufacturing / Refurbishing Centers (Factories), Collection / Distribution Centers, Recycling / Landfill Centers, and Customers. The suggested sustainable supply chain (SSC) performance measurement included three pillars with 23 indicators. To evaluate the overall sustainability of the SC understudy, a composite index has been developed that combines all the indicators to reflect the sustainability performance of the SC. Four steps are involved in creating a composite index:1) measuring the value of indicators, 2) weighing indicators, 3) Using the normalization technique, and 4) Evaluating the overall SSC indicator. The real case in Iran is selected as an illustrative case. Our research contributions are: We suggested a novelty indicator of SSC to better show the economic, environmental, and social tradeoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. We have found and measured the negative and positive impacts of COVID-19 on aspects of sustainability in SC. Based on the achieved data of the real case study, a numerical example is represented to explain how to calculate the composite index. The main contribution of this paper is the development of SSC indicators during the COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>",

This floor consists of tiles with inductive modules, which supply the AGV with energy. In addition to supplying power to the AGV, the inductive modules are also intended to guide the vehicle through production. To enable such a guidance sensors placed in the AGV measure the induced voltages of the floor. To answer the research question these voltages are calculated with the help of an electromagnetic simulation of the AGV’s travel on the inductive tiles. To estimate the position as well as rotation of the AGV depending on the simulated voltages as inputs a novel algorithm is presented. During the travel the AGV is able to move in arbitrary directions independently of its orientation. To control the omnidrectional AGV consistently without singularities, a transformation in Omni-Curve-Parameters (OCP) is proposed. As simulation case study a four wheeled steering- and velocity controlled AGV is introduced. For the evaluation a novel motion model depending on the input OCP is presented. This model is compared to the estimation of the position to verify the accuracy and the reproducibility of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

The research area was the artificial water retention layer and bare ground of the exposed sandy bottom formed under the influence of the warming–wetting trend that occurs when water recedes in the salt lake area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as well as the two conditions of underpass and underseal. According to the results, the time of condensation generation during the observation period in the salt lake area of Hoh Xil begins at about 0:00 and ends at about 10:00. The artificial water retention layer had little influence on the condensation generation time, and the trend of the condensation rate is the same. The unidirectional condensation phenomenon of water vapor in the near-surface air at a depth range of 0–5 cm when an artificial water retention layer is applied is clearly superior to that of other layers; accordingly, its frequency of condensation phenomenon is also the highest. The amount of condensed soil water vapor from the lower part of the ground when an artificial water retention layer is applied at depth ranges of 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, and 0–10 cm were 3.60, 6.39, and 10.27 times that of the near-surface air, respectively. The total amount of bidirectional condensed water under the condition of the artificial water retention layer at 0–10 cm was the largest. Conversely, the total amount of condensed water from the near-surface air at a depth range of 0–5 cm under the unidirectional condensation condition was the highest, being twice as great as the total amount of condensed water in other layers, which demonstrates the promoting effect that the artificial water retention layer has on the adsorption of water vapor in the near-surface air. Due to the existence of permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the heat zero-flux plane in the area of the Salt Lake has a migration range of divergence of approximately 30 cm from the surface to the ground. An analogous humidity coefficient characterizes the retention effect of condensed water in certain areas, which serve to demonstrate how the artificial water retention layer distributed at a depth of 0–5 cm, regardless of bidirectional or unidirectional condensation, has the best capacity for adsorption. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for condensate absorption capacity and vegetation restoration in the bare ecologically degraded areas of the lake bottom.</jats:p>",

In order to minimize the impact of the supply chain disruption on the Korean economy, it is necessary to reduce the import dependence from China and diversify the supply chain. This study analyze the vulnerabilities of the global supply chain for Korea's major import items, which are more than 50% dependent on imports from China. Major findings are: first, there is a weak correlation between the three indicators of supply chain vulnerability. Second, items with high priority for supply chain stabilization due to high dependence on imports from China, difficulties in diversifying suppliers, and weakness of localization capabilities are mainly raw materials and consumer goods. Third, as a supplier to replace China, Vietnam has a great influence on imports of consumer goods and capital goods, while Japan has a great influence on imports of raw materials. The optimal strategy for diversifying supply chain, such as monitoring of the potential risk factors, strategic international cooperation, and strengthening localization capacity, may vary by country, type of goods, and time frame.</jats:p>",

Slow supply was obtained using an isoamyl alcohol solution of 5 g l−1 in the bubbling columns and an air stream of 50 ml min−1. For fast supply, fermentations were aerated using 10 g l−1 and 100 ml min−1 for isoamyl alcohol solution and air stream, respectively. It demonstrated the feasibility of isoamyl acetate production in SSF. Moreover, the slow supply of the precursor increased isoamyl acetate production up to 390 mg l−1, which is 12.5 times higher than that obtained without precursor (32 mg l−1). On the other hand, fast supply caused an evident inhibition of the growth and production capacity of the yeast.</jats:p>",

The addressed systems in this paper reflect the real physical phenomena characterized by the complicated relationship between supply and demand for energy resources in the Shanghai area. Thus, we provide the developed fractional energy resource attractor and the simulation results regarding synchronization under the proposed control law of the same fractional energy resource attractor. Note that most of the synchronization methods achieved excellent performance when dealing with complex continuous systems; however, no method addressed the synchronization problem of fractional-order energy resource systems based on the F-oC and modern optimization techniques, to the best of our knowledge. By designing the finite-time control theory, the finite-time full synchronization of two identical fractional-order energy resources demand-supply hyperchaotic systems (F-oERDSHSs) is investigated due to its performance. The advanced prediction-based fractional-order control law (Pb-FoCL) is established for finite-time synchronization of F-oERDSHSs. The design procedure becomes a multiobjective optimization problem of the knowledge base of the developed controller while satisfying the desired performance requirements. The Finite-Time Stability (F-TS) of the control-loop system is proved by using the finite-time Lyapunov stability theory. Furthermore, the Improved Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (I-AHA) is used to find an optimal knowledge base of Pb-FoCL while achieving the design constraints. Simulation results are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.</jats:p>",

We find that a supply chain link was likely to be robust if the link was between a foreign‐owned firm and a firm located in the foreign‐owned firm's home country, implying that homophily on a certain dimension generates strong ties and thus supply chain robustness. We also find that firms with geographic diversity of customers and suppliers tended to increase their transaction volume with one partner while decreasing the volume with others. This evidence shows that firms with diversified customers and suppliers are resilient, mitigating the damage from supply chain disruption through the substitution of partners. Furthermore, the robustness and resilience of supply chains are found to have led to higher performance.</jats:p>",

Theoretical studies on equivalent simulation verification method of short-circuit withstand capability test of distribution transformer demonstrated the feasibility of using modern power electronics and advanced energy storage technology to replace conventional power grid dedicated line power supply, short-circuit testing alternator and other short-circuit impact test equipment.

The capacity and power of HESS are the critical issues affecting the system performance and cost. Therefore, a hierarchical energy management model is proposed to optimize the HESS sizing and the scheduling of TPSS with RPC. At the master level, a nonlinear mathematical model is built to minimize the HESS cost, which includes capital cost, replacement cost, and recovery cost. At the slave level, considering voltage unbalance as a constraint, a mixed‐integer linear programming model is established to minimize the electricity cost of railway operation. In order to solve the hierarchical nonlinear programming problem, an improved particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with a GUROBI solver embedded is proposed. Finally, the results show that the 14.08% cost reduction is achieved, and the standard limit value of voltage unbalance is satisfied.</jats:p>",

Pressure heads of leak scenarios are simulated using a hydraulic model, and then used to train a machine-learning-based leak localization model. A key element of the methodology is that discrepancies between simulated and measured pressures are accounted for using a dynamically calculated bias correction, based on historical pressure measurements. Data of in-field leak experiments in operational water distribution networks were produced to evaluate our approach on realistic test data. The results show that the leak localization model is able to reduce the leak search region in parts of the network where leaks induce detectable drops in pressure. When this is not the case, the model still localizes the leak but is able to indicate a higher level of uncertainty with respect to its leak predictions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Prior to Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the scope and directions of financial support for agricultural producers were determined by the priorities of the state agrarian policy and the financial capabilities of the state budget. The terms of membership in the WTO make it urgent to consider the issue of reducing the level of taxation for agriculture in the aspect of basic agreements, principles, and rules of the international organization. Methods. The following methods of understanding economic phenomena and processes were used to solve the problems: epistemological analysis (convention analysis), theoretical generalization, synthesis, induction and deduction, structural and logical analysis, comparison. The results. On the basis of the generalization of the world experience regarding the taxation of the activities of agricultural producers, measures are proposed for the fiscal stimulation of subjects of entrepreneurial activity in the field of agrarian business, that as one of the tools for reproducing the potential fertility of agricultural land, we are considering the use of adjustment coefficients when calculating the land tax and the tax of the 4th group of payers. For this purpose, it is expedient to develop a system of correction coefficients when calculating the value of agricultural land, for which it is necessary to carry out (every 5 years) agrochemical certification of land as a component of the agricultural census. As a basis for the calculation of the correction coefficient, it is advisable to take the value of agricultural land at the beginning and end of the reporting period and multiply it by the value of the normative monetary assessment in the region, on the basis of which the value of the land will be determined, which will serve as the basis for calculating land tax and rent. It is advisable to predict the effect of this indicator for a five-year period. Discussion. Financing of the country's post-war reconstruction will be carried out at the expense of agribusiness entities operating without state support. In this regard, it is necessary to use the foreign experience of stimulating tax influence on their activities, especially small agricultural enterprises, in particular, the extension of the simplified taxation system.

In this study, a quantification strategy is presented to calculate reservoir supply by comparing the results with the actual reservoir water storage. Strategies considering current calculation methods were divided into canal flow measurement (S1), theoretical flow rate (S2), water storage decrease in field practice (S3), and water demand in design practice (S4), utilizing water levels of the reservoir and its canal and the level–flow rate curve obtained from surveying the canal flow. Each strategy was assessed through hydrological verification of reservoir water balance modeling. Based on the determination coefficient (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and relative error (RE) values, the S1 method was found to be the most suitable. S2 had lower reliability than S1, while S3 and S4 satisfied neither R2 nor NSE and had a larger RE than S1 and S2. To accurately quantify agricultural water supplies, the importance of directly measuring reservoir canal flows must be emphasized using automatic water level and flow gauges in canals. This study provides insights into more scientific management of agricultural reservoir water supplies and more effective monitoring of agricultural water usage.</jats:p>"

Land-use decision making can be informed using spatial analysis of ecosystem services supply and demand, shedding light on potential mismatches, surpluses, deficits, and unsustainable uses of ecosystems. The integration of such analysis in land-use decision making, however, can be challenged by the complexity of the hierarchical and inflexible planning models used in various countries. We explored how the analysis of potential mismatches, surpluses, and deficits in the supply and demand of water and fertile soil can be spatially assessed for urban areas, and how such information can be used to inform land-use decision making. We used official data and geoprocessing methods to map water <jats:italic>-supply, demand, and risk for water scarcity-</jats:italic>, and fertile supply <jats:italic>–supply, demand, and risk for food insecurity-</jats:italic>, for Bogota and Villavicencio. We showed a high risk for water scarcity in Bogota, and an increasing competition for fertile soil between urbanization and agriculture. We recommended a cooperative management strategy of ecosystems and services considering that both cities shared river basins and natural reserves, in addition to their strike differences in population size. Inter-jurisdictional and inter-municipal cooperation, in addition to strong governance, are necessary to handle mismatches of urban ecosystem services supply and demand, and a potential solution to solve conflicts related to access, availability, and jurisdiction of ecosystem services in urban areas.</jats:p><jats:p>.</jats:p>",

This study modeled three scenarios, namely, ongoing (ONG), energy saving policy (ESP), and green energy policy (GEP) scenarios using low emission analysis platform (LEAP) software for the study period 2022 to 2050 for Pakistan. The results revealed that a 100% renewable energy supply could be achieved through the GEP scenario. Model results show that the share of renewable sources in the total energy mix is 1117.08 TWh and non-renewable sources contribute only 18.12 TWh to meet the energy demand of 966.05 TWh until 2050. Non-renewable production leads to the generation of 8.85 million metric tons of carbon emissions, which is too low compared with the 135.47 million metric tons under the ONG scenario. The USD 1482.46 billion investment cost required for adding renewable energy capacity until 2050 is too high as compared with the USD 46.80 billion under the ONG scenario. Energy demand and production requirements are reduced by 34.18% under the ESP scenario until 2050. This approach can also be applicable to the majority of nations worldwide.</jats:p>"

Indonesia, being a developing country, adapting to new ways of doing things, including the use of IoT takes time, hence affecting studies regarding the use of IoT in business units, such as the internal supply chain sector. Thus, there is no much studies from a localized perspective, measuring the importance and using IoT as well as supply chain performance of the country. The present paper applied an organizational capacity theory to establish the Internet of Things impact on varying dimensions of Supply Chain, which included supply chain integration process, organizational performance of supply chain and the capacity to the influence production.

This study investigated the relationship between the physical and hydraulic characteristics of a WDS and the corresponding serviced area. Five physical parameters (a) and two hydraulic parameters (b) describing the serviced area were identified for analysis, namely (a) total pipeline length, land area, area shape factor, terrain index, reservoir distance from area centroid and (b) peak flow rate and average static system pressure. Multiple linear regression was performed on the data. A model was compiled linking the total pipeline length of a WDS to the peak flow rate. The model is applicable to predominantly residential service zones larger than 80 hectares with a peak hour flow rate of &amp;lt;450 L/s. The model enables the prediction of the potable water distribution pipe infrastructure required for future development areas in the absence of basic planning information, such as cadastral layouts. Alternatively, the model can estimate the potential maximum peak flow rate that can be supplied, if the total pipeline length is known.</jats:p>",

In this study, we develop a research model to investigate to what extent SM fake news contributes to supply chain disruption (SCD), and what are the different SM affordances that contribute to SM fake news. To test the derived hypotheses with survey data, we have applied partial least square based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. Further, to identify how different configurations of SC resilience (SCR) capabilities reduce SCD, we have used fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results show that SM affordances lead to fake news, which increases consumer panic buying (CPB); CPB in turn increases SCD. In addition, SM fake news directly increases SCD. The moderation test suggests that, SCR capability, as a higher-order construct, decreases the effect of CPB on SCD; however, neither of the capabilities individually moderates. Complimentarily, the fsQCA results suggest that no single capability but their three specific configurations reduce SCD. This work offers a new theoretical perspective to study SCD through SM fake news. Our research advances the knowledge of SCR from a configurational lens by adopting an equifinal means towards mitigating disruption. This research will also assist the operations and SC managers to strategize and understand which combination of resilience capabilities is the most effective in tackling disruptions during a crisis e.g., COVID-19. In addition, by identifying the relative role of different SM affordances, this study provides pragmatic insights into SM affordance measures that combat fake news on SM.</jats:p>",

An NKEFA consists of a few National Key Ecological Function Counties (NKEFCs). China’s central government annually makes fiscal transfers to NKEFCs to compensate for their fiscal imbalance and ecosystem protection costs. The eco-compensation coefficient (ECC), together with the fiscal revenue and expenditure gap (FREG), determines the transfer payment, but the central government fails to provide practical methods for its estimation. This article proposes a framework for ECC estimation by integrating ecosystem service supply (ESS), ecosystem protection cost (EPC), and public service provision capability (PSC) of NKEFCs, and clarifies the criteria and indicators for ESS, EPC, and PSC evaluation. The framework was implemented in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YZEB), and the results were compared with the payments in the current central-to-local fiscal transfer (CTLFT) system. The key findings and conclusions include: (1) The payment in the current CTLFT system mainly depends on the FREG rather than ESS and EPC of NKEFCs. (2) Some counties are notably under-compensated because their ESS or EPC are underestimated, or the province that administers them has a stronger fiscal capability. (3) The framework contributes to fair allocation and efficient use of eco-compensation payments by improving the ECC estimation method and identifying the main stressors and public service weaknesses in NKEFAs. This study gives the following policy implications: (1) Inner-provincial and cross-provincial watershed eco-compensation programs need to be developed to supplement the central-to-local eco-compensation program in the YZEB. (2) Environmental management strategies should be based on the characteristics of stressors and people’s livelihood in NKEFAs.</jats:p>"

The permanent magnet linear motor is replaced by an electrical submersible linear motor based on switched reluctance linear motor. The sensorless control method further enhances the stability of the oil exploitation system. Meanwhile, a supply and demand balance control method is proposed to maintain the fullness of the submersible plunger pump within an ideal range. An established speed function allows the speed of the electrical submersible linear motor to dynamically alter in response to the change in oil deliverability and increasing the system's production. Additionally, maintaining the fullness of the submersible plunger pump within the ideal range helps simplify the model and increase computation accuracy. Finally, the supply and demand balance control method is validated and compared with the intermittent oil exploitation control method by simulations and experiments. Results from the simulations and experiments indicate that the proposed method can increase the production of the offshore oil exploitation system in addition to causing the motor to follow changes in oil deliverability and adjust the speed.</jats:p>",

The outcome of this review provides a foundation for understanding developing patterns and new changes in the industry, and it is significant for future research on supply chain risk management. Our study not only updates the review of SCRM but also illustrates the possibility to objectively review literature with the support of text mining technology, using our newly developed framework.

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a secure data sharing scheme (SDSM) for IoT based supply chains by combining blockchain and ciphertext-based attribute cryptography. This scheme supports the enforcement of fine-grained access control for different levels of partnerships. In addition, to identify partnerships, we propose a metric based on the historical transaction facts on the blockchain, where the level of partnerships among participants is automatically calculated by smart contracts. Finally, we introduce personalized attributes of participants in the ciphertext-based attribute encryption algorithm to support the construction of access policies that include partnerships, allowing for more fine-grained access control.

The operational decisions of the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) in the power battery industry should rather consider the impact of CSR. Thus, this paper studies the optimal recycling channel selection and coordination of CLSC in the power battery industry under the consideration of CSR efforts and uncertain demand. By considering the CSR efforts taken by the manufacturer, decentralized and coordination decision-making models under different recycling modes (including manufacturer recycling, retailer recycling and third-party recycling) are constructed to analyze the optimal decision of CLSC. After that, the models were validated through numerical and sensitivity analysis, followed by discussion and management insights. It is found that when consumers are sensitive to the level of CSR effort, CSR effort has a positive impact on the profits of participants in CLSC. Additionally, the coordination decision-making model always outperforms the decentralized decision-making model under the same recycling mode, so reasonable profit-sharing contracts are developed to ensure the implementation of coordination decision-making. Moreover, transfer price plays different roles in different decision situations and recycling modes, while recycling cost is critical to the overall profit of the supply chain and influences the choice of recycling channel.</jats:p>"

With the aim of mapping the risk categories in the PRD unit and providing recommendations for actions that must be taken to mitigate these risks with a quantitative approach. Pressure relief device (PRD) is a device that automatically discharges a certain pressure which is controlled by upstream static pressure coming from the valve and opens naturally with an increase in pressure above the opening pressure. The risk-based inspection method is carried out to calculate the risk value on an equipment by conducting analysis and calculations to determine the probability and consequence values on the PRD unit, the data used to calculate the risk value in the form of PRD data sheets include: general data, process condition data, data materials, data connection, and database and selection data, as well as inspection history records at the PRD unit (17 – PSV – 298) which are used to determine risk values, inspection plans, and recommendations for actions to be taken in mitigating risks. According to the calculation of the risk value on the PRD unit equipment (17 – PSV – 298) which was analyzed using the risk-based inspection method, the risk value for the PRD unit was 0.1135 m2/year, so it can be determined that the risk category is the medium category according to plotting against the risk matrix. The PRD unit (17 – PSV – 298) will approach the risk target as determined by the company in the 24th year since the first risk assessment was carried out using the RBI method and estimated on January 11, 2042. Based on the inspection history, there has been a leak in the PRD unit (17 – PSV – 298) during the pop test. Thus, the recommended type of inspection is the type of shop inspection/overhauls and is carried out periodically at least every 4 years. This is in accordance with PERMEN ESDM No. 32 of 2021 Article 21 Paragraph 4a.</jats:p>"

It will ensure the production and redistribution of energy in accordance with the schedule of consumers. Simulation of optimized operating modes of a self-sufficient heat supply system for a cottage village based on local energy resources and with minimal use of external energy sources was performed. The use of the software and information complex made it possible to calculate the parameters that provide optimized coverage of the heat load schedule of the cottage village based on local energy resources. The simulation performed using the example of the predicted values of the installed thermal capacity of the power units and the actual ambient temperature schedule. The developed new software and information complex provides an opportunity for hourly simulation and research of optimal modes of operation of heat units of autonomous heat supply systems. In the developed software and information complex, a model of optimization of operating modes is applied, which belongs to the class of problems of optimal loading of generating capacities of power systems with the criterion of minimizing costs for production, accumulation and consumption of heat and electricity. An example of simulation results using the heat load schedule for the selected day of March 20, 2018 is given. The obtained results indicate a decrease in the specific cost of hourly heat supply with an increase in the part of thermal energy supplied at the expense of renewable energy sources, and accordingly, a decrease in the part of gas, and in the general case of any other generation based on fossil fuel technologies, in the total volume of heat supply. Thus, the effectiveness of the use of renewable energy sources based on local energy resources as part of the heat supply system of the cottage village confirmed.

Using abandoned coal mines as underground water reservoirs is an effective idea for reducing eco-geological risks in mining districts. Accurate estimation of reservoir capacity is conducive to guiding the construction of an underground water reservoir. In this paper, estimation models of underground water storage capacity were established, which were divided into two kinds: horizontal mining district and inclined mining district. Furthermore, the minimum porosity of broken rock mass was analyzed based on laboratory experiments, and the fitted equation of minimum porosity was developed. A modern coal mine in northwest China was taken as an example, and the feasibility of the proposed model was verified by in-situ measurement. Finally, the effects of porosity of broken rock mass, water storage height and coal seam dip angle on water storage capacity were presented. The coal seam dip angle should be the principal consideration in choosing the site of an underground water reservoir.</jats:p>",

While overall calls for service (demand) tended to decline in most agencies, some experienced increases in specific categories of calls. During the early months of COVID, agencies also reduced their in-person response to calls for service, arrests, proactive policing, and community policing activities (supply). These findings indicate a substantial change in the public safety landscape during that time, which was experienced by agencies of all sizes and from all types of jurisdictions.

The first and second variant arteries could be remnants of transient anastomoses or collateral circulation, which were present during embryonic development and persisted until adulthood. Moreover, during our literature review, we noticed that the general description of omental blood supply and its possible variations is relatively poor; therefore, we emphasize the need for more precise knowledge regarding these anatomical parts, which could help surgeons who are performing abdominal or pelvic surgeries in preventing avoidable bleeding.</jats:p>",

Water footprint reflects the actual water consumption of each product, which can reflect the intensity of water consumption of each production sector and the flow of water resources implied in the product trade. In this paper, the water footprint of each sector in Henan Province in 2017 was calculated using non-competitive input-output techniques. Furthermore, a dual-objective planning model that minimizes water resource export and maximizes labor compensation was established, based on which the export structure of the sector in the province was optimized. Research findings show that agriculture is the primary consuming sector of water resources from the direct water use perspective. In comparison, the food processing industry is the major consuming sector of water resources from the water footprint perspective. The difference in water resources consumed by sectors from the perspective of water footprint is smaller than that from the perspective of direct water use. Second, most water-intensive sectors have a relatively large water footprint of out-of-province use, which results in 52.75% of Henan Province's produced water being consumed outside the province. Third, the current export structure adjustment of sectors in Henan Province can achieve a Pareto improvement of water conservation and economic development. It is expected to save 14.65% of the province's export water resources and increase Henan Province's total exports by 170.61 billion (170.61 × 109) yuan and increase labor compensation by 39.76 billion yuan. This study can be used to optimize water allocation and improve sustainable water use in water-scarce regions.</jats:p>",

It is a promising scientific and application area, as it is related to the problem of instability of power grids supplied with RES. The article presents the conceptual assumptions of the research on the design of a functional multi-criteria model of the stabilization model architecture of energy distribution networks based on a hydrogen energy buffer, taking into account the applicable use of hydrogen. The aim of the research was to identify the variables contributing to the stabilization of the operation of distribution networks. The method used to obtain this result was a systematic review of the literature using the technique of in-depth analysis of full-text articles and expert consultations. The concept of a functional model was described as a matrix in two dimensions in which the identified variables were embedded. The first dimension covers the phases of the supply chain: procurement and production along with storage and distribution. The second dimension divides the separate factors into technical, economic, and logistic. The research was conducted in the context of system optimization from the point of view of the operator of the energy distribution system. As a result of the research, several benefits resulting from stabilization using a hydrogen buffer were identified. Furthermore, the model may be used in designing solutions stabilizing the operation of power grids in which there are surpluses of electricity produced from RES. Due to the applied multidimensional approach, the developed model is recommended for use, as it enables the design of solutions in a systemic manner. Due to the growing level of energy obtained from renewable energy sources, the issue of stabilizing the energy network is becoming increasingly important for energy network distributors.</jats:p>"

The action of random factors is taken into account with the help of repeated simulation of the functioning of the studied energy supply technology in random implementations based on the Monte Carlo method.</jats:p>",

As a policy to revitalize the supply of eco- friendly cars, it is pushing for purchase subsidies and tax reduction policies, and aims to supply 6.7 million fuel cell electric vehicles and 310 hydrogen charging stations by 2022. Meanwhile in order for eco-friendly cars to be activated, various policies such as subsidies, vehicle price reduction, easing various regulatory policies, and promoting incentive policies are needed, but above all, installing charging facilities is important to revitalize eco-friendly vehicles. In this study, the current status of the FCEV industry and the promotion strategy according to the supply of FCEVs were presented to revitalize the supply of the FCEVs suitable for the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do. The first, practical hydrogen utilization measures should be prepared first in purchasing business vehicles through a plan to supply FCEVs, expand subsides to revitalize the supply of FCEVs, and secure subsidies for operation of hydrogen charging stations. The second, it is necessary to build a hydrogen production base in Gyeongsangbuk-do to expand the FCEV infrastructure, build an institutional plan to revitalize FCEVs, and reduce hydrogen costs through green hydrogen production and production base construction. The third, it is necessary to train professionals, in the hydrogen industry and promote the transformation of local people’s perception of hydrogen and hydrogen charging stations. Therefore, Gyeongsangbuk-do can secure competitiveness in the hydrogen industry by supplying FCEVs and expanding hydrogen charging stations, and contribute for forstering the hydrogen economy, a key driving force for future innovation growth and energy conversion.</jats:p>"

Research methodology: The study used a mixed research approach, with respondents selected using a stratified proportionate technique from each organization's employees to disseminate a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews done using a purposeful sampling technique. Correlation and regression, as well as thematic analysis, were used in the analysis.  Results: The finding of the study reveals that supplier integration, information sharing, postponement, and outsourcing affect humanitarian relief organizations’ performance positively in a statistically significant way.  Limitations: The main limitation is that the study focused only on humanitarian relief organizations operating in the Gedeo zone.  Contribution: Ethiopia experienced natural and human-made disasters such as (El Niño, flood, famine, war, communal conflict, etc) for decades. To reduce the threat of this, the Study suggests that supply chain management practice is a serious concern for many relief humanitarian organizations operating in the Gedeo zone.

Thanks to in situ measurements recorded by two saildrones deployed during summer 2019 and to refined sea ice filtering in satellite L‐band radiometric data, we demonstrate the ability of satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) observed by Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive to capture SSS freshening induced by sea ice melt. We refer to these freshening events as meltwater lenses (MWL). The largest MWL observed by the saildrones during this period occupied a large part of the Chukchi shelf, with a SSS freshening reaching −5 practical salinity scale, persisting for up to 1 month. This MWL restricted the transfer of air‐sea momentum to the upper ocean, as illustrated by measured wind speed and vertical profiles of currents. With satellite‐based sea surface temperature, satellite SSS provides a monitoring of the different water masses encountered in the region during summer 2019. Using sea ice concentration and estimated Ekman transport, we analyze the spatial variability of sea surface properties after the sea ice edge retreat over the Chukchi and the Beaufort seas. The two MWL captured by the saildrones and the satellite measurements resulted from different dynamics. Over the Beaufort Sea, the MWL evolution followed the meridional sea ice retreat whereas, in the Chukchi Sea, a large persisting MWL was generated by advection and subsequent melting of a sea ice filament.</jats:p>",

There has not been any easy-to-use software to speed up the process, even after many recent studies about environment-friendly window size, shading, position, and material. Thus, a single-family house with simple geometry in Kvemelto karti, Georgia, was simulated to introduce an alternative method to manage this gap. A building information model (BIM) was devised for this procedure through Autodesk Revit® due to its simplicity, popularity, interoperability and convenience among its users. Not to mention, the energy analysis tool (The Autodesk Insight 360) in Revit (BEM) displays the total energy load while, in this case, focusing on window size, position, material, and shading executed by Autodesk Green Building Studio®. The early energy analysis (the optimum window-to-wall ratio (WWR), the windows’ location in the wall, material, and shading) suggested by BEM does not give enough information to apply in the early stages of design and create a net-zero-energy building. The aim is to show the gap between data-driven from BEM and design strategies and to display the information required to be more detailed. For this purpose, after using Insight 360 (a web-based tool) for investigating window shades, material, and WWR, it has been concluded that there is a need for a more convenient way to automate the process in more depth. They could help to pick a viable widow shading, size, position, and material. Besides, choosing determined factors using just BEM is not practical because detailed characteristics of window factors as determining elements are not defined. This tool has its limitations.</jats:p>",

However, the construction of the KG for industrial robot fault detection is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a top-down approach to constructing a knowledge graph from robot fault logs. We define the event argument classes for fault phenomena and fault cause events as well as their relationship. Then, we develop the event logic ontology model. In order to construct the event logic knowledge extraction dataset, the ontology is used to label the entity and relationship of the fault detection event argument in the corpus. Additionally, due to the small size of the corpus, many professional terms, and sparse entities, a model for recognizing entities for robot fault detection is proposed. The accuracy of the entity boundary determination of the model is improved by combining multiple text features and using the relationship information. Compared with other methods, this method can significantly improve the performance of entity recognition of the dataset.</jats:p>"

A supervised declaration of meteorological drought based on available precipitation data requires an understanding of reliability and consistency of drought indices for appropriate severity classification. An attempt has been made in this study to critically evaluate the performance of six popular drought indices namely, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), China Z Index (CZI), Modified China Z Index (MCZI), Deciles Index (DI), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), and Z-Score Index (ZSI) for four districts in Tamil Nadu falling under arid (Karur), semi-arid (Cuddalore), dry sub-humid (Kanyakumari) and moist sub-humid (Coimbatore) conditions based on 120 years of precipitation records. Results showed that the SPI and CZI provided similar quantification of drought events (about 18% of the total months) irrespective of their climatic considerations while ZSI and RAI resulted in overestimation of drought severity (about 30–47%). Based on the classification strategy adopted for the selected indices, a framework for drought vulnerability assessment is proposed in conjunction with the estimated drought severity classifications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inspired by the poultry farming process, we studied an input control problem in a two-level supply chain for production-time-dependent products with random demands. Poultry farms deliver chicks in batches, and the raising process begins at timed intervals. Chicks become broilers after a predetermined raising time. The broilers in the process are shipped to manufacturing plants to satisfy the demand. The remaining chicks grow to the next product size to satisfy the demands for larger chickens. This procedure is repeated until the chicks are fully grown. After the chicks are grown to satisfy the demand for the largest size, the remaining chicks are discarded. In this paper, a stochastic model is presented to study an input control problem in the poultry farming process. Because of the production density, feed, and temperature control, one important issue in the operation of a poultry company is the determination of the raising interval and quantity of input (chicks). While existing mathematical models can provide effective information on the production-planning problem of systems, research has not been conducted on cases of random demand. Identifying a recursive structure and Markovian property for the number of raw materials (chicks) and the unfulfilled demand for each product type in the system, we demonstrate that embedded Markov chain models can be obtained. The equilibrium probabilities of the models can be calculated using matrix analytic methods or probability generating functions. Various numerical experiments are conducted to analyze how performance measures such as amount of disposal, unsatisfied demands, and total cost (considering disposal cost and opportunity cost) change with system parameters.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to evaluate the water quality of the Loopspruit River by analysing the physico-chemical and microbiological parameters of the water. Bacterial diversity was the highest in less polluted areas of the Loopspruit River. Dominating at all the sites tested were Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Predicted metagenome analysis revealed a correlation between the physico-chemical parameters and observed taxonomic units (OTU). Temperature had a negative correlation with Patescibacteria, Nanoarchaeaeota and Firmicutes (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The negative correlation was strongest with Patescibacteria. Sulphate had a strong correlation with Fusobacteria (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were was also evidence of faecal and agricultural pollution. Analysing and visually representing the water quality of the Loopspruit River demonstrated the value of combining physico-chemical, microbiology and geospatial data for an overview of understanding the potential environmental health risks.

This research study was the first to evaluate the potential role of chloramines for the online regeneration of MnOx(s)-coated contactor media. Testing initially at the bench scale and then subsequently over 6 months at the pilot scale demonstrated that chloramines were quite effective at promoting significant media regeneration. Pilot-scale data showed that the presence of chloramines addressed approximately 80% of the media regeneration requirements, allowing for the addition of free chlorine following media backwashing to address the remaining oxidant needs for media regeneration. Hydraulic loading rates of up to 39 m/hr (16 gpm/ft2) could be employed and still produce highly effective Mn removal. The means by which these research results can be applied to other water treatment situations are also discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This disease disrupted the functionality of the global economy, and the agriculture sector was not spared. It is in this context that this paper aims at assessing farmers’ perceptions about the perceived shocks of COVID-19 on the side of demand and supply of agricultural commodities. The study was guided by three objectives viz to investigate the perceptions of farmers on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for agricultural commodities, to explore the perceptions of farmers on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply of agricultural commodities and to analyze the factors affecting farmers’ perceptions of COVID-19 pandemic on demand and supply of agricultural commodities in Nyamasheke district. The target population size was 6237 composed of farmers of three irrigated lands in Nyamasheke District. Yamane’s formula for the sample size determination was used to find the sample size of the respondents which was 376 and then stratified and systematic sampling procedures were employed to get 174 farmers in Kirimbi, 114 farmers in Mugonero and 88 farmers in Kamiranzovu irrigated lands, respectively. This study employed both descriptive and inferential statistical tools to analyze data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data on the perceptions of farmers towards COVID-19 pandemic effects on the demand and the supply for agricultural commodities while the inferential statistics were used to estimate the logit of farmers’ perceptions on COVID-19 pandemic effects of demand and supply of agricultural commodities in the area under study. Results from the descriptive statistics revealed that 326 (86.7%) farmers agreed that COVID-19 pandemic has affected the demand of agricultural commodities while 244 (64.9%) farmers confirmed that COVID-19 pandemic has affected the supply of agricultural commodities in the area under study. The output of the model revealed that the independent variables that significantly contribute to the logit of the dependent variable were farming experience and labor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, farmers encountered several challenges that disrupted their livelihoods including changes in household consumption patterns, changes in market functionalities, discontinuity of the planned training and field visits, and low number of farmers in the farms. Researchers recommend that farmers’ purchasing power should be reinforced by providing financial support to them through lowering interest rates on loans.

First, the key variables are selected from the perspective of influencing the economic reliability of the power system. Second, the energy storage operation model of the power supply side under the high proportion of wind power access is established, and the impact of new energy access on the system balance and energy storage configuration is explored. Finally, the cost connection of each module body is used to optimize the allocation of energy storage resources, thereby improving the efficiency of the enterprise itself and providing a new idea for the power generation enterprise to participate in the operation and scheduling of the system.</jats:p>",

However, when the supply network is defined as a complex adaptive system that is a dynamic process, it is particularly important to explore its structure and evolution. Therefore, this study empirically analyzed how and through which micro-mechanisms the traditional vertical structure of the Korean automotive industry supply network is evolving into a horizontal structure. The results confirmed that new firms were continuously entering the Korean automotive industry supply network, and transaction relationships that were not found in the traditional supply chain structure were increasing. Additionally, among the existing suppliers, high-performing suppliers continued to form new transaction relationships while maintaining existing relationships. The significance of this study is as follows. SAOM was applied to the supply network of the Korean automotive industry for the first time, and the existing vertical and linear relationship studies were expanded from a network perspective. Furthermore, unlike the existing supply network-related studies, which were limited to an analysis at a specific point in time, the dynamic evolution of the supply network was identified.</jats:p>",

Further uncontrolled increase in the power of non-linear loads will make it possible to achieve a significant reduction in power consumption; weight and size indicators; increasing the functionality of electrical equipment, however, it will lead to a distortion of the sinusoidality of the voltage curve, which will cause a significant increase in the harmonic components of current and voltage; switching surges and deterioration of other power quality indicators, and will not be accompanied by the timely development of recommendations and technical solutions aimed at ensuring quality indicators in accordance with GOST. Thus, there is a problem of increasing the energy security and efficiency of the power supply system of the marine industry. The paper presents the structure, mode of operation of the power supply system of a shipyard and its non-linear electrical receivers. The results of experimental studies characterizing high levels of current harmonic components in circuits with non-linear loads are presented.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract  Blue swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) is one of Indonesia's highest-export fishery commodities. Capture fisheries are dominated by fishermen with low productivity, efficiency, and income levels. There is a high-profit disparity between upstream and downstream actors, where fishermen get the lowest profit. This study aims to identify the causes of profit disparities between supply chain actors and propose a supply chain model to solve the profit disparity problem. The supply chain actors observed were fishermen, mini plants, processing companies, and exporters of blue swimming crab. Determining variables that affect profit gain based on the business activities of the supply chain actors of blue swimming crab was carried out. The conceptual model was made using the Soft System Methodology (SSM). The analysis result showed that the causes of profit disparity were the vast number of fishermen, lack of product value understanding, minimum capital and access to capital, awareness of fishing gear utilization, and the individual fisherman's work system. The conceptual model of the blue swimming crab supply chain proposed consists of the formation of fishing groups, coordination between fishing groups and Perum Perindo, collaborating with Pokja and fishing groups, and increasing collaboration between all supply chain actors of blue swimming crab.  Keywords: blue swimming crab, fishermen, Soft System Methodology, supply chain     Abstrak  Rajungan (Portunus pelagicus) merupakan salah satu komoditas perikanan ekspor tertinggi di Indonesia. Usaha ikan tangkap didominasi oleh para nelayan dengan tingkat produktivitas, efisiensi, serta pendapatan yang rendah. Disparitas keuntungan yang tinggi terjadi antara pelaku rantai pasok dari hulu dan hilir. Nelayan memperoleh keuntungan paling rendah. Penelitian ini bertujuan mengidentifikasi penyebab disparitas keuntungan antara pelaku rantai pasok dan mengusulkan model rantai pasok sebagai solusi permasalahan disparitas keuntungan. Pelaku rantai pasok yang diamati adalah nelayan, mini plant, perusahaan pengolah rajungan, dan eksportir. Identifikasi variabel yang memengaruhi perolehan keuntungan berdasarkan aktivitas bisnis pelaku rantai pasok rajungan. Model konseptual dibuat menggunakan Soft System Methodology (SSM). Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa penyebab disparitas keuntungan adalah jumlah nelayan yang sangat banyak, pemahaman yang kurang terhadap nilai produk, modal dan akses permodalan yang minimum, kesadaran dalam penggunaan alat tangkap yang aman, dan sistem kerja nelayan yang masih dilaksanakan secara individu sehingga nelayan menerima keuntungan yang paling kecil di antara pelaku rantai pasok dari hulu dan hilir. Model konseptual rantai pasok rajungan yang diusulkan adalah pembentukan kelompok nelayan, koordinasi antara kelompok nelayan dan Perum Perindo, kolaborasi antara Pokja dan kelompok nelayan, dan meningkatkan kolaborasi antara seluruh pelaku rantai pasok rajungan.

The second goal is to confirm further hypotheses which joba satisfaction and delegation of authority show positive moderating effect on the relationship between Supply Chain Management practice capacity and the performance respectively. To accomplish these goals, the authors conducted a series of surveys and empirical analyses utilizing reliability analysis, validity check, regression model analysis and moderate regression model analysis.\r\nThose analyses brought the result that Supply Chain Management practice has positive effect on the performance in Korean sample companies. Further research analyses showed the results that delegation of authority demonstrates positive moderating effect on relationship between Supply Chain Management practice and the performances, while job satisfaction does not. lt implies an managerial implication that implementing investments on and making efforts on Supply Chain Management practice and delegation of authority concurrently can provide companies with more improvement in the performance because of a synergistic effect between the two. Moreover, one possible reason that job satisfaction does not demonstrates synergetic effect can be explained by the characteristic that job satisfaction have to be sought over long, not short, time span to expect improvements in performance in connection with other types of managerial efforts or investments.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the results of an empirical study investigating the moderating roles of information technology link and information sharing on the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Statistical techniques such as measurement test, correlation analysis, and regression analysis are applied to analyze the data collected during the Round 4 of the High Performance Manufacturing (HPM) Project. The data sample includes 304 manufacturing plants operating in 13 countries including Brazil, China, Finland, German, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Analytical results indicate that a supply chain would perform better when focal firms invest their effort in supplier development and knowledge absorption activities and develop a strong link with suppliers and customers through information technology systems. Information technology links with suppliers and customers have significant moderating roles in strengthening the relationship between supplier development, knowledge absorption from customers, and supply chain performance. Moreover, information sharing exchange with suppliers were found to make the association between supplier development and supply chain performance becomes more pronounced. The empirical results contribute to the existing literature of information sharing and supply chain coordination in supply chain management. In addition, this study provides several practical implications, such that information technology linkage and information sharing activities should be considered as the platforms for organizations to interact with different supply chain partners for achieving high supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The prevailing design provisions, such as minimum diameter, lead to oversizing of the water network, affecting operation. In upstream balancing reservoirs, outflow due to the water transmission network's excessive withdrawal capacity surpasses the available inflow causing flow starvation under intermittent water supply. This flow starvation causes partial flow in the downstream vicinity and forms a standing water column in the balancing reservoir's immediate downstream pipe. Traditional modeling approaches cannot simulate the piped network performance under this phenomenon due to their inability to model partial flow. Hence, a novel modeling approach is developed using a tank with an irregular cross-section, which integrates the hydraulic performance of the tank and the downstream pipe. Additionally, a reservoir and control valve represent the water withdrawal mechanism at the downstream reservoir. The proposed modeling approach simulates performance of a flow-starved water transmission network. A case study based on a real network is used to illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach. The developed modeling approach can serve as a management tool to devise operation schedules, helping better manage the operations of the water networks.</jats:p>",

This study aimed at examining the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of key pharmacovigilance actors in the public health pharmaceutical supply chain management in Nigeria. Consequently, a cross-sectional approach was used in the survey of 209 leaders of selected public health organizations. Purposive sampling technique was applied to administer validated semi-structured questionnaire electronically. Questions were drawn from the Nigerian national pharmacovigilance policy. Overall, response rate was 55%. Among the responders, medical doctors and medical laboratory scientists had better knowledge and practice of pharmacovigilance than pharmacists. Factors associated with practice of pharmacovigilance include awareness of policy (OR =1.90; P-value =0.1140), training provided by respondents' organizations (OR =1.34; P-value =0.4801), respondents' organization receiving periodic updates from the National Pharmacovigilance Center (OR =1.11; P-value =0.8525) and respondents independently receiving periodic updates (OR =0.83; P-value =0.7279). In conclusion, the study suggests pharmacovigilance outcomes could improve through increased awareness of the policy, training, and periodic safety communications.</jats:p>"

The remaining two-thirds were derived from the Taurus Mountains of Turkey, namely, from stream tin and residual low-grade mineralization remaining after extensive exploitation in the Early Bronze Age. The results of our metallurgical analysis, along with archaeological and textual data, illustrate that a culturally diverse, multiregional, and multivector system underpinned Eurasian tin exchange during the Late Bronze Age.

To enhance the performance of hydrodynamic bearings running with limited lubricant supply (LLS), this study examined the effect of stearic acid as an additive. Stearic acid is commonly used for boundary lubrication as an organic friction modifier. How the stearic acid adsorption affects the hydrodynamic lubrication of a slider-on-disc contact under LLS was investigated using interferometry measurement and fluorescence observation in this study. Firstly, the oil reservoir of PAO10 with stearic acid adsorption was observed at the slider entrance. Secondly, the film thickness versus speed of PAO10 and PAO10 with 0.1% and 0.3% stearic acid, respectively, were measured. Finally, the morphology and surface properties of the glass and steel blocks with stearic acid adsorption were characterized by atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the stearic acid adsorption layer weakens the wettability of the lubrication track and induces the ‘dewetting’ phenomenon of the lubricating oil. Thus, discrete oil distribution in the form of stripe or droplet can be generated, which leads to the accumulation of lubricating oil at the slider entrance to form a reservoir. An additional inlet pressure that is generated by the oil reservoir due to surface tension increases the oil film formation capacity. Furthermore, the morphologies of the adsorbed stearic acid layer on the glass and the steel blocks are, respectively, characterized by the nano-sized granular bulge and brush structure. This study reveals a new role of stearic acid adsorption in promoting LLS lubrication.</jats:p>"

The most protected source of drinking and industrial water from anthropogenic influence is groundwater. The article considers the role of groundwater as a reserve source in the system of national and regional planning of the development of the water management complex, in particular, in cases of emergency situations. Shortcomings of state planning and regulation in the field of exploration, assessment of reserves, moni- toring of the state and extraction of groundwater have been identified. Recommendations are given for improving the state policy in the field of water supply management for the needs of the population with groundwater reserves in case of emergency situations.</jats:p>",

An optimisation model of the supply chain system under consideration is built by formulating the objective function, which is minimising the joint total cost between a buyer and a vendor. The model is developed on the basis of a simulation system, and optimisation is carried out by utilising a Genetic Algorithm that has been embedded in the simulation system. This technique is called optimisation–simulation closed loop. The vendor actual condition, which deals with uncertain demands from the main buyer and other small buyers, is considered. To analyse timely supply chain events, a simulation system is developed. A new optimisation model for the single-vendor single-buyer supply chain system with fuzzy demand is developed on the basis of the simulation system. The use of optimisation–simulation closed loop is also a new finding. In this study, the optimisation model of the supply chain under consideration is developed by taking into account a specific condition in which the vendor receives demands from the main buyer and other small buyers. Naturally, buyer demand is uncertain and has been modelled using a fuzzy set. The use of optimisation–simulation closed loop enables the supply chain to make the optimum decision when at the steady state condition.</jats:p>",

However, to realize the potential of the OAC market, a better understanding of the market demand for OAC, as well as the quality and production standards under which the brands operate, the institutional frameworks, and the market mechanisms that underpin its commercialization, is needed. We evaluated the existing organic markets in Brazil using an interview-based methodology with key stakeholders throughout the organic cotton supply chain in 2022. Our study revealed that some brands are willing to pay prices ranging from USD$ 2.57 to USD$ 4.61 per kg of cotton lint depending on the brand. These brands require suppliers to meet quality specifications for the cotton fiber; for example, they require average to long fibers and specify harvesting practices that influence fiber quality. There are also social and environmental criteria that prioritize vulnerable communities of family farmers and women groups planting cotton based on established sustainable practices. The institutional framework includes different stakeholders throughout the organic cotton supply chain, which is fundamentally driven by private demand for cotton, counts on the support of agents connecting brands to farmers, and is indirectly supported by public policies. Existing markets for organic cotton are established via contracts that provide farmers with guarantees to invest in planting cotton and have different certification systems used by the brands that monitor and verify adherence to the standards. Market demand for OAC may, therefore, potentially lead to new markets that promote sustainable supply chains and farming practices. However, existing markets for organic cotton reveal complex requirements that must be addressed, such as the need for supporting agents connecting brands to farmers, and market mechanisms, such as complex contracts and certification.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Key trends in international logistics are highlighted. The essence of the international supply chain in the conditions of the formation of a circular economy model is revealed. The advantages of the circular economy over the linear economy are substantiated. Successful examples of the organization of zero-waste supply chains in the activities of well-known companies according to the principles of sustainable development are presented. The circular economy is proven to be the best alternative in today’s circumstances, as it aims to use products, equipment and infrastructure for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources.  The article argues that a sensible solution is to shift the focus from a linear supply chain to a circular supply chain. Thus, we are talking about a logistics model that focuses on the full life cycle of products. By investing in services such as reverse logistics, IT asset allocation and offering resource recovery and recycling options, we can extend the use of products and therefore reduce the negative impact on the environment.  One of the most important steps on the way to the implementation of the circular economy is the reorganization of the international supply network and the transition from a linear supply chain to a circular one.  In recent years, organizations have begun to focus on sustainable practices to solve environmental, social and economic problems, forming an approach based on the adaptation of circular economy methods.  Circular economy is an economic system aimed at the elimination of waste and continuous use of resources. That is, waste becomes resources. Circular business systems involve reusing, sharing, repairing, renovating, recycling to create a closed loop system, minimizing resource use and waste generation, pollution and carbon emissions. The circular economy aims to use products, equipment and infrastructure for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources. Waste materials and energy must become input resources for other processes.  The introduction of circular economy requirements opens up new opportunities for the development of international supply chains, because it is obvious that products in the circular economy no longer conform to the traditional linear model.  Through circular supply chains, it is possible not only to reduce the production of waste, but also to achieve self-sustaining production systems in which materials are returned to the production cycle. Such supply chains apply to both the manufacturing and service sectors.  Therefore, the circular economy is increasingly recognized as a better alternative to the dominant linear economic model. Circular Supply Chain Management, which integrates circular economy philosophy into supply chain management, offers a new and compelling perspective for the field of sustainable business development. Accordingly, interest in research is growing.</jats:p>",

Two scenarios are developed:  Scenario 1 – BAU (Business as Usual) scenario, where the current energy structure prevailed, with trends like the current development. The electricity demand is satisfied by coal-fired thermal power plants, gas-fired thermal power plants, hydro power plants and renewable power plants. Scenario 2 – Green scenario, where gas-fired thermal power plants and nuclear power representative with small modular reactors are base load technologies, and also intensive construction of production capacities on renewable energy sources is forced. By making further analysis, the possibility of flexibility in the construction of new facilities within the interval, economic indicators, and appropriate impact on the environment are obtained. In order to make an economic analysis for a particular technology, calculations are made for parameters that are standard for projects, such as: net present value, benefit – cost ratio, payback period and internal rate of return.

The methodology here proposed combines the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) and a Multi-Criteria Evaluation methodology, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The SCOR model allows mapping and describing the supply chain. By consulting with experts, the AHP helps examine and select decisive chain operational aspects for successful performance allowing redesign. According to the proposed methodology and expert consultation, those metrics, attributes, and processes with lower weight, should be improved.

Its edible young leaves and grains are rich in protein, amino acids, microorganisms, and minerals. Although assessing the effects of fertilization on quinoa yield and quality has become an intensive area of research focus, the associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. As one of the three macro nutrients in plants, potassium has an important impact on plant growth and development.

The study was conducted on the basis of CFD modeling using the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) approach.\nThe analysis of the basic regularities of the course of these processes in the proposed microjet burners was carried out. In this case, special attention was paid to the consideration of the characteristics of flow and mixture formation in the aft region of the flame stabilizer, where vortex structures are formed that are responsible for stabilizing the torch.\nThe regularities of influence on the flow and mixture formation in the proposed burner devices of such factors as the row number NR of the jet fuel supply, the relative pitch, S/d, of the location of gas supply holes and the coefficient of excess air, α, have been investigated. The presence of noticeable differences in the structure of flow and mixture formation in burners during fuel supply to different rows of gas supply holes has been established. It is shown that aerodynamics and the pattern of mixing fuel and oxidizer undergo significant changes when varying the value of S/d.\nFor the considered burner devices, rational design parameters of the fuel supply system have been determined, at which favorable conditions for mixture formation in the field of flame stabilization are ensured. In particular, it is shown that the rational S/d values are 5.4; 5.6; and 5.8, respectively, for the first, second, and third sections of the fuel supply.\nThe results can be widely used in energy practice for objects operated under conditions of variable values of the coefficient of excess air</jats:p>"

Precipitation is a nonlinear, non-smooth time series with significant stochasticity and uncertainty. In this paper, a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) model is developed for predicting annual precipitation in Zhengzhou city, China, which is compared with a single LSTM model, an ensemble empirical mode decomposition–LSTM model, a complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition–LSTM model, and a CEEMDAN–autoregressive integrated moving average and a CEEMDAN–recurrent neural network model. The results show that the mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination of the coupled CEEMDAN–LSTM model are 2.69%, 17.37 mm, and 0.9863, respectively. The prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of the other five models, indicating that the proposed model has high prediction accuracy and can be used for annual precipitation forecasting in Zhengzhou city.</jats:p>",

In this study, a multi-scalar framework for attribution analysis was constructed by integrating hydrological modeling into the Budyko-based decomposition method. Then, the multi-scalar framework was employed in the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) as a case study. Moreover, the quantification results are compared with the simulation of a monthly water balance model (i.e., abcd model). The main results and findings indicate: (1) The mutation point of the annual streamflow is 1991 in the SRYR, and the monthly ABCD hydrological model achieves good performance in streamflow simulation for the prechange period and postchange period; (2) The contribution of climate change to streamflow variation is 65.99%, 37.50%, and 70.86% for annual, dry season, and wet season, respectively, indicating that climate change is the dominant factor controlling streamflow variation for the annual and wet season, while human activities play a major role in streamflow variation for dry season; (3) The contributions of climate change and human activities show obvious dynamic and seasonal characteristics, which are strongly affected by the transition between dry and wet seasons. Generally, the findings of this study provide valuable references for local reasonable water resource planning and management to make timely and appropriate use of the water supply.</jats:p>",

The solar‐storage supply system normally includes two types of converters, grid‐forming (GFM) and grid‐following (GFL) converters. Nevertheless, the incompatibility of the dynamic performance between the GFM and GFL converters due to different control schemes may introduce the transient instability risk to the solar‐storage supply system. To address this issue, it is extremely necessary to perform transient stability analysis and stability‐enhanced control for such a system. In this paper, a sixth‐order model of the dc‐link timescale for the solar‐storage supply system is developed, whose accuracy and applicability are verified by comparing with the detailed electromagnetic model. Based on the derived model, the analysis demonstrates that the solar‐storage supply system faces the potential risk of transient instability under large disturbances of sudden load variation, due to the mismatch of the transient response speeds between virtual excitation control of the GFM converter and dc voltage control of the GFL converter. The transient stability boundary of the system is quantitatively investigated, by depicting the basin of attraction of the post‐disturbance equilibrium point. Furthermore, from the perspective of improving the coordination of the transient behaviours between the GFM converter and the GFL converter, the parameters related to virtual excitation control and dc voltage control are designed to enhance the transient stability of the system. Time‐domain simulations and real‐time simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis.</jats:p><jats:p>DC–AC power convertors, microgrids, power system control, power system transient stability, renewable energy power conversion</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While the paradigm of circular economy (CE) and the processes of socio-technical transition have been broadly investigated at the theoretical level, understanding how the transition toward circular models can be implemented in practice is still limited. This contribution aims to provide in-depth and evidence-based insights on an emerging pathway for the operability of CE into the olive oil supply chain. A case study from the Apulia region (the leading olive oil producing area in Italy) is presented to show how an existing business model can be transformed into a circular one, and to what extent it can be replicated. The study focuses on a vertically integrated firm, in which a new industrial process has been introduced to manage olive pomace, which is one of the most important by-products obtained from olive oil extraction. The empirical analysis is built on the Circular Business Model Canvas (CBMC), which is conceived as a suitable theoretical and methodological tool to speed up the transition process toward CE at a micro-economic level. This analytical framework allows us to identify the interplaying elements that the firm combines to capture, create, and deliver value, as well as the relationships with the broader economic system. Particular attention is paid to two distinctive components of CBMC: material loops and adoption factors. Also, internal and external factors affecting the adoption of the new circular business model have been discussed by separating drivers and barriers of the transition process.</jats:p>"

Regarding the IRA, both the Korea-US negotiations and the Korea-China negotiations have important meaning considering the future growth engines of electric vehicles and batteries. In negotiations with the United States, it is desirable for Korea to recognize that the nature of the issue is derived from the multilateral economic hegemony of the United States, and to engage in negotiations based on principle, that is, a problem-solving attitude that excludes political and diplomatic relations with both the United States and China. For the US, it is desirable to pursue a strategy that maximizes the actual benefits that can be obtained from local foreign direct investment rather than focusing on the application of exceptions to the IRA Act. If Korea fully accepts the US position on the IRA and makes a decision against China’s interests, there may be a threat of retaliation from China, and we must prepare for this at various levels.</jats:p>",

In this context, this study is aimed to discuss the implications of COVID19 in textiles sector in India along with major issues and challenges on demand and supply sides. This study determines the impact of crisis which affected demand and supply in textiles and fashion industry. COVID-19 has several implications for this industry, be it from demand or production. Its presence is observed in different aspects of the industry. This study uses secondary data collected from various sources like studies published in peer-reviewed journals. This study focuses on the need to think differently to deal with this unexpected crisis. Relaxation of tax compliance rules and deadlines, especially for small-scale segments is one of the potential solutions, so that the conditions of customer demand are not affected directly. In addition, more comprehensive financial relief package could be announced for textiles sector, considering the export- and labor-intensive processes to stem the adverse effects of pandemic. Rebates on exporters could be the next major step against the remission of taxes or duties on exports. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 crisis. More studies would be needed in post COVID era to generalize the findings. The combative measures and actual impact may be evolutionary and dynamic. The analysis focuses on the “out of the box” thinking to deal with unexpected crisis, but it may have different aspects to be discussed as the crisis unfolds. There is a lack of significant research on the impact of COVID-19 on textile industry in India. This study could be the stepping stone for researchers to study the impact on textiles sector and help policymakers to prepare for unexpected crises in future.</jats:p>"

Grass, silver, and bighead carp were selected as the research targets, and the impact of waterway regulation and the effect of gravel mounds on the target fish habitat were studied using numerical simulation. The results show that the original channel's hydraulic environment is similar to the artificial channel, and the target fish spawning habitat is limited, which is an important reason for the shortage of fish resources in the research area. The reconstructed channel can meet the river's navigation demands and improve the channel's flood discharge capacity. The habitat method was used to estimate the minimum and appropriate ecological flows of the target fish at each growth stage in the original and reconstructed rivers. Under the appropriate ecological flow, the weighted usable area (WUA) of juvenile, migratory, and spawning habitats of the target fish in the reconstructed river increased by 168, 24, and 580%, respectively, compared to the original channel, while the WUA of adult fish that preferred a slow-water environment decreased by 62%, effectively improving the target fish's spawning environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the leakage in water distribution systems operating with plastic pipes occurs at service connections (SCs), while the existing tools plan rehabilitation of pipes. With limited water resources, intermittent supplies in arid regions further enhance the failure vulnerability of metal fittings on water mains due to scale formation and large pressure transients. The present research developed a risk-based methodology for the proactive maintenance of SCs in intermittent water supply systems. A five-generation bottom-up hierarchical approach aggregated the basic hydraulic, physical, and water quality factors to determine the vulnerability of structural failures of SCs. Hydraulic parameters (pressure and velocity) were estimated by simulating a distribution network of 366 water mains of diameters ranging from 110 mm to 225 mm serving 371 SCs in a residential neighborhood located in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. Age, depth, and length of SCs’ estimated the condition index, while soil corrosivity and condition of the water mains were also counted when assessing the structural failure index for each SC. Water quality parameters, e.g., pH, turbidity, and iron, that can contribute to the vulnerability of an SC’s failure were also included. Fuzzy-based methods first assessed the relative importance weights of the basic input parameters at the bottom of the hierarchy and the risk factors in the middle of the hierarchy. Subsequently, the performance and condition scores were aggregated to develop respective indices. As the consequence of structural failure is high for the SCs serving households with a large number of residents, the final risk index aggregates the vulnerability and consequence at the hierarchy’s top. The developed model was effectively validated by comparing the SCs of high priority with the leaking and repaired SCs in the past. The method will be a useful tool for planning proactive inspection and rehabilitation of SCs of intermittent supply systems to minimize water losses (less than 8% of the national benchmark) in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.</jats:p>"

But behind that there is still hope in the agricultural sector, where agricultural exports continue to grow 15.4% in 2020 and 16.4% in 2021. This is supported by exports of the commodity porang. Porang received full attention from President Joko Widodo, he instructed the Minister of Agriculture to make porang a mainstay export commodity. In 2020, porang exports were 20,476 tons with an export value of Rp.924.3 billion. Indonesia is only able to serve 20% of the world's porang needs. In 2020, Bali is only able to meet the export of 185 tons of porang from the total demand of 750 tons per year for China. Seeing this opportunity, the people of Mundeh, Belatungan and Batungsel villages planted porang. However, problems arise during the harvest season, many porang are not sold. Problem: How is the flow of the porang supply chain. Research Objectives: To find out the porang supply chain starting from farmers, collectors, factories and suppliers. Research Methods: Qualitative Exploratory with Supply Chain Management techniques. The results of the study indicate that there is a flow of material, information and finance from the level of farmers, middlemen, suppliers, factories and buyers.</jats:p>",

The correlation between the variables and the degree of sediment contamination was verified using the Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), Contamination Factor (CF), and Pollutant Load Index (PLI). The general concentrations of the metals were in the order Mn &amp;gt; B &amp;gt; Ba &amp;gt; Zn &amp;gt; Cu &amp;gt; Cr &amp;gt; Pb &amp;gt; Ni in the water and Mn &amp;gt; Cr &amp;gt; Ba ≥ B &amp;gt; Zn &amp;gt; Cu &amp;gt; Ni &amp;gt; Pb in the sediment. The concentrations of Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and TP in the water exceeded the regulatory limits at least one time. The mean concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Ni in the sediment samples were 6.32, 1.63, and 2.61 higher than standard values. The applied geochemical indices indicated a moderate to a very high degree of sediment contamination, suggesting the anthropogenic origin of Cr, Cu, and Ni. Significant Pearson correlations were observed between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS), Ba, Cr, Mn, Zn, and TP.

The re-liquefaction system and FSS were installed independently in a conventional LPG carrier, while those systems were combined in the novel system. The condensed LPG in the re-liquefaction system was directly transferred to the FSS without the cooling and expansion process in the novel system. 84,000 m3 LPG carrier equipped with a 10 MW engine at normal continuous rating (NCR) was selected as a target ship. Aspen HYSYS ver.12.1 was employed for process simulation. The results showed that the energy consumption for the novel system was reduced by 38%. The energy for re-liquefaction was decreased because the flow rate recirculated was decreased, and the energy for FSS was reduced as the temperature of the stream supplied to the FSS was relatively high in the novel system. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of the parameters on the results. The investigated parameters were LPG compositions, seawater temperature, compressor efficiency, and pump efficiency. The energy consumption for the system was significantly different depending on the LPG composition, and the energy consumption was changed by 2.5% for conventional systems and 0.9% for the novel systems with the variation of 4 °C seawater temperature. The energy for the novel system was reduced by 2.8% for conventional systems and 2.3% for the novel systems with the 5% increment of compressor efficiency, whereas pump efficiency had little effect on the results.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the research, combined with the laboratory tests preceding the treatment, guides the definition of the proper operating conditions of the Water Treatment Plant; in other words, they technically improve and reduce costs. The test in static reactors stands out, what allows the evaluation of the coagulation and flocculation processes and their effects in the following phases of treatment. Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the efficiency of the coagulation and flocculation process in the treatment of different raw water for public supply in a medium-sized city in the state of Mato Grosso. Water samples were collected from the Queima-Pé stream and the Sepotuba river during different seasonal periods. The methodology was based on the following steps: preparation of a third sample with a mixture of 50% of the waters; raw water characterization and tests in static reactors. The results emphasize that rainfall influenced mainly in the water colors. Regarding the Sepotuba River, during the drought period, mainly in the months of July, August and September, the turbidity of the raw water proved to be inferior and close to the potability standard established by Brazilian legislation. However, the formation of very fine and small flakes was observed, with moderate color removal efficiency and turbidity reaching a maximum value of 37%, which can be justified by the reduced alkalinity of the raw water. That way, it is recommended to add an alkalizing agent in order to make the treatment more efficient.\nKeywords: Water Treatment. Jar Test. Water Mixtures. Potability.</jats:p>"

These stations receive primary energy from renewable sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines. At the same time, the condition of the problem includes the availability of information on several perspective areas in this region for the placement of such power stations, as well as information of values and distribution of loads. The developed algorithm for solving of the optimal location selection problem of power stations consists of several stages. The content of the first stage of the algorithm is ranking of possible areas for the location of power stations using local criteria, which are proposed as the specific estimated cost of station arrangement, the remoteness of the proposed location of the power station from loads and settlements. The second stage of the algorithm consists in a set formation of possible areas for the location of stations. And at the final stage of the algorithm, they are ranked using system criteria that evaluate these sets of areas for the location of power stations as a power supply system. The estimated cost of a power supply system arrangement based on power stations, located on areas of the rated set, the specific estimated cost of power stations arrangement, applied to the set of power stations with power lines as an autonomous power supply system, as well as the average rating of areas are proposed as system criteria. In this case, the decision maker, after familiarizing with values of system criteria, sets critical boundaries for each of them. The result of the algorithm is a certain totality of prospective sets for the location of several power stations in a given region, estimates of which according to system criteria are the best correspond to preferences of the decision maker. A feature of the proposed approach is the participation of the decision maker at all stages of design.</jats:p>"

This advantage can be achieved through a process that ensures the production of high-value product characters desired by consumers. The dominant indicator of value in commodities is quality.

In the literature, the optimal scale of farmland management is mainly discussed from the perspective of farmland lessees. The development of a healthy farmland transfer market should also consider the needs of farmland lessors. In this paper, we construct a farmland transfer supply function from the perspective of farmers, based on the theory of land market pricing, and apply it to assess the price–volume relationship using surveyed farmland transfer data on wheat farmers in Henan Province, China. The major findings of the present study are as follows: (i) farmers can optimize the allocation of production factors through the farmland transfer market to maximize their profits, and (ii) the quantity of farmland transferred to the market is significantly positively correlated with the price of farmland transferred, demonstrating a power function relation. Currently, the average price of farmland transferred in China’s main grain-producing areas exceeds CNY 800 per mu. There is a difference between the actual quantity of farmland transferred and the supply function estimated in this paper, indicating that the market is currently in a crucial period of vigorously promoting farmland transfer. We suggest that government departments follow the laws of farmland transfer, refer to the farmland transfer supply function, and implement policies that support and benefit grain production to provide rapid and consistent guidance to the farmland transfer market.</jats:p>"

The current study aims to model competitiveness and comparison between two closed-loop three-level supply chains, each of which includes a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third party to collect the products used by the customer, taking into account the concepts of game theory and the existence of aggregates. Moreover, a separate supplier for each chain is considered. In the forward supply chain, the manufacturer produces new products using new components or re-used products that have been collected from the consumer, then sells these products mainly to the retailer, and the retailer sells them. In the reverse chain, the collector provides the used products to the manufacturer after collection. The study utilized the definitions and concepts of game theory to model this closed loop chain as a Stackelberg game to obtain the optimal value of wholesale and retail price and the optimal value of the product return coefficient for the collector. Finally, the models based on some numerical examples are solved. Given the results, the remanufacturing costs have a significant role in making more profits for all members in such chains, and competitive chains should attempt to remanufacture the products at lower costs.</jats:p>",

Under certain costs, production and timber prices assumptions, payments ranged from $62.23 ($26.97–$105.87) ac/yr. for loblolly pine plantations and $399.17 ($189.80–$628.72) ac/yr. for Douglas-fir plantations. Our results indicate that higher carbon sequestration occurs with higher site index, higher trees per acre, and in unthinned stands. Significant variability within and between species was heavily dependent on the number of years that final harvest was postponed. In addition, we show the effect of prices on the quantity supplied under multiple silvicultural treatments. The study should assist willing forest landowners and potential partners to determine initial reservation prices for carbon sequestration and temporary provision for a 1-year period in line with programs offering this contracting mechanism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>SISTRO, a truck scheduling and management system, was developed to optimize stock fulfillment following the government regulation (Peraturan Menteri Perdagangan/Permendag) and the distribution process of subsidized fertilizer from Gresik Warehouse of PT Petrokimia Gresik (PG) to Buffer Warehouse located in almost every province in Java Island. The volume that must be distributed is around 5.4 million tons of fertilizer/year. During the implementation, a critical problem is the lack of integration and single information about the supply chain and truck loading process. The information includes (1) truck arrival delay, (2) the difference between planning and reality, and (3) the availability of workers. These three pieces of information are out of sync, so they have direct and indirect impacts. The direct impact is the potential for unscheduled open storage (OPS) in Gresik warehouse. At the same time, the indirect impact is the high logistics costs in the form of land transportation cost increases every year and the potential to lose the opportunity/moment to sell goods due to delays in fertilizer distribution. Therefore, a solution is needed by creating an integrated system to accommodate related parties in truck schedule arrivals, stock availability, and labor availability in the loading line warehouse, hereinafter referred to as SISTRO. The SISTRO’s scope of work starts from the distribution of quota allocations for heavy loading that has been adjusted to stock conditions and loading capacity in each warehouse so that the truck vendors can book the loading plan according to the schedule they want, based on the POSTO that has been uploaded on the SISTRO application and partners will get a booking code. The booking code will later be printed as a security pass. The security pass will later be scanned at all SISTRO checkpoints, which is proven can reduce the number of late arrivals for trucks to load appropriately from an average of 1.361 events/month to just 553 events/month. This project impacts several sectors, including reducing the risk of losing chances to sell goods that previously averaged 24,034 tons/month equivalent to Rp. 110 billion/month, a decrease in the OPS quantity (which is currently happening due to oversupply that does not match with quantum distribution). There has been no increase in inland transportation costs for 3 years and monitoring all license numbers and transportation partners so that there is no combined number of registration numbers. In fact, SISTRO can be used by all logistics companies.</jats:p>"

With the help of expert opinion, the identified factors were validated and then categorised based on technological—organisational—environmental (TOE) and supply chain (SC) theories to propose a framework. The Pakistani Pharmaceutical sector firms were selected to investigate the cause and effect relationship among the factors, their interdependencies, and impact on overall PSC performance. This investigation was supported by a novel integrated analytic model composed of best worst method (BWM), decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and analytical network process (ANP) methods. The results indicate that ‘human resource skills, competencies, and involvement’, ‘process improvement and healthcare reform, and manufacturing’, and ‘distribution and inventory management’ are the top three factors that have a high impact on the overall PSC performance. This study outcome help inform decision‐makers and managers in the healthcare sector in formulating strategies to improve their SC performance.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates how consumers’ environmental awareness and recycling cost-saving affect the optimal combination of recycling channel and logistics-service strategy. To this end, we mathematically formulate the supplier-led Stackelberg game theoretical-framework, and apply the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions for constrained optimization. We examine the optimal combination under the impact of consumers’ environmental awareness and recycling cost-saving on profits, environmental impact and social welfare, using numerical analysis. Results demonstrate that as consumers’ environmental awareness and recycling cost-saving remain at a higher level, the supplier and retailer will both achieve maximum profits when the supplier entrusts the retailer to recycle and the retailer undertakes the logistics services. Meanwhile, the third party will choose to be entrusted with services by the supplier, rather than the retailer. To improve supply-chain performance, the retailer should assume social responsibility to recycle and build the logistics-service system.</jats:p>"

A primary concern of this issue is a result of a higher competence demanded by employers, the change in the industry, competition among graduates, and new global economic practices. Enabling industries to lead curriculum development is one of the initiatives in enhancing the quality of the programme to improve graduate employability and producing quality technical and vocational education and training (TVET) graduates. Despite the various  models  that  have  been  employed  towards  individual  career development,  there  are  problems  of  job  skills mismatch and the lack  of  qualified  graduates  with  technical  and  non-technical skills. Thus, this study attempts to clarify  a  mismatch  in  the  supply  and  demand  of  building  surveying  graduates'  skills  from  the  perspectives  of  employers,  lecturers,  and  the students. This  study  investigates  building  surveying  academicians  and  the  industry’s  perspective regarding building surveying graduates’ performance, as well as to identify students’ awareness towardsthe current industry demand. Data for this study was collected using a qualitative method approach that involved a semi-structured interview with 10 building surveying students, 5 lecturers, and 5 building surveyor practitioners; the non-probability sampling design that was used in this study was based on the snowball sampling technique, and acontent  analysis  approach  had  been  employed  in  the  analysis  of  the data  using  NVivo  11  software.  The  findings  indicate that there is a mismatch in the supply and demand of building surveying graduates’ skills. This study offers an important insight into the building surveying programme towards the improvement of the programme’s syllabus and its learning outcomes. The study suggests that building surveying graduates should acquire and demonstrate both technical and non-technical  skills  that  are   demanded by the industry. Further research is suggested to identify the competency level among entry-level building surveyor graduates in real working practices.</jats:p>"

Chlorine has been used as an oxidant or algicide to treat cyanobacteria-laden source waters, but influences of chlorination on the cellular structure and metabolic activity of cyanobacterial cells were not well understood. In this study, after chlorination with various initial dosages (0.5–8.0 mg L−1), the cellular size, cellular surface, and cellular structure of Microcystis cells were investigated, and both photosynthetic and respiratory activity of Microcystis cells were also analyzed. Results showed that chlorination of 1–8 mg L−1 could effectively decrease the metabolic activity of Microcystis cells and their cellular structures were severely destroyed (e.g., cell wall, cell membrane, and photosynthetic lamellar). Meanwhile, Microcystis aggregates induced an increase of their particle size distribution of 10–100 μm (1.2–1.9%) in these treatments. In contrast, low-level chlorination of 0.5 mg L−1 did not change the particle size distribution of 2–10 μm along with a slight destruction of cellular structures. Interestingly, this treatment could induce an increase of photosynthetic activity of Microcystis cells (19.0%), implying that insufficient chlorination may not be a proper algicide to control cyanobacterial blooms in lakes or reservoirs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Weed management in large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSS-PV) farms has become a great concern to the solar industry due to scarcity of labour and the ever-increasing price of pesticides, which opens up possibilities for integrated farming, also known as agrivoltaics. Improper weed control may have multiple negative impacts such as permanent shading of the module surface, pest housing which damages communication cables, and even bush fires. The shaded PV modules can be heated up to extreme temperatures, causing costly burn-out damage. Critical information on the types of weeds on solar farms, especially in Malaysia, has not been established to support the concept of weed management. Thus, with this study, detailed composition of the weed community was obtained via quadrat sampling between solar PV modules, near ground equipment, near perimeter fencing, and directly underneath the PV modules. Weed-control measures via high-quality weedmat installation under solar PV arrays have been implemented where this approach can be considered effective on solar farms based on the existing PV structure height and equipment constraints plus the increasing cost for labour and agricultural inputs. This work underlines the proposed Agrivoltaic for Large Scale Solar (Agrivoltaic4LSS) program to complement the solar industry in Malaysia towards an agrivoltaic, eco-friendly approach to weed management.</jats:p>"

This study addresses the effects of elevated CO2 in combination with low nutrient supply on Lemna minor (common duckweed). We quantified plant growth rate and nutritional quality (protein content) and evaluated whether any adverse effects of elevated CO2, low nutrients, or the combination of the two could be mitigated by plant-microbe interaction. Plants were grown under controlled conditions and were either uninoculated or inoculated with microorganisms from a local pond that supported L. minor populations. Under low nutrients in combination with high CO2, growth (plant area expansion rate) decreased and biomass accumulation increased, albeit with lower nutritional quality (lower percentage of protein per plant biomass). Inoculation with plant-associated microorganisms restored area expansion rate and further stimulated biomass accumulation while supporting a high protein-to-biomass ratio and, thus, a high nutritional quality. These findings indicate that plant-microbe interaction can support a higher nutritional quality of plant biomass under elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, an important finding for both human and non-human consumers during a time of rapid environmental change.</jats:p>"

Biochar can be used to replace part of N fertilizer for rice production. A field experiment of 2-year/four-season was conducted to investigate the effects of N fertilizer reduction combined with rice straw biochar application on rice yield, soil fertility, and N use efficiency. The experiment contained six treatments: No N application (CK), customary N application (N100), 20% N reduction (N80), 20% N reduction + biochar (N80+BC), 40% N reduction (N60), and 40% N reduction + biochar (N60+BC). Compared with N100, N reduction alone had no significant impact on the number of tillers and aboveground biomass of rice, exceptfor N60 which slightly reduced grain yield, while biochar incorporation tended to obtain higher tillers, aboveground biomass, and grain yield of rice compared with N reduction alone. The average contribution of biochar to grain yield on the basis of N80 and N60 were 5.8% and 7.7%, respectively. Notably, biochar incorporation further improved the agronomic N efficiency (54.5–309.4% over N100) and apparent N recovery (25.7–150.5% over N100) on the basis of N reduction. Furthermore, biochar application could not only maintain N nutrition level of rice, but also improve soil fertility mainly by increasing soil pH and organic matter. Therefore, integrated application of mineral N fertilizer and biochar is a feasible nutrient management measure to increase rice yield and soil fertility, and improve N use efficiency in paddy ecosystem.</jats:p>"

It is hypothesized that renal and lower limb oxygen supply during LBP is superior to off-pump surgery and comparable to that of a standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods: in this prospective single-center study, patients aged &lt;1 year were recruited if they were scheduled for a correction of aortic arch anomalies using antegrade cerebral perfusion and LBP (group 1), a repair of coarctation during aortic cross-clamping (group 2), or surgery under whole-body CPB (group 3). Renal (prefix “r”) and peripheral (prefix “p”) oxygen saturation (SO2), hemoglobin amount (Hb), blood velocity (Velo), and blood flow (Flow) were measured noninvasively. Results: A total of 23 patients were included (group 1, n = 9; group 2, n = 5; group 3, n = 9). Compared to the baseline values, rSO2 and pSO2 decreased significantly in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3. Conversely, rHB significantly increased in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3, reflecting abdominal venous stasis. Compared to group 3, group 1 showed a significantly lower pFlow during CPB; however, rFlow, pFlow, and pVelo did not differ. Conclusion: according to these observations, LBP results in an improved renal oxygen supply compared to off-pump surgery and may prove to be a promising alternative to conventional CPB.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The year 2022 was marked for the world as the year of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. The war caused considerable damage, not only to the Ukrainian economy, but also disrupted global economic relations. The agricultural sector was especially affected as agricultural enterprises cannot transfer their capacity to other, safer regions, like other sector enterprises, to conduct their activities. A significant part of the grain harvest was lost due to the war, so taking into account that Ukraine is one of the main exporters of grain, many countries did not receive the ordered deliveries. Among grains, in terms of value, wheat ranks third after corn and rice. Wheat is used not only for consumption but is also exported as seeds. Obstacles to harvesting, transportation, and export of wheat have become an extremely urgent issue for countries that are very dependent on the supplies of Ukrainian wheat. The purpose of the study is to develop a model of the Ukrainian wheat supply system in war conditions for groups of importing countries in terms of the volume and stability of supplies, to ensure food security. The ABC-XYZ analysis was used while conducting the study. This method is based on the use of statistical data on the volume of Ukrainian wheat supplies to other countries. According to this method, all countries are grouped in terms of their order volume and stability. This approach indicates the countries that are strategically important for Ukraine as a wheat exporter. As the results of the analysis show, at the beginning of the war, the behaviours of the wheat-importing countries changed. If they could previously diversify the wheat supply channels, choosing the most profitable channels for themselves, since 2022, many countries have cancelled supplies of wheat from the Russian Federation and have become more dependent on other producers. In addition, unfavourable weather conditions and the desire of powerful wheat producers to create additional stocks of wheat for their own needs have been added. It was found that such countries as Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Yemen, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Libya are most dependent on Ukrainian wheat and have positive previous experiences of cooperation with Ukraine. The presented logistics model of wheat supply can be adapted to new changes, but the ultimate goal of its implementation should be to indicate conditions to ensure global food security.</jats:p>",

To address these issues, a cascade control strategy of sliding mode control (SMC) and Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) control is proposed in this study. The goal of the control strategy is to enhance the PEMFC’s net power by adjusting the oxygen excess ratio (OER) to the reference value in the occurrence of a load change. In order to estimate the cathode pressure and reconstruct the OER, an expansion state observer (ESO) is developed. The study found that there is a maximum error of about 2200Pa between the estimated cathode pressure and the actual pressure. Then the tracking of the actual OER to the reference OER is realized by the SMC and PID cascade control. The simulation study, which compared the control performance of several methods—including PID controller, adaptive fuzzy PID controller and the proposed controller, i.e., the SMC and PID cascade controller—was carried out under various load-changing scenarios. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed SMC and PID cascade controller method really does have a faster response time. The overshoot is reduced by approximately 3.4% compared to PID control and by about 0.09% compared to fuzzy adaptive PID. SMC and PID cascade control reference OER performs more effectively in terms of tracking compared to PID control and adaptive fuzzy PID control.</jats:p>"

The results show that different strategies of involvement explain different NPD success. We observed that integrative practices involving three distant actors have a positive impact on all NPD success indicators. We also observed that NPD success related to specific purposes, for example, market or internal processes, can be obtained with simpler combinations of collaboration. This shows the significance of choosing a differentiated portfolio of SC partners based on cognitive distance to achieve success in different NPD performance measures. Our results confirm that the types of partners are determinants in achieving different NPD success and that there are different alternatives to achieve success.

Therefore, the objective of this work is to present a methodology to select the best WEC-site combination to supply the energy demands of ports. To illustrate this methodology, the Port of Leixões (Portugal) is used as a case study. For the selection of wave energy sites in port areas, the methodology proposes a detailed spatial characterisation of both the wave resource and marine uses. For the area of study, having considered the main marine uses (sediment disposal, biodiversity, aquaculture, recreational and navigation), two exploitable wave energy sites (Areas I and II) with average annual energy resources of 24 and 17 kWm−1, respectively, were found. Next, the methodology proposes a techno-economic optimisation of WECs, based on the local wave conditions of Areas I and II, to minimise their associated Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE). The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the methodology, with the novel oCECO device, appearing as the most feasible option (with an LCoE of EUR 387.6/MWh) to exploit the wave potential in the surrounding areas of the port.</jats:p>"

The PVSD model captures the convective transport of Cu(II) from the bulk solution to the biosorbent surface, followed by its surface and pore diffusion inside the biosorbent. The adsorption of Cu(II) is mimicked using the Langmuir isotherm. The algebraic, ordinary, and partial differential equations, involved in the PVSD model, are solved using the general process modeling system (gPROMS). The model simulation results, depicted by the Cu(II) concentration decay curve, show an excellent match with experimental data. The external mass transfer coefficient (≈10−3 m/s) indicated no restriction on approaching Cu(II) toward the biosorbent surface. Within the biosorbent, surface diffusion was dominant over pore volume diffusion. The statistical analysis of the PVSD model results has been done by calculating R2, Chi-square value, normalized standard deviation, p-value, and root-mean-square error. The PVSD model approach presented in this work could be beneficial to other heavy metal–biosorbent systems.</jats:p>",

There is uncertainty in the reliability of supply chain facilities for reasons such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, labor errors, and weather conditions. Therefore, when making strategic decisions, the system will continue to operate with minimal damage. Over the course of this study, the uncertainty of supplier layers in the supply chain has been modeled. To meet that aim, the issue of supply chain, including producers, warehouses, suppliers and consumers are considered. To calculate the cost of breakdowns due to the non-functioning of distributors, the scenario-building method has been utilized. Finally, the desired model is solved with Gomez software and the results are presented.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has led many countries to intensify the development and production of the COVID-19 vaccine. and some countries have even required universal vaccination against this epidemic. However, such popularization of vaccination has also exposed various flaws in vaccine management that existed in the past, and vaccinators have become more concerned about the effectiveness of their vaccinations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based traceable vaccine management system. First, the system uses smart contracts to store the records generated during the whole process, from vaccine production to vaccination. Second, the proposed scheme uses the Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) to guarantee the security and integrity of these data. Third, the system participants can access the corresponding data according to their authority to ensure the transparency of the whole system operation process. Finally, this paper will also conduct a security analysis of the whole system to ensure that the system can resist potential attacks by criminals.</jats:p>"

By measuring quality parameters such as temperature and humidity, real-time sensors are technologies that can continuously monitor the quality of food and thereby help reduce FLW. While there is enough literature on sensors, there is still a lack of understanding on how, where and to what extent these sensors have been applied to monitor FLW. In this paper, a systematic review of 59 published studies focused on sensor technologies to reduce food waste in food supply chains was performed with a view to synthesising the experience and lessons learnt. This review examines two aspects of the field, namely, the type of IoT technologies applied and the characteristics of the supply chains in which it has been deployed. Supply chain characteristics according to the type of product, supply chain stage, and region were examined, while sensor technology explores the monitored parameters, communication protocols, data storage, and application layers. This article shows that, while due to their high perishability and short shelf lives, monitoring fruit and vegetables using a combination of temperature and humidity sensors is the most recurring goal of the research, there are many other applications and technologies being explored in the research space for the reduction of food waste. In addition, it was demonstrated that there is huge potential in the field, and that IoT technologies should be continually explored and applied to improve food production, management, transportation, and storage to support the cause of reducing FLW.</jats:p>"

It represents one of the new era’s most important economic growth points. How to use the advantages of the digital economy to escape the “Malthusian trap” has always been an essential part of the attention of economists and policymakers. This paper investigates the degree of development of China’s digital economy and employs the entropy method and fixed-effect model to test how the digital economy has impacted high-quality economic development. Based on the study, digital economy development significantly promotes high-quality economic development. After controlling various factors that influence high-quality economic development and using instrumental variables to correct endogenous estimation biases, the results remain stable. The analysis also finds that the digital economy in economically backward areas has a more significant impact on high-quality economic development. In addition, the analysis of Nax’s “Vicious Circle of Poverty” theory shows that the digital economy can promote high-quality economic development through the supply and demand effect. Therefore, it is imperative to actively promote digital economy development and form a dynamic balance between supply and demand at a higher level by stimulating the consumption potential to ensure high-quality economic growth.</jats:p>"

Identifying ecological security patterns (ESPs) for urban agglomerations serves as an effective way to sustain regional ecological security and promote harmonious ecological conservation and economic development. Focusing on the Fujian Delta Urban Agglomeration (FDUA) as an example, this study aims to present a framework for linking the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) to identify ESPs in 2020. First, the ecological sources are delimited by coupling the supply and demand of four critical ESs (carbon storage, water provision, grain production, and outdoor recreation). Afterward, the resistance coefficient is modified using nighttime light intensity data and the ecological risk index, the second of which combines the effects of the soil erosion sensitivity index, the geological disaster risk index, and the land desertification risk index. Then, ecological corridors are determined by employing the minimum cumulative resistance method. With the integration of ecological sources and corridors, the ESPs of the FDUA can be identified. The results show a distinct supply–demand mismatch for ESs, with supply exhibiting an upward gradient from coastal cities to inland mountain cities and demand showing the opposite trend. The ESPs consist of 8359 km2 of ecological sources that are predominantly forests, 171 ecological corridors with a total length of 789.04 km, 34 pinch points, 26 barriers, and 48 break points. This paper presents a realizable approach for constructing ESPs for urban agglomerations, which will help decision makers optimize ecological sources and ecological protection policies.</jats:p>"

To test these hypotheses, performance on a bimanual tracking task at 4 complexity levels and associated brain activation were assessed in 3 age groups (20–40, 40–60, and 60–80 years, n = 99). All age groups showed decreased tracking accuracy and increased brain activation with increased task complexity, with larger performance decrements and activation increases in the older age groups. Older adults exhibited increased brain activation at a lower complexity level, but not the predicted failure to further increase brain activity at the highest complexity level. We conclude that older adults show more brain activation than younger adults and preserve the capacity to deploy increased neural resources as a function of task demand.</jats:p>",

The authors evaluate the bibliography and whether there is mention of the document issued by CONITEC (National Comission on the Incorporation of Technology to Brazil’s Unified Health System), the issuing body, and whether the urgency of the request was considered justifiable. Method: Search at Natjus websites of the term ‘’Miglustat’’. Duplicate notes or notes that addressed other diseases were excluded. Results: 23 Notes were found, 14 of which were favorable and 9 were not favorable. As for urgency, 9 notes considered that there was urgency and 9 concluded there was none, while 4 did not approach urgency. In 18 notes the CONITEC document was mentioned, while it was not mentioned in 5. We found 2 articles with a high degree of evidence, published after 2019, on the topic. Discussion: It was to be expected that the technical notes favorable to the release would present studies not evaluated by CONITEC, with new information. When reading the bibliography, only note 01/2021 cites these articles. None of the other 20 notes, favorable or not to the release, cite the articles, while 2 notes do not present a bibliography. Conclusion: This survey indicates a lack of standardization in the preparation of technical notes, with notes on the same subject altered according to the issuing entity. The bibliographic survey of the notes appears to be flawed by not discussing works with a high level of evidence regarding survival and therapeutic gains. Further work on technical notes is needed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on a review of scientific literature, as well as a detailed analysis of business processes, it should be stated that the increase in the volume of sales on a global scale generates not only the need to analyse the development of business, but above all the need to conduct scientific research in the field of improving logistics processes and information flow in the supply chain. The relatively long time of delivery of ordered goods, the complexity of customs processes and logistic service make it necessary to apply innovative digitalization solutions in order to be able to monitor and react quickly to disruptions. These analyses are most noticeable in global supply chains, which is why the New Silk Road became the research area. In this paper, the authors focused on conducting a review of digitalisation solutions that improve the efficiency in supply chains. The review was conducted both in the research aspect, by verifying knowledge on the subject in the scientific literature available on the Web of Science and Scopus databases, but also in the practical aspect, by analysing needs and trends in the use of supply chain digitalisation in business practice. The research aspect was based on the application of the CANVAS model for the identification of business needs in the supply chain digitalisation aspect and on surveys for importance degree analysis for the identified needs in business practice. The research carried out in this area is the result of cooperation between Lukasiewicz Research Network – Poznan Institute of Technology and Poznan School of Logistics. The research was conducted in 2021 and the first half of 2022 among Polish logistic companies.</jats:p>",

Taking the Eichmann Lake wetland of the Aksu River Basin in Xinjiang as the research area, the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics of the lake and the response of ecological water in recent years were studied based on remote sensing images and monitoring data. The results show that: (1) The water surface area of Eichmann Lake is shrinking, from 61.57 km2 in 1996 to 27.76 km2 in 2020. The changes in water surface area have experienced three stages: rapid decline, slow decline, and slow recovery. After the ecological water supply, the water surface area has obvious seasonal changes with hysteresis; (2) In areas with a low average water level, the ecological water supply has a significant impact on the groundwater level. The higher the water supply is, the higher the groundwater level will be. There is a significant lag effect between the change in the groundwater level and the response of the ecological water supply, which is 1–2 months; (3) The response characteristics of different natural vegetation to the ecological water supply were different in interannual, seasonal, and spatial contexts. The response of Populus euphratica to the ecological water supply is obvious, and its growth is the best within the range of 100–500 m from the water supply outlet. This research can provide the basis for the rational allocation of the Aksu River Basin’s water resources, and also act as a valuable reference for the restoration and reconstruction of surrounding vegetation in the Aksu River irrigation area.</jats:p>"

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the two independent sample t-tests were used to obtain the distribution with the highest degree of fitting, and the probability distribution and expected value of average annual household water consumption were obtained from the distribution probability function. The results demonstrated that the Birnbaum–Saunders distribution was the optimal distribution; families comprising one and two generations were dominant in terms of water consumption; and the number of water-saving households was far less than that of households with high levels of water consumption. The findings of this study have valuable implications for water governance and the domestic water planning.</jats:p>",

Climate change may, however, affect the potential of RE and its related technologies. This study investigated the impact of climate change on photovoltaic cells’ temperature response and energy potential under two CO2 emission scenarios, RCP2.6 and 8.5, for the near future (2024–2040) and mid-century (2041–2065) in Togo. An integrated Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) from the CORDEX-CORE initiative datasets has been used as input. The latter platform recorded various weather variables, such as solar irradiance, air temperature, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity. Results showed that PV cells’ temperature would likely rise over all five regions in the country and may trigger a decline in the PV potential under RCP2.6 and 8.5. However, the magnitude of the induced change, caused by the changing climate, depended on two major factors: (1) the PV technology and (2) geographical position. Results also revealed that these dissimilarities were more pronounced under RCP8.5 with the amorphous technology. It was further found that, nationally, the average cell temperature would have risen by 1 °C and 1.82 °C under RCP2.6 and 8.5, in that order, during the 2024–2065 period for a-Si technology. Finally, the PV potential would likely decrease, on average, by 0.23% for RCP2.6 and 0.4% for RCP8.5 for a-Si technology.</jats:p>"

A five-year plan for the electrification of the region in 1925–1929 was developed, an integral part of which was the construction of a group hy-droelectric station in the Malo-Kabardinsky district, in the east of the KBAO in the dry steppe zone with insufficient and unstable moisture. After laying the western canal of the Malo-Kabardinsky irrigation system, the local authorities began the construction of the Akbashskaya SHPP, which played a key role in supplying high-quality electricity to remote settlements and the first industrial enterprises of the district.

Overvoltage generated during the operation of the vehicle-mounted circuit breaker has a long duration and high waveform steepness, which accelerates the service life of the vehicle-mounted equipment and is likely to cause insulation failures. For the above-mentioned problems, the operating overvoltage characteristics of high-speed EMU were obtained by traction substation-catenary-EMUs system (SCES) analysis and experiments, thus deriving the influences of the closed phase angle and the residual magnetism of the vehicle-mounted transformer on operating overvoltage. The results showed that the voltage phase of the catenary significantly affected the operating overvoltage, and the closed switching overvoltage was small at 0–40°, 140–210° and 320–350°. The voltage on the primary side of the vehicle-mounted transformer was 60.78 kV, with the transient impact of high-frequency oscillation overvoltage of 22.71 kV, and an initial period of oscillation of 0.01 ms. Then, the period became longer, and it took 0.5 ms for the high-frequency oscillation from attenuation to disappearance. Finally, a scheme of series reactance suppression devices was proposed to protect vehicle-mounted voltage transformers.

As the most typical mode of SCF, accounts receivable financing mode can use the part of accounts receivable occupying working capital for financing, which is widely used. In order to effectively manage the credit risk in the Supply Chain Finance and maintain the healthy operation of the supply chain, this paper proposes a supply chain financial credit risk prediction model based on PCA-GA-SVM. First, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the original index system, and then genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the principal components selected by PCA are input into the GA-SVM model for training, and the final prediction model is established. The running results show that the prediction performance of PCA-GA-SVM model is better than that of SVM and GA-SVM models. It has a good generalization ability, which can be used as a reference for commercial banks to improve the credit risk management ability of Supply Chain Finance and is conducive to the sustainable development of supply chain finance business.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a location-inventory problem (LIP) in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is investigated to optimize facility location and inventory control decisions by considering product recovery. The objective is to optimize facility location and inventory control decisions to minimize the total cost of business operations in a closed-loop supply chain system. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and design a modified hybrid differential evolution algorithm (MHDE) to solve it efficiently. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the performance of the new algorithm. The results show that MHDE is more efficient and effective than Lingo and other algorithms for the research problem under study. Managerial insights are also derived for business managers to improve their supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

However, the impact of different straw incorporation techniques on soil bacteria and their functions is still not well understood, especially across soil depths. Here, we investigated the impact of three maize straw management methods (straw removal, straw incorporation into topsoil, and deep‐injected straw incorporation into subsoil) on soil bacterial communities and how they were linked to extracellular enzymes and soil properties. Deep‐injected straw incorporation strongly promoted enzyme activities: C‐cycling enzymes increased by 111–532 nmol g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> hr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, N‐cycling enzymes by 229–708 nmol g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> hr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and P‐cycling enzymes by 142–216 nmol g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> hr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> compared to straw removal and straw incorporation into topsoil. In addition, deep‐injected straw incorporation considerably increased soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total nitrogen (TN) compared to the other straw management methods (249–253% for SOC, 303–370% for DOC, and 178–196% for TN). However, in topsoil, only minimal effects of straw management practices on bacterial communities, enzymes activities, and soil properties were found. Deep‐injected straw incorporation favoured copiotrophic bacteria which resulted in a reduction of 41% in Shannon index. Bacteria associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling were mainly Actinobacteria, which were positively correlated with TN, SOC, and DOC. Acidobacteria were the dominant species in P‐cycling module and were positively associated with SOC, DOC, and available phosphorus. Overall, injection of straw into subsoil alters bacterial communities and functioning, and increases soil nutrients and soil organic C in subsoil.</jats:p>",

However, the existing sequential pricing mechanism does not fully consider constraints such as the purchase volume of downstream firms and the change information of each parameter, which leads to the pricing mechanism being detached from the real market. According to the concept of the sequential pricing game model being used among multi-oligopolies under constraints, we constructed the constrained sequential pricing game model by incorporating the parameters related to the product demand function, marginal production cost, dominant coefficient, following coefficient, and agreed minimum purchase volume as constraints, and the model was converted into a nonlinear bilevel programming model to facilitate model solving. Furthermore, we provided the analytical solution formulas for six special cases, thus making the model more similar to the real market. In addition, the effects of the agreed minimum purchase volume and the dominant and following coefficients on the equilibrium quoted prices and profits of the firms were analyzed. The results of the numerical simulation show that the constrained sequential pricing game model is more effective than the unconstrained sequential pricing game model in solving the problem with the multi-oligopoly pricing mechanism, which means that it can be used to establish a better pricing mechanism and provide a more reasonable and scientific basis for market operation and policymakers in solving practical problems.</jats:p>"

An alternative is a single‐stream system where the grain and stover are harvested as a bulk material co‐stored and preserved by anerobic fermentation, and finally, co‐transported to a biorefinery. In the present work, four single‐pass whole‐plant bulk systems were compared with a conventional multi‐pass bale system. The single‐stream systems consisted of the harvest of corn grain and a portion of the stover fraction. Four machine configurations were simulated. This work predicted that a multi‐pass bale system would result in a material cost of 111.80 $2021 Mg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> stover DM delivered to the biorefinery gate. Alternatively, the lowest cost single‐stream system was the self‐propelled forage harvester (SPFH) configured with the whole‐plant header, which delivered feedstock for 74.76 $2021 Mg stover DM<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. In addition to machine configuration, a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand important drivers of feedstock cost. These analyses revealed that feedstock cost increased with moisture content, fertilizer price, and biorefinery size, and decreased with harvest season length, crop yield, and grower participation. This work demonstrated that single‐stream systems could reduce corn stover feedstock costs in comparison with state‐of‐technology systems. © 2022 The Authors. <jats:italic>Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining</jats:italic> published by Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</jats:p>",

One of the infrastructures that continues to be improved is toll roads, and a design and build contract scheme is chosen, which in theory has the characteristics of a faster time in infrastructure provision. This project experienced delays caused by supply chain problems for the main materials, namely rebar and concrete. This study aims to measure the performance of supply chain management for rebar and concrete materials that cause project delays of 3.251%. The population in this study was 25 contractors who understood and were involved in the supply chain management process for rebar and concrete materials. This type of research is a descriptive causal study that uses a quantitative approach and uses SCOR and AHP as analytical tools. The results show that the supply chain management performance assessment for rebar and concrete materials is 64.36 out of a scale of 100. This indicates that the supply chain management performance in toll road construction projects is at an average level. This performance is much influenced by the scarcity of materials from suppliers at certain times and the design process that coincides with the construction period, causing long waiting times for adjusting the order quantity. Based on the AHP, it was found that the most dominant variables were Plan and Source. Thus, it can be concluded that the performance of delayed toll road construction projects is influenced by the performance of the rebar and concrete supply chain. For toll road projects with design and build contracts, the corrective steps must focus on Plan and Source so that the performance level increases and can avoid the risk of delays that are detrimental to service providers.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted to determine the supply of fish waste and awareness of fish vendors on the potential use of fish by-products as silage. This study specifically determined the socio-demographic profile of fish vendors in the barangays and public market of Baybay City. Additionally, it identified the supply and means of disposal of local fish by-products and most importantly, determined the awareness of fish vendors on the utilization of fish by-products. Using descriptive research design, a total of 42 respondents were surveyed and interviewed. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as percentage and ranking. The results showed that fish vendors were mostly female with age ranges from 51- 60 years and high school graduates. These vendors earned around P10, 000.00 per month from selling fish that were sourced out from nearby towns. Top fish varieties being sold in Baybay City public market were Blackfin scad, mackerel tuna, and milkfish were among the top fish being sold in Baybay City. Fish waste by products weighing1-5 kilograms per vendor were disposed based on three (3) times a day based in the daily schedules using garbage truck to prevent foul odors. These fish wastes were not sold to consumers, although a few would ask for it as pet food. With this, there is a huge potential on the utilization of these by products as animal feeds, and therefore offers a possible sustainable project between the government and the academe.</jats:p>",

The microprocessor unit is the brain of the system and manages the events and was optimized to provide electrical energy to the electronic devices under normal operation and under the presence of disruptive events. The measurements showed that when switching either from battery to AC or from AC to battery, neither caused the shutdown of the power supply nor affected the behavior of the power supply. The power supply was able to charge 80% of the battery on a fast recharge of 1 h and the remaining 20% on a slow recharge of 2 h. The current allocated to the battery did not affect the operation of the power supply. The tests also showed that the power supply was able to transmit relevant information about its operation to external computers through a serial connection. This information includes the voltages at the battery and at the output of the voltage regulators, the voltage level of the AC network, the level of the battery charge and if it was being recharged, the current being drained, the internal temperatures at two locations (one measured on the resistor that limits battery charge and another measured on the output diode of the regulators), and whether the cooling system is being used. The total cost of this smart power supply is less than $150, demonstrating good potential for its popularization.</jats:p>"

The development of machine learning-based technologies for data visualisation and prediction has opened the possibility of evaluating the accountability of publicly funded projects. Methods: This study describes the conception and evaluation of the architecture of a system that can be utilised for project profile definition and prediction. The system was used to analyse data from 20,942 System of Management of Agreements and Transfer Contracts (SICONV) projects in Brazil, which are government-funded projects. SICONV is a Brazilian Government initiative that records the entire life cycle of agreements, transfer contracts, and partnership terms, from proposal formalisation to final accountability. The projects were represented by seven variables, all of which were related to the timeline and budget of the project. Data statistics and clustering in a lower-dimensional space calculated using t-SNE were used to generate project profiles. Performance measures were used to test and compare several project-profile prediction models based on classifiers. Results: Data clustering was achieved, and ten project profiles were defined as a result. Among 25 prediction models, k-Nearest-Neighbor (kknn) was the one that yielded the highest accuracy (0.991±0.002). Conclusions: The system predicted SICONV project profiles accurately. This system can help auditors and citizens evaluate new and ongoing project profiles, identifying inappropriate public funding.</jats:p>"

Based on the comparison of the two sides, the joint views that both adopters and technology consultants share is the ability that BCT holds to speed up processes across SCs through decentralized data access, thus decreasing human errors and reducing paperwork. However, technology consultants perceive the need to increase BCT awareness levels of businesses, to prevent BCT implementation just for reasons such as ‘recordkeeping’ and to reduce misconceptions in areas such as cryptocurrency applications. The findings also revealed that technology consultants insist on the careful evaluation and definition of records to be kept on BCT platforms prior to the adoption process, in order to avoid unnecessary data input. Currently, according to early industry adopters’ cases, most business attempts of BCT adoption use private networks, so technology consultants promote business entities on developing plans towards open-access public networks.</jats:p>"

In the farmer stage, during the growing period, not all articles survive until the end of the period, so a density function of the probability of survival and death of the growing articles is taken into account. Moreover, it is considered imperfect quality in the retailer’s stage because as the supply chain goes down, there exists a greater probability of product defects. Here, the end customer (consumer) can detect poor-quality aspects such as poorly cut, poorly packed, expired products, etc. An inventory model that maximizes the expected total profit is formulated for a single type of growing items with price-dependent polynomial demand. An algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem generating the optimal solution for order quantity, backordering quantity, selling price, and the number of shipments that maximizes the expected total profit per unit of time, and a numerical example is used to describe the applicability of the proposed inventory model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for all the input parameters of the inventory model, where the effect of each of the parameters on the decision variables is shown to extract some management knowledge. It was found that holding costs in the three stages of the supply chain have a substantial impact on the total profit per unit of time. In addition, as the demand scale parameter increases, the company must raise the selling price, which directly impacts the expected total profit per unit of time. This inventory model has the advantage that it can be applied to any growing item, including animals or plants, so it helps the owners of farms or crops to generate the most significant possible profit with their existing resources.</jats:p>"

It is very important to conduct a risk assessment of China’s rapeseed supply chain and put forward suggestions to construct a safe, effective, and accessible supply chain. In order to accurately evaluate the safety of the rapeseed supply chain from 2010 to 2020, we applied fuzzy multiconnection theory and analytic hierarchy process model (AHP). A comprehensive risk assessment model for the rapeseed supply chain with two primary indicators and 10 secondary indicators was constructed. By establishing the rapeseed risk evaluation model, we quantitatively analyzed the risk of China’s rapeseed supply chain. The domestic risk of production is still high, and the international risk under the high import dependence is alarming. We put forward risk prevention and countermeasures for China’s rapeseed supply chain. The results show that China has a large demand for rapeseed products, but the increase in China production is limited and the import from other countries is unstable. The proposed suggestions are designed to optimize and enhance the stability of the rapeseed product’s supply chain. It is recommended to continue to consolidate and deepen the cooperation with traditional trading partners such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Brazil; expand other import sources to build a more diversified and efficient rapeseed product import network and extend the supply chain of rapeseed products. This research can be a basis for making decisions for promoting the sustainable and efficient development of the rapeseed supply chain.</jats:p>"

How to balance the service cost and return cost through pricing decision, so that the profit of supply chain members can be improved, is the problem studied in this paper. In this paper, we consider the effect of service level of network channel on consumers’ return behavior in the context of manufacturer’s dual-channel supply chain when dual channels provide services at the same time, and discuss the effect of service level and return rate on pricing decision of dual-channel supply chain. It was found that return behavior can stimulate manufacturers to improve service levels and increase overall supply chain profits. The higher the return rate in the network channel, the greater the benefits from improved service levels by the manufacturer and the less detrimental to retailers’ returns. This study enriches the research on pricing decisions in dual-channel supply chains, increases the motivation of merchants to improve service levels, and has some guiding implications for supply chain members to develop price and service strategies.</jats:p>"

Based on this analysis, the main problems that arise in legal practice when establishing signs of the composition of an offense were identified. The norms of criminal legislation are investigated for the possible involvement of producers of low-quality dairy products to criminal responsibility. When analyzing law enforcement practice, it was found that no criminal case was initiated on any of the identified facts of the supply of falsified dairy products to the territorial bodies of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, despite all the facts of the prosecutor's response and expert opinions, which confirmed the facts of the supply of products that did not meet the established standards. Correctional institutions and pre-trial detention facilities in connection with the unfair business activities of enterprises with which state contracts were concluded for the supply of dairy products for convicts, suspects and accused held in institutions are at risk of mass conflict situations on the territory of these institutions by persons held in them, since the fact of eating food that does not meet the requirements state standards, of course, it causes indignation among people who are forced to use the supplied low-quality products.</jats:p>",

Through oxidizing methane and other hydrocarbons, microorganisms inhabiting cold seeps supply subsurface‐derived energy to higher trophic levels, sustaining highly productive oases of life in the deep sea. Despite the central role of microbiota in mediating biogeochemical cycles, the factors that govern the assembly and network of prokaryotic communities in cold seeps remain poorly understood. Here we analysed the geochemical and microbiological profiles of 11 different sediment cores from two spatially distant cold seeps of the South China Sea. We show that prokaryotic communities belonging to the same methane‐supply regimes (high‐methane‐supply, low‐methane‐supply and non‐seep control sediments) had a highly similar community structure, regardless of geographical location, seep‐associated biota (mussel, clam, microbial mat) and sediment depth. Methane supply appeared to drive the niche partitioning of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) at the regional scale, with ANME‐1 accounting for &gt;60% sequence abundance of ANME in the high‐methane‐supply sediments, while ANME‐2 dominated (&gt;90%) the low‐methane‐supply sediments. Increasing methane supply enhanced the contribution of environmental selection but lessened the contributions of dispersal limitation and drift to overall community assembly. High methane supply, moreover, promoted a more tightly connected, less stable prokaryotic network dominated by positive correlations. Together, these results provide a potentially new framework for understanding the niches and network interplay of prokaryotic communities across different methane seepage regimes in cold‐seep sediments.</jats:p>",

However, due to the limited empirical evidence, claims on transparency and sustainability benefits are largely theoretical. We lack an understanding of the benefits and drawbacks for upstream actors within global value chains and how this affects technology adoption. Addressing this gap, we conduct an empirical study to identify the drivers and obstacles for coffee producers in Colombia in adopting blockchain. We base our research on an event-driven and permissioned blockchain model, specifically designed for this research. Applying the Participation Capacity Framework and conducting semi-structured interviews with coffee producers and key informants, we analyze adoption attitudes towards the blockchain application. We further identify opportunities and drawbacks from the producers’ perspective. We set these findings in the context of the Global Value Chain research, considering the existing power relations in the coffee value chain. The top-down nature of blockchain projects raises distributive concerns, as resource investments, implementation burden, and risks are significantly higher upstream, whereas downstream lead firms will benefit most. We identify data squeeze as an additional channel of sustainable supplier squeeze relevant in the case of blockchain initiatives. Data squeeze implies lead firms turning the data obtained through, likely unpaid, labour of blockchain participants into a monetizable assets and marketable value through branding and advertisement. Based on the findings, we identify potential design dimensions and implementation features that can contribute to materializing producer benefits, thus mitigating the risk of a sustainability-driven supplier squeeze.</jats:p>"

The widespread implementation of ULS still suffers from a lack of research into its operation in the marketplace, although the research on ULS system technology and network design appears to be sufficient. A new supply chain for logistics service based on ULS (ULS-SSC) was proposed, as ULS embedded in the urban logistics system could lead to the evolution of the role of supply chain participants. This article analyzed the organizational structure and operation characteristics of ULS-SSC and designed a top-down ULS-SSC operation process model based on the designed functional structure and subsystems relationship using the hierarchical colored Petri net (HCPN). The simulation results show that the integrated information management platform based on ULS can integrate urban logistics service supply chain resources and operate effectively under the two main service modes designed. The high-time delay intermediate links can be upgraded by system optimization, and the links with initial pickup and terminal distribution can be improved through outsourcing and supply chain collaboration. The findings provide new insights into the feasibility of the operation of ULS in the market and help stimulate the implementation of ULS.</jats:p>",

The flood regulation (FR) service function of the ecosystem plays an important role in mitigating flood disaster risk. Previous studies on flood regulation ecosystem services (FRES) are still lacking in a cross-scale assessment of supply and demand, refined simulation of regional complex hydrology, and application of spatial zoning management. Taking the Fujian Delta as an example, this study established a cross-scale research framework based on the social-ecosystem principle. The SWAT model was used to simulate the regional hydrological runoff and calculate the macro-scale supply of FRES. Taking patches of land as units, a flood risk assessment model was constructed to calculate the micro-scale demand for FRES for urban and rural society. Through a comparison of supply and demand across spatial scales, a zoning management scheme to deal with flood disaster risk was proposed. The results showed that: (1) The supply of FRES differed greatly among the sub-basins, and the sub-basins with low supply were mostly distributed in the lower reaches of Jiulong River and the coastal areas. (2) The demand for FRES was concentrated in high-density urban built-up areas. (3) By comparing the supply and demand of FRES in sub-basin units, 2153 km2 ecological space was identified as the primary ecological protection area, and 914 km2 cultivated land and bare land were identified as the primary ecological restoration area. (4) By comparing the supply and demand of FRES of land patch units, 65.42 km2 of construction land was identified as the primary intervention area. This study provides a decision-making basis for regional flood disaster management from the perspective of FRES.</jats:p>"

Only about a third of respondents were vaccinated, however, about half of unvaccinated respondents reported that they would get vaccinated now if they could. Fears of harm to the unborn baby or young infant were common (22% of unvaccinated women). However, among unvaccinated women who wanted to get vaccinated, the most common barrier reported was that their health care provider refused to provide them the vaccine. Gender barriers and social norms also played a role, with family members restricting women’s access. Trust in the health system was high, however, women were most often getting information about COVID-19 vaccines from sources that they did not trust, and they knew they were getting potentially poor-quality information. Qualitative data shed light on the barriers women faced from their family and health care providers but described how as more people got the vaccine that norms were changing. These findings highlight how pregnant women in India have lower vaccination rates than the general population, and while vaccine hesitancy does play a role, structural barriers from the health care system also limit access to vaccines. Interventions must be developed that target household decision-makers and health providers at the community level, and that take advantage of the trust that rural women already have in their health care providers and the government. It is essential to think beyond vaccine hesitancy and think at the system level when addressing this missed opportunity to vaccinate high risk pregnant women in this setting.</jats:p>"

We posit that aligning cross‐platform effect across digital and physical infrastructure enhances system outcomes. Our arguments are informed by evidence on private–public partnerships for developing production and distribution infrastructure in the pharmaceutical industry. We identify enablers and inhibitors for cross‐platform effects within these data in terms of product and process technology readiness, path‐dependent standards creation, organizational alignment, regulatory fragmentation, and the desire towards such infrastructure yielding resilient outcomes.

At the same time, retailers are employing green marketing efforts for green products. In addition, members who are followers of the green supply chain are prone to fairness-concern behavior. To investigate the impact of fairness concerns on green supply chain decisions, this study develops a two-tier green supply chain in which the manufacturer makes green input and the retailer makes green marketing effort input. The retailer in the follower position of the supply chain has fairness concerns. Stackelberg game models are constructed and compared in three scenarios: one without fairness concerns, one where the manufacturer considers the retailer’s fairness concerns, and one where the manufacturer does not consider the retailer’s fairness concerns. After the manufacturer decides whether to consider the retailer’s fairness concerns, a two-part tariff contract is used to coordinate the green supply chain based on optimal decision-making and profit under a centralized decision-making condition. The study found that: (1) when the manufacturer considers the retailer’s fairness concerns, fairness concerns will negatively impact greenness, green marketing efforts, wholesale price, and retail price. When the manufacturer does not consider the retailer’s fairness concerns, fairness concerns will not impact greenness or wholesale price, but will negatively impact green marketing efforts; (2) the retailer’s fairness concerns have a negative impact on the green supply chain’s profit, and from the supply chain perspective, the retailer should abandon its fairness concerns; (3) it will be more beneficial if the manufacturer can consider the retailer’s fairness concerns; (4) when the manufacturer does not consider the retailer’s fairness concerns, the retailer can make fairness concerns according to the parameter conditions; (5) when a fixed fee meets a certain range, the two-part tariff contract can coordinate the green supply chain when the retailer has fairness concerns. The results will help manufacturers and retailers better understand fairness concerns and provide them with decision-making guidance and coordinated choices.</jats:p>"

The judicial practice regarding the interaction of accounting and tax documents has been analyzed. It is noted that the defect in the primary documents and the buyer’s failure to acknowledge the fact of the supply of the disputed goods does not deprive the supplier of the opportunity to prove the supply of the goods with other evidence that will convincingly testify to the actual circumstances of the supply of the goods. It is noted that there is a close relationship between tax accounting and accounting, since both tax accounting and accounting have one object — economic activity and reflect the same economic transactions, as well as accounting and tax accounting are based on primary documents It was concluded that judicial practice provides for the possibility of using a tax invoice as proof of the fact of the delivery of goods under the contract, but on the condition that there is other evidence. It is emphasized that when evaluating tax invoices in combination with other evidence in the case, the courts must take into account the provisions of the Tax Code of Ukraine and the actual actions of the parties to the contract regarding the reflection of the fact of the delivery of the disputed goods in the tax accounting and accounting records. It was determined that tax invoices received from the Unified Register of Tax Invoices cause legal consequences, and the basis for the taxpayer’s right to a tax credit from value added tax is the fact of actual transactions for the purchase of tangible goods. It is noted that establishing the rule regarding mandatory confirmation of tax credit amounts taken into account by the VAT (value added tax) payer when determining tax liabilities, the legislator assumes that these documents are authentic, that is, the transactions they confirm really took place. It has been proven that registered tax invoices in combination with other evidence confirming the real movement of goods can confirm the fact of the supply of goods under the contract, however, this is not clearly provided for by the legislation of Ukraine, but requires a combined analysis of various legal norms and judicial practice. It is proposed in the Tax Code of Ukraine to determine that the presence of registered tax invoices in combination with other evidence confirming the real movement of the goods is the basis for confirming the fact of the supply of the goods in case of a disputed situation.</jats:p>",

Moreover, this study used Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to study the agglomeration characteristics and evolutionary trajectories of supply–demand over two decades. The results showed that between 2000–2010 and 2010–2020, the water supply decreased by 19.01 × 108 m3 (18.28%) and 12.97 × 108 m3 (15.27%), respectively. However, the water demand in the same period increased by 6.17 × 108 m3 (23%) and 15.74 × 108 m3 (47%), respectively. Over the decades, the contribution of land use land cover (LULC) changes to variations in water supply has yielded values ranging from 2.87% to 6.37%. The analysis of the water supply–demand imbalance indicated that the entire CW experienced water shortage, and the type of spatial matching for supply and demand is dominated by a high supply and high demand class (16.09% of the total area). Based on the level of water deficit calculation, the upstream and downstream areas were identified as zones that require ecological conservation, while the middle CW area requires ecological restoration or ecological improvement.</jats:p>"

In the Republic of Belarus, preventive measures are being taken to eliminate the problem of iodine deficiency, in particular, a state strategy has been developed and implemented, the main measure of which is the mandatory use of only iodized salt in the food industry and public catering. Despite the measures taken, the problem of iodine deficiency remains relevant, especially for children and pregnant women. According to the results of the assessment of iodine sufficiency in the world, published by the RIAC on Surveillance for Iodine Deficiency Diseases (ICCIDD) - a global non-commercial, spheral need created for the use of iodine deficiency and the consequences of its negative examination on health, adequate iodine intake is provided in the Republic of Belarus. In 2016, the Global Iodine Network published maps characterizing iodine sufficiency for two main assessment categories - school-age children and pregnant women, confirming the status of the Republic of Belarus as a country with adequate iodine sufficiency. However, despite the results achieved, from the standpoint of medical monitoring, the quality of studies conducted to monitor the iodine supply of the population, the risks of excessive salt intake remain relevant. In this paper, a comparative analysis of the dynamics of the primary incidence of thyroid pathology in the population of the Zavodskoy district of the city of Minsk for the period 2016-2020 was carried out. According to the results of the analysis, a positive trend in the primary incidence of simple goiter, nodular non-toxic goiter and thyroiditis was revealed, while the dynamics of the primary incidence of hypothyroidism did not change. According to the data presented, the presence of iodine deficiency with a median urinary iodine excretion of 196.15 gg/l was revealed in pregnant women of the Zavodskoy district of Minsk in 2021. An analysis of the questionnaire survey of the nature of the nutrition of pregnant women showed that most of the surveyed do not know about the benefits of using iodized salt for the development of the fetus, and therefore the reason for the formation of iodine deficiency in the body of pregnant women is the insufficient intake of iodine in the body and refusal to take iodine preparations. In the surveyed region, 22 % of women do not comply with the prescription of endocrinologists about the need to take iodine-containing drugs.</jats:p>",

Substrate mixtures contained 30% (v/v) of vermiculite and 70% (v/v) of different biochar:peat treatments as follows: 0:70 (B0), 15:55 (B15), 30:40 (B30), 50:20 (B50), and 70:0 (B70). Higher biochar treatments increased the pH and electrical conductivity of the substrate, negatively affecting plant growth and germination (especially in B70). The partial substitution of peat by 30% biochar (B30) delayed seed germination but improved plant growth and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), with shoots containing higher levels of organic nitrogen and nitrate. Moreover, it increased the water holding capacity (WHC) and led to an efficient use of nutrients. Our study demonstrates that biochar can successfully replace and reduce peat and N fertilizer consumption. This has the potential to promote more sustainable farming with positive impacts on both plant growth and the environment.</jats:p>"

However, in many large cities with rapid economic development, the supply of UPGS is unfairly distributed, and there is a severe mismatch between its supply and residents’ demand. Taking the Beijing central city as an example, this study aims to develop a fairness assessment model to quantify the fairness of UPGS distribution and the matching relationships between supply and demand for UPGS. To achieve the aims of the study, we improved the supply model of UPGS by integrating three factors: the number of UPGS, the service capacity of UPGS, and the quality of UPGS in the Beijing central city. Subsequently, we evaluated the spatial fairness and social fairness of the supply of UPGS using the Gini coefficient. Then, we used the number of residents in the sub-district to characterize the intensity of residents’ needs and quantitatively analyzed the spatial matching relationship between the supply of UPGS and residents’ demand. The results show that: (a) The improved supply model of UPGS can measure the supply of UPGS of different types in a more detailed way. (b) The per capita supply of UPGS is unevenly distributed among the six urban districts of Beijing, which may lead to a sense of unfairness among residents. While residents in Haidian District (Gini = 0.649) may have the highest sense of unfairness, followed by those in Fengtai (Gini = 0.505), Dongcheng (Gini = 0.410), Xicheng (Gini = 0.392), and Chaoyang District (Gini = 0.225). (c) The matching relationship between the supply of UPGS and the needs of different social groups is not ideal, especially the spatial matching relationship between the needs of the elderly and the supply of UPGS. This study can be used as a reference for supporting decision making in optimizing UPGS and providing a reference for fine urban management.</jats:p>"

However, food supply must be estimated on the basis of the current and potential demand of future populations, taking into account the landscape carrying capacity towards sustainable agricultural planning. From this perspective, the study aimed at estimating the resilience of the “Agri-food Region of Central Córdoba” (ARCC) and its role in supporting the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as proximal services, provided by the diversified agricultural landscape in the peri-urban area of Córdoba (Argentina). A direct field survey has been carried out to collect data on the main species and types of crops, the annual productivity, and the area covered by each species and type of horticultural crops. The data have been statistically elaborated to test the spatial and temporal variability of productivity as well as the spatial autocorrelation. In relation to crop diversification, a total of 30 vegetable species have been recorded in the diversified farms under study, with 15 species identified as the most frequent crops as on the basis of the area dedicated to each vegetable species sampled in the farms (in %). The productivity of 30 species has been integrated into a single value of “vegetable crop productivity mean” (kg/m2), proposed and measured in this study, which has been 3.46 kg/m2. It can be a useful monitoring indicator in diversified production contexts. The estimated food supply (ton/year) of vegetable crops for the 170 farmlands has been 72,881 ton/year. An accurate measurement of the biomass harvested on a given surface area can be useful to assign productivity data to the pixel of each land use/cover class, providing accurate input data for remotely sensed-based models supporting decision-making on food provision in peri-urban systems. In this sense, the paper proposes a methodological framework that can be useful worldwide when up-to-date official productivity data are not available, but they are a necessary basis for planning, decision-making, and the implementation of public policies. Thus, diversity in farming systems can combine high ecological and socio-economic benefits, in terms of ecosystem service provision and sustainable food production.</jats:p>"

Reservoir sediment retention (RSR) and water–sediment regulation (WSR) of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir (XLDR) contribute to mitigating the siltation and adjusting the bankfull channel geometry in the lower Yellow River (LYR). However, few studies have been conducted to quantify the contribution of RSR and WSR to medium-sized channel shaping. In this paper, we analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of bankfull discharge (BFD) in the LYR, established empirical expressions between the BFD and the previous five-year average discharge above 2,000 m3/s and the incoming sediment coefficient during flood seasons, and then constructed three different water and sediment scenarios to quantify the contribution of the WSR of the XLDR to medium-sized channel shaping in the LYR. Calculated results indicated that WSR accounted alone for 68%–94% of the medium-sized channel shaping, with RSR contributing 6%–32%. The contribution of WSR to the recovery of medium-sized channels increased with time and became stabilized eventually. Along the LYR, such contribution also increased from 68% to 97% and eventually became stabilized in narrow reaches, reaching over 90%. The results will lay a solid technical foundation for the WSR of the XLDR, river regulation downstream of the reservoir, and sediment disposal of the YR.</jats:p>",

Recent insights into tumor metabolic dependency provide a therapeutic opportunity for exploring optimal treatment approaches. Herein, a smart responsive “Energy NanoLock” is developed to improve cancer metabolic intervention by simultaneously inhibiting nutrient supply and energy production. NanoLock is a pomegranate‐like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD‐modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CyclicRC, pI = 6.7) encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles (IK‐AuNPs), which together form a dual pH‐ and photoresponsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock exhibits good stability under physiological conditions, but releases small‐size CyclicRC and IK‐AuNPs in response to the tumor acidic microenvironment, leading to deep tumor penetration. CyclicRC targets integrins to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and consequently blocks tumor nutrient supply. Meanwhile, IK‐AuNPs specifically induce apoptotic peptides and photothermally mediated mitochondrial collapse, and consequently inhibits endogenous energy production, thereby facilitating cell death. Importantly, in both xenograft and orthotopic oral cancer models, NanoLock selectively eliminates tumors with little cross‐reactivity with normal tissues, especially oral functions, resulting in prolonged survival of mice. Therefore, NanoLock provides a novel metabolic therapy to exploit synergistic inhibition of exogenous nutrient supply and endogenous energy production, which potentially advances oral cancer treatment.</jats:p>",

This study was to investigate the changes and associations of the hepatic blood flow, liver volume, and portal pressure gradient (PPG) after TIPS in liver cirrhosis. Methods. Twenty-one patients with liver cirrhosis who received TIPS were recruited. The contrast CT images were used to assess the iodine density (ID) of liver parenchymal and liver volume. The ID of the liver parenchyma was used to reflect hepatic blood flow. We used a paired t-test and regression analysis to investigate the effect of TIPS on hepatic blood flow, liver volume, and PPG in individuals with cirrhosis and the factors that affect changes in liver volume. Results. After TIPS, there was a significant improvement in the ID of liver parenchyma at arterial phase (AP) and PPG in individuals with cirrhosis (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>P</a:mi>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> &lt; 0.05). Each 1 unit increase in the ID change of whole liver parenchyma at the venous phase (VP) was significantly associated with a 269.44 cm3 increase in the liver volume after TIPS (b = 269.44, <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <c:mi>P</c:mi>\n                     </c:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> = 0.012). With an increasing ID change of whole liver parenchyma at VP, the change in liver volume followed an increasing trend (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\">\n                        <e:mi>P</e:mi>\n                     </e:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> for overall association = 0.005). Conclusions. Our data indicate that there was a significant improvement in hepatic blood flow, especially at AP, after TIPS and the change in hepatic blood supply from the portal vein is positively associated with the change in liver volume after TIPS. Increasing the blood supply to the liver from the portal vein may improve the reduction of liver volume.</jats:p>",

This problem has attracted more and more attention and research by experts and scholars. This paper took Anhui, the coal ESB of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), as an example and took the key stage of rapid development of regional economic integration (REI) and accelerated the realization of CEs reduction targets in YREB from 2007 to 2017 as the study period. From the perspectives of regions and industry sectors, we calculated the transfer amount of ECEs-IPT in Anhui among the YREB, analyzed the spatial–temporal evolution pattern of ECEs-IPT, and revealed the industrial characteristics of ECEs-IPT. Then, we classified the industry sectors and proposed the direction of industrial improvement measures. The results showed that, during the decade, the amount of provinces undertaking the net ECEs-IPT outflow from Anhui increased significantly and spatially expanded from only Jiangxi Province to almost all of the YREB. In addition, 39.77% of the net ECEs-IPT outflow of Anhui was concentrated in petroleum processing, coking, and nuclear fuel processing (RefPetraol), metal smelting and rolling processing (MetalSmelt), and electricity and heat production and supply (ElectpowerProd) that trade with Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. The analytical model and results will provide a useful reference for the global similar coal ESBs, especially the coal ESBs within the EIRs, to formulate improvement measures for regions or even the world to ensure stability of the energy supply and achieve regional CEs reduction targets.</jats:p>"

A comprehensive research method was used, including a review and synthesis of scientific and patent publications, analytical studies of methods for creating backwash during well drilling. Their advantages and disadvantages are revealed. The greatest attention is paid to drilling of large-diameter wells with backwash, which is widespread in foreign countries in the development of groundwater reserves. The presented materials showed a clear advantage of this method over others, both in terms of the quantity and quality of produced water, and in terms of well operation. It is shown that, under local conditions, the advantages of this method can have a particularly pronounced effect, and its disadvantages will manifest themselves to a minimal extent. The advantages of rotary backflushing over other drilling methods can be considered proven. It will provide a sharp increase in the utilization rate of local groundwater resources, which is the main problem of local groundwater supply. The need for widespread implementation of this method is obvious. The influence of the upward flow rate of the drilling fluid and its density on the maximum depth of drilling with backwash using an airlift has been studied. An improved device of the circulation system for drilling wells with backwash using an airlift has been developed. Thanks to its use, it becomes possible to use commercially available drill pipes with conventional connections.

Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in leaves of the three alien plants significantly increased with increase of nitrogen supply. With increase of phosphorus supply, nitrogen or phosphorus concentration of leaf was complex among the three alien plants.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considered Issues of increasing the reliability of the movement of the sprinkling machine (SM) on the example of \"Kuban-LK1\" were considered. Significant rutting leading to loss of patency due to increased rain intensity at the end of the SM (last bogies and cantilever) was noted, which ultimately leads to a decrease in machine performance. To eliminate this drawback, pneumatic tires with a profile width of 21.3 - 24 are installed on the outermost SM bogie, the rain intensity of which is 1.0 mm / min, and the length is 350 - 400 m, instead of serial tires 18.4 - 24. To eliminate this shortcoming, pneumatic tires with a profile width of 21.3 - 24 are installed on the extreme SM trolley, the rain intensity of which is 1.0 mm / min, and the length is 350 - 400 m, instead of serial tires 18.4 - 24. Modifications of SM with a length of 500 meters or more characterize increased intensity (ρ = 1.0-1.2 mm/min), and, accordingly, an increased value of surface water runoff, while the bearing capacity of the soil in the area of the last spans is up to 70 kPa. This determines the need to install wide-profile pneumatic tires with a profile width of 21.3 - 24 not on one, but on several last bogies. However, based on the high cost and weight indicators of pneumatic tires 21.3 - 24, according to theoretical and experimental studies, the authors recommend equipping the last SM bogies with pneumatic tires of a conventional profile 18.3 - 24 with a rigid flare, the radius of which is determined by reducing the wheel radius by an amount equal to the average depth of immersion of tires of a conventional profile, at the end of the irrigation season. The conducted experimental studies have shown that the installation of an expander on the pneumatic tires of the last bogies provided the indicators of the reference rutting ability, equivalent to those of the intermediate bogies.</jats:p>",

This study examines the effects and mechanisms of improved judicial independence on the development of larger and more sustainable domestic supply chains, using a sample of Chinese enterprises from 2011 to 2016 and a quasi-natural experiment of local judicial reforms. We find that, after the establishment of local circuit courts, the distribution distance of a firm’s supply chain increases significantly. The mechanism analysis suggests that the increase in distribution distance in the domestic supply chain is due to the breakdown of market segmentation resulting from the reduction in local judicial protectionism and the improvement in the quality of local justice after the establishment of circuit courts. Further tests show that the impact of improved judicial independence on the domestic supply chain is most pronounced among small and manufacturing non-state-owned enterprises and those from less competitive industries. Overall, the findings of this paper provide important insights into developing large and sustainable supply chains via breaking down market segmentation, thereby promoting long-term economic growth.</jats:p>"

However, existing methods, including ID-based and cryptographic-based solutions, cannot achieve both counterfeit resistance and decentralization in supply chain management. We argue that this dilemma comes from the disconnection and inconsistency of the data records and physical product entities. This paper proposes RF-Chain, a novel decentralized supply chain management solution that uniquely combines data record authentication and physical-layer RFID tag authentication to effectively achieve credibility and counterfeit resistance. The main contribution of this work is to integrate physical-layer authentication of cheap commodity RFID tags into a blockchain-based information management system, and RF-Chain is the first to do so. The proposed cross-layer authentication can effectively defend against counterfeit attacks without relying on a central key management service. Real-world experiments utilizing the Ethereum (ETH) platform and more than 100 RFID tags demonstrate that RF-Chain is secure, effective, time-efficient, and cost-efficient.</jats:p>",

This study constructs a water and soil resource analysis system based on system dynamics. It integrates cloud theory and hierarchical analysis to analyze the evolutional trend of the water and soil resource carrying capacity in irrigation areas. The spatial analysis technique was used to obtain a raster map of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the influencing factors, and analyze the evolutionary characteristics of the water and soil resources carrying capacity by integrating multi-source data. The results showed that: (1) the evaluation clouds of water and soil resources carrying capacity in 2002, 2010, and 2018 were (0.5034, 0.0236, 0.0071), (0.5586, 00218, 0.0062), and (0.5989, 0.0249, 0.0061), respectively. This showed that the carrying capacity of water and soil resources was transitioning from ‘critical bearing’ to ‘good bearing’, but the evolution rate was gradually decreasing; (2) from 2002 to 2018, the size of the ‘good bearing’ area increased by 8.38%, while the size of the ‘severe bearing’ area decreased by 6.4%; (3) the degree of dramatic evolution of the carrying capacity of water and soil resources is: continuous change &amp;gt; pre-change &amp;gt; post-change &amp;gt; continuous stable &amp;gt; repeated change; (4) the serious carrying capacity area shows a spatial pattern of decreasing in an arc from the town to the surrounding areas.

To improve the quality of fresh products, some fresh product supply chains have implemented blockchain technology to provide traceable information for their products, and some regional governments have subsidized their local firms to incentivize them to implement blockchain-driven traceability systems. However, with regional government subsidy heterogeneity, cross-regional fresh product supply chain firms lack theoretical guidance on their operation decisions. Based on the research gap, we investigate optimal operation policies in a fresh product supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer located in different regions. The local governments may subsidize the manufacturer or the retailer located in their own regions, which construct four subsidy strategies (SS, SN, NS, and NN) along the supply chain. We find that the optimal operation policies under four subsidy strategies can be affected by the sensitivity to traceability level, cost-sharing rate of the manufacturer, rate of products left after corrosion, and subsidy rate to the manufacturer. Moreover, the government subsidy to the retailer is always beneficial to the retailer and the supply chain but does not affect the manufacturer’s operation policies and profits. The government subsidy to the manufacturer is always beneficial to the manufacturer but not always beneficial to the retailer and the supply chain. Hence the desired subsidy strategy for the manufacturer is SS and SN, and the one for the retailer and the supply chain is either NS or SS with different conditions.</jats:p>"

Observations were made, and iButton® temperature monitoring devices were used to record ambient temperatures experienced by blueberries from harvesting until after forced cooling in the cold store. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the temperature data. The results showed poor adherence to protocols and a large number of temperature and chilling injury spikes and breaks. Many trials did not reach pre-cooling and forced cooling protocol temperatures within the required time. Quality reports indicated that pallets were downgraded owing to cartons being underweight, probably as a result of moisture loss, and other quality defects such as collapsed berries and mould. By minimizing the breach of protocols and improving the beginning stages of the blueberry supply chain, a better-quality product will be ensured, thus reducing costs, food loss and food waste.</jats:p>"

To provide a scientific basis for formulating regional sustainable development strategies that enhance human well-being, resource-based cities in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) were selected as the case study. The supply and demand of ecosystem services in these cities from 2000 to 2020 were measured. The spatiotemporal evolution of the supply-demand relationship was illustrated by taking its coordination degree. In addition, geographical detector and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were applied to quantify the spatiotemporally varying effects of natural and socioeconomic factors on the ES supply--demand relationship. The results showed that resource-based cities in the YRB were experiencing expansion in supply and demand overall, but the supply-demand relationship tended to be tense. The northwest YRB had higher coordination values of supply-demand, while lower values were found in the southeast YRB. Moreover, the relationship between supply and demand was significantly affected by natural and socioeconomic factors, such as elevation, slope, precipitation, land-use type, population density, and gross domestic product (GDP) per land. Furthermore, the GWR model suggested that the effects of driving factors on the supply-demand relationship had notable spatial heterogeneity. The coordination of ES supply-demand in the resource-based cities of southeast YRB was mainly influenced by socioeconomic factors, while that of the west YRB was mainly influenced by natural factors. Our study suggested that it is necessary to enhance the awareness of environmental protection, pay attention to ecological restoration, and avoid unreasonable human disturbance to the ecosystem.</jats:p>"

Data on the domestic supply of cocoa, domestic and international prices of cocoa, volume of cocoa exports, exchange rate, inflation rate, and agricultural gross domestic product (agGDP) were obtained from reputable secondary sources such as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Food and Agriculture Organization Statistical databases (FAOSTAT). Data were analysed using Augmented Dickey-Fuller statistics, Johansen’s co-integration test, descriptive statistics, trend model, and error correction models at a level of significance α = 0.05. There was a high fluctuation in the trend of the domestic supply of cocoa over the study period. The average annual percentage change in the domestic supply of cocoa was 8.092 percent. The coefficients of variation revealed a high degree of instability in the domestic supply of cocoa, ranging from a low of 11.510 percent in the 2010-2017 sub-period to the highest of 122.340 percent in the 2000-2009 sub-period. The producer price of cocoa steadily decreases over the study period. The average producer price of cocoa over the study period was ₦1935.80 per tonne. The average annual percentage change in producer price of cocoa over the study period is 4.900 percent. The coefficient of variation ranged from a low 25.130 percent in the 2000-2009 sub-period to the highest 130.370 percent in the 1990-1999 sub-period, showing high instability in the producer price of cocoa over the study period. The contribution of cocoa to agricultural exports is unstable over the study period. The average percentage contribution of cocoa to agricultural export over the study period was 84.300 percent. The results of error correction analysis revealed that the domestic supply of cocoa is negatively influenced by interest rate, inflation rate, and producer price of cocoa. Thus, it can be concluded that cocoa is a significant agricultural export commodity, but there is a need to pay significant policy attention to these macroeconomic variables for an increased domestic supply of cocoa.</jats:p>"

The primary purpose is to check the comprehensive influence of the six factors of pipe diameter, inlet flow ratio, outlet flow ratio, location of damage point, flow of brine, and density of brine on the turbulent mixing of water and brine in the pipeline. The coefficient of variation is used as an evaluation index to evaluate the mixing in the pipeline, and the effective mixing length LEML is used to quantify the uniform mixing position of brine in the pipeline. The results show that the inlet flow ratio, outlet flow ratio, and pipe diameter significantly affect LEML in the east outlet of the cross joint. Outlet flow ratio and pipe diameter significantly affect LEML in the cross joint's south outlet direction. In addition, the dimensionless relationship equation representing LEML is fitted through dimensional analysis.</jats:p>",
