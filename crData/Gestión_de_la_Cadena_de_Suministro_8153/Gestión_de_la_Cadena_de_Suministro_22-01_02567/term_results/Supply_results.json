The population in this study were 100 broilers in the districts / cities in Banten Province. The data to be used in this study are primary data, through sending questionnaires. Development of theoretical models with five hypotheses processed in the analysis using SmartPLS Software version 3.0.m3. The results showed that supplier flexibility and supply agility have a positive and significant effect on company performance, supplier flexibility and supply agility have a positive and significant effect on supply chain performance and supply chain performance has a positive and significant effect as an intervening variable to the company performance. Supply chain mediation has an important role in integrating production processes from upstream to downstream, including establishing good relations between businesses involved in supply chain management to improve the company's performance.</jats:p>"

The analysis results are based on three months of data collected from 890 SMEs in Vietnam. The results show that supply chain finance has a statistically significant positive impact on supply chain effectiveness, SMEs performance and supply chain risk resilience. At the same time, supply chain finance has a negative impact on the supply chain risk of Vietnam SMEs in the global supply chain. Finally, we offer recommendations to help SMEs improve supply chain effectiveness and performance through the supply chain finance tool.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to define the relationships between supply chain capability, supply chain performance and marketing performance. Some of the retail stores are no longer operating. Tool of analysis is the partial least square that is suitable for small sample size. The result of PLSSmart 3.0 shows that the relationship between supply chain capability and supply chain performance is positive and significant. However, the relationship between supply chain performance and marketing performance is positive but non-significant. Direct relationship between supply chain capability and marketing performance appears to be positive and significant. Indirect relationship between supply chain capability and marketing performance through supply chain performance also appears to be non-significant. The study can be a reference for retail managers to increase the supply chain in their marketing performance. Some further research needs to add other variables to see a more concrete relationship between supply chain capability and marketing performance.</jats:p>"

Many Korean manufacturers have withstood perilous supply chain dynamism and maintained operational performance without interruption. This study examines the antecedents of supply chain resilience and operational performance to suggest how other manufacturers can develop and maintain continuous uninterrupted operations even amid dynamic supply chains and global disruption. This is an empirical study of South Korean manufacturers utilizing PLS-SEM analysis with mediation effects. This study examines the interrelationships of six variables including, supply chain disruption orientation, management’s intention, digital infrastructure capability, innovation adoption, supply chain resilience, and operational performance. The implications are meaningful for both scholars and practitioners alike. This paper contributes to literature pertaining to both supply chain management and technology assimilation.</jats:p>"

Mit einem zielgerichteten Supply Chain Design werden Erfolgspotenziale geschaffen sowie langfristige Rahmenbedingungen festgelegt. Die Gestaltungsaufgabe des Supply Chain Designs betrifft aus einer institutionellen Perspektive beispielsweise Entscheidungen über die in die Supply Chain zu integrierenden Supply Chain-Partner. Für die physische Ebene der Supply Chain ist die Struktur, die Dichte und die Leistungsfähigkeit des Netzwerks festzulegen. Von nachhaltigem Supply Chain Design kann gesprochen werden, wenn neben Erfolgszielen auch ökologische und soziale Ziele im Rahmen des Supply Chain Designs verfolgt werden. Auf Basis der Aktivitätsanalyse wird ein quantitatives Modell zur Darstellung und Lösung des Problems eines nachhaltigkeitsorientierten Supply Chain Designs entwickelt und am Beispiel von Baumwoll-T-Shirts angewendet.</jats:p>"

Companies must apply supply chain management and supply chain flexibility (SCF) to boost industrial competitiveness, which impacts firm performance. To ensure that supply chain management supports the company's strategy, companies must evaluate supply chain concerns. From the literature search, researchers have not found any published studies or articles on SCM and SCF in their influence on firm performance through competitive advantage, specifically for corn companies in Indonesia. The population in this study includes agriculture companies in Indonesia. Sampling was carried out using probability sampling technique, the total population of 200 obtained a sample size of 133.333 which can be rounded up to 134 research samples. The inferential statistical method used in the data analysis of this study was the Partial Least Square Version 3 program. The study found that SCM influenced firm performance and SCF had a direct influence on firm performance. However, competitive advantage variable failed in being a mediator in SCM and SCF on firm performance.</jats:p>"

It stresses the importance of energy to human health, safety, and even injustice. It evaluates the relative human burdens of fuel poverty in the industrialized places like United Kingdom and energy poverty in agrarian sub-Saharan Africa. It identifies concerns about energy justice when using nuclear fuels, assessing whether these concerns should caution us against the future development of nuclear power for commercial purposes. Will the increased use of renewable energy resources increase energy democracy and energy justice, or will it have little effect? Rather than letting others make energy decisions that can rule our lives, could we design more equitable energy systems that would allow more people (or even <italic>all</italic> people) to lead peaceful lives?</p>",

Supplier selection is a complex decision-making process that includes multiple criteria and a set of supplier alternatives. This study integrates the dimensions of sustainability and resilience into the supplier selection process. The aim is to propose a systematic supplier selection framework to help companies categorize suppliers based on their sustainability and resilience performance and select the ones that perform well on those two dimensions. We use a novel multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM), the Best-Worst Method (BWM), to solve the complex decision-making process of coffee supplier selection in a local roastery in Indonesia. The data was collected from two groups: experts regarding the coffee supply chain in Indonesia and a decision-maker at a coffee roastery in Indonesia. The result shows that the economic criteria for sustainability performance and risk reduction criteria for resilience performance are the most important supplier selection criteria for both groups. There are no significant differences between the importance evaluations of criteria by both group of experts, which indicates that the supplier selection process of the company aligns with the expert perspective.</jats:p>"

This research explores a model that describes the association between organizational performance and supply chain management practices. Based on existing research, a theoretical framework for the investigation was established. A standardized questionnaire was developed to gather data for the research, which was completed by 396 supply chain professionals from Saudi Arabian food companies. Partial least square (PLS)–structured equation modeling was used to examine the model and hypotheses. Four independent variables were chosen to scrutinize the impact of supply chain management strategies on organizational performance: customer relationship, strategic supplier partnership, level of information sharing, and postponement. According to the research, customer relationships, strategic supplier partnerships, and information sharing all have a major impact on organizational performance. On the other hand, the postponement has no significant impact on organizational performance.</jats:p>"

The agricultural landscapes of northwest Victoria provide a compelling vantage from which to ground truth and trouble the idea of seamless circulation and relatedly the idea that disruptions are merely technical blips in otherwise well-oiled machines. Working between the interpretive lenses of Anna Tsing and Bernard Stiegler, supply chains emerge as artefacts of distinctive social formations, conduits of colonial capital power, and ultimately distancing mechanisms that separate people from places and each other. Yet supply chains are also imperfect and incomplete in their operations, and it is this observation that provides for creative responses and the hope of reinvigorating more grounded approaches to the production of food and practices of feeding.</jats:p>"

Besides, supply chain finance has a statistically significant impact on supply chain financing performance and SMEs performance. Finally, the innovation capability and the market response capability act as full mediators in the relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain financing performance.

The results point out that big data and the Internet of things have significant impacts on the strategic outcomes of supply chain 4.0. Hence, it was concluded that supply chain technologies are pivotal drivers of supply chain strategic outcomes. Based on these results companies are called to adopt and integrate Industry 4.0 technologies into their supply chains to improve supply chain long-run performance.

The results of this study indicate that supplier integration has a positive effect on supply chain performance, transformational leadership style has a positive effect on supply chain performance and supplier integration has a positive effect on transformational leadership style in Indonesian manufacturing companies. The results of the study can be a reference for decision makers and supply chain management leaders to implement supply chain management strategies in the form of integration with suppliers to improve the company's supply chain performance and to consider the influence of supply chain transformational leadership styles to maintain the sustainability of long-term relationships with suppliers in multinational companies which already has a standard and standard system.</jats:p>"

How much, though, does this language of crisis—as particular, contextual, temporally bound—suffice to describe the conditions of the present? This chapter, and the book it introduces, take the COVID-19 pandemic as a springboard to interrogate a larger set of structural, environmental and political fault lines running through the global food system. In a context in which disruptions to the production, distribution and consumption of food are figured as exceptions to the smooth, just-in-time efficiencies of global supply chains, we examine the pandemic not simply as a particular and acute moment of disruption but rather as a lens on a deeper, longer set of structural processes within which disruption is endemic. At a time when it is more likely to be grasped in terms of speculative investment than as a common good, food offers a vital prism for grappling with the logics by which power circulates in the world. Attending to this constellation of forces calls for attention to supply chains as key mechanisms in the organization of the capitalist food system but also demands that we extend our thinking beyond the bounded linearities of supply chain models.</jats:p>"

The study instrument was developed based on the previous studies and the survey included 284 companies in Jordan. A sample of 263 responses were used for exploratory analysis. Results show that the 46-item instrument was loaded on four factors. During this phase, the measurement scale was purified to 36 items, and characterized with a high degree of reliability. The results were confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis and showed that the 36-item measurement model met the empirical requirements namely, convergent, construct, and discriminant validity. The fitness indicators test for the model shows that it is applicable in SMEs companies’ environment in Jordan. The study presented implications for decision-makers in SMEs companies. The limitation of this study was presented which were relied on to develop directions for future research.</jats:p>"

Supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, supply chain alignment, which is known as the Triple-A strategy, are elements to form supply chain performance. In this study, we tried to apply it to SMEs in developing countries, such as Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to show whether it is true that the supply chain cannot be applied to SMEs, while for a disruption as it is today, competition is getting tougher not only among SMEs but also against large companies, and SMEs need to develop several strategies that were previously unimaginable. This study uses quantitative techniques to determine the effect of supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, supply chain alignment on supply chain performance either partially or simultaneously. The results showed that all hypotheses were accepted. This shows that supply chain management can be a strategy to create better SMEs performance and can even be used to achieve competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

The e-commerce environment is difficult to predict due to the vast availability of information and changing market dynamics. Management can deal with uncertainty more effectively when focusing on administrative partnerships as part of their corporate strategy.

However, investigation of these risks is relatively sparse and has primarily been independent with less combinatory research, despite their interrelationships and causality. The present study aims to address that gap by an extant literature review and analysis of relationships among risk factors using a combination of fuzzy approaches. A mixed approach was used, including empirical data from private and government firms in a developing telecom sector. This research finding confirmed that economical dimension risk is major for SSCM in the TSC. In developing countries, it could help telecom service providers in determining which risk factors are critical and those that are crucially significant. As a result, they will be able to more effectively develop strategies focussing on the most affecting risk dimension for SSCM. This is the first study using a hybrid fuzzy approach that analysed interrelationships of risk factors for SSCM. Further, it gives a comprehensive view of risk assessment in the risk management context in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Different gas composition determines different physical and chemical characteristics of the gas, its heat of combustion, dew points on water and hydrocarbons, and Wobbe number. Previously, when using gas, little attention was paid to its characteristics, which are guided by the requirements of GOST 5542-87. With the restoration of Ukraine's independence and the transition to market conditions, attitudes toward gas have changed. Gas is a commodity and has a price. With the integration into the European Union, there was not only the implementation of European legislation but also the widespread use of advanced equipment and technologies in these countries. Gas will be metered in units of energy, not volume as before. This forces us to pay more attention to the quality of gas, set stricter requirements for its component composition, and monitor compliance with regulatory requirements in the process of transporting and supplying gas to the final consumer. GOST 5542-87 defined only a few quality parameters. Currently, the Code of Gas Transmission and Gas Distribution Systems, the Technical Regulation of Natural Gas and other regulations determine the quality of gas by more than 20 parameters that meet European standards. The methane content in the composition of natural gas must be at least 90 %, and other components of the gas are regulated. However, different deposits have different methane compositions. These limits range from 85 % to 99 % of methane. Different composition of natural gas affects not only its properties but also the reliability of the gas transmission and distribution system and affects the work of individual end-users. This problem is especially relevant when using gas appliances with high efficiency. The problem of gas quality is important for its metering in Ukraine and in settlements with other countries. The analysis of gas composition and quality during its transportation from the field to the consumer is carried out. It is determined that in the distribution part of the gas transmission system of Ukraine there are deviations in gas quality from regulatory requirements. This reduces the efficiency of some gas appliances and throttling equipment.</jats:p>"

CBEC will be playing a more important role and undertake the task of foreign trade transformation and driving domestic economic growth. In this case, the corresponding service supplies chain capability（SSCC）becomes a key part of whether            the CBEC platform could complete the task. Based on the grounded theory, this research has collected data through interviews with the relevant people working in the supply chain department of the CBEC platform to systematically explore the key factors behind dynamic service capability of the digital supply chain within the CBEC platform service ability. Then, the author constructs the theoretical model of the Digital Service Supply Chain Capability. The results show that the CBEC digital service supply chain capability consists of the logistics, capital flows and information flows. Data analysis includes internal data and external data, while internal data consists of the three main categories — customer demand forecast, product quality prediction and internal data collection &amp; analysis. Finally, external data consists of the three main categories: market intelligence collection, assessing supplier risks and big data.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Pipe scale forms when the anti-corrosive lining of the water supply pipeline is damaged, and it has a significant influence on the chromaticity and turbidity indicators of water quality. Therefore, the reasons for damage to the joint, tee, elbow, and other parts that are prone to damaging the anti-corrosive lining in the pipeline construction were investigated. On this basis, the matters needing attention in the construction and prefabricated parts are proposed, and it is suggested that steel pipes should not be used during construction if the diameter of the pipeline is less than 700 mm. A combination of removal and pipeline rehabilitation should be used to treat pipe scale to ensure water quality and safe water supply.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to classify and identify journal and conference articles and undertake analysis of the present paper to develop a deep comprehension of the supply chain in retail business. A systematic mapping study (SMS) examines scientific publications produced over time, focus, locus, and the most widely investigated type of research. It is also the most widely used research method. The SMS technique follows well-established empirical guidelines, and the mapping data is based on Scopus. According to SMS research findings on organizational change, 68 studies match the inclusion criteria. By paper type, method, focus, locus, and year of research publication, we divided 68 publications into topic groups. The current studies are then categorized and quantified based on multiple parameters, topic descriptions, and current research trends.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric analysis to analyze trends and patterns of outsourcing and supply chain research results using statistical and co-word analysis. The search results in the Scopus database yielded 787 relevant documents with the keywords outsourcing and supply chain from 1997 to early 2022. The results of the bibliometric analysis resulted in the number of publications, citations, subject areas, country, keywords, and topic clusters. The trend of outsourcing and supply chain research tends to increase every year although it had a significant decline in 2011. The documents with the most citations are related to supplier selection using analytical network processes, optimization of outsourcing partners, and ICT in the supply chain. The four fields that dominate the research area are business management, engineering, decision science, and computer science. The United States of America is the most productive country with the most citations. There are four cluster topics formed: the importance of supply chain management in outsourcing in industry and ICT in company activities, the impact of supply chain on business performance and outsourcing decisions, logistics outsourcing decisions to third parties and their effectiveness, lastly the benefit costs of outsourcing and the implications for product management. This paper provides an additional updated overview of the outsourcing and supply chain research map.</jats:p>"

The dynamic capability theory of firms was adopted in the supply chain to design a research framework that recommends a supply chain strategy under uncertainties pertaining to inter-island logistics in Indonesia. This study involved the survey of 140 large-scale companies delivering products across the Indonesian islands to identify the supply chain uncertainties by analyzing data using SmartPLS. The supply chain ambidexterity (SAM) was identified to exhibit no direct correlation with SCP; however, agile supply chain (ASC) and lean supply chain (LSC) could indirectly relate the SAM and SCP. For supply chain professionals, the results indicated that SCP cannot be achieved solely through SAM, thereby necessitating the development of LSCs and/or ASCs, driven from SAM, to achieve SCP. Thus, this study empirically confirmed ASC and LSC to be effective practices for mitigating supply chain uncertainties by mediating supply chain ambidexterity on SCP.</jats:p>"

The reason for doing this research is because some of the research that has been done by previous researchers still discusses this on corporate and not on SMEs. However, market conditions have changed. SMEs need to be managed professionally, by minimizing expenses to maximize revenue, taking into account risk, resource capabilities, in flexible ways as well as low-cost. The results showed that there was a significant influence on the financial performance of SMEs with the presence of human resource competences and supply chain management either partially or simultaneously.</jats:p>"

It is rare for someone to solve a linear program by hand — except perhaps in a class-room. Large-scale simulations would be all but impossible without the aid of a computer. For many people, numerical techniques have superseded analytic techniques as a tool for solving mathematical problems. This paper proposed Generalized LUExponential Trapezoidal Fuzzy Number and their ranking based on numerical integration. In this ranking method, the values are calculated with left and right spreads at some 𝜶 −level of generalized LU-exponential trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and Weddle‘s rule for numerical integration. To illustrate the proposed methods, a fuzzy four dimensional transportation problem (FDTP) is proposed and solved. This ranking approach is very simple and useful for the real life inequality based decision making problems.</jats:p>"

Data were collected using a questionnaire from managers of food processing companies. The results showed that big data affected supply chain management significantly and positively, which in turn affected supply chain performance significantly and positively. In addition, big data exerted a significant and positive impact on supply chain performance. Based on these links, it was found that supply chain management mediated significantly the effect of big data on supply chain performance.

Based on a literature review, six BDA adoption intention enablers: financial readiness, perceived advantages, top management support, IT infrastructure, technology sophistication, and data quality were identified. The study collected data from different levels of managers in the consumer goods’ retailing sector in Jordan to test the proposed study framework. To obtain primary data, a quantitative method was used, and a survey (structured questionnaire) was conducted. SmartPLS version 3.3 was used to analyze and test the proposed study model, which included 211 respondents. Three BDA enablers, including perceived advantages, top management support, and IT infrastructure, were found to have a statistically significant effect on BDA adoption intention in their supply chain operations. Furthermore, the relationship between financial readiness and BDA adoption intention was significantly moderated by innovation culture. This research model can be used to determine the challenges and enablers to BDA adoption in supply chain operations for both developed and developing countries. Future research may replicate the model in various sectors or the same sector in different countries.</jats:p>"

This study draws upon the budgeting literature to explore the role of participative budgeting on the supply chain resilience amid Covid-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 191 managers working in supply chain functions of organizations operating in industrial zones in Vietnam. The technique of partial least square structural equation modelling was used to assess data. The results suggest that Covid-19's disruptive impact increases participative budgeting, which results in organizational commitment. This commitment leads to the enhancement of internal and external supply chain integration, which in turn leads to supply chain resilience. This study is the first study to explore how and why budgeting practices lead to the enhancement of supply chain resilience amid Covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

Good supply chain management improves their market share by improving productivity and utilising production competitiveness, raw material storage, commodity transportation, product processing and distributor selection. Informatization and digitalization are one of the hotspots of supply chain management research. For many enterprises, the informatization and digitalization of supply chain management are particularly important due to the complexity of their own business. This article expounds the characteristics of the supply chain and introduces the importance of its digitalization and informatization implementation steps, which includes some important matters needing attention. And the article analyses how a food producer located in Xinzheng, China pays less attention on the supply chain management.

Achieving this optimization brings productivity to the organization. A sustainable and reliable supply chain (S&amp;RSC) as an emerging paradigm, with a comprehensive view, leads the supply chain network design (SCND) issue to the desired situation. This study, as part of an emerging theme, presents a systematic review and classification of 42 articles at the intersection of sustainability, reliability, and supply chain network design. In this regard, in a historical course, the four concepts of green supply chain, socially responsible supply chain, sustainable supply chain, and reliable supply chain in the form of four structures of history and definition, deriver and importance, substrate and practice, evaluation, and implementation are discussed. The result of the review shows that the articles that study the integration of sustainability and reliability in SCND are vibrant and rapidly growing in various industries. Developing countries and manufacturing companies with the largest number of articles have been the research fields of the studies. Most of the studies have considered the structure of the supply chain as a forward flow. The key contribution of this review is the development of a comprehensive framework of S&amp;RSC from the conceptual point of view, elements, assessment tools, and its implementation context. The present review can serve as a guide for various stakeholders. In particular, practitioners and policymakers can effectively develop their own strategies and policies to advance the sustainable‐reliable program.</jats:p>",

This study aims to examine the interrelationships among various proposed success drivers of SCP that were analyzed individually or collectively in some previous studies. Four proposed forces have been identified in this study including organizational culture, SC relationships, SC integration, and SC innovation. SC integration is seen as a mediating factor between SC relationships and SCP. Using a deductive and quantitative approach that is based on collecting data from (17) companies in the field of logistics using an online survey, the study focuses on four success drivers including organizational culture, SC innovation, SC relationships, and SC integration. Smart PLS 3 software was applied to analyze the data based on the use of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings confirm that organizational culture and SC innovation have a direct significant impact on SCP. Regarding the mediating role of SC integration, the finds confirmed that SC integration mediates the relationship between SC relationships and SCP. A set of implications and recommendations for decision-makers and researchers are proposed based on the empirical findings of the current study. SC managers must first consider organizational culture and try to create positive supportive cultural attributes. A culture that encourages openness to change, sharing of knowledge, and collaboration seems a necessity to further improve SCP. Additionally, as the study findings emphasized the significant impact of SC innovation, SC managers should encourage innovative initiatives and behavior.</jats:p>"

Research data were collected from 162 enterprises producing organic agricultural products. Applying the structural equation modeling (SEM), the study has shown that supply chain risks negatively affect the supply chain performance of organic agricultural products.

Manufacturing companies essential in handling covid experience increased demands, while other companies not related to covid experienced a decrease even in cancellation of orders. Order changes determine the company's performance. This research is related to the effect of order changes on firm resilience through supply chain coordination. The distribution of questionnaires to manufacturing companies in Indonesia is done by sending a google form link in the social media group. Data obtained as many as 446 questionnaires and analyzed using the partial least square technique. The study results showed that amended orders positively impacted 0.728 to the internal operational coordination, the positive influence of 0.201 to coordinate with the supplier, and positive effect with a coefficient of 0.213 to coordination with the customer. Internal operational coordinated influence coordinated with the customer of 0.593 and coordinated with the customer of 0.515. Supply chain coordinated impact on the company's supply chain resilience determined by internal operational coordination by 0.371, coordinated with the supplier of 0.183 and coordinated with the customer of 0.199. The practical contribution of the research is to make managers able to build a coordinated Supply chain to overcome amended orders and increase supply chain deficiencies.</jats:p>"

The paper discusses how robust optimization handles uncertain demand in agricultural processed products supply chain problems within two scenarios during the pandemic situation, i.e., the large-scale social distancing and partial social distancing. The study assumes that demand and production capacity are uncertain during a pandemic situation. Robust counterpart methodology is employed to obtain the robust optimal solution. To this end, the uncertain data is assumed to lie within a polyhedral uncertainty set. The result shows that the robust counterpart model is a computationally tractable through linear programming problem. Numerical experiment is presented for the Bandung area with a case on sugar and cooking oil that is the most influential agricultural processed products besides the main staple food of the Indonesian people, rice.</jats:p>"

By placing the mediating role of innovativeness, this study developed a theoretical framework to explore the antecedents of tourism supply chain management. This research was conducted in a national park in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, with 176 samples from tourism business actors. By using purposive sampling method, data analysis was performed using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of the analysis show a positive and significant influence of environmental management, social support, and financial performance on managerial innovation. These variables in the next analysis are estimated as antecedents of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in tourism, indicating positive and significant effects resulting from the analysis. In particular, the analysis also raises the important role of managerial innovation in improving the performance of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in tourism. Empirically, these findings underscore that the greater capabilities of the tourism organization in consolidating organizational resources, organizational performance and social support is more likely to increase the sustainability of SCM.</jats:p>"

Although businesses and workplaces are restarting activities in some countries, with containment measures gradually being lifted, overall consumer demand is expected to remain low, also determined by the loss of jobs and income. Therefore, the scale of the impact on supply chains exceeded anything most companies had anticipated. This study aims to understand how companies were affected and identify some lessons learned about their vulnerabilities and the possible ways to address them in the long term.

Despite this, there has been very little research into the effects of SCI on the GI of manufacturing businesses. As a result, the current study was carried out to close this gap in the literature. Data from 231 manufacturing businesses in Jordan was used to validate a framework of several hypotheses about the relationships involving SCI and GI. SCI (customer integration (CI) and supplier integration (SI) have beneficial benefits on the green product and process innovation (GPDI &amp; GPRI), according to the results of structural equation modeling. SI's effects on green products and process innovation are moderated by environmental unpredictability. The effects of CI on green product innovation are being moderated by environmental unpredictability. Environmental uncertainty, on the other hand, does not moderate the impacts of CI on green process innovation. This research adds to our knowledge of the SCI-GI link.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of information science and technology and the continuous advance of economic globalization, the international market competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Faced with the increasingly complex global market competition, multinational corporations, in order to continuously enhance their competitiveness, improve customer satisfaction and maximize profits, take the global market as the background, take product research and development, raw material procurement, manufacturing and processing as well as final product distribution into account, so as to realize the global design of supply chain network, form a global supply chain, and establish a global supply chain management strategy. At present, under the sweeping tide of economic globalization, global supply chain management will become the mainstream trend of management development of multinational corporations in the future. In this context, this paper makes an in-depth study of global supply chain and its management, and makes a detailed analysis of Dell’s and Lenovo’s global supply chain management, which are typical multinational enterprises that have established effective global supply chain management. Through the research and case analysis, this paper aims to have a comprehensive and profound understanding of global supply chain and its management, to have a critical understanding of Dell’s and Lenovo’s effective global supply chain management and understand their strengths and challenges, and finally to provide practical suggestions for the development of Chinese enterprises in domestic and international markets. Finally, the following findings are obtained in this paper. With its global supply chain management, Dell has reduced costs and built good relationships with suppliers and customers. Lenovo has also adopted effective global supply chain management modes, which enable Lenovo to achieve the competitive advantages of information integration and costs reduction as well as the competitive advantages in the mode of operation and management technology. However, in the domestic and international environments, there are still some problems in Dell’s and Lenovo’s global supply chain management, which presents them with some challenges. Through the comparison between the two, this paper finds that they have both similarities and differences in global supply chain management, as well as successes and shortcomings. Therefore, this paper believes that, for Chinese companies, in order to have a foothold in the world, they must learn from the common successes of Dell and Lenovo, focusing on customer demand and product value added as well as minimizing costs. In addition, Chinese enterprises must learn from Lenovo and Dell respectively when exploring domestic and international markets, learn to adapt measures to local conditions, and make full use of the advantages of the direct selling model. In addition, Chinese enterprises should also clearly recognize the problems in their own supply chain management, and actively adopt countermeasures to achieve the overall optimization of their own supply chain management.</jats:p>"

In this essence, the current research examines how supply chain integration, just-in-time practice, and quality management boost a firm operational and financial performance during a pandemic crisis like COVID-19. Similarly, this study examines the moderating effect of IT advancement on the relationship between a firm operational and financial performance. The sample size of this study is assessed with a priori power analysis. Data were collected from employees working in manufacturing firms, including construction equipment, transportation, electronic products, engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, and healthcare manufacturers. For empirical analysis, 380 responses were estimated with a structural equation modeling approach. Constructs validity and reliability are tested in the measurement model. Empirical findings revealed that factors such as internal integration, process integration, product integration, just-in-time, and quality management collectively explained R^2 75.4 % variance in firm operational performance. In addition, effect size analysis 〖 f〗^2 shows that product integration has the highest importance in determining a firm operational performance. The research model has shown substantial predictive power Q^2 54.2% to predict firm operational performance. The moderating impact of IT advancement is established and revealed that IT advancement in the supply chain will strengthen the relationship between the firm’s operational and financial performance. Theoretically, this research has developed an integrated supply chain model that combines supply chain integration factors, just-in-time, quality management, and IT advancement to investigate the firm’s operational performance. To practice, this study suggests that policymakers should concentrate on process integration, just-in-time supply chain strategy, and IT advancement, which boosts the firm’s operational and financial performance. This study is unique as it discloses several useful findings which would help manufacturers deal with an unprecedented situation like the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

The main aim of our work is aimed at identifying universal marketing audit tools that could help small businesses to increase efficiency and profitability. A sample of 144 small businesses through a survey were used for research. The study applied the SmartPls program for finding marketing audit tools. Our research showed that supply chain management and response (reaction to feedback from employees or customers) are main tools of marketing audit to help improve a small business. We found that marketing audit has a positive effect on both current market efficiency and current profitability. Results also show that, despite the direct benefits of marketing audit, many small companies in emerging markets do not adopt audit due to lack of marketing knowledge. This study can be a reference for owners of small businesses in emerging markets. We developed novel tools of marketing audit that could help small businesses. This paper is an original contribution to managerial knowledge.</jats:p>"

Some businesses have managed to deal with the impact while some have faced severe losses. In the UK, analysts have identified that SMEs play a major role in economic growth and development. The current pandemic situation has increased pressure for the businesses, which has led to a shift in the business models. The businesses are adopting new strategies and methods to deal with the challenges and complexities. The pressure of competing and retaining positions has affected different areas and aspects of the business. Along with these changes, it has been seen that the demands of consumers have also changed. The changes in consumer behaviour have led to influence on business approaches and strategies. The study focused on gathering primary data using a questionnaire. The analysis of the data using the regression model justified that the Covid-19 pressure has imposed changes on SMEs. However, the impact of consumer behaviour in this situation has not been proved. The study concludes that it is important for the business to respond quickly according to the market trends and demands.</jats:p>"

The distribution of questionnaires directly to hotel practitioners was 25 respondents, and 65 respondents obtained the distribution of google form links. The results showed that supply chain practices with supplier relationship management and quality information sharing activities could increase internal and upstream integration and not directly impact downstream integration. Internal integration with data integration activities accurately and coordination between functions on an ongoing basis can affect upstream and downstream integration and green hotel performance. Upstream integration and downstream integration with joint decision activities and planning synchronization with external parties can directly impact green hotel performance. They were increasing the market share and image of the hotel with the implementation of caring for the environment. This research contributes to hotel practitioners adopting practical supply chains in building internal and external integration to increase competitiveness and theoretical contribution to developing supply chain theory and green performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vaccination plays an essential role in the fight against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The currently insufficient vaccine production capacity makes it difficult to balance supply with demand, which has led to a contradiction between command demand and limited supply. According to analysis based on game theory, the attributes of COVID-19 vaccines vary with supply strategies formulated by vaccine-producing countries. This means that vaccine-receiving countries can only be motivated to prepare operable vaccine distribution plans through the supply of COVID-19 vaccines as global public goods. The rational distribution of global public goods must be guaranteed by a global supply institution system. To that end, Elinor Ostrom’s eight design principles provide a basis for designing such a global supply system. This paper proposes a nested institution solution for guaranteeing the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines based on the design principles, which include clearly defined boundaries, proportional equivalence between benefits and costs, collective-choice arrangements, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict-resolution mechanisms, minimal recognition of rights to organize, and nested enterprises. To win this global fight against COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines must not only be treated as global public goods, but countries must also be urged to coordinate cooperation in global institutional design, thus ensuring that COVID-19 vaccines can truly benefit all mankind.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of globalization, the process of value creation is becoming more complex, exposed to greater risks for companies, partners, and customers. Moreover, modern digital technologies, such as the use of digital twin technology, can increase the use of geographically dispersed work teams and contribute to sustainable value creation in the future. However, the digital transition creates new organizational models and influences relationships in supply chains, thus affecting structural changes in business models.Hence, the study aims to investigate, from the whole value chain perspective, how the next generation of digital services is affecting business value and changing the business model concept. In addition, this paper discusses the stakeholder and social responsibility value creation perspective on business model for integrated sustainable value creation. To investigate this, it was decided to use a quantitative methodology in the form of questionnaires, which were distributed among different interested parties: two contractors, three suppliers, and an operator. The results indicated that all respondents, such as an operator, shipping companies, and subsea service providers, are positive about future digital technologies, which should ensure environmental sustainability, improve human interaction and communication. At the same time, they emphasize the importance of integrated join work within the value creation element. Overall, all participants are interested in reducing costs, they expect initiatives from each other in offering sustainable and innovative solutions, and to achieve these, innovative cooperation is needed.\nAcknowledgmentThe study is supported by a grant from the Research Based Innovation “SFI Marine Operation in Virtual Environment (SFI-MOVE)” (Project no: 237929) in Norway.</jats:p>",

A promising way of evaluating the environmental performance of a product or a process is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) modelling, but the reliability of LCA results is mostly compromised due to the lack of real data from upstream and downstream supply chains. Our research aim is to drive LCA modelling through Blockchain Technology (BCT) and internet-of-things which have the capability to record reliable, transparent, and secure data from across the supply chain. The modified LCA model will provide various industries with the quantified benefits of BCT in terms of industrial emissions reduction. This conference paper reflects the 1st stage of research where we carried out a detailed literature review on potential use of blockchain technology in green supply chain management and based on the findings, we developed an integrative framework architecture for the supply chain of a supermarket product. In the next phase, the integration of BCT and LCA will be studied in food supply chains using a supermarket case study of Walmart-IBM developed blockchain consortium.</jats:p>",

This study proposes a two-stage delayed differentiation model for a multiproduct manufacturer-retailer coordinated supply chain featuring the adjustable-rate for making common parts and a multi-shipment policy for transporting finished goods. The aim is to help present-day manufacturers achieve their operational goals mentioned above. The mathematical techniques help us build a specific model to explicitly represent the problem and derive its overall operating expense. Then, the convexity of the total expense is verified by Hessian matrix equations. The differential calculus helps derive the cost-minimized fabrication-shipment decision. This study offers an example to demonstrate the applicability and capabilities of our proposed model numerically. The following crucial information has been made available to the managers to facilitate their operating decision makings: (1) the problem’s best fabrication-shipment policy; (2) the collective influence of various common part’s completion rates and values on the problem’s total expenses and optimal fabrication-shipment policy; (3) the impact of various adjustable-rates in stage one on utilization and stage one’s uptime; (4) the details of cost contributors to the problem; and (5) the collective impacts of critical features on the problem’s performance.</jats:p>"

In addition, opportunistic behavior and the degree of interdependence have also been shown to have a reverse impact on the level of cooperation of enterprises. The findings of this study show a contribution both theoretically and practically, demonstrating the inherent negative risks of information in the supply chain to the financial performance of the enterprise. Research has shown the intermediate role of the degree of interdependence in the relationship between the above two factors. Based on the research results, the authors propose several recommendations to improve the financial performance of enterprises.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study analyse the mode of access to safe public water supply in Jalingo Metropolis. The study applied both survey and experimental research designs. The survey design involves sampling consumers' modes of accessing the public water supply, whereas the experimental approach involved laboratory investigation of water quality. A cross-sectional study carried out among 348 consumers who had access to public water supply and seven supply points each served by the three (3) production units of the Taraba State Water and Sewerage Corporation (TAWASCO) in Jalingo metropolis were selected. The standard procedures for water sample collection was done, which were analysed using the Wagtech Water Quality analysis machine in the World Health Organization Modern Laboratory located within Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA) office in Jalingo. Whereas, the questionnairs elicited information on the mode of access to water by the residents. The questionnaire data were analysed using frequency count and simple percentage. The result revealed that both the physical and chemical characteristics of public water supply in Jalingo metropolis are within the permissible limits of WHO and NSDWQ. The coliform count for the water samples were in trace amount and within the standard limits of WHO/NSDWQ. On the mode of access to safe water supply, the result revealed that majority of the respondents (80%) in Magami and ATC production channels do not have direct connection to the main water supply from RUWASA but gain access through indirect connection from neighboring houses/compounds. It was only from the Mile Six production channel that majority of the respondents (70%) reported that they access water from taps located within the house. This implies that most of the residents in the study area do not have connection to the main supply, which delivers water directly to their homes. The study therefore recommended that the government should ensure equitable distribution of portable water to the generality of the public.</jats:p>"

Successful inventory reduction and on-time delivery are essential in the PCSC because of critical scheduling and cost factors. To solve these challenges, this study applied Just-In-Time (JIT) strategies in the PCSC using the Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model to help manufacturers identify the optimal decision. The factors considered were offsite inventory levels (based on days buffered) and batch delivery decisions that reduced supply penalties and improved construction performance. The model was validated based on a precast project experiment in Vietnam; the model provided a saving of 52% in manufacturer penalties and reduced construction idle work by 77%. An optimal combined decision was provided for the manufacturer, such as a 1day-4batch decision with maximum benefit and a 2day-2batch decision for safety using an uncertainty risk consideration in the PC wall panel study case. This research contributes a tool to help manufacturers in decision making and promotes the use of JIT applications/strategies in the PCSC process.</jats:p>"

The study was divided into four phases namely: • Phase-I: Pre-pandemic phase [Oct’19 to Feb’20] • Phase-II: The full-blown pandemic phase [Mar 20-Sep 20] • Phase-III: The declining phase [Oct20-Feb21] • Phase IV: The second wave [March21-may21] Details of the blood units collected both in-house as well as in the VBDC’s were used for the study. The date of collection, expiry and date of issue for each packed red blood cell [PRBC] units were noted. The components  prepared from the whole blood was also noted. The average In-house donations were tabulated. The various components issued month wise was also noted. The supply of Convalescent plasma in all the three phases was tabulate RESULT: The average whole blood collection pre pandemic was 1103 units (55%), 768units (51%) in pandemic phase, 1219units (61%) in declining phase and only 692units (21%) in second wave of the pandemic. In Phase I 27 VBDC collected 1153 units (58%) and in Phase III 8 VBDC collected 236units(12%) Due to restrictions in mass gatherings and lockdown enforced, the whole blood collections from Phase II and Phase IV was 93units (6.5%) and 76units (2.2%) only. In Phase I, the average In House Donation was 33.6%, In Phase II it was12%, In Phase III was 5.75% and lastly in Phase IV was 5.4% The PRBC issued on an average in the four phases was 59%, 48%, 55% and 26% respectively. Similarly the FFP issued in Phase I , II, III and IV was 62%,34%,58% and 20%. Lastly the RDP issued was 15%, 13%, 19% and 4.5% in all the various phases. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that COVID 19 pandemic had a negative impact on total number of In-house donations, voluntary blood donation camps, blood stock inventory and transfusion recipients along with taking a major toll on health and safety of our blood bank staff as well. With little insight of the disease and everyday learning, by motivating more voluntary donors and health care workers the efficient chain of blood supply and demand can be maintained as the virus is to stay with us for a long time.</jats:p>"

The proposed model is uniquely researched as no prior research explores the link between supply chain performances, blockchain, and smart inventory in prestigious academic journals. A quantitative technique with convenient cluster sampling is used. A descriptive, exploratory, causal and analytical design was applied—a sample size of 303 respondents was used for data analysis through regression and hypothesis with ANOVA. The findings revealed a significant positive impact of blockchain and smart inventory systems on SC performance. Limited construct-based research can be focused on more industries and constructs for future studies. There are numerous chances for businesses to leverage blockchain technology to their advantage over the competition, giving them the chance to strengthen their market position. Managers must carefully consider the qualities of their goods, services, and supply chains to ascertain whether they require or would sufficiently benefit from blockchain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The arrival of the era of robots and autonomous machines is undisputable. It is anticipated that the future business environment will be characterized by a variety of intelligent systems and autonomous robots. In 2017, the International Federation of Robotics reported that momentum gained by robotic technologies is strong and that the sales volumes of both service and industrial robots is expected to grow. Building on this projection, the present study proposes a set of prerequisites or key determinants for the adoption of autonomous robots in the supply chain and logistics industry: technological context (i.e., relative advantage, complexity, and cost), organizational context (i.e., management support, financial support and employee competence) and environmental context (i.e., competitive pressure, customer pressure and vendor support). The study adapts a quantitative research design and uses an online survey to collect the needed data to test the conceptual framework and hypotheses proposed. Part of the study results confirms the association between the cost of digital technologies and the adoption of autonomous robots. However, the study found no evidence that the perceived relative advantage positively impacts supply chain and logistics firms’ adoption of autonomous robots. The study offers some managerial advices to supply chain mangers and marketers of the digital technologies and tools that can be applied in the supply chain setting.</jats:p>"

The multi-input intervention models are performed for twelve series data obtained from BPS-Statistics of West Nusa Tenggara Province. The results from the estimated response values show that generally the number of unloading and loading in the three main ports and airports have experienced mixed impact, i.e., negative, and positive impacts. As the main concern in this study, the negative impacts were more experienced by the number of unloading and loading goods in airports than in ports indicating that the supply chain in airports was more vulnerable to intervention. Lombok International Airport and Sultan M Kaharuddin Airport received the most negative impact during the period. Most intervention events have delayed impact patterns that are more experienced by the three airports than the three ports. Started in March 2020, Covid-19 produced the widest and biggest negative impacts. These impacts are even bigger than the impacts produced by the severe earthquakes that occurred in August 2018.</jats:p>"

Broiler chicken is one of the animal protein food products that is favored by people from various circles because it has a relatively cheaper price compared to other meat commodities that provide animal protein, is easy to obtain, and has good organoleptic quality. The purchasing power of the people of the special region of Yogyakarta (DIY) is also increasing due to increased nutritional awareness related to the fulfillment of animal protein. The broiler production process contains uncertainty because it is seasonal. This causes a fluctuating price change. Fluctuations in broiler prices are not a new phenomenon in the DIY. Price fluctuations usually occur at certain times such as during religious holidays and this phenomenon occurs repeatedly every year. So we need a broiler supply chain research to maintain price stability using a dynamic simulation system model of the broiler chicken supply chain in DIY. This study develops a causal loop diagram (CID) and stock and flow diagram (SFD) of system dynamic model of the broiler supply chain in the DIY and simulates the model using powersim studio 10 software. The simulation is confirmed verified and valid, therefore for the next research model can be used to solve the problem by generating policy scenario.</jats:p>"

Effective and efficient supply chain management is one of the goals to achieve the company's business stability in the fuel oil supply chain. Fuel oil is a very complex basic need for companies in carrying out industrial and transportation activities. The research method is measuring and evaluating company performance through a combination of the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model and the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Research respondents through interviews with four informants from the company ConocoPhilips. Based on the SCOR Version 11.0 model, in this study the SCOR measurement is divided into four perspectives, namely Plan, Source, Deliver and Return. Furthermore, through the measurement of Key Performance Indicators, it is classified using five supply chain dimensions, namely reliability, responsiveness, agility, costs, and assets. The research resulted in the final value of supply chain performance of 74,992 which can be categorized as a moderate or intermediate level, this implies that the existence of an assessment system or measurement of supply chain performance on an ongoing basis can be used as a consideration in determining the optimal strategy. Research findings, improvements, and strategies are needed, especially in the perspective of delivering which has the lowest score.</jats:p>"

In today’s global business environment, manufacturing firms encounter numerous operational challenges. Externally, they must promptly satisfy the customers’ various requests, while internally, they must cautiously manage several inevitable issues in the fabrication process. These issues might be concerned with scrap, random breakdown, etc. Resolving such issues is crucial for meeting the due dates of customers’ orders, adhering to the expected manufacturing schedules, product quality, and minimizing the total fabrication-transportation-inventory costs. The study develops a model to characterize the system’s features mentioned above and assist the manufacturers with batch fabrication planning. The model proposes a solution process with an algorithm seeking an optimal runtime for the system. Additionally, it gives a numerical illustration depicting the collective and individual impacts of these special features on the operating policy and other performance indices. This model and the research findings can facilitate manufacturers’ decision-making for green batch fabrication and enhance competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

This chapter aims to reveal the problems and learn lessons in these areas where significant risks are faced. During the COVID era, the need for resilient supply chains that are not affected by instantaneous changes has come to the fore. Accordingly, the second aim of the chapter is to offer solutions toward the short, medium, and long terms of the first-mile, production, and last-mile processes as enhancing the responsiveness of supply chains by the elements of supply chain resilience. This study is prepared as a review article in an exploratory approach through the supply chain literature and current practical examples. As a result of the study, digital-intensive business models, collaborative network design, and sustainability are highlighted as the main concepts to reach more resilient networks. </jats:p>",

To conduct this research and meet the stated research objective, a quantitative research method was used to collect data from food products manufacturers in Jordan due to the main contribution of this sector to the national economy of Jordan. PLS-SEM approach was selected in the phase of analysis and the findings revealed a significant effect of all hypothesized research assumptions and a significant moderating effect of trust on the relationship between supply chain partners’ integration and organizational performance. The research findings also provided expected implications and supported the relevant evidence and literature in this area, as well it would contribute to cover the existing research knowledge gaps by integrating a new model including sets of new variables that have not been examined together within a single conceptual framework.</jats:p>"

The research paper used the quantitative research method through analysing structural equation modelling (SEM), with a dataset of 518 observations. The survey subject is the experienced and knowledgeable manager in supply chain management in the agricultural sector. The result found that risk has impacted not only directly and negatively on the supply chain cooperation but also indirectly through intermediary factors, namely commitment and the participant's opportunistic behaviour. In addition, the study has also proved that in some cases, the participant's dependency mentality in work and opportunistic behaviour lead to the opposite impact of commitment on trust and level of supply chain cooperation in agriculture. Based on this result, the study also makes recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the supply chain cooperation in the agricultural sector in Vietnam. The findings contributed to both theory and practice. It pointed out the impact of risk on the supply chain cooperation in the agricultural sector, as well as the mediating role of commitment and opportunistic behaviour in this relationship.</jats:p>"

New digital technologies that are emerging every day are on their way to affect nearly all business processes and activities. This study investigates the effect of the digital supply chain on the supply chain and organization performance in the Malaysia manufacturing industry. This paper also further assesses the mediating effect of supply chain performance in the relationship between the digital supply chain and the organizational performance in the Malaysia manufacturing industry. The objectives are achieved via quantitative research design. The researchers emailed the online survey questionnaire to 1160 manufacturing companies listed in the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) directory via stratified sampling technique and received 63 responses. 7 incomplete responses have been deleted and 56 usable responses representing 5.43% of the response rate used for data analysis. The data was analyzed by using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Three hypotheses are not supported and seven hypotheses are supported, which includes all the hypotheses of moderating effect. The manufacturing companies in Malaysia can consider adopting the DSC in the business process to remain reliable in the competitive market by providing good supply chain performance and best organizational performance as a whole. The implication of the study is given to academics and practitioners, specifically manufacturing companies. The limitations and the recommendation for future study have been highlighted.</jats:p>"

Zak provides groundbreaking analysis of well over one hundred of Frost’s lyrics, considering each poem as an interrelated portion of the poet’s overarching “constellation of intention.” Beyond biography, this book offers extended, close readings of Frost’s oeuvre, building its case incrementally from deftly examined particulars. </p>\n          <p>Zak discusses how the pastoral mode Frost adopts is no depleted, homespun idiom retreating from modernism’s complexities, but a self-conscious determination to assume the prophetic mantle from his predecessors (Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Emerson, and Thoreau). Frost’s version of pastoral represents no escape from life’s stresses, but the most constructive and life-sustaining means to address life’s struggles “head on”—in both sense of that last phrase’”.</p>\n          <p>This book makes a case for Frost as America’s preeminent philosophical poet. The unfortunate effect of Frost’s early detractors’ claim that he was merely an ironic and equivocal anecdotalist has for too long relegated his work to the second tier of the modernist poetic pantheon. This study, by contrast, supports Robert Graves’ claim for Frost as the “first American poet who could be honestly reckoned a master poet by world standards.”</p>"

The analysis is based on the assumptions that the global economy is facing the possibility of decoupling of many trade connections, and this trend favors deglobalization processes that have long been promoted by populism, nationalism, and economic protectionism. It is concluded that global supply, production, and value chains although being economically efficient are no longer any more secure under national protectionist policies, and therefore, the relocation of production processes is mainly due to the increase in the level of income and wages of the developing countries that are the destination and which reduce the advantages to relocate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>T he Democratic Republic of Congo in short DRC which has been blessed with a flurry of minerals has been suffering from the paradoxical “resource curse” showing worse economic development than countries with fewer resources, this has been due to weak democratic development, corruption, and civil war. Increased levels of corruption in the mining sector resulted in great political instability because whoever controls the assets usually those with political might use them for their own benefit, the increase in importance of minerals like cobalt and coltan due to the ubiquity and necessity of mobile phones which heavily rely on these materials has resulted in warlords and armies in DRC converting ASMs (Artisan and small miners) into slave laborers, soaring prices of materials like coltan are said to have brought militias more than 20 million dollars (about twice the cost of a celebrity mansion) a month. With increasing demand from buyers to purchase ethically sourced materials there is an increasing need to reform the mining industry in DRC and one of the propositions is through ethical supply chain management using blockchain technology. One of the major benefits of blockchain technology is accountability according to UN surveys military occupation by Ugandan and Rwandese soldiers plus other foreign military forces as well as many bands of Congo military factions fighting there was massive looting of Congolese natural resources and the fighters were enriching themselves by mining and smuggling out coltan, Copper, gold, diamonds etc. This could have been averted if there was an accountability measure in the purchase and resale of these materials that is in the supply chain of these ores. Accountability or lack thereof which has led to unspeakable evils like slave labor is not the only malevolent act that has been a result of these mining expeditions soil erosion and other environmental concerns like pollution of rivers and the increasing reduction of eastern mountain gorillas is just another example. This paper will talk about how blockchain can be integrated into this supply chain network to enhance traceability, increase efficiency and speed of supply, improve financing, contracting, and international transactions and how a workable technology can be created.</p>"

Distinct controls dedicated to different levels of domains, namely human resources, access control, asset management, cryptography, physical security, operations security, supplier relations, acquisition, incident management, and security governance are provided. Companies, contractors, and any others who are part of the supply chain organization must follow this security framework to defend from any cyber-attacks. </jats:p>"

The development of industry and increasing consumer concern for the environment as well as issues regarding the concept of an environmentally sound industry have forced industries to adjust in line with the GSCM concept. To make the program a success, Green Manufacturing, Green Distribution, and Reverse Logistics are assumed to be supporting the implementation process. This study uses quantitative methods, with the number of samples taken randomly as many as 70 people. The analysis was carried out using the Path Analysis method. Hypothesis testing was carried out in two stages, namely Structural Model-1 and Structural Model-2 testing to obtain each path coefficient number. The results of the study conclude that there is the contribution of Green Manufacturing, Green Distribution, and Reverse Logistics on the success of GSM implementation so that companies must always pay attention to the facilities and related policies to improve the performance of those variables.</jats:p>"

At the same time, the environmental effects should be minimized. In this research, a nonlinear mixed-integer multiobjective model is developed to design a green closed-loop supply chain for medical products. In this supply chain, the echelons include supplier, manufacturer, warehouse, and customer in the forward supply chain and collection centers, repair services, and disposal centers in the reverse supply chain. In the proposed model, four objectives of customer satisfaction, environmental effects, supply risk, and total costs of the supply chain were considered. The developed model is implemented in a supply chain of medical products, and after optimizing the model, the main results including location and capacity of facilities, planning for flexible production, purchase of materials, service and maintenance plan, product transfer, and inventory level are determined and analyzed.</jats:p>",

Meskipun semakin banyak literatur di bidang manajemen rantai pasokan yang berkelanjutan, tidak ada artikel ulasan yang secara komprehensif mensintesis penelitian mutakhir di industri otomotif. Untuk menutupi kesenjangan ini, makalah ini meninjau literatur manajemen rantai pasokan berkelanjutan di industri otomotif yang diterbitkan antara 1995 dan 2017. Tinjauan sistematis dan analisis konten dilakukan untuk mengumpulkan studi dan menganalisis kontennya. Analisis konten disusun berdasarkan serangkaian proses bisnis utama yang mengikuti metode Fungsi Definisi Integrasi (IDEF0), yang merupakan pendekatan terstruktur untuk menganalisis proses bisnis. Studi ini memberikan pedoman praktis untuk merancang rantai pasokan otomotif yang berkelanjutan dan memuncak dengan kesenjangan penelitian yang diuraikan dan rekomendasi untuk penelitian masa depan.</p>"

This research aims to analyze factors affecting the strategic efficiency of the supply chain (SPSC) and the OPSC by quantitative and quality research in the automotive industries. The research aims to evaluate the main outcomes, such as checked theories and established levels of buildings between IKCO and Isuzu, as studies in the automotive industry. In total, IKCO and Isuzu businesses received a total of 217 and 201 completed questionnaires. SPSS analyzes Cronbach's Alpha, where all values of Alpha are highly reasonable, also tested the reliability of results. Path analyzes (PA) were engaged in discovering the occasional relationship between variables through multi-regression in PHSA, according to SPSC and OPSC as the key-dependent variables. SPSC and OPSC have been structured, based on the PA methodology, to assess IKCO and Isuzu's distribution chain efficiency. The Maximal Factor Likelihood (ML), used for the study of normality, outliers and composite stability, validity, and evaluating theories of Amos, was the foundation for confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). The qualitative analysis was also conducted to clarify the dimensions and assess the actual condition through interviews and documents. In conclusion, study results show that IT, organizational learning (OL), and product creativity (PRI) have affected the strategic success of the supply chain. However, SPSC has little impact on transformational leadership. In addition, method innovation (PI) and relationship efficiency affected the organizational output of the supply chain (PQ). The SPSC and OPSC have first been studied in the automobile sector. The research difference has been established, and the research center and SCM as the key foundation for automotive producers have been recognized.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Malaysia, manufacturing industry is a major contributor to the economic advancement. As a result, cutting-edge technology like the internet of things (IoT) is projected to have a significant impact on business operations and supply chain management (SCM). However, research into the influence of IoT deployment on supply chains and organizational performance is relatively sparse. Therefore, this study is to determine the relationship between benefits and challenges of IoT adoption and organizational performance. Furthermore, this study looks into the mediating role of supply chain performance in the relationship between IoT adoption benefits and challenges and organizational performance. The population of this study is comprised of 3019 manufacturing companies in Malaysia, while the minimum sample size needed is 43 manufacturing companies.1160 complete set of survey questionnaire were distributed through email and 63 responses received representing five per cent of response rate. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to assess all of the study's hypotheses. The results of this paper support six out of the seven hypotheses tested. In conclusion, the manufacturing industry in Malaysia needs to be exposed more to the benefits of IoT rather than keep discussing its challenges. This study can be a guideline to the manufacturing companies in decision making for IoT adoption. The limitations and recommendation for future study is highlighted.</jats:p>"

A survey tool based on the existing literature was developed and relevant data were collected from 351 Industrial Saudi organizations on this tool. In the data analysis the validation of the instrument is mainly carried out with confirmatory factor analysis in terms of unidimensionality, durability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, nomological validity, and the associated validity criteria. A parsimonious instrument that makes an important contribution to the SCM literature is generated by the results of this research. The instrument will allow an enterprise to incorporate various SCMPs, to keep track of the implementation status, and then to evaluate SCM performance to the SCM dimensions.</jats:p>"

The water balance was analyzed using the Please check all author names carefullyMODSIM-decision support system (MODSIM-DSS) to evaluate the agricultural water supply capacity. MODSIM-DSS can also be used to analyze the watershed demand status and agricultural water supply facilities. In this study, the watershed inflow and agricultural reservoir inflow (supply) data for each watershed were obtained using the SWAT outflow data. SWAT was calibrated and validated using 16-years (2005–2020) of daily streamflow data from one water level station and two weirs, by considering water withdrawal and return flows from agricultural, domestic, and industrial water use. The coefficient of determination (R2) was analyzed as 0.50 to 0.80 at three stations. Then, water balance analyses were performed for 41 years (1980–2020) by applying the SWAT outflow results to MODSIM-DSS. The results showed that agricultural water shortages of 517.8 × 106 m3, 520.0 × 106 m3, 579.8 × 106 m3, and 517.5 × 106 m3, occurred in 1992, 1994, 1995, and 2015, respectively. The efficiencies of agricultural water supply for these years were 58.2%, 58.0%, 53.2%, and 58.2%, respectively, which were lower than the 40-year average of 84.5%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new approach for reducing output noises in the level-shifter is presented. The\nlevel-shifters which are intended for making the high-voltage amplitude signal from lowvoltage amplitude signal, has a big issue related to the output noises. The noises that come from parasitic capacitances and other sources become much higher in the output as the circuit increases the amplitude of the input signal in the output, so it also increases the\nnoises. These level-shifters also have the delay time issue. The delay time range between\nthe input signal and output signal is not so low. Using the capacitances in the output for\nreducing the noises can increase the delay time range, which is not a good feature for the\ncircuit. The new method reduces the output noises without increasing the delay time range, also it increases the area of the circuit with a little percent. By using this method in 32nm technology, the area of the circuit increases by 14% and the noise error decreases by 68%</jats:p>"

The research also incorporated the mediation role of environmental sustainability between green HR practices, Green Supply Chain, and green business. A structural study methodology was used with 220 samples drawn from manufacturing companies in the province of Central Java. A questionnaire was used to collect data. The PLS(SEM) was also utilized to assess the constructs' reliability and validity as well as investigate their hypothesized links. The finding of this study indicates that environmental sustainability significantly mediates the relationship between green HRM, green supply chain, and green business. The research also finds a positive relationship between green HRM, environmental sustainability, and green businesses. Similarly, findings also found a significant relationship between green supply chain, environmental sustainability, and green industries. The results of this study can be applied to strengthen the resource based theory and literature of HRM and supply chain management. There are several practical managerial implications for improving the performance of manufacturing companies in Central Java. They provide recommendations for practitioners and managers to improve the business performance of companies based on green HRM, green supply chain, and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability aims at a sound synergy of the economic, ecological and social dimension. To promote sustainable development and guarantee a high living-standard for future generations, all three elements must be balanced. The economy impacts the other two dimensions along the value chain. Particularly critical is the impact of the supply chain as human working conditions and environmental standards must be secured for procurement of materials along complex transportation routes. To tackle this issue, France has passed a Supply Chain Law (Loi de vigilance) in 2017, Britain has passed the Modern Slavery Act which prohibits child labor in 2015 and Germany has passed a Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettengesetz) in June 2021. Furthermore, a EU-wide supply chain law on due diligence and environmental standards for supply chains is expected for 2022. A transparent digitalized version of a company´s supply chain, including its human resources and environmental impact, would facilitate the identification of several sustainability intervention points. Such transparency could lead to not only better and supply chain law-compliant regulations for fairer working conditions and improved social sustainability, but also to optimized circular economy processes. However, there is also the risk that a high level oftransparency in complex supply chains entails very high bureaucratic efforts. With this conceptual outline, we would like to contribute to the discussion of the new German legislation and present a variety of IT solutions to improve and monitor the sustainability of supply chains as well as to reduce the bureaucratic effort which comes with supply chain supervision.</jats:p>"

However, the development of this commodity still has many obstacles, especially in the ability to provide high-quality products, resource capabilities and manage existing information, especially the farmers who are involved in cooperation in this supply chain system, so that it can impact their performance. This study explores the mediating effect of collaborative performance systems (CPS) in lateral collaboration structures such as; information sharing (ISH), resource sharing (RSH), contract farming (CTF) and join mode transportation (JTM) in individual companies (CIP) and supply chain performance (SPO) in the fresh produce supply chain (FPSC). The sample in this study was taken based on purposive sampling from the participation of respondents in the FPSC network consisting of farmers producing fresh vegetables and fruits who are members of the Association of the Farmers Groups (Gapoktan), distributors, owners of transportation modes and supermarkets. Respondents consisted of 72 people who had filled out complete questionnaires from their four supply chain channel partners. Data collection methods were analyzed using a structural equation approach. The results of the study that the mediation of CPS on the performance of CIP and SPO in the FPSC was confirmed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cloud-based data integration and machine learning applications are becoming increasingly popular in many industries because they provide a great deal of flexibility for managing different types of specialized data. Cloud platforms can now handle large volumes of diverse data rapidly, and they support a variety of storage services and machine learning applications for big data analytics. Creating advances in reliability, speed, and robustness on a secure platform, they permits the development of powerful enhancements to business functions. In the rigorous regulatory environment of biopharmaceutical supply chain operations, the value of cloud-based services in data integration process efficiency and capability for machine learning-based analytics is of significant importance. This text explains the use of cloud-based data integration and machine learning applications in the biopharmaceutical supply chain planning and management area, where significant but underutilized data resources exist. The use of production planning-related data can yield significant strategic and tactical advantages in reliability, responsiveness, and cost control, offering substantial commercial benefits. A secure cloud-based data integration platform can enable a high level of capability, efficiency, validation, and transparency for use in biopharmaceutical regulatory environments. The scope can increase the potential for both continuous improvement and benefits from operational analytical techniques and can enhance trust at all levels of planning and operations. Regulatory requirements for biopharmaceutical data acquisition, processing, and analysis can be addressed using a secure, high-capability platform, repository, and large-scale machine-learning application technologies. Consequently, a high-power platform methodology can be prepared for use in a variety of upgrade and value-added applications with a broad range of operational reach, which traditional internal capability cannot provide efficiently.</jats:p>"

The technology enhances the traditional business model and improves distance relations among companies and customers through well managed distribution channels, creates high-level customer satisfaction, and provides timely information in each stage of the supply chain process. Innovative technology allows companies to make more profit by saving time and making an additional product to meet specific demands cost-effectively. It is also reducing human efforts, which will be taking place by robotics soon.

The aim was to assess the practices of information technology adoption in the health supply chain management and also to identify the major challenges associated with the adoption of this technology in the Hospital. Methods: An in-depth interview was conducted with the 8 health workers in the different units of Alsabah children’s hospital viz. out-patient, pharmacy, EPI, Laboratory, state drug warehouse located within the hospital, and Admin and Finance department. Published articles were searched online to identify the relevant studies and the collected data were analysed narratively. Results: It was observed that no Information and Communication technologies application are used in the hospital for communication between the staff and the patients, monitoring of the patients, and supervision is done in person which is very difficult for the hospital staff to manage with serve shortage of the skilled and qualified staff in the hospital. Lack of internet facility is the main challenge and patient information is recorded in the registers and all the information from different units is submitted to the hospital statistician on a weekly basis for summarization. The hard copies of the report are submitted to the county health department office on a weekly and monthly basis. Conclusion: This study concluded that the management and the staff of the hospital face a lot of difficulties in performing their duties due to the lack of Information Communication Technologies in the hospital. A lot of time is spent attending to the patients, the decision is not made on time, and supervision of the patients is not adequately carried out. If provided new technologies, it will help the Physicians and the Nurses in performing their duties with ease and without wastage of time.</jats:p>"

The authors defined the essence of the concept of «supply chain». In the supply chain structure, it is possible to distinguish complete logistics chains, which, in turn, contain all key links and stages of the reproduction process, starting from raw material sources and ending with final consumers. New tasks related to the formation of rational logistics chains, supply chains and the construction of effective systems of their management have been analyzed. Comparative characteristic of supply chain management models is given. The key characteristic features include structural and conceptual, the level of interconnection with the enterprise strategy, the breadth of the set of activities, intra-organizational connections, inter-organizational connections, value forming factors, information support, etc. A new vision of economic transformation is established in logistics practice. Integration into global production networks will allow countries (especially Ukraine) to reveal their comparative advantages by focusing on specific tasks and industries. Modern production systems, which have become the end result of the dynamism of production factors, distribution and production networks, have been studied. The critical problems regarding the choice of existing corporate strategies by enterprises for their further effective expansion have been highlighted. The strategies available in the global economy have been analyzed, their advantages and disadvantages have been highlighted. In general, to establish the cumulative impact of all business processes on the level of performance of the supply chain, which will allow us to approach the measurement of the level of their synergistic effect, it is necessary to ensure constant monitoring of indicators in two areas: process and system. Under crisis economic conditions (in particular, instability of markets, destruction of well-established supply chains, in particular, due to military actions), there is a need for a quick response, complete modernization, and adaptation of the proposed logistics services throughout the supply chain. It has been proposed to form and offer a market of the latest, perfect, adaptive services to clients, which will allow balancing the unpredictability of the market with the need to obtain a stable, growing level of profitability.</jats:p>"

As a result, producing on-demand personal protective equipment (PPE) using additive manufacturing (AM) capabilities (3D-printing) emerged as a common strategy. While layer-by-layer processing confers several advantages to AM, it also imposes prohibitive print times, particularly for large volume parts. This leads to potential for using AM to rapidly produce smaller adaptors that modify available components for addressing critical shortages in emergencies. We applied this principle in developing a quick, simple, and low-cost adaptation of elastomeric half-mask respirators for emergency use in high-risk clinical settings.             As we move toward reopening society, we must proactively build stronger bridges between engineering and medicine to respond to critical shortages in PPE ensuing from a potential second wave.</jats:p>"

The non-stop production of massive amounts of data on various digital platforms has prompted academics and practitioners to focus on the data economy. Companies must rethink how to harness big data and take full advantage of its possibilities. Big data analytics can help them in giving valuable insights. This chapter provides an overview of big data analytics use in the supply chain field and underlines its potential role in the supply chain transformation. The results show that big data analytics techniques can be categorized into three types: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. These techniques influence supply chain processes and create business value. This study sets out future research directions. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Financial stress experienced by supply chain elements causes stress to all members. Predictive data mining is a common tool for predicting bankruptcy. Bankruptcy often involves highly imbalanced datasets with a large number of potential variables, with bankrupt firms being by far the minority case. This study uses data from four studies of firm bankruptcy and examines the impact of data balancing and variable selection on model accuracy. The models used are random forest and gradient boosting based on decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machines. Two machine learning methods are used to trim the number of variables. Stepwise regression and entropy from decision trees are used to generate reduced variable sets. The complexity parameter was used to set levels on number of variables using the entropy (decision tree) option. The impact of reducing variables is examined. Error metrics used were type I and type II error (sensitivity and specificity), overall average error (accuracy), and area under the recall curve (AuC). The average error of extreme gradient boosting and random forest models was found to be better than support vector machines, which had a slight advantage over logistic regression and neural networks. Variable reduction was found to lead to mixed results with respect to relative accuracy. Overall accuracy increased with slight reduction in the number of variables (using stepwise regression), but deteriorated as the number of variables was reduced to the smaller number of variables. The experiments into balancing found that unbalanced data had high error rates, which dropped a great deal with even 10 percent balancing, but balancing beyond 10 percent was found to provide little additional accuracy.</jats:p>"

This has positive effects on the environment, the climate, biodiversity and animal welfare. An increase in organic farming also has a direct impact on reducing or eliminating fertilisers, pesticides and antibiotics. There are significant growth rates in egg production in particular, while other processing sectors have so far only been able to come up with small shares. The share of fattening poultry and pigs is still well below 2%, while the share of eggs is already 15% and rising. The demand for protein is mainly covered by soy, but other protein sources such as legumes and especially sunflower and rapeseed have become very important. Sustainability and CO2 reduction are at the centre of public interest. Origin from European cultivation is therefore becoming extremely important. This significantly reduces the impact on the climate. The previous main suppliers in South America are waiting with smaller market shares. This is especially true for the organic sector, while conventional processing continues to rely on non-European origins for cost reasons.</jats:p>"

From the standpoint of a supplier, this paper investigates the impact of rating changes, interest rate fluctuations, and business cycle position on the cost-benefit trade-off in the SMEs and manufacturing companies. However, the data was collected using a questionnaire. The main result is that changes in critical financial variables like ratings, news alerts and interest rates will shift former win–win circumstances for the supplier dependent on the business cycle into win–lose situations for the supplier. Overall, the reverse factoring results reveal sophisticated trade-offs, necessitating careful consideration in managerial decisions.</jats:p>"

This study uses descriptive research design. Two hundred and seven manufacturing industries in three industrial estates (Balaju, Bhaktapur, and Patan) of Kathmandu valley were taken as a sample for the study whereas all 245 operating industries were the population of the study. The findings revealed that 33.3% of industries are highly practicing green supply management chain whereas 23.7% and 19.6% are practicing it moderately and less, respectively. It was found that industries of all scale—large, medium, and low—are equally practicing green supply management chain to a greater extent. Thus, the study concludes that manufacturing industries ought to consider the systemic interaction between the internal and external facets of the application of the GSCM and to ensure that their respective operations are integrated in order to achieve improved environmental and organizational efficiency and consequently to achieve economic benefits.</jats:p>",

The authors compared the game behavior of the participants in the traditional supply chain finance and the supply chain finance on the blockchain and the difference of the mixed decision Nash equilibrium whether blockchain rewards and punishment were added. When the rewards and punishment were added to encourage the transaction information placing in the blockchain, the Nash equilibrium point would be further away from the origin point, and the capital provider and the capital demander would choose to cooperate with greater probability. When the cost of the blockchain is gradually reduced, the two sides of the game choose to place the transaction information in the chain, which can improve the cooperation of the participants of the supply chain finance, and they can get more profit.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined the influence of brand image on supply chain performance of automobile marketing firms in Rivers State of Nigeria. The population for the study was sixty-eight (68) automobile marketing firms in Rivers State, whose wholesome list was acquired from the business unit of the Rivers State Ministry of Commerce and Industry as at October, 2020. A causal thought-out analytical model was inculcated to grasp the two hypotheses poised for the study. To arrive at the sample size for the study, the Taro Yamane’s formula for determining sample size was used. The simple random technique of probability sampling was utilized to select 40 firms from the sample and the respondents for the study were verified by contacting four managers from each of the 40 automobile marketing firms under study. The number of respondents contacted was: 40 multiplied by 6, which gives 240 respondents. A 5-point likert-scaled questionnaire was administered to respondents. The accurate questionnaire sent out were 240, from which 215 responses were received, and after establishing the validity of the questions 200 (93%) The 200 questionnaires generated the useful response rate. The analysis was made up of descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS version 22 providing aid. The inferential statistics involved three parametric inferential tests- Pearson’s Product Moment Coefficient (PPMC), One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Simple Regression Analysis. The PPMC was used to test the relationship between the variables, ANOVA was employed to test the differences in means of responses on the variables, while by means of the simple regressions, the study tested the effect of the elements of brand image on supply chain performance. The results demonstrated that brand identity has a strong, positive and significant influence on supply chain performance, and brand personality has a moderate, positive and significant influence on supply chain performance. Therefore, the study concludes that brand image significantly influences supply chain performance of automobile marketing firms in Rivers State, and recommends that, managers of automobile marketing firms should design brand image enhancing programs that are competent in bringing about positive supply chain performance in order to survive in the highly competitive and dynamic business landscape.</jats:p>",

Five indices responsible for water supply-demand imbalance are considered on both water resources supply and demand sides, and corresponding regulation strategies are proposed to restore water supply-demand balance by improving the water supply capacity of conventional and non-conventional water resources, improving water-use efficiency, and controlling the social and economic development scale. The proposed hierarchical index system has been successfully applied to the analysis of the water supply-demand situation in Qingdao. The results reveal that in order to improve the severe water supply-demand situation in Qingdao, it is necessary to divert water from other regions and improve agricultural water-use efficiency. This study may provide insights into the design and preparation of inter-basin or cross-regional water diversion projects and the formulation of annual water diversion plans.</jats:p>"

The items are prone to different diseases during their growth which can lead to their death. This is modeled by applying a mortality rate that can be controlled by investing in preventive practices. The slaughtered items (such as chicken meat) that fall into the category of deteriorating inventory are quality controlled and exploited to satisfy demand. An analytic solution approach is developed to derive the optimal order quantity of newborn animals, their growth period, and action level for preventive practices. Experimental results show that choosing a hatchery with the best purchasing cost should be the first priority of the system to manage its costs. It is also depicted that the breeding period is not influenced by all input parameters of the model, and the nature of the items plays a key role in this regard.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the world’s population grows, resulting in the aggravating trend of aging population, it brings with it an increase in the demand for blood. Nowadays, in most cities, the blood distribution network is based on a single distribution centre pattern, with the blood centre acting as distribution centre for one‐to‐one distribution. However, despite its convenience, this pattern has a high frequency of delivery, increased risk of blood shortage, and generates high carbon emissions. This paper aims to understand the real‐life problems of the current blood distribution network and to design a more rational blood distribution network by taking the characteristics of the blood supply chain into account. Two blood distribution network patterns are considered, the current single distribution centre pattern and the proposed multiple distribution centre pattern. In order to minimise environmental impacts, we introduce open vehicle routing problem for blood delivery routes planning, using mixed integer programming for modelling, to compare the carbon emissions between the two blood distribution network patterns. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that applying the proposed BDN can reduce carbon emissions by an average of 25.84% and up to 29.59%, and the delivery time in emergency situations is significantly reduced by an average of 33.15%. Such studies are essential for both reducing carbon emissions and safeguarding patients’ lives.</jats:p>",

Based on the feedback of 313 manufacturing enterprises in four sectors (electronics, agriculture, food, textiles) operating in Vietnam, this study found some important findings. Firstly, GSCM has a positive and significant influence on the operational performance of businesses in Vietnam. Secondly, the resulting effect of implementing GSCM is better for enterprises with large scale and high export rates. This has reaffirmed the need to improve the overall supply chain management and green supply chain of this group of businesses. Overall, the findings suggest that improving GSCM practices is important not only for businesses in developed countries but also for businesses in emerging economic regions such as Vietnam.</jats:p>"

Inadequate water supplies tend to generate environmental and health issues. Improvements in water supply systems should give priority to the region with the most severe mismatch between water supply and demand. To set priorities for the improvement of water supply systems, this study proposed a water supply-demand balance model to quantify the water supply-demand gap in the Koshi River basin and compared it with the traditional water vulnerability model. The results suggested that (1) the water supply-demand balance model had good applicability to the Koshi River basin and was superior to traditional models in identifying the region with the most severe mismatch; (2) the shortage of agricultural water was much more serious than that of domestic water in the basin; (3) the largest supply-demand gap of domestic water was in Tarai and that of agricultural water was in the hill areas; and (4) Four districts, including Lalitpur, Mahottari, Makwanpur, and Solukhumbu, were found to be the most water-stressed regions and priority should be given to them. Based on these findings, the priority setting in the improvement of water supply systems and adaptation strategies for mitigating water stress from the perspectives of the government, communities, and households were presented. It helps design water supply systems that match heterogeneous demands and optimize systems operation. Targeted improvements in water supply systems can make limited funds available to benefit more residents.</jats:p>"

While oil remains the leading energy commodity globally, copper is crucial for many new technologies, foremost for RES. Therefore, both oil and copper are extremely important for current and future energy security. This article contains a bivariate methodological approach to a comparative analysis of oil and copper supply: determining supply security with an Index of security of supply, and examines price stability with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models. This research provides evidence that there are many differences but also significant similarities between these two completely different commodities in terms of both supply security and price stability. Facing the future for RES, significant demand may cause a threat to energy security on a previously unknown scale. Therefore this instability, both supply- and price-related, appears to be the main threat to future energy security.</jats:p>"

In information systems and computer science, mobility is used for the concept of mobile computing, in which a computer is transported by a person during normal use. Logistics creates by the design of logistics networks the infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods. Electric mobility is one of today’s solutions from an engineering perspective to reduce the need of energy resources and environmental impact. Moreover, for urban planning, mobility is the crunch question about how to optimize the different needs for mobility and how to link different transportation systems. In this publication we collected the ideas of practitioners, researchers, and government officials regarding the different modes of mobility in a globalised world, focusing on both domestic and international issues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Socioeconomic drought is a phenomenon of water shortage caused by an imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources in natural and human socioeconomic systems. Occurrence of these droughts is closely related to sustainable socioeconomic development. However, compared with meteorological drought, hydrological drought and agricultural drought, socioeconomic drought has received relatively little attention. Therefore, this paper proposes a universal and relatively simple socioeconomic drought assessment index, the Standardized Supply and Demand Water Index (SSDWI). Taking the Jianjiang River Basin (JJRB) in Guangdong Province, China as an example, socioeconomic drought characteristics and trends during 1985-2019 were analyzed. The return period of different levels of drought were calculated using a copula function to estimate the risk of socioeconomic drought in the basin, and the relationship between socioeconomic, meteorological, and hydrological droughts and their potential drivers were discussed. The results showed that: (1) SSDWI was a better index for characterizing socioeconomic drought in the JJRB. 29 socioeconomic droughts occurred in the basin during the past 35 years, with an average duration of 6.16 months and an average severity of 5.82 per events. Socioeconomic droughts mainly occurred in autumn and winter, which also had more severe droughts than other seasons. (2) In the JJRB, the joint return periods of ‘∪’ and ‘∩’ for moderate drought, severe drought and extreme drought were 8.81a and 10.81a, 16.49a and 26.44a, and 41.68a and 91.13a, respectively; (3) Due to the increasing outflow from Gaozhou Reservoir, the risk of socioeconomic drought and hydrological drought in the JJRB has significantly declined since 2008. The reasonable operation of the reservoir has played an important role in alleviating the hydrological and socioeconomic drought in the basin.</jats:p>"

The sensitivity analysis identified that the watershed is characterized by 13 sensitive parameters. The watershed receives around, 9.6%, 59.9%, and 30.5% precipitation during dry, wet and short rainy seasons, respectively. The received precipitation was lost by 9.6%, 40.5%, and 41.3% in the form of evapotranspiration for each season, correspondingly. The surface runoff contribution to the watershed was 3.8%, and 79.2% during dry and wet seasons, respectively, whereas it contributes by 17.0% during short rainy seasons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In the water supply network, leakage of pipes will cause water loss and increase the risk of environmental pollution. For water supply systems, identifying the leak point can improve the efficiency of pipeline leak repair. Most existing leak location methods can only locate the leak point approximately to the node or pipe section of the pipe network, but cannot locate the specific location of the pipe section. This paper presents a framework for accurate location of water supply network leakage based on ResNet. The framework is to pinpoint leaks to specific locations along the pipeline. The leakage of two kinds of pipe networks is simulated. For a pipe network containing 40 pipes, the positioning accuracy of the pipe section is 0.94, and the MSE of the specific location of the leakage point is 0.000435. For the pipe network containing 117 pipes, the positioning accuracy of the pipe section is 0.91, and the MSE of the specific location of the leakage point is 0.0009177, and the leak location ability under different sensor arrangements is analyzed. Experiments verify the robustness and applicability of the framework.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The article presents four categories of EU approaches on regulating supply chain responsibility. Sometimes, like in the case of the Kimberley process for conflict diamonds or with respect to illegally fished fishery products, the EU enacts restrictions or prohibitions that are specifically targeted at the import of foreign products. These import regimes are distinguished from marketing prohibitions for unethically produced goods. The prime examples are the European bans on cat and dog fur and seals products, as well as a possible future ban on goods made from forced labour. While these categories impose negative duties for EU importers and producers, the author also looks at EU regulations imposing positive obligations of EU companies. They may either be required to report about supply chain responsibility or need to entertain due diligence with respect to their import activities. For the latter category, the author discusses the EU regulations on tropical timber, conflict minerals, deforestation and general due diligence. Hoffmeister shows how these regimes fit into the normative framework of the European Union’s foreign policy objectives and argues that they are WTO compatible. He also provides a short comparative assessment about their effectiveness. </p>"

At the international level, foreign direct investment is mostly regulated through international investment agreements (IIAs). While most of these agreements are still silent on corporate responsibilities, there are some notable exceptions that mark the way forward toward a more balanced investment protection regime. This contribution argues that even though the main purpose of IIAs remains the promotion and protection of foreign investment, IIAs could equally be used to enhance corporate responsibilities. To that purpose, the contribution outlines possible legal sources and means of enforcement to establish corporate responsibilities through IIAs. </p>"

Renewable energy helps to reduce emissions if the industry supply chain is used optimally. Further, there is little understanding of how renewable energy implementation cost and stock dependence simultaneously impact supply chain (SC) profit. Thus, we propose a duopoly sustainable supply chain considering renewable implementation and stock-dependence demand under uncertain environments. A mathematical model is developed for a sustainable supply chain under three scenarios: (i) Renewable energy effort by manufacturer and cost-shared by the retailer (<jats:italic>Model M</jats:italic>) (ii) Renewable energy effort by retailer and cost-shared by the manufacturer (<jats:italic>Model R</jats:italic>), and (iii) Renewable energy effort by both retailer and manufacturer and cost-shared by the manufacturer and retailer (<jats:italic>Model C</jats:italic>). Nash equilibrium was used to find optimal strategies for players under different integrated channels. The result finds that <jats:italic>Model M</jats:italic> is comparatively better than the other two models as cost-sharing increases. The result additionally establishes that the total profit decreases as the cost of sharing increases<jats:italic> </jats:italic>in <jats:italic>Model C</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Model R, </jats:italic>whereas it increases in <jats:italic>Model M</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given blockchain’s ability to record and maintain information in an accessible, verifiable, non-repudiable and tamper-proof manner, this technology appears to provide a secure environment to improve product traceability and provenance throughout the extended supply-chain, which would particularly benefit the agri-food industry. Indeed, the extension and the multi-participant/multi-phase nature of the production cycle that characterize modern agri-food supply chains has made them increasingly difficult to manage, while ensuring that stakeholders are properly informed, that counterfeiting is identified and prevented, that safety standards are met, and that the origin and quality of agri-food products are properly certified. It is a growing opinion, among scholars, that blockchain – as a resilient record-keeping and tracing system - could overcome some of these critical issues; accordingly, smart contracts would be a potentially innovative tool to automatically execute agreements between the various parties involved and, perhaps, help monitor, regulate, and verify each (processing, storage, transfer, etc.) stage that forms the workflow. This paper – building upon the extant academic literature and taking into account Italian policies and legislation on the point – aims to explore the role of smart contracts in food-(block)chain traceability systems, evaluating suitability and critical issues. Finally, the possible contribution of smart contracts - when combined with IoT devices - for more effective (fully or partially automated) controls on food products will be analyzed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s constantly developing and changing world, businesses strive for superiority in various areas to survive and create competitive advantage. Businesses that can integrate sustainability into their activities can be more successful in this sense and take a step ahead of their competitors. The supply chain, which covers all the activities carried out in the process starting with the supply of materials until they are delivered to the end consumer, is another area where competition has been intense recently. To adapt to the order in the global environment, businesses need to adopt a different cost management approach while building their supply chains. While the cost management approach in earlier times only dealt with the management of costs arising within the enterprise, cost reduction processes in the modern age not only include the internal costs but also all the costs incurred throughout the supply chain outside the enterprise. Therefore, to achieve success and create a competitive advantage, the need to manage costs in an integrated manner arises. In this context, this study tackles the issue of sustainable cost in the retailing sector, which is an important element of the supply chain and has special importance in economic crises, with particular focus on Migros Trading Joint Stock Company (Migros Co.), one of the forty largest retail companies in the World. By analyzing the sustainability reports published by the company between 2016-2020, the factors affecting sustainability in retailing, sustainable value networks, and their sub-titles are examined in detail. According to the results obtained, in the specific case of Migros T.A.Ş., continuously developing the awareness of sustainability in the retail sector and particularly adopting sustainable cost management are very important factors for business success.</jats:p>"

It is the application of quantitative and qualitative techniques to resolve related issues and to foresee the results by considering quality of information. The problems like improved effort between companies, customers, governmental organizations and retailers, businesses are developing Big Data strategies. Big Data uses will be connected for Supply Chain Management throughout the fields as procurement, warehouse operations, transportation, advertising as well as for smart logistics. As supply chain networks getting great, much more complicated and driven by needs for more demanding service levels, the kind of information which is handled as well as examined likewise gets to be more complicated. The existing labor aims at providing an introduction of adoption of abilities of Data Analytics included in a \"next generation\" architecture by creating a linear regression type on a sales-data.

In simple terms, blockchain is a distributed ledger system, or a record book, except that it is not maintained by a single person but by anyone who is interested in keeping the records. Since blockchain is a new and revolutionary concept in technology, more techies are interested in it. However, it also has certain disadvantages. The purpose of this study is to explain the challenges and pitfalls of blockchain in supply chain and logistics. Using a systematic literature review method, this chapter identifies 31 publications that discuss the challenges and pitfalls associated with blockchain in supply chain and logistics. </jats:p>"

A tracer study is a commonly used approach for mixing performance evaluation but has limitations, such as limited sampling points and inability to be applied to the full scale at design stage. In practice, mixing time is usually estimated by the tracer curve measured by a probe sensor in a physical tracer study. However, the probe tracer concentration curve can be affected by many factors in the tracer release approach (e.g., instantaneous pouring or quill injecting), such as pouring volume, vertical penetration, and injecting time, making the estimated mixing time inaccurate. Coefficient of variation (CoV) decay curve is an alternative for determining mixing time. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed to study mixing in a cylindrical water tank. Mixing times were estimated from both probe tracer curve and CoV decay curve. Results show that the mixing time estimated from a probe tracer curve only represents local mixing, while that estimated from a CoV decay curve is a more appropriate index for global mixing, suggesting that the CoV decay curve should be used for mixing performance analysis in a water tank.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most essential factors in a company's overall supply chain management success is the location of its manufacturing facilities. Due to the emerging energy crisis, the demand for insulation materials is rising, which increases the competition for insulation material companies. To stay competitive, the companies might consider expanding to different locations. This decision entails the consideration of various factors and alternatives, which could be formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This paper contributes to the problem of location selection in the chemical industry, by implementing two MCDM methods, Best-Worst Method (BWM) and ELECTRE III, in a real-world case company. Based on a thorough literature study and data from interviews with the decision-makers, seven criteria and nine countries as alternatives were chosen. The BWM was used to elicit the weights of all the criteria from a group of decision-makers. Then, ELECTREE III was used to generate a ranking of the alternative countries. Based on the results, the main recommendation to the case company was to choose France as the most appropriate location for the new manufacturing unit. The findings of this research have insights for other companies in the chemical industry deciding on new locations for their manufacturing.</jats:p>"

It is proposed for noise droop to introduce a nonlinear dead zone (NZ) at the controller input, which is determined by the requirements of the control accuracy in a stationary mode and is implemented using an approximating nonlinear function with saturation. As a result, noise droop is achieved at the NZ output by error asymptotic approximation to zero, in contrast to the threshold noise suppression. Research is carried out and results that reflect the effectiveness of the proposed solution is obtained.\n\nKeywords\napproximating nonlinear function, dead zone, PID controller, noise droop coefficient, transient process</jats:p>"

BoP businesses contribute to the first UN Sustainable Development Goal that calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations. BoP businesses are regarded as financially and socially beneficial for both participating firms and poor communities. It is, however, understood that success in BoP markets cannot (and should not) be assumed, as it demands a profoundly different view towards managing supply chains. Focusing on this issue, our conceptual study contributes to the emerging debates in BoP and supply chain management research by elaborating the notion of legitimacy contexts (LCs) at BoP. We draw on institutional theory to characterize the LCs in BoP markets and discuss their implications for key supply chain functions. We argue that firms often design their supply chain functions for BoP business using their own LCs as opposed to those of BoP actors. This implies ignoring the institutional distance between BoP markets and firms and reveals a key culprit in the failure of BoP projects. We offer practical implications for firms intending to engage in BoP business.</jats:p>"

The empirical findings were used to examine the extent of migration to and from the country, from the perspectives of skills supply and demand.  Emigrants were most educated, enjoyed the lowest unemployment probability (about 10%), and were most likely to be involved in high-paying skilled occupations and tertiary sector activities as full-time employees (if employed). The immigrants fared worse than the emigrants but better than natives. These immigrants, mainly originating from the other African countries, were slightly more educated, but enjoyed higher LFPR (75%) and lower unemployment likelihood (20%), compared with the natives (55% and 30% respectively). Furthermore, for both above-mentioned two groups, they were distinguished into long-term, medium-term and short-term migrants, and it was found that long-term migrants fared relatively better in the labour markets of their respective host countries.  Overall, the findings strongly indicated brain drain out of South Africa, and exodus of highly educated and skilled people is not complemented by a rapid increase of supply of equally educated and skilled labour force entrants in the country. The study recommended four policy suggestions: ease up regulations to attract skilled immigrants, promote entrepreneurial activities of immigrants, better develop and retain skills of the natives, improve migration and vacancy data capture, availability, usage and analysis.</jats:p>"

This research aims to develop a mathematical model for urban water supply crises (UWC) able to deal with the ambiguity of the real available data. The applied methodology comprises the following steps: (i) identifying the influencing factors in UWC; (ii) proposing a conceptual model for the description of UWC; (iii) collecting and simulating the necessary and available data; (iv) optimizing the conceptual model parameters; and (v) verifying the proposed model performance. The results indicate that there are many influencing factors in UWC. The model developed comprises two parts or two sub-models. The first sub-model explains water consumption, and the second sub-model explains water availability. In the first sub-model, the functions are related to the factors that influence water consumption. In the second sub-model, the functions are related to the factors that influence the availability of water. This research also aims to analyze the possibility of applying Fuzzy Logic to deal with the ambiguity of real data. It was concluded that, with the proposed model, the UWC was modeled appropriately. The model proposed can help to predict the impact of actions such as reducing losses, reducing pressure on the water supply network and intermittent supply on the intensity of water crisis cases in cities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ports have been taking major steps to improve information sharing for supporting their port call services. Despite the strong aspiration for this improvement, progress is still slow. In this paper, we argue that the progress is hampered by the challenges of an inter-organizational nature. To explore this argument, we conceptualize the link between inter-organizational relationships and information sharing in ports. We use and operationalize the partnership model, which was originally proposed for the supply chains, for the port context. We test the applicability of the model for the port of Rotterdam. Data was collected using desk research, expert interviews and surveys amongst all port actors.  We find that potential for inter-organizational relationships varies substantially between the port actors, which implies an unequal potential for information sharing between them. While some actors show potential for strong relationships, in which two-way frequent exchange of information is supported, others could only support basic, occasional, or unbalanced information sharing. Therefore, it is unrealistic to assume that the information can be uniformly exchanged between all the actors. Instead, we suggest tailored information-sharing strategies that fit to actors’ business interests and characteristics. We conclude that this salient aspect of inter-organizational relationships between port actors should be acknowledged and considered for the effective design of port development strategies.</jats:p>"

It is necessary to find ways to maximize the creation of added value by Russian residents both in order to ensure the economic security of the country and to ensure the sustainable development of all levels of management. An important condition for sustainable development is the balance of social, economic and environmental development of the country and the region, which is especially important for the production of sanitary and hygienic products. The emerging market conditions and the general turbulence in the formation of demand for paper sanitary ware during the pandemic served as the basis for conducting this study, the main purpose of which was to identify factors for the optimal supply in the sanitary ware market for manufacturing enterprises and determine the conditions for starting a business, taking into account the needs world market. In the course of the study, an analysis of the domestic market, the dynamics of supply and demand of the market for sanitary and hygienic products in the Russian Federation and on the world market was carried out; studies of the export activity of Russian manufacturers of sanitary and hygienic products were carried out; the main trends in the consumption of sanitary and hygienic products in the Russian domestic market were identified; recommendations are proposed for optimizing the activities of manufacturing enterprises, taking into account domestic and global market conditions. The results of the study can be used by Russian SMEs to make management decisions in the implementation of strategic and operational planning for the production and sale of paper sanitary and hygienic products.</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is to develop models for the integration of Croatian intangible cultural heritage protected by UNESCO into the tourism supply. For this purpose, Croatian intangible cultural assets are divided into four categories: 1) knowledge and skills, 2) musical expressions, 3) customs, rituals and traditional manifestations, and 4) traditional crafts. The model proposed for each category is based on the tourist motivation and the main activities that intangible cultural heritage can stimulate in tourists, as well as on the tourism products through which intangible cultural assets can be included in the tourism supply of destinations.</jats:p>"

This paper identifies a list of sustainability indicators for examining the supply chains of construction companies. Those indicators were categorized and assigned to one or a couple groups by reviewing their use in the previous literature agreeing to the reasoning to way better reflect the SSCM principle of their use in construction companies. The use of indicators can help develop strategies for the construction sector for sustainable policy makers and construction company managers.</jats:p>",

During the first wave of the pandemic, long, undiversified, and lean global supply chains were destabilized by a massive surge in demand for care, that required high volumes of critical health products for care delivery (Snowdon, Saunders &amp; Wright, 2021). China, the primary manufacturer of a number of critical health products and the first site of a COVID-19 outbreak, temporarily shuttered its manufacturing capacity. As a result, there were severe product shortages across every global health system. Manufacturers were unable to rapidly scale their production capacity to meet the sudden and dramatic increase in the demand for critical products, which resulted in a destabilizing “ripple effect” across global healthcare supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the surge in supply demands it created, exposed the fragility that rapidly destabilized these global healthcare supply chains. This destabilization of healthcare supply chains impacted every jurisdiction in Canada and touched the lives of healthcare workers, patients, citizens, and non-permanent residents (such as temporary foreign workers).\r\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In a globalised economy, transnational corporations from all sectors are directly or indirectly linked to global supply chains, in particular through transnational business activities and foreign investments. That this represents a potential threat to individuals and the environment has been revealed by persistent human rights abuses and damage to the environment. In practice, human rights abuses by transnational corporations often take place in countries of the Global South and affect the most vulnerable people, such as women workers, child labourers and residents of poor and rural areas. Nevertheless, the existing international human rights system does not impose direct human rights obligations on private actors, including transnational corporations. The responsibilities of transnational corporations for human rights in global supply chains are mainly based on a patchwork of soft regulations. In recent years, however, new initiatives have emerged at the national and international level, such as the the development of an internationally legally binding treaty to regulate business activities with respect to human rights or domestic legislation for corporate due diligence obligations. Most of these initiatives emphasise the role of the State in incorporating a “mediated” approach to the human rights responsibility of transnational corporations. This article explores recent developments connected to the human rights responsibilities of corporations and discusses their feasibility under international human rights law.</p>"

Die Literaturanalyse gibt Aufschluss darüber, inwieweit Process Mining im Speziellen im Mehrwegbehältermanagement und unter der Integration von Kontextinformationen und -bewusstsein Anwendung findet. Die Basis der Analyse bildet die zentrale Forschungsfrage: „Wie können mit Ereignisdaten verknüpfte Kontextinformationen bei der Anwendung von Process Mining im Mehrwegbehältermanagement berücksichtigt werden?“. Methodisches Vorgehen: Um die aktuellen Forschungsthemen im Bereich Process Mining zu ermitteln wurde eine systematische Literaturrecherche mittels ausgewählter wissenschaftlicher Datenbanken, unter Berücksichtigung definierter Ausschlusskriterien, durchgeführt. Für die Analyse werden themenrelevante und aktuelle Veröffentlichungen herangezogen. Ergebnisse: Im Bereich Mehrwegbehältermanagement und Process Mining wird deutlich, dass nur wenige Veröffentlichungen existieren. Bei der Recherche wurde deshalb auch Literatur aus der Logistik im Allgemeinen berücksichtigt. Deutlich wird die Herausforderung der Datenstrukturierung bei der Anwendung von Process Mining in einem organisationsübergreifenden Prozessumfeld, wie der Logistik. Die Berücksichtigung von Kontextinformationen im Process Mining hat das Potenzial die Process-Mining-Ergebnisse zu verbessern. Kontextbewusstsein wird im Process Mining oft vernachlässigt und diese Literaturanalyse zeigt, dass auf diesem Gebiet noch weiterer Forschungsbedarf besteht. Einschränkungen/Konsequenzen: Die Analyse zeigt den aktuellen Forschungsstand im Bereich Process Mining und Logistik unter Berücksichtigung von Kontextinformationen. Durch die begrenzte Auswahl an Datenbanken und die fest definierten Suchkriterien ist die Literaturanalyse auf diesen Bereich beschränkt. Weitere Anwendungsfelder von Process Mining werden deshalb nicht berücksichtigt.</jats:p>"

One of the most important objectives of the supply chain which can be adversely affected by disruptions, is environmental objective. Therefore, considering supply chain resilience and environmental aspects simultaneously is of great importance. In this paper, the problem of designing a green and resilient mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network under operational and disruption risks has been studied. A bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to formulate the problem. Some resilience strategies are applied to deal with disruption risks and enhance supply chain resilience. In order to overcome the complexity of the problem and solve the problems with medium and large sizes, a new meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective hybrid Ant-colony optimization and teaching and learning based optimization (ACO-TLBO) has been proposed and compared with two hybrid metaheuristics and the augmented ε-constraint method through various test problems. The outcomes showed that the ACO-TLBO algorithm is very efficient in obtaining high-quality Pareto solutions and is the best method among the proposed methods. Also, in order to show the applicability of the problem and validate the model and solution methods, a real case study in the tire industry has been presented and analyzed. The results of analyses demonstrate the high effectiveness of resilience strategies and the necessity of joint consideration of resilience and greenness in the supply chain design.</jats:p>"

Methodology: A descriptive research design has been used for assessing satisfaction. The data collection was carried out from 28 April/20, 2019 to – 20 June/2019. All hospitals in the study area were selected purposively and simple random sampling with a lottery method was used to pick health centers from the sampling frame. A total of 64 participants were selected for data collection. Epidata software and SPSS version 20 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Frequency distribution, arithmetic means, and percentages were calculated. Result: All questionaries were successfully filled and returned. It discovered that 41(64.1%) of respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, while 19(29.7%) considered themselves as ‘satisfied’ with the overall quality of the logistics services they received. Besides, 3(4.7%) of the respondents said they were ‘dissatisfied’ with the service and 1(1.6%) was highly dissatisfied with the service. From all dimensions, the condition of pharmaceutical delivery and product availability received the highest (3.749) and the lowest mean score (2.885), respectively. Conclusion: The overall perceived satisfaction of public health facilities with the quality of logistics service given by the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency Bahirdar hub was in the middle of the continuum, with the mean score close to the 5-Likert scale midpoint.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global retail business has become diverse and latest Information Technology (IT) advancements have created new possibilities for the management of the deluge of data generated by world-wide business operations of its supply chain. In this business, external data from social media and supplier networks provide a huge influx to augment existing data. This is combined with data from sensors and intelligent machines, commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT) data. This data, originating from the global retail supply chain, is simply known as Big Data - because of its enormous volume, the velocity with which it arrives in the global retail business environment, its veracity to quality related issues, and values it generates for the global supply chain. Many retail products manufacturing companies are trying to find ways to enhance their quality of operational performance while reducing business support costs. They do this primarily by improving defect tracking and better forecasting. These manufacturing and operational improvements along with a favorable customer experience remain crucil to thriving in global competition. In recent years, Big Data and its associated technologies are attracting huge research interest with academics, industry practitioners, and government agencies. Big Data-based software applications are widely used within retail supply chain management - in recommendation, prediction, and decision support systems. The spectacular growth of these software systems has enormous potential for improving the daily performance of retail product and service companies. However, there are increasingly data quality problems resulting in erroneous tesing costs in retail Supply Chain Management (SCM). The heavy investment made in Big Data-based software applications puts increasing pressure on management to justify the quality assurance in these software systems. This chapter discusses about data quality and the dimensions of data quality for Big Data applications. It also examines some of the challenges presented by managing the quality and governance of Big Data, and how those can be balanced with the need of delivery usable Big Data-based software systems. Finally, the chapter highlights the importance of data governance; and it also includes some of the Big Data managerial practice related issues and their justifications for achieving application software quality assurance.</jats:p>"

However, enterprises must first find, analyze, and select potential startups as suppliers before they can exploit startups' resources and talents in a buyer–supplier relationship. Due to the fact that earlier research has focused exclusively on how purchasing firms select established firms as suppliers, it is unknown which processes, tools, or organizational approaches purchasing organizations employ when selecting startup firms as suppliers. These suppliers are qualitatively distinct in that they lack organizational structure, financial resources, and operational competencies, offering a substantial risk to purchasing organizations. This inductive, qualitative case study research elicits data from twenty established purchasing firms and examines how they choose startup suppliers. We begin by identifying five design motifs that differentiate purchasing firms' selection procedures. We create a typology of three supplier selection paradigms based on these themes. The findings suggest that enterprises who are ready and able to adjust their selection technique to startups should exhibit a higher level of selection performance, implying a greater likelihood of selecting acceptable startups as suppliers. The findings contribute to the literature on supplier selection and shed light on the burgeoning sector of new venture suppliers.</jats:p>"

It has thrown some SMEs into a financial crunch, forced them to reduce/remove their workforce, hampered production due to prolonged lockdowns, halted their logistics and supply chain activities, and delayed their delivery schedules enormously. The revival of the SME sector is very important for the survival of the economy. One of the most important aspects of this revival strategy would be to innovate their existing supply chains for more visibility, transparency, and robustness through the adoption of affordable digital technologies. In spite of advanced studies in SC innovation, the in-depth studies related to this area of SMEs towards sustainability are still very scanty and inadequate. Therefore, this chapter proposes to develop a framework of SC Innovation for the sustainability of SMEs through a systematic literature review. This framework will be very useful to the owners and employees of SMEs and various researchers. </jats:p>"

The measurement instrument was applied to 93 companies from the food industry sector of Michoacán, México which are divided into nine sectors; grinding grains and seeds, obtaining oils and fats, confectionery with and without cocoa, preserving fruits, vegetables and prepared foods, dairy products, meat and poultry processing, preparation and packaging of fish and seafood, bakery and tortillas. The Integrative activities are analyzed by means of statistical descriptions, paired samples test, one-sided contrast, mean difference and confidence intervals and associations. The results indicate that the difference is always in favor of customers than for suppliers.</jats:p>"

The capitalist food system is one that develops through temporary measures—acts that seek to patch structural weaknesses before they explode in ways that could destabilize the system itself. Looking via the lens of US animal agriculture, this concluding chapter asks if viewing the food system in this way might open up alternative ways of thinking about political agency in times of mundane crisis, highlighting the messy contingencies of capitalism’s own persistent efforts to foreclose the realizations of other, fuller visions of nourishment.</jats:p>"

The research objectives were achieved in terms of a sophisticated multi-country project resulting in assessment of the supply chain management for small- and medium-sized businesses in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan (256 businesses in total). The study was implemented through a phased application of online survey methods using closed-ended single-choice questions, including a 5-point Likert scale, mean score ranking, and ABC analysis using the Pareto principle. The assessment showed that, regardless of the surveyed country, almost all respondent businesses use a reactive supply chain design. Since the reactive design does not allow for the implementation of resilient supply chain development, the recommended practices, which have been developed during the pilot phase, deal with improving the supply chain management and gradual transformation of the reactive design into a cooperative management model to ensure resilient supply chain development under uncertainty.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article shows the role of the Dnipro and Desna rivers in the water supply of Kyiv. 2022 marks the 150th anniversary of the Kyiv centralized water supply system, which was built in 1872 with a water intake from the Dnipro. For a century and a half, technologies in water supply have changed, the role of the Dnipro as a source of water supply – the role of groundwater, and subsequently the Desna, increased. In 1939, the Dnipro water supply station was built, which is still in operation (design capacity 600 thousand m3/day). In 1961, the Desnyanska water supply station was built (1080 thousand m3/day). The design capacity of the artesian water pipeline is 420 thousand m3/day. The Dnipro River to Kiev (Upper Dnipro) and the Desna River form their waters on the territory of Polesie, which affects the chemical composition and quality of river waters. The water quality of the Dnipro River with an average annual salinity of about 290 mg/dm3 is influenced by the Pripyat River, the chemical composition of the water of which is formed in wetlands and contains a significant amount of humic substances. This leads to the fact that in certain periods during the spring flood, a tense situation arises regarding the purification of water from organic matter at the Dnipro waterworks. There is no such problem with the water of the Desna River with an average annual salinity of about 330 mg/dm3. But the threat to the Desna floodplain, which is easy to spot on the ground, is its development. Often – this is a building unforeseen by the general plan for the development of settlements. In recent years, the average daily rise in water by subdivisions of the private JSC “AK” Kyivvodokanal “is 700-720 thousand m3/day. The share of water supply sources in the city is as follows: Desna – 66%; Dnipro – 25%; artesian waters – 9%. A high specific indicator of drinking water use in Kyiv per one inhabitant was in 1991 – 588 L/day/person. In 2018, it decreased 2.6 times (225 L/day/person) compared to 1991; in 2019 – 2.6 times (223 L/day/person); in 2020 – 2.7 times. (219 L/day/person). This was facilitated by the introduction of market relations in the procedure for payment by the population for water supply and sanitation services. The centralized water supply of the city also provides for the centralized water disposal of wastewater generated in the process of water use. Built in 1965, the Bortnytska aeration station receives 100% of the city’s wastewater with the discharge of treated wastewater into the Dnipro River below Kyiv. The Dnipro together with the Desna River play an extraordinary role in the city’s water supply. The Dnipro remains the hydrographic axis of the Ukrainian capital.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South African International Maritime Institute (SAIMI) is engaged in answering the questions that centre around whether the country’s maritime skills supply matches the industry’s demand. The SAIMI commissioned a study1 to evaluate the maritime skills situation in South Africa, culminating in a final report in 2019. The purpose of this study was to determine the overall demand for maritime and ocean economy skills in order to grow the sector, and to determine whether there is adequate capacity within the skill supply framework to meet this demand. This exercise required an assessment of the anticipated demand and the current supply of skills capacity in South Africa, with any surplus or deficit being clearly highlighted. The author investigated a number of credible studies and international best practice examples within a framework supported by the latest skills data about the supply and demand dynamics in the maritime economy arena. It was found that South Africa is producing graduates with maritime-related qualifications in sufficient numbers, but not with the relevant types of skills required by the industry, which are mainly technical and professional maritime skills. A shift in emphasis is required to prioritise scarce, critical and future-proof skills for the growth of the maritime economy, with a particular emphasis on the maritime skills that will be needed in the context of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR). This work was presented to a representative platform of stakeholders in industry, academia and government at the SAIMI Forward Thinking Conference for Maritime Education and Training Excellence2 to review current maritime skills capacity against future demand and to consider collaborative and collective ways to close the skills gap. The outcome of the conference confirmed this report’s findings and recommendations to address these shortcomings. A focussed and driven programme is required within the South African maritime environment to align and accelerate all maritime education, research and skills enhancement to the market needs of the maritime sector, with the private sector directly involved throughout.</jats:p>"

As a result of the research, we concluded, that one unit of the\nmoney is less circulated in the economy in terms of GDP, which means that the population \"has taken\" the path of savings. As a result, the money, as a key means of ensuring turnover, is out of control and unmanageable. Analyzing the results of the research,\nwe can state that, in order to reverse the situation, not only the non-cash money should\nbe targeted increasing control over the money in the economy and transparency of circulation, but also a new investment network should be created, which will encourage savings. The analysis explains more clearly that in the last two years the \"money sleep\" is\nbeing express faster. In addition to the conclusion, we put forward the \"Sleep\" or the\n\"Sleeping\" money, which characterizes the annual decrease in the money supply in the\neconomy or the savings of the population.</jats:p>"

Numerous recent literature studies on supply. However, comprehensive analysis, clearly identifying the supply chain relationships used and finding the impact of this relationship on supply chain performance are still lacking. Therefore, this research has the main objective to review past studies on the implementation of supply chain in SMEs, as well as to research the literature to analyze how SMEs have implemented supply chain management approaches. To understand the role of supply chains in SMEs conducted a comprehensive literature review, which resulted in the identification and analysis of 20 high quality international journal articles, published between 2017 and 2021 in English. Based on the findings from this literature review, there are methods or frameworks that can be used by researchers to understand the implementation of Supply Chain Integration in business that can improve performance, efficiency, added customer value, or even competitive advantage. Then, the researcher realizes the need to conduct a literature review to see new developments and findings that have appeared in previous studies. The result is a detailed analysis of the main findings and insights obtained.</jats:p>"

The model is designed to capture key characteristics of the U.S. input–output tables with a core sector that produces intermediate inputs not easily replaceable by the other sectors, possibly subject to minimum‐scale requirements. Using epidemiological and mobility data to inform our exercises, we show that the reduction in labor services due to the observed social distancing (spontaneous and mandatory) could explain up to 6–8 percentage points of the roughly 12% U.S. GDP contraction in the second quarter of 2020. We show that public measures designed to protect workers in core industries and occupations with tasks that cannot be performed from home, can flatten the epidemiological curve at reduced economic costs—and contain vulnerabilities to supply disruptions, namely a new surge of infections. Using state‐level data for the United States, we provide econometric evidence that spontaneous social distancing was no less costly than mandated social distancing.</jats:p>"

In view of the total global economy of fuel and energy resources, the difficult energy situation in Ukraine, the issues of energy saving and reliable operation of heat supply systems, including autonomous ones, come first. The development and implementation of new technologies in the field of small energy are becoming more and more relevant. The compact size of energy generators, and, accordingly, their mobility, arouse interest in research, development and application in small energy of modern autonomous power generation installations. Thermal power plants with different types of aggregates can be used as autonomous units, each of which can be rational for one or another specific field of application and type of fuel. Today, there are number of problems that make it possible to organize a reliable energy supply. Among them: energy deficit in the regions, lack of high-quality energy infrastructure, interruptions in energy supply, low energy efficiency of generation, high wear and tear of thermal power plant equipment and network infrastructure, lack of centralized heat supply in remote areas, high energy intensity of production. Now for consumers there are a number of obstacles in the reliable operation of the energy supply system, so the use of microturbines as an energy source for objects of various purposes will allow to effectively solving this problem. The use of counter-pressure steam microturbines in boiler rooms with steam boilers is the easiest way to utilize the energy of the steam flow to generate electricity and further utilize the steam heat in the boiler. The transfer of existing boiler houses to mini-CHP will make these enterprises highly profitable. In the calculations, the boilers of the DKVR series, which are predominant today in boiler rooms, were taken as the basic boilers. The calculation of the microturbine impeller is based on the Euler equation for plane-parallel flow. After analyzing the studies of the microturbine, it is possible to conclude about the expediency of its use to increase the efficiency and reliability of the operation of autonomous power plants.</jats:p>"

In the Blockchain era we have entered the Supply Chain Management (SCM) System. Compared to the traditional Supply Chain Management System the Supply Chain Management using Blockchain is more effective and useful in its own ways, it also surpasses the limitations of the traditional supply chain management. Supply chain acts as a primary concern in the business field while transporting of the products among the producer and consumer in the right and systematic way. Many companies across the globe face many challenges to manage the supply chain from source to destiny. We have created a system which maintains a transparency of products and its source in Supply Chain using Blockchain. The objective of this system is the development of an integrated information system in which the digital stream of data generated in the supply chain of products can be assigned to these products. That’s the reason why the majority of companies nowadays approach this concept. There are significant advantages of adopting Blockchain in supply chain management, they are: Customer Fulfilment, Anti-Counterfeit, Identify the problems, cost efficiency and rise in Economy.

Mobile and wireless technologies are putting an extra layer of data source in this technology-enriched supply chain operation. This environment also needs to provide access to data anywhere, anytime to its end-users. This new type of data set originating from the global retail supply chain is commonly known as big data because of its huge volume, resulting from the velocity with which it arrives in the global retail business environment. Such environments empower and necessitate decision makers to act or react quicker to all decision tasks. Academics and practitioners are researching and building the next generation of big-data-based application software systems. This new generation of software applications is based on complex data analysis algorithms (i.e., on data that does not adhere to standard relational data models). The traditional software testing methods are insufficient for big-data-based applications. Testing big-data-based applications is one of the biggest challenges faced by modern software design and development communities because of lack of knowledge on what to test and how much data to test. Big-data-based applications developers have been facing a daunting task in defining the best strategies for structured and unstructured data validation, setting up an optimal test environment, and working with non-relational databases testing approaches. This chapter focuses on big-data-based software testing and quality-assurance-related issues in the context of Hadoop, an open source framework. It includes discussion about several challenges with respect to massively parallel data generation from multiple sources, testing methods for validation of pre-Hadoop processing, software application quality factors, and some of the software testing mechanisms for this new breed of applications</jats:p>"

A recent example is the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act that obliges German companies to adhere to due diligence obligations vis-à-vis human rights and, to a lesser extent, the environment when making use of global supply chains. Germany, as other WTO members, must at the same time ensure compliance with WTO law when adopting such measures. This article will argue that due diligence laws may have a bearing on WTO obligations, but can be justified according to the general exceptions clause of Art. XX GATT. Ultimately, the article argues that such measures may be necessary if international economic law is to accommodate the common goal of sustainable development. </p>"

If supermarkets and grocery stores represent the archetypal endpoint of the value chain for commercial food systems—the interface between customer and commodity, where its value is realized—the social reproduction of this cultural logic in the face of unsettled circuits of production and consumption is indeed “essential” labour. But it is essential for deeper reasons than those highlighted in public discourse. This chapter describes the labours of employees and owners in a single independent grocery store in the Melbourne Central Business District over 18 months of lockdown, recession, and personal and economic uncertainty. It captures some of the innovations, improvisations and expressions of solidarity made both possible and necessary in the anticipation of an eventual return to “business as usual”. These experiences throw into relief the supermarket’s function as a definitive node that articulates the supply chains, consumer publics and regimes of precarious migrant labour that constitute the urban food system as a domain for the expropriation, circulation and accumulation of surplus value.</jats:p>"

Results show that the carbon emission reduction level and the supply chain profit under a centralized supply chain are both higher than those under a decentralized supply chain, if the manufacturer’s fairness concern, the carbon emission reduction level and the supply chain profit will further decrease, but manufacturers’ profits are taking a growing share of the supply chain’s total profits. Under three different modes, the carbon emission reduction level will increase with the increase of the carbon coefficient. The retail price and the supply chain profit are jointly determined by the carbon tax rate and the carbon coefficient. Moreover, the implementation of a carbon reduction investment cost-sharing contract can increase the demand of low-carbon products and reduce the retail price. Under a carbon tax, regardless of whether manufacturers pay attention to fairness, the carbon reduction investment cost-sharing contract can effectively improve the overall efficiency of the low-carbon supply chain.</jats:p>",

This study aims to provide a review of the current state of knowledge and practices regarding fresh fruit and vegetable supply chains (FFVSC). The reviewed papers are divided into categories according to their findings, research purposes, tools and messages used. Our objective is to guide both academics and practitioners by pointing out significant streams of research with respect to these categories. For a better understanding, these subgroups are essentially based on their common research purpose, and the tools and methods they adopted are explained. Therefore, this study sheds light on research related to FFVSCs for those who are new to this area or planning to conduct in-depth research on directions suggested by studies in this area. The related literature was classified into eight categories: namely, (1) value chain indicators of FFVSCs, (2) food-related problems/postharvest losses along FFVSCs, (3) roles of parties involved in the FFV value chain, (4) review papers, (5) technological trends in FFVSCs, (6) packaging issues of FFVSCs, (7) logistics solutions of FFVSCs, and (8) sustainable FFVSCs. Details on the tools and methods employed in these studies are summarized in Appendix B. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the related literature lacks a comprehensive review that investigates different aspects of FFVVCs in detail. Thus, this study contributes towards a better understanding of the related literature and can be used as a guide for future studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT This paper presents an algorithm capable of calculating the optimal route for pipelines that traverse terrain with or without additional displacement constraints to the difference in ground elevations and head losses to be overcome by pumping. The criterion used to determine the pipeline diameter and calculate feasible routes was minimizing the annual cost, which results from the sum of (i) annualized costs related to the acquisition of the pipeline and (ii) costs of payment for electric power to operate the system throughout its useful life. The geometry of the shortest routes in the multidimensional search space is calculated by the proposed algorithm, called BAGDA (Busca pelo Ajuste Geométrico da Despesa Anual, in Portuguese, or Search for the Annual Cost of Geometric Tuning, in English), thus obtaining the optimal combination of length and manometric head of the pipeline. The performed applications show the efficiency of the algorithm in providing subjectivity-free routes sensitive to the most important variables considered in the design of piping systems.</jats:p>"

Implementing the EU’s “zero-waste” guidelines implies action on the part of producers of packaging and food for B2C distribution to find new solutions to enable the above-mentioned stakeholders in the logistics supply chain to balance the business mentioned above parties – taking into account environmental protection. The article discusses the tasks and possibilities under the above conditions of a new type of “RECYCLER” companies, which, at the end of the life of PET packaging, i.e. after the foodstuffs in PET bottles have been consumed, produce a recyclate and return it to re-production. In several journals, including, e.g. (Połednik et al. 2016, Topiarzová et al. 2011), respecting good recycling practices – there is an ongoing discussion on the sense of introducing reusable packaging, deposits, etc. This article discusses the barriers to recovery in a multi-level plastics recovery system, with specific reference to the operation of a PET bottle recycling line, and presents a pre-verified concept for a method to increase the efficiency of separating PET bottles from the plastics fraction in a multi-level waste separation system.</jats:p>"

A conceptual, logical and physical model based on the description of the subject area has been developed. A water supply network database was developed using the MySQL Workbench tool. An interface has been created for monitoring the state of pipelines using the Angular framework and the programming languages TypeScript and JavaScript. The information system allows the user to view information from humidity and flow sensors. The application predicts the humidity around the pipes and the water flow for the subsequent period and receives the appropriate message if an accident is possible. The program provides the user with a convenient graphical interface for tracking possible accidents in the water supply network with reference to the coordinates of the pipes, so that the user can make a timely decision to carry out repairs and prevent such a situation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Perishable and short-life products can be seen everywhere in life. Due to the particularity of these products, they are more complicated in supply chain management. This paper studies whether the two-part tariff and ZRS contract can achieve the purpose of reducing risks and coordinating supply chain. We assume that market demand and supplier yield are uncertain, and we use game theory and probability distribution for research. The research results show that when the information is asymmetric, the manufacturer always ignore the demand forecast information provided by the retailer under the wholesale price contract. When the demand is uncertain, regardless of whether the information is symmetric or asymmetric, the two-part tariff contract and the ZRS contract can coordinate the supply chain and achieve maximum profit. When the retailer’s degree of risk aversion is high, the ZRS contract is better than the two-part tariff, which can reduce the risk of retailers and achieve the purpose of coordinating the supply chain. When the supply is uncertain, the manufacturer can provide the supplier with a risk-sharing contract, including the return price and the sharing ratio that meet certain constraints. Such a contract can effectively reduce the supplier’s risk and realize supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Forestry and forest industries are important for regional income and employment in Norway as well as in most North European countries, but few studies exist about factors affecting the timber supply at regional level. The main objective of this study is to estimate aggregated regional timber supply elasticities for six regions in Norway. Thereby we also test for regional differences, focusing on wood prices, standing stock volume and interest rate as explanatory variables. We have used three different statistical models (fixed and random effects panel models and first difference models) on regional data from the Norwegian forest inventory on standing volume and official statistics on harvested volumes, interest rate and prices of sawlogs and pulpwood for the period 1996â2016. Statistically significant different price elasticities are found in 12 out of total 15 pairs of regions. The price elasticity was lower and the volume elasticity higher in the western region compared to the other regions. The first difference models are best with respect to specification tests. The use of region specific price elasticities gives slightly better fit for the panel data models than using a uniform price parameter. The results show that the econometric specification influence the parameter values, and it is thus complicated to directly compare results in different timber supply studies. Regional differences in timber supply are important to consider.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to propose and test a model facilitating assessment of tactical planning maturity in supply chains of manufacturing companies. The author proposes a model called Tactical Planning Maturity Model (TPMM). The model is created based on literature research, participant observations and data gathering conducted in two companies. The proposed framework combines both knowledge from supply chain integration and steps necessary to reach proficiency in sales and operation planning. The second step consists of choosing a case study method to verify model adequacy in two companies operating in central Poland. The findings illustrate the TPMM as a ready-to-use tool where the line to supply chain maturity is clearly drafted and results could be compared between production companies. This paper strengthens the link between practitioner and academic literature by providing empirical evidence of the benefits of tactical planning maturity model usage as well as its impact on further development of supply chains. This paper studied merely two companies and is not intended to be representative of outcomes for all companies looking to understand the complexity and maturity of their supply chains. Furthermore, the analyzed companies only reached level four in the maturity model; levels five and six were not observed. Further quantitative studies are required for testing the accuracy of the proposed model and potentially, qualitative studies could be undertaken in order to understand factors enabling the increase in maturity of tactical planning in the supply chains of manufacturing companies.</jats:p>"

Significant examples of regional formalization of responsible business conduct mechanisms such as Kenozero National Park (Russia) and Green Tourism Business Scheme (Great Britain) are considered.\nThe scientific novelty of the research lies in considering the organizational aspect of ecotourism through the concept of responsible business conduct, as well as identifying the features of its implementation in the field of ecotourism.\nAs a result of the study, it was concluded that in the field of ecotourism, the implementation of the concept of responsible business conduct has a pronounced focus on environmental protection and consumer satisfaction, leaving out of direct sight the areas of human rights, fair labor, fair finance and anti-corruption, which are no less important in the global mechanisms of the OECD, UNEP and the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance. Responsible business institutions in the field of ecotourism in Russia are currently being formed spontaneously and without formalization. An example of the regional formalization of responsible business institutions in the field of ecotourism is the Green Tourism Business Scheme, which stimulates the creation of responsible supply chains in the formation of regional tourism products.</jats:p>"

At the same time, there is a growing demand for information necessary to mitigate the consequences. To minimise the damage and increase the resilience of supply chains, it is necessary to identify sources of threats promptly, the extent of possible damage and the possibility of preventing or minimising their impact. The aim of the paper is to structure supply chain threats and search for appropriate datasets. <jats:bold>Methodology</jats:bold>: The paper analyses the state-of-the-art through a comprehensive literature review and demonstrates secondary data about how free-access business data can be used as Early Warning Signals to forecast supply chain disruptive events, with a particular focus on international maritime transportation. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: It was confirmed that companies can access many open datasets, and collecting and aggregating these data can improve their preparedness for future disruptive events. As the most important issue, the authors defined the selection of proper datasets and interpreting results with foresight. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Identifying and analysing the relevant Early Warning Signals by companies to prevent supply chain disruptions are essential for keeping their supply chains sustainable and their resilience on a sufficient level. It was proved that general business indicators (PMI delivery time, container capacity, inflation rate, etc.) can help to signal the increasing possibility of maritime traffic problems in ports and container unavailability as usual supply chain disruption types in recent years. Therefore, the companies in the supply chains need to find, collect and analyse the appropriate data, which are, in some cases, free and available. However, it is a substantial task for data analysts to identify the most relevant data and work out the analytical methodology which can be applied as Early Warning Systems (EWS).</jats:p>"

Dieser Artikel beschreibt mit Fallbeispielen, auf welche Weise die digitale Transformation produktionsnaher Prozesse in KMUs des metallverarbeitenden Gewerbes mit einem Fokus auf die Application Layer erfolgen kann. Die Fälle gehören zum Forschungsprojekt OBerA, das von der bayerischen Regierung initiiert wurde. Im Detail handelt es sich um folgende vier Fallbeispiele aus dem Geschäftsprozess des Produktionsbereiches: - KI-basierte Stammdatenpflege von Preisen und Werkzeugen - Heuristisches Planungsverfahren zur hybriden Make-To-Stock-(MTS) und Make-To-Order-(MTO) Planung - Produktionsdatenerfassung für die Auftragsbuchung - Werkzeugverwaltung in KMUs Zusätzlich zu den Anwendungsfällen wird die Entscheidungsfindung bezüglich IoTArchitekturen, als übergreifendes Thema, untersucht. Jeder der Anwendungsfälle basiert auf einer Forschungsagenda und zielgerichteten Methoden. Daher werden hauptsächlich qualitative Erhebungsmethoden (wie Interviews, Umfragen, Beobachtungsprotokolle und andere) gewählt. Als Ergebnis der Anwendungsfälle und der Recherche zur IoT-Architektur wurden einige Faktoren identifiziert, um das Potential der Digitalisierung mit den vorhandenen Ressourcen in metallverarbeitenden Unternehmen erfolgreich zu nutzen. Über alle Ergebnisse hinweg ist die Betonung der beiden Aspekte Einfachheit und Anschlussfähigkeit hervorzuheben.</jats:p>"

It draws on four main sources, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, public transport provider data, GTFS and OSM map layers. Methodologically, it combines the use of the GTFS format and corresponding static timetable component files, Thiessen polygons and empirical selection of relative indicators. As places of research, three comparable Hungarian cities have been selected by their population size; Pécs, Szeged and Miskolc. The comparison consists of 8 quantitative indicators that cover six major geographical aspects of transport operation (accessibility in terms of proximity, capacity, connectivity, density, frequency and velocity of vehicles). The analysis does not consider the mode of public transport, thus opening up the possibility of an independent comparison of efficiency regardless of various infrastructure characteristics. The results show that Miskolc and Pécs achieved the best values in four indicators. On the contrary, the city of Szeged, despite its diverse structure of transport modes, does not have an advantage in any aspect. The relatively loosely anchored methodology leaves room for an extension to include economic, environmental, and other specific factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past 40 years, confection sunflower in China has achieved significant improvements from old landraces to open-pollinated varieties (OPV) through conventional breeding. Starting in 2010, after a short period of growing U.S. hybrids, superior Chinese proprietary hybrids were developed through contributions from both the private and public sectors utilizing old landraces, OPV and limited foreign germplasms as genetic resources which eventually enabled China to become a leading producer worldwide. The average yields have steadily increased from 1730 kg/ha (OPV) to over 2700 kg/ha (hybrid) largely due to genetic improvements and advanced cultivation practices. The planted area is expected to remain at around 0.60 M ha, with over 95% confection sunflower, and the remaining 5% oilseed type. Sunflower production in China is mainly concentrated in 10 provinces of the northwest region with around three-fourth of the production in Inner Mongolia, followed by Xinjiang. The potential for increased sunflower cultivation remains optimistic in those regions due to the benefit of an established industrial supply chain of producing, processing, and marketing near the production areas. More than half of all products is domestically consumed (∼2.0 M T/year), but overseas exports have gradually increased in recent years. Future directions for confection sunflower breeding should continue emphasizing high quality, multi-disease resistance, and product versatility to meet the diverse market demands. Further enhancement of variety registration and the implementation of DNA fingerprinting for variety identification will help the sustainable development of the Chinese sunflower industry.</jats:p>"

The load connected to that phase is disconnected from the power supply. And nowadays in industry, office, or domestic use, there is a general problem, which is the phase absence out of the three-phase. Due to the absence of that one or two phases, some electrical system and loads connected on the live phase is ON in one section of the industry and OFF in another section of the industry. It becomes a cause of disturbance in routine work. In this project, the model is designed to check the availability of the active phase. After detecting the active phase load is shifted to it. Even if only one phase is available out of three, electricity will be used to provide the load. All the phases connected to the system are continuously checked by the controller for detecting the live condition of the phase. The controller checks all of the phases linked to the system on a regular basis to see if they are still active or not. The GSM module sends a message of an unavailable or faulty phase to the technician. Relays are used by the controller to link the load to the live phase. And the transistor is used for driving those relays. When two or three phases are live, phase one is always utilized as the default phase to connect the load.

In this chapter, we focus on the experience of COVID-19 by a particular population group, Indigenous Australians living in extremely remote circumstances. Here key responses to the disruption wrought by the pandemic have paradoxically registered as reprieve. In Australia, remote-living Indigenous peoples live in deep poverty and were anticipated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity and supply chain disruption. Surprisingly, the pandemic served to disrupt in other ways. The hegemonic characterization of welfare-dependent Indigenous peoples as morally deficient subjects in need of discipline and control could not be sustained as the country “locked down” and over a million others became “welfare dependent” overnight. Unemployment benefits were temporarily doubled, and onerous work-for-the-dole mutual obligations eased. This essay explores potential positive changes to systems of food provisioning caused by government responses to COVID-19. The remote food security “crisis” is shown to be mainly an artefact of government policies designed to punish the poor and push unemployed remote-community residents into jobs. We propose permanent reform to the social security system that will enhance food security and liberate Indigenous peoples to more effectively self-provision and exercise “food sovereignty”.</jats:p>"

It is really impossible to envision industrialization and societal well-being or high standard of living without adequate and reliable electricity supply. Sustainable electricity supply will aid the artisans, traders, farmers with storage facilities, reduce the rural-urban immigration, improve the standard of living in the rural areas, and encourage rural industrialization and capital formation. This study investigates the impact of sustainable electricity supply on poverty reduction in Nigeria. A time series data from 1981 to 2018 was analysed for this study. Based on the outcome of this study, it could be seen clearly that while electricity generation play a significantly role reducing poverty in the country, electricity consumption does not guarantee poverty reduction. Also, apart from the fact that poverty level in the past period is found to have a direct and statistically significant effect on the poverty rate in the current period, it was also revealed  that lower unemployment rate does not really translate into reduction in the poverty level in Nigeria. The study therefore recommend that electricity generation should be given more attention and while trying to address the menace of unemployment in the country, underemployment and labour exploitation must also be tackled headlong.</jats:p>"

This analysis, using the resource-based perspective, capabilities and also the most recent literature on big data analytics, examines the indirect connection between a big data analytics capability and two types of development capabilities, incremental and radical. The study extends existing research by proposing that BDACs enable companies to produce insight that could help strengthen dynamic capabilities that positively influence incremental innovation capabilities and radical. To test the hypothesis we proposed, we utilized survey data from 185 chief executives and managers operating in Italian companies. The outcomes of partial least squares structural equation modeling confirm our assumptions about the indirect effect that BDACs have on development capabilities. In particular, we find out that dynamic abilities completely mediate the outcome on both incremental and radical innovation capabilities. Furthermore, under conditions of higher environmentally friendly heterogeneity, the effect of BDACs on powerful features and in sequence is improved incremental innovation ability, while under conditions of higher eco-friendly dynamism, the effect of powerful abilities on incremental innovation abilities is increased.</jats:p>"

It was successful when both governments and organizations found a way to work together. Challenges included determining ways to support long-term working relationships and agreements, developing required tools and processes, and identifying contracting opportunities. This article describes the journey partners took under the leadership of Cando.

The structure of CLSC includes production centers, retailers’ centers, probabilistic customers, collection, and disposal centers. In this research, two strategies are considered to find the best location for retailers by focusing on 1- the type of expected movement 2- expected coverage (distance and time) for minimizing the costs and maximizing the profit by considering the probabilistic customer and uncertainly demand. First of all, the expected distances between customers and retailers are calculated per movement method. These values are compared with the Maximum expected coverage distance of retailers, which is displayed in algorithm 1 heuristically, and the minimum value is picked. Also, to allocate customers to retailers, considering the customer's movement methods and comparing it with Maximum expected coverage time, which is presented in Algorithm 2 heuristically, the minimum value is chosen to this end, a bi-objective nonlinear programming model is proposed. This model concurrently compares Strategies 1 and 2 to select the best competitor. Based on the chosen strategy, the best allocation is determined by employing two heuristic algorithms, and the locations of the best retailers are determined. As the proposed model is NP-hard, a meta-heuristics (non-dominated sorting genetic) algorithm is employed for the solution process. Afterward, the effectiveness of the proposed model is validated and confirmed, and the obtained results are analyzed. For this purpose, a numerical example is given and solved through the optimization software.</jats:p>"

Nowadays the market for software products has increased the number of programs designed for electronic accounting. The principles and methods of installing the electronic documents flow services are investigated. The most popular electronic documents flow services on the Ukrainian market are generalized. It is determined that each company should choose the software that suits it properly, taking into account the number of jobs, document circulation, archive size and also some additional features that are needed. But, in general, each program is developed according to the standards of current legislation and therefore, despite the chosen service of electronic documents flow software, the productivity of the enterprise will increase. «Ptak», platform, which allows integration with any accounting system via API has been studied. This platform cooperates with the following electronic documents flow services, Medoc, Sota, FREDO, DocMan in particular. It is proposed to develop the platform that will be integrated with all electronic documents flow services regardless which service and rate are chosen by the company. The creation of the special archive which will define when the document is sent and what decision the contractor made about it is interpreted. In order to improve the use of the platform, it is proposed to add the field for comments, where the counterparty will be able to explain why this document is not signed (if such a problem arises) or what amendments are to be corrected. It is justified for the convenience and security of enterprise data that the received documents are automatically stored not in the platform, but in the electronic document management service, for decision-making and secure signing of this document. The decision on the document (accept/reject/edit) and the comment will also be supported by it in the service. This solution will make it possible to exchange freely the necessary documents between contractors, even if they use different services. The submitted proposals will increase the number of users of electronic documents flow services and agree on cooperation between contractors, regardless of their location, the chosen accounting service and electronic documents flow program.</jats:p>"

The choice of topic in this regard is linked to transnational labor law, namely the regulation of global supply chains. As a result of the increased international trade in goods and the ever-expanding global market, more and more multinational companies have emerged. In order to meet consumer needs, these companies often use practices that raise serious labor law issues. In this study, in addition to describe the problems, I want to present the possible solutions.</jats:p>"

This paper first uses bibliometric to summary the hot issues between green supply chain management and performance. Secondly, the relationship and internal mechanism between green supply chain management and performance are sorted out based on 57 literatures. Finally, the existing research on the relationship between them is reviewed and prospected, so as to provide theoretical reference for further research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Complex supply chains characterise today's economic life, which is determined by uncertainties and risks. Managing those successfully requires the development of resilient and flexible structures and processes based on information transparency, which enables better decision-making, especially in times of global crises. In this context, supply chain visibility (SCV) is defined as the stakeholders' capability to have access to accurate and timely information about the flow of goods. Although the importance of SCV has been discussed in scientific literature and practice, challenges still inhibit improved SCV, particularly in distribution logistics. These have been scarcely investigated. The purpose of this study is to identify the challenges of SCV in distribution logistics and to provide implications to address them. <jats:bold>Methodology:</jats:bold> A qualitative content analysis (QCA) spanning 26 scientific articles was used. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We found evidence of challenges inhibiting SCV in distribution logistics within the three aggregated dimensions of <jats:italic>inappropriate processes &amp;amp; technologies and information systems, lack of communication &amp;amp; trust, </jats:italic>and<jats:italic> insufficient monitoring &amp;amp; decision-making metrics. </jats:italic>The findings show that trust can be seen as both a challenge and a prerequisite. Despite the possibilities of digitalisation, there exist trade-offs between manual processes and new technology implementation. Decision-making can be based on individual experiences, and monitoring can be difficult due to undefined metrics. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Practitioners may use the findings to better identify and address the challenges of SCV in distribution logistics. Further studies could extend the findings through empirical studies, which would allow practitioners to assess their level of SCV and derive initial solutions.</jats:p>"

The proposed Regulation will affect trade with the European Union, a key trade partner for Latin American countries. If this type of regulation is increasingly adopted by other industrialized countries, which currently represent the largest share of exports for Latin American countries, the trade impact in Latin America will be even broader. We argue that regulatory approaches focused on global supply chains—such as the EU Regulation—represent an opportunity to reinvigorate existing, albeit weak, Latin American environmental cooperation to tackle key drivers of deforestation, notably, agricultural expansion. Despite the global relevance of the region's forests and biodiversity, Latin American cooperation has not been significant in forest conservation.<jats:sup>2</jats:sup></jats:p>"

Banyak orang berlomba-lomba untuk membuka restoran dikarenakan makanan merupakan kebutuhan pokok yang harus dipenuhi oleh manusia, sehingga dengan membuka restoran tentunya akan memberikan banyak keuntungan bagi pemilik restoran. Dalam sebuah proses bisnis restoran tentunya melibatkan banyak sekali peran di dalamnya seperti peran dari seorang pelayan, peran dari seorang koki, peran internal dari bagian stok bahan mentah, dan lain sebagainya saling berkaitan dan harus tersinkronisasi. Namun pada praktiknya, restoran masih menggunakan cara-cara konvensional yang tidak efisien, efektif, dan terstruktur. Beberapa restoran di kota Medan hanya memanfaatkan pencatatan konvensional baik dalam pemesanan ataupun pencatatan stok bahan mentah sehingga seringkali terjadi kesalahan dikarenakan proses penghitungan yang kurang akurat. Selain itu, proses bisnis dalam sebuah restoran masih belum terstruktur dengan baik antar setiap bagian yang bekerja sehingga seringkali terjadinya kesalahan pemesanan. Oleh sebab itu akan dilakukan penelitian untuk membangun sistem informasi restoran menggunakan metode Supply Chain Management. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan penerapan metode Supply Chain Management pada sistem informasi restoran yang dibangun terbukti dapat mengintegrasikan seluruh bagian bisnis restoran secara baik sehingga mencegah terjadinya kesalahan oleh setiap pihak yang bekerja di restoran.</jats:p>"

Although there has been a wide range of studies on the selection of Third-Party Logistics (3PL) providers during the operation and supply chain management of the companies, research focusing on the phase of market expansion is lacking. The aim of this study is to analyze the selection of 3PL providers with an emphasis on overseas market expansion. A Vietnamese company in the chemical industry aiming to select the most suitable 3PL provider for overseas market expansion to Brazil is considered. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to five main criteria that are cost, service, global network, industry experience, and local presence. A list of five 3PL providers is evaluated and ranked. Group decision-making with a sharing approach is used, such that three decision-makers (DMs) achieve a consensus on the assessment. The results indicate that industry experience and responsiveness to urgent occurrences are the two most important criteria when the company chooses a 3PL provider for overseas market expansion, while the lowest priority belongs to communication.</jats:p>"

In fact, a small change in point-of-sale demand may be interpreted by SC participants as a much bigger variability in demand. This looks like a cracking a whip, where a small flick of the wrist may yield a large motion at the end of the whip. Misstate data from one side of a SC to the other part may yield substantial sloppiness. This includes increase in inventories, shortage of cash flow, weak customer satisfaction, etc. Enterprises may efficiently reduce the bullwhip effect by completely learning its root causes.

Although it is not necessary to know the forcing mechanisms of sequence formation to construct a sequence-stratigraphic framework and map the distribution of rock properties, it is commonly useful to incorporate one’s understanding of key processes to provide predictive capabilities away from sample control.</jats:p><jats:p>Many factors influence the development and expression of parasequences and depositional sequences. These factors can be grouped usefully into two main categories: processes (sediment supply and accommodation) and contingencies (inherited and coeval factors that condition the effects of those processes). The main components of sediment supply include detrital, biogenic, and authigenic processes as well as lateral and temporal changes thereof; the components of accommodation include those processes that affect the upper and lower boundaries of sediment accumulation. Contingencies exert a significant influence on the expression of sequence-stratigraphic surfaces and units because they affect when, where, and how the processes of sediment supply and accommodation operate. Four main contingencies affect all depositional settings and generally do not change significantly during a depositional sequence: (1) geological age, (2) plate-tectonic setting, (3) paleolatitude, and (4) paleogeography at the continental and basinal scale. Other contingencies tend to be specific to particular types of depositional settings or change significantly during accumulation; these include (1) inherited and evolving bathymetry, (2) climate mode, and (3) ocean chemistry.</jats:p><jats:p>Ultimately, it is difficult to uniquely identify causal mechanisms because of the many influences on accommodation and sediment supply and the commonly convergent effects of those influences (i.e., similar stratal patterns can result from various combinations of influences). Knowledge of mechanisms is not, however, an essential part of the sequence-stratigraphic approach (and is potentially not possible in many circumstances—especially not from the stratal patterns alone). Sequence stratigraphy allows construction of a comprehensive and useful stratigraphic framework based on a single criterion—the physical relations of the strata themselves—that reveals genetically related rocks.</jats:p>"

Proponents of consumer ethics contend that informing consumers about injustices in the food system via labels or awareness campaigns will lead to collective rejection of unethical food corporations and the embrace of ethical products. This approach has been criticized on a variety of grounds, including its reliance on and eventual co-optation by market mechanisms. In response to these criticisms, food activists and scholars have promoted a consumer ethic that embraces local and alternative food systems, thereby producing an alternative consumer ethic purportedly outside of market logics. While these alternative practices have much to commend them, we argue that alternative food systems are invariably oriented towards consumer interests and thereby run into similar problems faced by earlier iterations of consumer-based ethics. We argue against the persistent focus on consumer ethics as means of substantially disrupting food systems, whether global, local or alternative.</jats:p>"

The gas medium is described on the basis of a viscous compressible gas model. To find the temperature field in the walls of the structure, the equation of non-stationary heat conduction is solved. The conjugation of temperature fields in a gas and a solid is carried out using an iterative procedure. In the calculations, the geometrical parameters of the cavity, the density of the energy supply, the initial pressure, and the composition of the working mixture are varied. The results of calculations obtained in the framework of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional formulation of the problem under the action of both a single pulse and a series of pulses are compared.

The proposed technique is used to compare several projected supply chain innovations and is based on a comprehensive evaluation using an integral coefficient and taking into account both financial and non-financial indicators, depending on the purpose and focus of suggested innovations. The presented approach was tested as part of the analysis of two supply chain innovations, using the example of the selected trading company. Based on the tasks that are planned to be solved with the use of corresponding supply chain innovations, the categories and indicators are identified for calculating the integral coefficient in order to measure the performance of supply chain innovation. The final analysis also takes into consideration the selected indicators for evaluating the efficiency of investments and functional subsystems of a supply chain to develop sound management decisions in the field of the company's logistic system transformation.</jats:p>"

In the corporate sector, supply chain 4.0 is the most recent trend. This article examines and analyses the existing state-of-the-art literature on Supply Chain Management 4.0 (SCM 4.0) and the interaction between digital technologies and Supply Chain Management. A bibliometric study and a literature assessment of state-of-the-art publications in the relevant topic were done. The impact of emerging technology on various supply chain operations is examined in this research. In addition, the study establishes a foundation for future research and practice. Because it describes the pillar components for any supply chain change, the suggested work is valuable for both academics and practitioners. It also suggests a set of study questions that might be utilized as a foundation for the field's future research. This research presents a fresh and original literature review-based study on SCM4.0, as there is currently no comprehensive evaluation accessible that includes bibliometric analysis, motives, impediments, and the impact of technologies on distinct SC processes.</jats:p>"

This paper reports on a study that investigated the suitability of discrete-event simulation for modelling forestry supply chains. As part of a larger research project, two discrete-event simulation models with bi-objective optimisation of the South African pulpwood and saw-timber  supply chains respectively were developed. The simulation models were developed for each supply chain by first mapping out the supply chain processes through subject-matter expert and stakeholder consultation. Thereafter simulation concept models were developed, and the required input data were identified, acquired, and verified. The simulation models were verified and validated to be realistic representations of the supply chains that they imitate. The study concluded that the simulation models demonstrated the ability to perform scenario analysis and bi-objective optimisation. It was also demonstrated that the two disciplines of industrial engineering and forestry science can successfully collaborate.

Supply chain decarbonization plays a pivotal role in mitigating climate change, as these emissions often exceed Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined. Strategies for reducing supply chain emissions include improving material efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy, and fostering circularity in production processes. Despite the complexity of measuring and managing Scope 3 emissions, organizations can leverage supplier engagement, data-driven carbon accounting, and regulatory frameworks to enhance transparency and accountability. Key sectors such as energy, transportation, and manufacturing contribute significantly to global GHG emissions, necessitating targeted interventions. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of Scope 3 emissions reduction, emphasizing the role of corporate responsibility and policy frameworks in facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy and achieving global net zero commitments.</jats:p>"

The paper aims to identify the main trends in the wine sector revolving around environmental evaluation using the LCA method in the academic literature. The aim is to investigate the literature on life cycle assessment analysis of grape and wine production through the systematic grouping of papers into clusters of research. So, the purpose is to discuss the gaps and insights identified by the study in order to aid in the development of a comprehensive state of the art on the topic. Scopus and Web of Science were used to search all articles following a clear and replicable protocol. The results (keywords) were subjected to co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer, after which the articles were further analysed. Through a bibliographic coupling analysis, the research results were grouped through a network analysis that allowed identifying the research trends on the topic. Three clusters were identified containing the main lines of research on the subject. The results show that nowadays the literature is focusing on concerns related to climate change and consumer awareness on sustainability issues and certifications as well as environmental impacts generated mainly in the production phase in the vineyard. The research results are of interest for future research on LCA analysis in the wine sector in order to contribute to the discussion on the current model in the global wine sector.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain is modeled to obtain the best allocation and location of retailers including production and distribution centers, the warehouse of manufactured products, retailers' centers, probabilistic customers, collection, repair, and disposal centers so that the amount of environmental pollution and CO2 emissions by taking into account the conversion of CO2 to O2 in vehicles’ gas converters, is minimized. In this research, two strategies are considered to find the best places for retailers by focusing on 1- the type of expected movement (Rectangular, Euclidean, Euclidean Square, and Chebyshev); 2- expected coverage (distance and time). To this end, a bi-objective nonlinear programming model is proposed. This model concurrently compares strategies 1 and 2 and selects the best competitor. Based on the selected strategy, the best allocation is made by employing a heuristic algorithm and the locations of the best retailers are determined. As the proposed model is NP-hard in the nature of the problem, a meta-heuristics, namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is employed for the solution process. Eventually, to authenticate and confirm the effectiveness of the suggested model, a numerical example is given and solved utilizing optimization software, and the results are analyzed.</jats:p>"

Using yearly time series data, this paper employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model and Bound test. The main findings of the study indicate both long-run and short-run positive correlations between these variables. So, to formulate the monetary policy for our country, policymakers should consider the empirical evidence of the positive correlation between money supply and interest rate. This study has significant policy implications for shaping the monetary policy of Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

The model includes four independent variables: money supply (MS), imports (IMP), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and exchange rate (EXCH). A Johansen-Juselius co-integration test and a Vector Error Correction Model were used to determine the existence of long-term and short-term links between the variables. The results demonstrated the existence of co-integrating links between the variables. Aside from the effects of GDP, all independent factors had a positive effect on the inflation rate. Depending on the results, the money supply is the primary long-term predictor of the inflation rate in Egypt.</jats:p>",

Hence, this study aims at evaluating the capabilities of Logistic Model Tree (LMT), J48, Random Forest (RF), and PART classification algorithms in precipitation forecasts at Pars Abad station using previous 1–4 days data of meteorological variables. So, five scenarios were considered based on the cross-correlation function and partial autocorrelation function for validation of the studied methods in the period of 2004–2019. In general, by examining the Kappa, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) indicators, scenario number 1 using the input parameters of 1-day lag was determined as the most appropriate scenario to predict daily precipitation. Also, the obtained results showed that the PART had better performance with more than 80% accuracy in precipitation forecasting. Moreover, the most accurate performance of PART was scenario 1 with Kappa = 0.2007, RMSE = 0.3879 and MAE = 0.2856. The conclusive results indicated that by implementing classification algorithms and decision trees and using meteorological data of the previous days, daily precipitation could be predicted accurately.</jats:p>",

The following methods were applied: descriptive statistics, trend data and balance sheet method. On average, 3.161 tons of trout were produced in B&amp;H per year, 82% of total fish production. Carp were produced 510 tons per year. Other freshwater fish are becoming less and less attractive for production. B&amp;H's fish self-sufficiency is low (54%) and the average rate of import dependence is about 76%. The consumption of fish per capita is 2 kilograms. It is necessary to improve the education of the population throughout B&amp;H about the importance of fish nutrition and the health aspects of its consumption.</jats:p>"

Yet energy systems for these purposes largely remain fossil-based (such as diesel generators). Although such energy systems are inexpensive, they are carbon intensive and inefficient. This study presents a methodology of simulating temporary shelter with access to an energy supply system through a mobile energy unit with renewable (PV) power supply systems to ensure on-site electricity production, as well as heating/cooling and ventilation. Digital modeling simulations have been performed for a simulated temporary shelter in different climate conditions incorporating different combinations of electricity generation systems with a fossil fuel-based solution and a PV system, using TRNSYS software. Study results show that the operation of a mobile energy generation unit can operate HVAC systems and generate electricity for temporary shelter occupants in off-grid solutions. The modeling results show that the use of a mobile energy generation unit can significantly reduce diesel consumption in temporary shelters from 54% annually (in Riga, Latvia) to 96 % annually (in Jerusalem, Israel). Furthermore, the output of PV-generated electricity is higher (in most cases) than the consumed electricity amount.</jats:p>"

The Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000 permits qualified clinicians to use medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to treat opioid dependency. This study characterizes clinicians authorized to perform MAT and examines whether these clinicians are geographically collocated in areas with higher opioid burdens. Methods: Data of DATA providers in 2019 came from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. Opioid overdose mortality rates were extracted from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps to represent disease burdens in local areas. The DATA provider density is represented by the number of DATA-waivered providers per 100 000 population for each county. We used Pearson correlational tests to examine the correlations between the local DATA provider density and the opioid mortality rate.Results: Most of the DATA providers were physicians (57%), followed by nurse practitioners (27%) and physician assistants (4%). The average waivered provider density was 13.90 per 100 000 population. The local density of DATA providers and local opioid overdose death rates are moderately correlated (P &lt; 0.001).Conclusion: Physicians still represent most waivered providers in Ohio. While DATA providers were located in some areas with high needs for opioid treatments, our data suggest that other areas with high opioid burdens likely have an inadequate workforce supply to reduce opioid burdens. Without an adequate DATA workforce, policies that focus on MAT care access to address the opioid epidemic may be in vain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Dutch disease model was broadly applied in the past on different countries and causing sources creating revenues (Benjamin et al., 1987; Corden, 2012; Égert, 2012; Fardmanesh, 1991; Larsen, 2006; Niftiyev and Czech, 2020; van der Ploeg and Venables, 2013; Zhang et al., 2021). In reference to the question of how countries and governments can successfully deal with resource deposits, Werner (2012) shows that national resource funds are an opportunity to overcome the possible strongly negative economic development. This presented chapter conducts a systematic literature review with empirical studies that deal with countries facing occurring or possible occurring Dutch disease because of resource deposits like minerals or oil. It shows that, industrial diversification, a favourable business environment, attracted domestic and foreign investment in the industrial and agricultural sectors as well as good institutional quality are recommended to prevent a Dutch Disease.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die Elektromobilität in Deutschland hat im letzten Jahrzehnt stark an Bedeutung gewonnen. Teslas Einführung des Model S im Jahr 2012 in Kombination mit einer strengeren EU-Regulierung bezüglich des CO2-Ausstoßes von Automobilen beflügelte die Entwicklung einer Technologie, die sich als disruptiv erweist. Der vorliegende Beitrag geht der Frage nach, wie sich die Absatzsatzzahlen disruptiver Technologien typischerweise entwickeln und analysiert dessen Durchdringung am Beispiel der Elektromobilität in Deutschland. Zielkunden werden dafür in drei verschiedene Bedarfsgruppen unterschieden: (1) Innovationsaffine, (2) Breite Masse, und (3) Nachzügler. Ergebnisse einer deutschlandweiten Umfrage unter Studierenden des Jahrgangs 2020 (n=4056) zeigen, dass die Wahrnehmung der Elektromobilitätstechnologie bei den Befragten grundsätzlich positiv ist, sich jedoch signifikant zwischen den Gruppen unterscheidet. Eine eingehendere Untersuchung und Unterscheidung der spezifischen Bedürfnisse und Erwartungen der verschiedenen Gruppen kann also helfen, den sogenannten Abgrund (‚Chasm‘) zu überwinden (vgl. Moore, 2014). Dieser Artikel leistet einen Beitrag zum Verständnis aktueller Entwicklungen beim Absatz von Elektroautos.</jats:p>"

This article goes into the empirical findings of a study that is based on in-depth interviews with 20 staff and line public managers of the four RWS in different regions as well as on content analysis of policy documents and funding organizations’ reports. The results indicate that appropriate CD, reforms in internal organization arrangements, and understanding of context-specific social, economic, and political diversity remain necessary in collaborative compliance with institutions for RWS sustainability.

Neben den vorrangigen Themen wie Digitalisierung und vernetzten Systemen kommt der Automatisierung nach wie vor eine zentrale Bedeutung zu. Die Einbindung von Softwarerobotern sowie Indoor-Lokalisierungssystemen kann dabei die Effizienz von Geschäftsprozessen massiv beeinflussen. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist die Entwicklung und Umsetzung eines Laborbeispiels, das die weitgehende Automatisierung eines produktionsnahen Make-to-Order Auftragsabwicklungsprozesses auf Basis eines Enterprise- Ressource-Planning-Systems durch ausgewählte Industrie 4.0-Komponenten innerhalb einer Laborumgebung beinhaltet. Dazu werden zunächst die theoretischen Grundlagen von Geschäftsprozessen im Allgemeinen sowie des Auftragsabwicklungsprozesses im Besonderen dargestellt. Im nächsten Schritt werden die eingesetzten Technologien separat diskutiert, bevor ein Integrationsansatz aufgezeigt wird. In diesem Zusammenhang werden Radiofrequenz- Identifikation, ein Indoor-Positionierungssystem mittels Ultrabreitband sowie die robotergestützte Prozessautomatisierung evaluiert. Schließlich folgt die Entwicklung eines Laborbeispiels zur Integration der genannten Technologien. Neben dem Verfahren wird auch die konkrete Umsetzung der Technologien durch geeignete Hard- und Software erläutert.</jats:p>"

Entrepreneurship business models are more different than sustainable business models for operation and maintenance, but they can be seen as complementary or two stages of industrial development: explore and exploit. Both are part of what can be described as Entrepreneurial Mindset. Teaching in collaboration with companies tells us something of how this may be done as experienced in course cases. Supply Chains are becoming more and more global even for SMEs. With increasing use of global Supply Chains together with increased volume and frequency, the activities and logistics in between main operations have become more important to ensure reliability and sustainable operations. And these are based on collaboration and communication between involved companies and agencies. Core issues in this are charges that determine cost involved together with custom clearance issues, delays, miscommunications, and unforeseen circumstances. The sustainable Supply Chain of tomorrow needs to be data-driven to achieve improvement. We need to go from customer data to customer benefit. It may be achieved by utilizing AI to improve decisions and reduce latency. A 3-stage roadmap for utilizing Entrepreneurial Mindset in teaching digitalization of sustainable Supply Chain is suggested.</jats:p>"

Beyond concrete organizational aspects, two fundamental issues are at stake: the strategic control of flows and the geographical and social relations operating within supply systems. This article focuses on the complementary approaches commonly adopted to address this question, rarely studied in recent years. By closely associating the field of resources and power, it shows that food supply is not simply a technical question of price, volumes and flows, but depends ultimately on the relations between different types of actors – governments, businesses, communities, trade networks, etc. – thus becoming a truly political issue. We observe that under certain authoritarian regimes (Gulf States, Latin America), the organizing state remains ever-present, while outside times of crisis (sub-Saharan Africa), there is greater scope for developing more informal dynamics.</jats:p>"

These characteristics made it attractive as a refuge for European intellectuals and artists as soon as communications with the outside world began to develop. The first significant presence of artists occurred in the 1930s, just before the Spanish Civil War. After years of war and isolation, artists returned in a larger volume and variety than before. Other regions also had artistic and countercultural communities, but Ibiza decided to use them as an element of its tourist promotions, making the hippie movement a part of its culture and history and the most internationally known element. The objective of this paper is to expose the importance of art and artists, a direct inheritance of that time, in Ibizan promotion and tourism. The authorities and entrepreneurs of the island realized the media interest they received and the importance of this media impact on developing the tourism sector. The result was that they supported artistic avant-garde and various activities derived from the hippie movement to differentiate Ibiza and make it known in Spain and abroad, creating the myth of Ibiza as an island of freedom, harmony, and nightlife (the current image of the island).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this book chapter, the authors highlight the potential of big data analytics for improving the forecasting capabilities to support the after-sales customer service supply chain for a global manufacturing organization. The forecasting function in customer service drives the downstream resource planning processes to provide the best customer experience at optimal costs. For a mature, global organization, its existing systems and processes have evolved over time and become complex. These complexities result in informational silos that result in sub-optimal use of data thereby creating inaccurate forecasts that adversely affect the planning process in supporting the customer service function. For addressing this problem, the authors argue for the use of frameworks that are best suited for a big data ecosystem. Drawing from existing literature, the concept of data lakes and data value chain have been used as theoretical approaches to devise a road map to implement a better data architecture to improve the forecasting capabilities in the given organizational scenario. </jats:p>"

In many companies this is leading to a shift of paradigms away from low-cost to a more reliable and robust supply chain which comprises higher inventories and logistics cost. This underlines the necessity of supply chain resilience which already became more and more important over the last years. This paper shall investigate different forms of disruption during the pandemics and strategies how to manage them in terms of supply chain resilience. Especially strategies which led to a competitive advantage over a company’s competition are of interest. Finally, it will be discussed what implications for the future arise out of the discussed cases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract\n\nRecently, supply chain management (SCM)has been receiving increasing attention from the industry. Most of the current research is focused on the high-tech industry and very little research has focused on SCM topics in the food and beverage (F&amp;B) industry. In Taiwan, as the F&amp;B industry is highly competitive, maintaining and building strong relationships with suppliers of ingredients or tableware is a way to maintain a competitive edge. Therefore, maintaining and building strong relationships with suppliers of ingredients or tableware required for restaurant operations is a way to maintain a competitive advantage. In addition, the perceived value, relationship commitment, satisfaction, switching costs and loyalty of supply chain buyers in the F&amp;B industry is a matter that researchers want to probe when developing an ongoing understanding of SCM in the F&amp;B industry. It has been discovered that the supplier-buyer relationships, when it comes to buyer perceived value and relationship commitment, increase customer satisfaction and increase switching costs as well as positively impact loyalty to the F&amp;B supply chain seller. Therefore, in the rapidly dynamic business environment of the F&amp;B industry, establishing an effective SCM system for the F&amp;B industry can indeed enhance a company's competitive advantage.\n\nJEL classification numbers: L10.\nKeywords: Perceived value, Relationship commitment, Satisfaction, Loyalty.</jats:p>"

These labour shortages focused public attention on the importance of seasonal labour for horticultural production and the availability of fresh fruit and produce, resulting in a paradoxical revaluation of that work. On the one hand, seasonal farm work was revalued as essential labour, and migrant workers were acknowledged as critical to Australia’s food security. On the other hand, the increased visibility of seasonal farm work highlighted its systematic<jats:italic>de</jats:italic>valuing as so-called unskilled work that is done for low wages, under often poor conditions, and that is widely figured through racialized narratives. Faced with the prospect of critical labour shortages, both industry and government sought—and largely failed—to reinscribe the terms by which seasonal labour was imagined in attempts to make it attractive to “local” workers. What resulted was an entrenching of uneven distributions of precarity, risk and vulnerability along the fault lines of race and migration status.</jats:p>"

To analyze this behavior, a quantitative survey on the use and acceptance of digital services by general practitioners was carried out. For this purpose, students from the Stralsund University of Applied Sciences and employees of the nursing home were asked to take part in a survey on the “use and acceptance of the digital services offered by general practitioners”. With regard to the current use of digital services by general practitioners, there were hardly any differences between the age groups. The survey showed that personal contact with the doctor is still important for most of the respondents. A particularly relevant result, however, is that half of the respondents stated that they could imagine choosing their GP in the future based on the digital services offered. While the younger generations are more likely to use the Internet to find out about digital offers from the doctor, the older generation expect information from the doctor and the practice staff. The survey showed that only a few general practitioners currently provide digital services. It could be shown that so far only the online appointment arrangement is relatively common. Additional applications are only gradually finding their way into care.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, there has been a debate over the extent to which housing-supply regulations increase inequality and reduce workers access to more productive cities. This problem is formalized in a two-city model with skilled and unskilled workers to study the impact of one city relaxing land-use restrictions. Such a policy will raise welfare, but inequality and the number of unskilled workers locating in more productive cities may rise or fall. And when the policy does reduce inequality, there is a decline in unskilled workers in the higher productivity city. Inclusive zoning policies can mitigate this effect but weaken agglomeration economies. A city authority that takes into account equity considerations may prioritize more or less housing for unskilled workers than the market, depending on the degree of societal aversion to inequality. The model is extended to include homeownership and racial discrimination in the housing market. Homeowners are not necessarily harmed by less restrictive land-use policy, but racial discrimination reduces the benefits of homeownership for minority groups. </jats:p>",

A number of unknowns remain regarding the operationalization of supply-side policies, such as how to establish a binding international agreement and how to raise and allocate financial compensation for nonextraction. Nevertheless, the need for supply-side policies only emphasizes the importance of imaginative and bold initiatives within the current conjuncture of global environmental politics.</jats:p>",

Sustainable practices were collected from the repository “Business Process Framework for Sustainability” owned by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Salerno (Italy). By using literature research and descriptive statistics, there emerges a positive relationship between sustainable development and SC performance enhancement. From the study of the practices that can be implemented for cooperation activities with upstream and downstream supply chain partners, it emerges that companies have many opportunities of both supporting the 2030 Agenda and enhancing their market and organizational performance. The research demonstrates that both procurement and distribution processes could be reengineered by implementing sustainable approaches considering all three dimensions of sustainability. Differences emerge in terms of number of opportunities, depending on motivations for implementing them, industry and supply chain processes, performance achieved, and SDGs pursued.</jats:p>"

These effects were felt more intensely in less-developed countries, which are highly dependent on imports of products and raw materials. This study aims to assess the impact of supply chain resilience in a less-developed country (Guinea-Bissau) using complex adaptive system theory. Methods: We used a qualitative methodology through multiple case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four companies. The semi-structured script contains questions about supply chain disruptions, vulnerabilities and resilience. Results: The main results show that the companies in Guinea-Bissau, due to their dependence on the outside world and the absence of formal, larger and more diversified supply chains, suffered serious consequences with the disruption imposed by the pandemic. It was also concluded that the more resilient the supply chain, the fewer the impacts of crisis events and that the resilience of companies at this level depends on their obtaining competitive advantages over their competitors. Conclusions: The main practical implications of this study are the need to formalize the supply chain, diversify the supply of services and products of companies dependent on the exterior, adopt metrics that allow for the early detection of situations of supply chain disruption, effectively manage stocks and promote proactive crisis resolution strategies. Studies on the impact of resilience on supply chains in crises are scarce, especially on companies located in underdeveloped countries.</jats:p>"

It is widely accepted that marine phytoplankton follows Bergmann's Rule and becomes smaller with climate warming. Compared with the direct effect of increasing temperature, the indirect effect via nutrient supply is considered to be an important and dominant factor in the reduction of phytoplankton cell size. In this paper, a size-dependent nutrient-phytoplankton model is developed to explore the effects of nutrient supply on the evolutionary dynamics of functional traits associated with phytoplankton size. The ecological reproductive index is introduced to investigate the impacts of input nitrogen concentration and vertical mixing rate on the persistence of phytoplankton and the distribution of cell size. In addition, by applying the adaptive dynamics theory, we study the relationship between nutrient input and the evolutionary dynamics of phytoplankton. The results show that input nitrogen concentration and vertical mixing rate have significant effects on the cell size evolution of phytoplankton. Specifically, cell size tends to increase with the input nutrient concentration, as does the diversity of cell sizes. In addition, a single-peaked relationship between vertical mixing rate and cell size is observed. When the vertical mixing rate is too low or too high, only small individuals are dominant in the water column. When the vertical mixing rate is moderate, large individuals can coexist with small individuals, so the diversity of phytoplankton is elevated. We predict that reduced intensity of nutrient input due to climate warming will lead to a trend towards smaller cell size and will reduce the diversity of phytoplankton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

By combining European call option and buyback mechanisms, we propose a new hybrid option-buyback contract to coordinate such a supply chain with demand information updating. We construct a two-stage optimization model in that the supplier offers option price and the manufacturer decides initial ordering quantity in the first stage, then the supplier offers exercise price and buyback price and the manufacturer decides final ordering quantity in the second stage after demand information is updated. In both the centralized and decentralized settings, we analytically derive the optimal equilibrium solutions of two-stage ordering quantity. Particularly, we obtain closed-form formulae to describe the members' optimal behavior with a bivariate uniformly distribution. We prove that the proposed contracts can realize the perfect coordination of the supply chain and analyze how the proposed contracts affect the members' decisions. The theoretical results show that, by tuning the option price or buyback price, the supply chain profit can be arbitrarily split between the members, which is a desired property for supply chain coordination. Compared with the standard option and buyback contract, the proposed contract results in a greater supply chain profit and achieves Pareto improvement for the supply chain members. Furthermore, extending the baseline model focusing on price-independent demand to the case of price-dependent demand, we show that the proposed contract still can achieve supply chain coordination. Numerical examples are also conducted to complement the theoretical results.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The paper presented an alternative method for the disposal of bird manure and the production of thermal and electrical energy on the basis of the gas generator set. The article presents the mathematical model to determine the parameters of the gas generator set. (Research purpose) The research purpose is in reducing the cost of energy supply to small poultry farms using a gas generator set powered by bird manure. (Materials and methods) Methods of mathematical analysis were used; methods of system analysis and synthesis, modeling were used in theoretical research; provisions and laws of thermal balance and mathematics were used. The experimental data obtained were processed using mathematical statistics using electronic computers. (Results and discussion) Authors have developed a technology for the disposal of poultry manure with associated generation of thermal and electrical energy. The characteristics of the gas generator set on poultry manure, as well as the composition of pyrolysis gas were studied: 25 percent divalent carbon monoxide, 18 percent tetravalent carbon monoxide, 17 percent hydrocarbon radical, pyrolysis temperature 700-800 degrees Celsius. The experimental sample of the gas generator set was assembled, taking into account the characteristics of poultry manure as fuel. (Conclusions) This technology has made it possible to solve the problem of recycling poultry manure both from an environmental point of view and from an economic feasibility. During recycling, additional thermal and electrical energy is generated, which can be directed to the needs of poultry production.</jats:p>"

Maintenance and repair services, strongly associated with the reverse movement of equipment, are among the most demanding reverse supply chain operations. Equipment is scattered in various locations, and multiple suppliers are involved in its maintenance, making it challenging to manage the related reverse supply chain operations. Effective maintenance is essential for businesses-owners of the equipment, as reducing costs while improving service quality helps them gain a competitive advantage. Methods: To enhance reverse supply chain operations related to equipment maintenance, this paper presents the operational framework, the methodological approach, and the architecture for developing a system that covers the needs for predictive maintenance in the service supply chain. It is based on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of things, machine learning, and cloud computing. Results: As a result of the successful implementation of the system, effective equipment maintenance and service supply chain management is achieved supporting the reverse supply chain. Conclusions: This will eventually lead to fewer good-conditioned spare part replacements, just in time replacements, extended equipment life cycles, and fewer unnecessary disposals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ukraine ranks seventh in the international list of countries by the number of coal reserves in the country. Optimal use of this natural resource is the key to active industrial development and the basis for increasing the country's energy independence. There are large deposits of coal on the territory of Ukraine, so historically this type of fuel has been the basis of the energy sector of the economy. Despite extensive experience, the optimal way to burn coal has not been established. Even minor changes in the design of solid fuel furnaces significantly affect the efficiency of the heat transfer process inside the boilers. Therefore, the study of various design features of furnaces is relevant and promising. The results of numerical calculation of the parameters of the process of burning brown coal in a vortex furnace with counter-swirling flows are presented. The fractional composition of the fuel varies from 25 μm to 250 μm. A comparison of fuel and air mixture supply schemes from the bottom of the furnace and from the top of the furnace is performed. It has been shown that the supply of fuel from the bottom of the furnace removes solid ash at the top of the furnace, leads to a more even distribution of flue gas temperatures within the furnace volume and reduces coke content in fuel particles during lignite combustion. The results of numerical simulation of brown coal combustion processes in a vortex furnace with counterflows show that among the three schemes considered, the third scheme with lower fuel supply and removal of solid ash from the top of the furnace has the best characteristics. In this case, 99.4% of the capture of particles is provided, the particles do not accumulate in the furnace volume due to the extraction of ash. However, the mechanical underburning of coke particles with a diameter of 25 μm to 250 mm, which is captured, is 8.1% and requires afterburning. The second scheme does not provide efficient combustion of coal due to the accumulation of particles in the furnace volume.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of 5G are set to add a new layer of complexity to the current practice of standard essential patents (SEPs) licensing. While, until recently, the debate has centred on the nature of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) commitments and the mechanisms to avoid hold-up and reverse hold-up problems between licensors and licensees, a new hotly-debated issue has now emerged. At its core is the question of whether SEP holders should be required to grant a FRAND licence to any implementer seeking a licence, including component makers (the so-called ‘licence-to-all’ approach), or if they should be allowed freely to target the supply-chain level at which the licence is to be granted (the so-called ‘access-for-all’ approach). After providing an up-to-date overview of the current legal and economic debate, this article focuses on the most recent antitrust case law dealing with the matter on both sides of the Atlantic and argues that no sound economic and legal bases which favour licence-to-all solutions can be identified.\n\n* The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees, Luigi Federico Signorini and the participants in the 2021 Annual Conference of European Policy for Intellectual Property (EPIP), in the 38th Annual Conference of the European Law and Economics Association (EALE), in the TILTing Perspectives 2021 (Tilburg University), and in the 16th Annual Conference of the Academic Society for Competition Law (ASCOLA). The study was conducted as part of the research activities promoted by the DEEP-IN (Digital Ecosystem, Economic Policy and Innovation) Research Network. The author is grateful for the financial support received. Any opinions expressed in this paper are personal and are not to be attributed to the Bank of Italy.\n\nThe first is Half-Causation Branching, which allows the logical mapping of the inventing space, within which the imaginary invention is located. Implementing this tool reveals two alternative nearby inventions, which if left out of the sought patent protection would render any eventually granted patent practically worthless. Following that, Half-Causation Encapsulation comes to the rescue by allowing the encapsulation of the original imaginary invention, plus the two alternative nearby ones, all in a manner that provides the all-important unity of invention\n\nOn the one hand, patent agents are not supposed to contribute to their client’s inventive concept to the extent that they become co-inventors. On the other hand, scientists and engineers are not supposed to dedicate so much time and effort to learning about complex patent laws as to become patent agents. Arguably, each should aim to excel in their discipline. However, a structured dialogue should be considerably helpful to each and to the patent process as a whole. It is proposed that Half-Causation, with its logical structure, can provide a basis for such a dialogue.\n\nBesides targeting a readership in patent practices and theory, this paper should be of interest to multiple readerships, for example in engineering design, medical discovery and philosophy of technology.</jats:p>",

This paper answered the following research question: “Which technical, economic and emissions-related conditions predominantly determine the feasibility of a conceptual supply chain of liquid CO2 that is captured from the exhaust gases of LNG powered offshore vessels?” The captured CO2 is transported to land where it is utilized by a final customer. The study followed a systems engineering approach. Problem definition was followed by a requirements analysis (technology, emissions, economy and operations), design with scenarios and a case study with realistic vessel deployment, modeling and evaluation. All designs have technical uncertainties and financial risks, but the sale of captured CO2 could be a crucial advantage of the proposed concept over other concepts. The main conclusion is that emission and financial targets (payback time) can be met by aligning the offshore transportation distance with the capacity to store CO2 on board and the available means of transport to the final user. Specialists from the vessel owner indicate that capturing, storage and off-loading is likely to have minor implications for the vessel availability and regular operations.</jats:p>"

To ensure a sufficient amount of energy sources, we require to import these energy supplies. Since Malaysia has a large amount of petroleum and crude oil, we need to export the resources and indirectly, it can contribute by increasing our country's income. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to explore any significant impact of import and export of energy on the total electricity generation in Malaysia. All of the data are taken from the Energy Commission (Malaysia). Range from 1980 until 2017 every year. Ordinary least square (OLS) and correlation analysis have been implemented to achieve the objectives of our study. The energy supply was found to be significant with the total electricity generation exclude the export of crude oil which shows it is insignificant. Then, our findings proved that the highest correlation is between the import of petroleum and import of coal. On the contrary, the import of crude oil is the lowest negatively correlated to the export of crude oil. For the K-S test, it justified that the residuals are normally distributed. Our results confirm the energy supply influences either in a positive or negative impact on the total production of electricity in Malaysia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a strict 100-day lockdown period in Spring of 2020 in China. One of the consequences of the lockdown was the disruption of the food supply chain for the millions of people confined to their homes. The well-established online food delivery service (OFDS) in China were disrupted by pressure to scale up rapidly to resolve the last mile of food delivery. The importance of the OFDS during periods of crises became apparent, as did the realization that uninterrupted food distribution was only possible due to the presence and scalability of the existing delivery network. Focusing on the importance of an established OFDS as a foundation for food distribution, this paper seeks to explore factors that affect consumers’ perception and acceptance of the retail food delivery system in urban China. By applying the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), mean value calculation, univariate linear regression, and multiple linear regression have been adopted to test the hypotheses. Data obtained online from 260 participants demonstrate that the software’s characteristics concerning hedonic motivation (HM), convenience motivation (CM), perceived ease of use (PEOU), navigational design (ND), information quality (IQ), privacy and security (PS), restaurant credibility (RC), and perceived severity (Psev) have positive and significant impacts on customers’ intention to use (ITU), and thus, affects the actual use (AU) of the application in a positive way. The findings of this research contribute to the existing literature by consolidating, validating, and extending the TPB model, especially under the large-scale public health crisis circumstances. Customized practical insights are provided to emphasize developing HM, CM, Psev, and RC factors with maximal marginal effects that promote consumer acceptance; this is a prerequisite to the development of a robust OFDS. which can be repurposed during periods of crises to provide sustainable last-mile food delivery networks.</jats:p>"

While the biomass is fairly cheap, the logistic costs are major obstacles in utilizing these sources. In this paper, a mathematical programming model (a MILP model) is presented to design the biodiesel supply chain network (BSCN) in Iran. A supply chain model is presented that is in accordance with the real conditions and geographical features of the case study. Due to, importing most of edible oils in Iran and their high production costs, non-edible biomass including Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) and waste cooking oil (WCO) are considered as sources of producing biodiesel. In addition, in this study, the possibility of capacity expansion of facilities in different periods is considered. The presented approach is used to design a three-echelon, multi-product, multi-period BSCN. This model determines the strategic and tactical decisions including location, number, capacity of the facilities, production, inventory and material flow throughout the network. The result of this paper shows the effectiveness of the presented approach for designing the BSCN.</jats:p>"

This work investigated the influence of the coagulant/particle ratio and average velocity gradient () in the occurrence of this phenomenon with a different water matrix than previous research. Jar test assays were conducted with low (≈15 NTU), medium (≈50 NTU) and high (≈100 NTU) turbidity synthetic raw water, using alum as coagulant and kaolin as primary particles. Results were analyzed using Argaman and Kaufman's model and values for KA (aggregation constant) and KB (breakup coefficient) were determined with the evolutionary convergence method. Model fitting was satisfactory when the Al/particle ratio varied between 10 and 27 mg Al3+/g. Outside this range, residual turbidity increased after equilibrium, attributed to the irreversible floc breakup process and not adequately described by the model. A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, and the results indicated a plausible correlation between pKA (–log KA) and Al/particle ratio. As for pKB (–log KB), the results indicated a possible correlation with both Al/particle ratio and . The results suggest that the irreversible floc breakup may occur regardless of the water matrix composition.</jats:p>",

The literature on social capital is utilized to construct hypotheses about the cognitive, structural, and relational factors that may influence decisions to purchase from minority enterprises. Following that, current discrimination theory is used to deduce how buyers' views about supplier diversity affect the effects of social capital on their buying operations with EMBs. Multiple regression research indicates that in both the United States and the United Kingdom, buyers' perceived positive social capital has a direct, substantial association with their spending with EMBs. Additionally, the findings indicate that in both nations, purchasers' attitudes toward supplier diversity act as a moderator of the connection. Interestingly, despite the fact that the United States pioneered the concept of supplier variety, our study reveals that UK LPO buyers spend more with their EMBs. This research demonstrates how LPOs' strategic corporate social responsibility initiatives may be influenced by their buyers' social relationships with EMBs and their views about supplier diversity, based on these findings.</jats:p>"

From this perspective, the Brazilian Federal Government’s investment in social technology and education encouraged local agricultural production and subsistence agriculture began to have a surplus for commercialization and income generation. However, there are still difficulties in the development of the productive chain, as perceived in Alagoas, Brazil, with the jabuticaba fruit and its derivatives. In this locus, problems related to the creation of value and distributions of the product were identified. Methods: This study proposed a participant observation in a rural producers’ association and a multimethodological approach based on VFT (Value-Focused Thinking) and SWOT analysis aiming to structure the problem, identify communities’ objectives and develop alternatives to solve these problems so that they can get more out of their production. Results: showed that the product has marketing potential due to its differential, but the producers are limited in the process of distributing the goods. Conclusions: So, this study was able to analyze the problems of this productive system in a structured way, generating suggestions for actions to achieve the strategic objectives of the cooperative.</jats:p>"

With the various economic problems represented by high inflation rates, high volume of external indebtedness, and deterioration of the exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar and others. As soon as the war ended, Iraq entered into a devastating international war that lasted unless it was destroyed from the infrastructure of the Iraqi economy,  followed by a comprehensive economic blockade that isolated Iraq from the world economically, scientifically, and culturally.  Naturally,   these circumstances in Qatar exacerbate most of the financial problems already experienced by the Iraqi economy during the 1980s. Suppose we add to those conditions the mismanagement of the ruling regime, whose decisions were focused on strengthening the fragile pillars of its rule. The decisions made were political before they were economical and targeted the regime's interests before they were aimed at the interests of the economy.</jats:p>"

Estimating the future trade volumes of certain products for specific markets can help companies to adjust their own global supply chain operations and strategies. However, in today's competitive and complex global supply chain environments, making accurate forecasts has become significantly difficult. In this chapter, the authors present a novel big data analytics methodology to accurately forecast international trade volumes between countries for specific products. The methodology uses various open data sources and employs random forest and artificial neural networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methodology, the authors present a case study of forecasting the export volume of refrigerators and freezers from Turkey to United Kingdom.

In this paper, we consider a single global freight firm allocating its capacity to its own regional sales offices. The firm sells cargo space based on two types of contracts: long-term and spot sales. Regional sales offices utilize their effort to generate more demand in their designated region. In other words, it is assumed that the demand is dependent on their efforts. First, we find a closed-form solution for the optimal level of the efforts of a single sales office in a specific region. Then, we study the case when the firm allocates its limited total capacity to two sales offices. We investigate different methods of capacity allocation: decentralization, centralization, and mixed, by conducting numerical studies. Different from the traditional finding, we suggest that the decentralization method is not always dominated by the centralization method.</jats:p>"

The activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase was evaluated based on the amount of accumulated NADН during conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. The activity of malate dehydrogenase was determined from NADH accumulation in reaction of malate oxidation, at λ = 340 nm. The activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was measured by intensity of α-ketoglutarate oxidation, spectrophoto-metrically at λ = 417 nm. The animals were divided into the following experimental groups: I – control group (C); II – animals receiving low-protein ration (LP); III – animals receiving high-sucrose diet (HS); IV – animals receiving low-protein high-sucrose diet (LP/HS). It has been shown, that by rats group kept on a low-protein diet isocitrate dehy-drogenase activity was increased, without any significantly compared changes in α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase activities. A similar tendence is typical for animals maintained on a low-protein/high-sucrose diet. At the same time isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase activities exceeded control values in group of animals feeded by high-sucrose diet the most. From results we got, it can be con-cluded, that activation of NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases of Krebs cycle in mitochondrial kidney fraction of rats received a high-sucrose diet can be considered as one of possible links in mechanism of kidney injury progression. Our finding allows to substantiate the approaches for kidney complications treatment biochemically under nutrient imbalance.</jats:p>"

Human activities have increased atmospheric nutrient fluxes, but the impacts of variability in phosphorus supply on carbon sequestration in ombrotrophic peatlands are unclear. Here, we synthesise phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon stoichiometric data in the surface and deeper layers of mid-latitude Sphagnum-dominated peatlands across Europe, North America and Chile. We find that long-term elevated phosphorus deposition and accumulation strongly correlate with increased organic matter decomposition and lower carbon accumulation in the catotelm. This contrasts with literature that finds short-term increases in phosphorus supply stimulates rapid carbon accumulation, suggesting phosphorus deposition imposes a threshold effect on net ecosystem productivity and carbon burial. We suggest phosphorus supply is an important, but overlooked, factor governing long-term carbon storage in ombrotrophic peatlands, raising the prospect that post-industrial phosphorus deposition may degrade this carbon sink.</jats:p>"

Three types of horizontal mergers are considered in a dual-channel supply chain consisting of three firm types: suppliers, single-channel retailer, and dual-channel retailer. A comparison with a benchmark pre-merger scenario underscores the impacts of each horizontal merger on firms in the dual-channel supply chain. First, where horizontal mergers occur (i.e., at upstream or downstream tier) has an impact on firms in the dual-channel supply chain. Second, synergy costs trigger the domination of the synergy effect. Third, the degree of consumer preference for channels affects the trigger due to which the synergy effect outweighs the competitive effect. Although dual channels prevail in supply chain management, few studies pay attention to horizontal mergers in this context. Unlike literature on horizontal mergers in single-channel supply chains, we suggest that the impacts of horizontal mergers in dual-channel supply chains have unique features, and channel preference plays an important role in such impacts.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prefabricated house-building companies, as suppliers or supply chains, which use manufacturing as a business approach towards industrialization, struggle to implement principles and optimal practices driven from well-established and validated theories in operational research. Supply chain management has a mature body of knowledge that has been widely adopted by research on offsite construction to improve its performance at an organisational level. However, there is no comprehensive review available in the literature for supply chain management theory within prefabricated house building research from the perspective of suppliers. In this study, a systematic review was conducted on the available literature on supply chain management within prefabricated house-building research. Initially, qualitative analysis was performed to identify the key themes. Later, quantitative analyses were applied to validate the overlapping themes and keywords. Further, key trends related to focus, methods and theories or frameworks were reported. The findings were discussed in the context of recent developments in all principal component bodies of supply chain management for future work. This study also provides a brief guide for potential future review studies to explore interdisciplinary intervention within the offsite stream.</jats:p>"

Business audit information has become more abundant and complex, which has increased the efficiency and increased the potential risk of commercial banks, with credit risk being the biggest risk they face. Therefore, credit risk assessment based on the application of digital SCF is of great importance to commercial banks’ financial decisions. This paper uses a hybrid Extreme Gradient Boosting Multi-Layer Perceptron (XGBoost-MLP) model to assess the credit risk of Digital SCF (DSCF). In this paper, 1357 observations from 85 Chinese-listed SMEs over the period 2016–2019 are selected as the empirical sample, and the important features of credit risk assessment in DSCF are automatically selected through the feature selection of the XGBoost model in the first stage, then followed by credit risk assessment through the MLP in the second stage. Based on the empirical results, we find that the XGBoost-MLP model has good performance in credit risk assessment, where XGBoost feature selection is important for the credit risk assessment model. From the perspective of DSCF, the results show that the inclusion of digital features improves the accuracy of credit risk assessment in SCF.</jats:p>"

In this study, the researchers attempted to elaborate on this matter by looking at it from the rural wing based on the human resource and human capital theory. This study uses a quantitative explanatory approach. The analytical tool used is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as a fundamental data analysis using AMOS software. The population in this study were all agricultural extensions in South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi. The sample was taken using the accidental sampling technique; it included only the completed questionnaire in the data analysis. Until the time limit, only 122 agricultural extension people filled out the questionnaire and were declared complete. Research shows that rural extension has a significant positive effect on soft-skill competence and not substantial on farmer productivity. Furthermore, soft-skill competence significantly affects farmer productivity and is a good mediator in increasing farmer productivity. The results show that it could improve farmers' productivity, not because of direct extension but because the farmers' soft competence increased due to interventions from the quality of agricultural extension workers. Therefore, good quality agricultural extension agents will encourage the rural farmers' ability to solve problems. Make systematic planning and communication skills that will help them build relationships with colleagues and stakeholders, improve ethics, discipline, increase their skills and experience.</jats:p>"

Smart grids use the capabilities of information and communication technologies, especially the Internet of Things, to improve the sustainability, quality and productivity of energy production and demand forecasting, as well as to reduce resource consumption and increase the integration of renewable energy sources. The performance of the developed system is evaluated for a variety of residential electrical loads with different energy consumption patterns on a smart distribution board. In this project, the photovoltaic tracking system as well as the cleaning system will be connected to the smart board. All the input data will be collected and sent via Bluetooth/WI-FI by a working prototype built on an Arduino board, which can independently collect and monitor the real-time energy and environmental conditions of solar plants. The mobile application is also used to allow individual users to monitor the system in real time, notify users of electrical system problems, display real-time energy consumption, and provide other important notifications and alerts to the remote user when there is a deviation of solar power production quality parameters from a predefined set of standard values. A number of improvements are also proposed for further integration with Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technologies.</jats:p>"

To further improve a product's goodwill and make more profit, member firms in the supply chain use various contracts to coordinate the channel. Considering the dynamic effect of advertising, this paper studies a two-level supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. The two members focus on maximizing their profits through advertising and pricing strategies under two types of contracts: the wholesale price contract and the consignment contract. The Stackelberg differential game is introduced, and the optimal advertising effort, wholesale and retail pricing strategies in the two situations are studied. Numerical examples and sensitivity analyses are conducted to explore the models further. The results show that the retailer's revenue proportion and the product's goodwill according to consumers significantly affect the strategies and the contract choice of the partner firms in the supply chain. A proportion of too high or too low revenue may lead to a contract selection conflict between the two partner firms. However, when consumers care more about the product's goodwill, this contract selection conflict can be weakened.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Competitiveness is given by the interaction of various resources, actors and circumstances, which generate situations that could be auspicious or detrimental to the sector and other sectors. As a general perspective, Porter's Competitive Diamond Model and Action-Participatory Research have been used, combining scientific rigor with industrial practice. In applied research of non-experimental transactional design, an Attitude Scale was used as an instrument with 62 items and Likert-type answers, considering 7 latent variables. The methodological intervention was carried out on a sample of 75 sectoral experts. The factors that mainly determine the competitiveness of the textile sector are the structure, rivalry and strategy developed by the companies with a path coefficient of 0.812, the understanding of the behavior of the demand with a path value of 0.912 and the actions of the Government with an inverse relation of 0.824 for the respective path coefficient; while no relation has been established with the variable Integration or cluster.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cyclonic-vortex technology of solid fuel combustion allows to reduce the furnace volume of the boiler unit, dimensions and weight. Mixing of fuel particles and air in a swirling stream provides intensive heat exchange and fuel combustion in a limited furnace volume. The results of improving the thermal scheme of combustion of pulverized fuel (wood waste) in a circulating fluidized bed are presented. The results of numerical calculations showed the possibility of burning sawdust with a particle diameter of 25 μm to 750 μm. When the air-fuel mixture is supplied from the bottom of the furnace, and the secondary air from the top of the furnace, ash is removed in liquid form through a slot in the lower part of the furnace. It was found that with a sawdust moisture content of 10%, ash content Ac = 0.6%, a higher combustion heat of 17.7 MJ / kg, particle entrainment is 19.2 %, the degree of particle burnout is 92.5%, which requires afterburning of entrainment in a circulating boiling layer. One of the ways to improve Ukraine's fuel and energy balance is to use alternative sources of heat to natural gas, namely solid fuels or wood industry waste. It is necessary to involve specialized technologies for burning solid fuels. Currently, there is an incomplete theoretical and practical knowledge about the processes of burning wood waste.The use of natural gas as a source of thermal energy occupies a significant part of Ukraine's fuel and energy balance. To increase the share of solid fuels, it is necessary to study in more detail the processes of their combustion and the use of methods of intensification of heat transfer processes in the furnaces of solid fuel boilers. The results of numerical calculations showed that the use of vortex furnace instead of direct flow in the scheme CKS increases the residence time of particles in the furnace, which reduces the multiplicity of fuel circulation, reduce the size and weight of the furnace</jats:p>"

However, some periods can be perceived as critical moments when sudden events challenge established patterns and introduce new dynamics within the agri-food system. Many observers identified the food price hikes in 2007/2008 as such a “turning point”. The food price hikes were seen as a stark reminder of the fragility and volatility of the global food system and interpreted as signalling a structural crisis in agriculture and its organizational and institutional frameworks. The 2008 crisis produced both winners and losers. Among the winners were institutional investors that started engaging much more actively in the area of productive resources. Roughly ten years later, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global agri-food relationships again, perhaps even more profoundly. This chapter juxtaposes the crises of 2007/2008 and 2020/2021 and explores the role of financial actors within them. It analyses how financial investors, who emerged as powerful actors out of the 2008 crisis, responded to, and dealt with, the COVID-19 crisis. It further investigates how the pandemic has been rhetorically framed, what investment strategies were promoted, and how financial investors anticipate their engagement with agri-food in (post-)pandemic times.</jats:p>"

One thing to consider is the use of hot water. Not by eliminating it, but by looking for other alternatives to produce hot water. The heat-generating system that is widely used by the community is the electric water heater. On the one hand, this system works effectively because it can produce hot water with a maximum temperature of 750C. But on the other hand this system is not economical, because the electricity costs are very large. An alternative that can be given is the use of Air Conditioning Water Heater. Compared to the use of other types of water heaters, hot water produced by ACWH can be said to be \"free hot water\" because it is produced by utilizing the exhaust heat of the air conditioner and does not require additional electricity costs. The purpose of this research is to determine the most economical type of water heater. The research includes variations in the price of water heaters on the market and the electricity costs paid. From the results of the research, it was found that the most economical type of water heater is ACWH PK with an accumulated electricity cost of Rp. 5.010.300,- in the first year to Rp. 15.003.008,- in the 10th year. The results of this study are expected to be a solution to the economic crisis that hit almost the whole world. In addition, the ACWH system is also environmentally friendly and can reduce global warming because it does not consume energy and utilizes waste heat as its energy source.</jats:p>"

The main trends in the agricultural sector of Ukraine, which directly or indirectly affect the activities of the farm, are analyzed in the work. It is established that the choice of the most optimal means of transport for grain crops transportation allows the farm to reduce the cost of the logistics supply chain, which in turn will lead to increased profitability and expansion of the agricultural sector. The solution to this problem is possible through the modeling of the grain crops logistics supply chain. To form a model of the grain crops supply chain the process of grain delivery as a system that contains many acceptable alternatives for making the most rational decision. The proposed model is presented in form of a \"black box\" model. The objective function of this model for farms is to make a rational decision on the process of grain delivery in order to maximize profits by optimizing the costs of such supply chain and ensuring the development of farming as an activity. The original variables of this model are: grain crops yields and grain crops humidity; farm’s sown area; harvesting equipment efficiency; own granaries capacity; cost for grain storage in own granary or for elevator service; grain share depending on the storage place; sales price of grain crops: to the internal buyer, at the grain reception center, at the port terminal, and also weather and climate conditions during harvest (favorable / unfavorable conditions). The initial indicators that will characterize the success of the grain delivery process will be the following one: harvest duration, harvest amount, trucking cost, average daily harvest duration, additional costs obtained by managing grain humidity, magnitude of crop losses due to the harvest duration, magnitude of losses due to the grain quality reduction (with mixing, without mixing). The proposed model will consider all these factors and their impact on harvesting, storage and transportation of grain crops, and will help to take into account the costs for farms depending on the situation.</jats:p>",

A few sustainability measures have been proposed in the literature to recognize supply chain sustainability, assisting interested parties in making strategic decisions. Researchers and practitioners alike have become more aware of and interested in sustainable supply chain management. The majority of these studies, however, focus on supply chains in wealthy countries, with little research on sustainable supply chains in poor countries. Existing research focuses solely on the triple bottom line approach to supply chain sustainability, and more study is needed to identify and quantify additional components of supply chain sustainability. Although the lack of empirical evidence in the current conceptual study, it intends to propose this index to improve the evaluation and health coverage of public health supply chains. It will serve as a starting point for more study and will allow for actual testing of the index in public health supply chains.</jats:p>",

It describes the simultaneous digital and sustainable transition of the European economy. If implemented correctly, ongoing digitization contributes significantly to the desired sustainability. It, in turn, also means that digital processes supported by software should consider sustainability goals. Business software and, in particular, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are the most applied tool for the digitization of business processes. For a successful twin transition, it is crucial to combine the idea of sustainability with ERP systems. For this purpose, we conduct a literature analysis. The outcome shows that some research work regarding sustainability and ERP systems and their implementation as a whole exists already. However, a detailed process- oriented examination about the consideration of sustainability in ERP-based business processes is still missing. It should focus on the specific decision processes of business processes and functions within ERP systems. For generating impact on sustainability, the decision-making processes are of particular interest. Therefore, our research aims to examine the twin transition of decision-making processes in ERP-supported business processes. The focus is on considering sustainability in these decisions. Thus, we introduce an approach that integrates both the ERP support by automation and the consideration of sustainability.

The purpose of this study was to propose a new method to determine the scale range of environmental damage in water pollution events. In this study, taking Fen River in Shanxi Province as an example, a computer simulation system was used to simulate the diffusion and migration process of phenol at different concentrations, so as to determine the curve series of the scale range of environmental damage caused by the simulated water pollution event. At the same time, taking the incident of water pollution caused by phenol leakage in Jingle County as an example, the actual scale range of environmental damage was compared with the simulated scale range, so as to determine the error of the scale range of environmental damage. The results showed that the maximum error of the curve series of the scale range of environmental damage was 22.4%, and the minimum error was 7.5%, which indicated that the error of the scale range of environmental damage was small, and proved that this method of quantitatively determining the scale range of environmental damage had certain scientific nature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent times, sustainability of supply chains becomes the most interested subject by customers, firms, government bodies, academia, and suppliers as the environmental resources reveal as the most valuable and limited asset for human beings. One of the most important elements determining the performance of sustainable agri-food supply chain business is supplier’s commitment. A mainly inspiring feature in this domain is the wide range of factors influencing supplier selection decision-making process in Triple Bottom Line context must be analyzed. However, it is not easy to completely integrate and measure majority of these factors in a simple optimization model. Therefore, this paper starts with a comprehensive review of literature about supplier selection for sustainable supply chains (SSCs) development. Afterwards, a new two-steps hybrid solution method is suggested. In initial step, a set of criteria for supplier selection process is analyzed built on Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP). The result of the first step is fed in to the second step of the analysis to design a model with multiple objectives for selection process of supplier using fuzzy VIKOR. All three dimensions of sustainability; specifically, factors such as weather, water and soil footprint, energy and material consumption, employment, social services and finally financial performance of supply chain are considered concurrently. The suggested approach generates a comprehensive model to help supply chain managers in supplier selection process. Numerical analysis is completed via exploiting data from a Turkish agri-food company case for validating effectiveness, also and success of the proposed solution. Final analytical results of the analysis provide valuable business policy oriented, operational and practical insights on the influence of economic, environmental, and social sustainability for enhanced supplier relationship management module in sustainable supply chain structure. Moreover, by tracking environmental impact indicators such as, emission and pollution rates, footprint rates, against social and cost indicators it would be possible to perform tradeoff analysis for giving more sustainable decisions on new supply chain investments.</jats:p>"

We consider the finite mixtures of regression models, given their flexibility in modeling heterogeneous time series. Our study aims to implement a novel approach, which fits mixture models based on the spline and polynomial regression in the case of auto-correlated data, to cluster time series in an unsupervised machine learning framework. Given the assumption of auto-correlated data and the usage of exogenous variables in the mixture model, the usual approach of estimating the maximum likelihood parameters using the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm is computationally prohibitive. Therefore, we provide a novel algorithm for model fitting combining auto-correlated observations with spline and polynomial regression. The case study of this paper consists of the task of clustering the time series of sales data influenced by promotional campaigns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a case study of 131 sales series data from a real-world company. Numerical outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for clustering auto-correlated time series. Despite the specific case study of this paper, the proposed method can be used in several real-world application fields.</jats:p>"

Acutodesmus dimorphus (Turpin) Tsarenko is a species of green algae of the Scenedesmaceae family. These are cynobial freshwater algae, which are representatives of water bodies of moderate latitudes. Nitrate supply is a key factor in the algae cultivation process. The conjugation of cellular processes of algae will depend on the amount of nitrogen in the nutrient medium. Nitrogen content is the dominant factor in the accumulation of lipophilic compounds in algae biomass. The effect of nitrate supply on the accumulation of biomass, the amount of proteins, lipids and carotenoids of A. dimorphus was determined. To simulate nitrogen deprivation, Yanovsky's medium with a reduced NaNO3 content was used. Janovsky's control medium contained 80 mg/L NaNO3 (100% nitrogen supply). In experimental versions of the environment, the amount of NaNO3 was reduced to 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. A decrease in available nitrogen in the nutrient medium for A. dimorphus leads to an increase in the amount of triacylglycerols in algae cells. The highest indicator of the number of neutral lipids was noted at 50% and 25% nitrogen supply of A. dimorphus culture. Under conditions of nitrogen starvation, a decrease in the amount of total protein in A. dimorphus cells was noted, but this trend is not directly related to an increase in the amount of triacylglycerols. In order to obtain lipophilic compounds of A. dimorphus, it is recommended to use Yanovsky's medium with 25% NaNO3 content. Under these conditions, we obtain A. dimorphus biomass with an optimal content of triacylglycerols, carotenoids and protein.</jats:p>"

Data were collected using a questionnaire developed based on the literature and administered to a sample of restaurant customers consisting of 376 customers. Using IBM SPSS and AMOS software for data analyses, the results indicate that customer retention had a perfect mediating role in the effect of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty and a partial mediating role in the effect of customer delight on customer loyalty. The study provided several contributions. A key contribution to researchers is that the effect of customer satisfaction on other variables, particularly customer loyalty should be assessed in terms of its direct and indirect effects. A basic contribution to managers is that both satisfied and delighted customers have potential intentions to defect, hence, retaining customers is a crucial step to ensure loyalty. Delighted customers are more likely to be retained and retained customers are ready to be loyal customers.</jats:p>"

In this study, we evaluated the optimal renewable energy mix for power generation and associated investment costs for the country to progressively achieve upper-middle-income countries by 2050. Two economic scenarios: business as usual and Ethiopia’s homegrown reform agenda scenario were considered. The study used an Open Source energy Modeling System. The model results suggest: if projected power demand increases as anticipated in the homegrown reform agenda scenario, Ethiopia requires to expand the installed power capacity to 31.22GW, 112.45GW and 334.27GW to cover the current unmet and achieve lower, medium and higher middle-income status by 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively. The Ethiopian energy mix continues to be dominated by hydropower and starts gradually shifting to solar and wind energy development towards 2050 as a least-cost energy supply option. The results also indicate Ethiopia needs to invest about 70 billion US$ on power plant investments for the period 2021–2030 to achieve the lower-middle-income electricity per capita consumption target by 2030 and staggering cumulative investment in the order of 750 billion US$ from 2031 to 2050 inclusive to achieve upper-middle-income electricity consumption rates by 2050. Ethiopia has enough renewable energy potential to achieve its economic target. Investment and financial sourcing remain a priority challenge. The findings could be useful in supporting decision-making concerning socio-economic development and investment pathways in the country.</jats:p>"

It is faced with more difficulties in aged irrigation projects due to temporal changes such as changes in the crop patterns, development of the command area and destruction of canals and hydraulic structures. The plan of operation methods have some hydraulic and social complexities and therefore is usually simplified or implemented experimentally. This research investigates the best options for water distribution to the paddy fields in a subunit of Sefidroud irrigation scheme based on field survey, recording real data and hydraulic simulation with the employment of a SOBEK hydrodynamic model. Different operation scenarios were defined and then simulated in the current physical state of the scheme through replacing the exhausted intake structures with sluice gates. Finally, improved operation scenarios during the irrigation season were suggested based on the distribution indices. The results show that in spite of the current situation, water loss could reach the minimum by employing modification scenarios and indices of adequacy and equity of water distribution improve.</jats:p>",

The operator adjusts the temperature control curve according to watching the outdoor weather conditions, which usually results in economic conditions. Given the above condition, we analyze the heating system’s mechanism first, then compile and analyze much historical data. According to the analysis results, we establish the heat exchange station-user room temperature joint model based on the machine learning method. Using the above model, the system is deeply explored, and the optimized secondary heating curve is designed and simulated. The results show that the user’s room temperature stability has an obvious control effect, which is of great significance to meet the room temperature compliance rate. At the same time, the knowledge graph of the heating field and some applications based on the knowledge graph are also built to provide more convenient and friendly operating advice for operators.</jats:p>",

We calculate cost optimum retrofit measures for a multi-apartment building in a lifecycle perspective, and lifecycle primary energy savings of each optimized measure. The retrofit measures consist of the thermal improvement of windows with varied frame materials, as well as extra insulation of attic floor, basement walls, and external walls with varied insulation materials. The most renewable-based heat supply is from a bioenergy-based district heating (DH) system. We use the marginal cost difference method to calculate cost-optimized retrofit measures. The net present value of energy cost savings of each measure with a varied energy performance is calculated and then compared with the calculated retrofit cost to identify the cost optimum of each measure. In a sensitivity analysis, we analyze the cost optimum retrofit measures under different economic and DH supply scenarios. The retrofit costs and primary energy savings vary somewhat between non-renewable and wood-based retrofit measures but do not influence the cost optimum levels significantly, as the economic parameters do. The lifecycle primary use of wood fiber insulation is about 76% and 80% less than for glass wool and rock wool, respectively. A small-scale DH system gives higher primary energy and cost savings compared to larger DH systems. The optimum final energy savings, in one of the economic scenarios, are close to meeting the requirements in one of the Swedish passive house standards.</jats:p>"

The Marine Forecast Management System is of considerable importance to help establish rules and clues on the potential progress of the Marine Forecast Management System. Many investigations into the risk of the maritime supply chain currently concentrate on risk assessment and control and seldom undertake a detailed study of each factor’s reasoning structure. It is difficult to monitor and regulate the globalization of supply chains. Blockchain technology promises to provide accountability, traceability, and safety certain global supply chain management concerns as a distributed digital technology leader. This article critically analyzes blockchain technologies and intelligent contracts with future supply chain management applications. The interpretation framework model uses the Supply Chain Management based on Marine Economic Development (SCM-MED) methods to analyze the maritime supply chain risk mechanism. The model examines the structure and processes of the marine supply chain risk mechanism, offers a scientific framework for controlling the risk of the marine supply chain, and makes corresponding proposals for reducing and monitoring marine supply chain risk. It aims to test this belief by strictly calculating the exchanging value of information and comparing this improved value in the supply chain to reduce lead times and increase the pace of distribution by decreasing load sizes. The experimental result recommended SCM-MED improves the marine economic development ratio (98.2%) and total losses per year (25%). </jats:p>",

Findings of previous studies in terms of predictors and consequences of using E-procurement are inconsistent and most prior literature were conducted in developed countries. The purpose of this study is to examine the predictors and consequences of using e-procurement. Based on resource-based view (RBV) and Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE), the study proposed that technological (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) and organizational factor (top management support, organizational readiness, and Information System (IS) committee) will have significant effect on e-procurement which in turn expected to affect the firm performance. Competitive pressure is proposed as a moderating variable between technological and organizational factors, and e-procurement. The population of the study includes large companies in Jordan. Purposive sampling was deployed to collect the data using a questionnaire. The findings were derived from 221 responses. Data analysis was conducted using Smart PLS. The findings showed that technological (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) and organizational (top management support and organizational readiness) have significant effect on e-procurement which in turn affected firm performance. Competitive pressure did not moderate the effect of technological and organizational factors on e-procurement. The findings help the policy makers in Jordan to increase the usage of e-procumbent and firm performance by focusing on the benefits and reducing the complexity of using a new technology.</jats:p>"

This new concept called distributed energy generation, provides opportunities to separate parts of existing distribution networks into smaller units, i.e., microgrids, which can be self-sufficient and sustainable for shorter or longer periods. In a smart grid environment, efficient usage of energy and better consumer energy supply is possible, especially in cases of failures in the main grid. This paper presents a method for the assessment of possible rooftop PV system power capacity in a smart city. Special attention will be paid to the generation units coming from renewable energy (solar) and the possibility of supplying existing loads. As a case study, the results of a hypothetical project on the possibility of PV solar energy application for the electricity supply in some cities in Serbia are presented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">&lt;abstract&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, most countries are moving towards digitalization, and their energy consumption is increasing daily. Thus, power networks face major challenges in controlling energy consumption and supplying huge amounts of electricity. Again, using excessive power reduces the stored fossil fuels and affects the environment in terms of $  {\\rm CO_{2}}  $ emissions. Keep these issues in mind; this study focuses on energy-efficient products in an energy supply chain management model under credit sales, variable production, and stochastic demand. Here, the manufacturer grants a credit period for the retailer to get more orders; thus, the order quantity is related to the credit period envisaged in this model. Considering such components, supply chain members can reduce negative environmental impacts and significant energy consumption, achieve optimal results and avoid drastic financial losses. Additionally, including a credit period increases the possibility of default risk, for which a certain interest is charged. The marginal reduction cost for limiting carbon emissions, flexible production to meet fluctuating demand, and continuous investment to improve product quality are considered here. The global optimality of system profit function and decision variables (credit period, quality improvement, and production rate) is ensured through the classical optimization method. Interpretive sensitivity analyses and numerical investigations are performed to validate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the idea of credit sales, flexible production, and quality improvement increases total system profit by $ 28.64\\% $ and marginal reduction technology reduces $  {\\rm CO_{2}}  $ emissions up to $ 4.01\\% $.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Logistics is a form of calculative reasoning and set of material practices framed by the fantasy of perpetual, seamless circulation. This fantasy is built on ideas of universal connection and fungibility that sit beyond the teeming messiness of lived, unpacified life. The fantasy of connection is, however, continually haunted by an anxiety that an irruption of liveliness will disrupt material flows and expectations of plenitude. In this chapter, we draw on two case studies of food disruption from Aotearoa New Zealand—pork and flour—to interrogate these promises. The two cases take the form of vignettes when the regular operation of logistics relationships was in some way affected by the COVID-19 response of the Aotearoa New Zealand government and other actors. We argue that the character and impact of the disruption experienced in each case study are specific to its material and cultural particularities and that the particularities of disruption themselves provide a valuable analytical entry point for understanding the fragility and contingency of logistics. This leads us to show that the critical analysis of logistics relationships needs to move beyond a mirroring of claims to universality and is more insightful when it is attentive to the specific materialities of things and their liveliness.</jats:p>"

London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2018). This chapter asks what transformational possibilities might emerge in this context through a case study of a broad-acre regenerative-farming couple, Di and Ian Haggerty, and their experiments with new ways of knowing, living and farming in the wheatbelt. The Haggertys seek to reconfigure ecological relations within regimes of large-scale production. On the one hand, these regimes of production look much like their neighbours’, as they use the same logistical chains, infrastructure and financial systems as other wheatbelt producers. On the other, their farming practice—informed by a probiotic and more-than-human epistemology the Haggertys call “natural intelligence”—suggests a potential disruption to extractivist commodity agriculture in the wheatbelt and the hegemony of its technoscientific institutions. While regenerative farming at scale could be dismissed as a greener form of settler-colonial agriculture, this case study suggests, or at least creates space for, a cautious optimism that more diverse ways of knowing and doing food might be constructed from within the cracks of global supply chains and that new alliances might emerge from the ground up.</jats:p>"

In the post-socialist context, the reformist state has been pursuing a capital-based vertical model to integrate millions of smallholding producers into the market. Yet, the introduction of high-yield hybrid rice to increase production has resulted in a set of related crises, including widespread environmental pollution, food-safety issues and adverse impacts on rural life. However, agrarian communities are challenging these state-imposed practices of food production. This chapter explores an endogenous form of regenerative agriculture that has emerged in South China since the early 2000s, a Chinese form of food and farming activism for reviving community agrarianism. I argue that the revitalization of “traditional” farming practices as a form of <jats:italic>xaingtu</jats:italic> (rural) knowledge has evolved with and through local peasants’ experience and struggle over the decades. One example that combines diverse aspects of such knowledge is the “fish-duck-rice paddy”, a well-known symbiotic method of pest control that also works with native varieties, organic manure and cooperative labour. This method revives peasants’ experience of the Mao era as a cultural reference for <jats:italic>community</jats:italic> agrarianism. The revival of community agrarianism allows farming to be narrated as an evolving social and historical practice, not “wasting” peasants’ knowledge, in contrast to the capitalist agrarian transformation.</jats:p>"

But due to lack of quality, inefficient water supply designs, quality of water is deteriorated specially in recent decades and affecting a number of people. In present study, it had been inevitable to style a water system system for selected area to supply safe water system design for alittle community. For this purpose, a study area was selected named as Nimkhedi Zone of Jalgaon City. The current water system system of the village was built 30 years ago with the issues of leaky pipes, beverage was causing water-borne diseases like Diarrhea, Cholera, Giardiasis, Typhoid fever, Schistosomiasis. EPANET (Environment protection agency network) is computer software was used to design a water system system of the world providing input parameters to the software. For this a profiling survey was conducted to work out the length of pipes and therefore the elevation of every junction. The other input parameters just like the diameter of pipes, pipe network map, head losses were provided. Conclusively, EPANET gave an in-depth water system system plan for specific design period. By adopting this design provided by detailed surveys of the world and EPANET will help to regulate water quality. The new design is predicated on technology by using modern techniques (Software). It provides save and continue supply of water to community. It will also reduce the value of water billing, leakage, decrease the diseases rate and improve the life standard of people’s lives therein area.

Simultaneously, the model is solved using the fourth-order Runge Kutta (RK4) method. Finally, the validity and reliability of the proposed scheme are verified by comparing the numerical and graphical results with those obtained through the RK4 method. A numerical comparison between the results of the cGP (2) method and the RK4 method reveals that the proposed technique is a promising tool for the approximate solution of non-linear systems of differential equations. The present study highlights the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes as in comparison to the other traditional schemes, for example, the Laplace adomian decomposition method (LADM), variational iteration method (VIM), homotopy analysis method (HAM), homotopy perturbation method (HAPM), etc. In this study, two different versions of the HIV model are considered. In the first one, the supply of new $ \\text{CD4}^{+} $ T-cells from the thymus is constant, while in the second, we consider the production of these cells as a monotonically decreasing function of viral load. The experiments show that the lateral model provides more reasonable predictions than the former model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

Therefore, organizations that are willing to compete on the supply chain level are recommended to be among the JIT-productions, JIT-buyers, JIT-sellers and suppliers of JIT-information. In summary, production managers must take advantage of a T-JIT production strategy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of T-JIT production system implementation and supply chain effectiveness on improving product quality. Statistical population of this research is 305 managers, supervisors and administrative staff of production industries. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS and AMOS software. Finally, it was observed that supply chain management strategy has a positive and significant effect on product quality, supply chain capability and T-JIT production. On the other hand, T-JIT production has a positive and significant effect on product quality and supply chain capability, and also the positive and significant effect of supply chain capability on product quality was confirmed.</jats:p>"

At the same time, there are several environmental, societal, and economic implications associated with logistics transportation, including pollution, noise, and the use of urban space for transportation infrastructure. Business analytics solutions may help firms with logistics operations achieve these targets, while keeping costs down and positively impacting the society. However, many corporations haven’t venture into business analytics to achieve sustainability. The main reasons are the need to customize analytics solutions for each business problem as well as the lack of a viable, coherent process model closing the loop between sustainability objectives and analytical questions, metrics, and tools. This paper introduces a functional framework for sustainability analytics, which can be implemented in any corporation, making the planning, controlling, and measuring of sustainable development easier. The resulting business analytics blueprint, called as “Sustainability Design Process”, is suitable to effectively implement sustainable logistics using business analytics approaches such that there is a balance between economic, environmental, and societal factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly changed the supply chain process. In this study, we study the effects associated with AI automation of the retailer's order decision in a decentralized supply chain comprising one supplier and one regretful retailer. In the absence of AI automation, the retailer has a regret bias in that it behaves as though considering the deviation between the realized demand and order quantity, when making an ex ante inventory decision. We find that if profit margins of the supply chain are high, regret bias drives the retailer to decline the supplier's contract, whereas, if profit margins are low, regret drives retailers to order more from the supplier. As a result, although the automation of retailer decision leads to a higher expected profit for a retailer that operates in a centralized vacuum, it nevertheless can be a negative force for a decentralized supply chain with either high or low profit margins. Perhaps more interestingly, as a retailer's decision becomes automatic, it is not destined to earn a higher expected profit. In the extreme, a lose‐lose outcome can prevail in which automation potentially leaves both the retailer and supplier worse off. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The halal industry sector in Indonesia has experienced a very rapid increase. Based on the Global Islamic Economic Conditions Report (SGIE) 2020/2021, the halal fashion industry sector in Indonesia is ranked 3rd, this causes increasingly tight competitiveness, so that companies must excel in competing. Constraints experienced by the company are delays in raw materials from suppliers in terms of quality, quantity and time. The goal in achieving competitive advantage is to measure supply chain performance from upstream to downstream so that companies can find out which performance indicators need to be maintained and which need to be improved. The method used to improve the company's performance is the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method. Performance measurement is carried out by mapping the halal supply chain using the SCOR method at level 1, level 2 and level 3. Next, a pairwise comparison questionnaire is distributed and each indicator is calculated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach and normalization is calculated using the snorm de boer formula. So that the final value of supply chain performance is obtained at 63.54 which indicates this value is included in the average category. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the company knows which performance indicators need to be improved and which need to be maintained so that the company can improve performance from the results of supply chain performance measurements.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAbstrak. Sektor industri halal di Indonesia mengalami peningkatan yang sangat pesat. Berdasarkan Laporan Kondisi Ekonomi Islam Global (SGIE) 2020/2021, sektor industri fashion halal di Indonesia menginjak peringkat ke-3 hal tersebut menyebabkan adanya daya saing yang semakin ketat sehingga membuat perusahaan harus unggul dalam bersaing. Kendala yang dialami perusahaan yakni adanya keterlambatan bahan baku dari pemasok baik dari sisi kualitas, kuantitas dan waktu. Tujuan dalam mencapai keunggulan bersaing yaitu dengan mengukur kinerja rantai pasok mulai dari hulu hingga hilir agar perusahaan dapat mengetahui indikator kinerja yang perlu untuk dipertahankan dan yang perlu untuk dilakukan perbaikan. Metode yang digunakan untuk meningkatkan kinerja perusahaan yaitu metode Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR).Pengukuran kinerja dilakukan dengan memetakan rantai pasok halal dengan metode SCOR pada level 1, level 2 dan level 3. Selanjutnya dilakukan penyebaran kuesioner perbandingan berpasangan lalu dihitung setiap indikator dengan pendekatan Analitical Hierarchy Process (AHP) dan menghitung normalisasi dengan rumus snorm de boer. Sehingga nilai akhir kinerja rantai pasok didapat sebesar 63,54 yang menunjukan nilai tersebut termasuk kategori rata-rata. Kesimpulan yang dapat diambil yaitu perusahaan mengetahui indikator kinerja mana yang perlu dilakukan perbaikan dan yang perlu untuk dipertahankan sehingga perusahaan dapat meningkatkan kinerja dari hasil pengukuran kinerja rantai pasok.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Investigative approaches in connection with special collection methods of open-source data from social media could provide information that can usually only be obtained through measures with strong encroachments on fundamental rights. Social media offer an approach for law enforcement to quickly and directly access a large amount of openly accessible personal data of the suspect users. This contribution focuses on the acquisition of open-source data from online users to determine movement profile. To this end, 90 digital identities were observed in their social media lives over 20 days. During the observation period, 4,186 contributions were recorded in five online services and then evaluated. A geotag was used for 834 entries and the location could be designated as known for 696 entries. The open-source data from social media is suitable to determine movement profiles of the suspects. Much of the open-source data recorded in this investigation could be used to create a movement profile for the corresponding digital identities. The results indicate that Instagram is currently best suited for creating movement profiles. Snapchat also offers great potential for creating movement profiles. User accounts can be easily assigned to users via Instagram in particular. While Facebook is only suitable to a limited extent, Twitter and YouTube are ruled out for the desired goal.</jats:p>"

Water has become one of the most valuable resources for the countries; therefore, rainwater harvesting systems for water recovery gain importance to implement in buildings. Thus, authorities have begun to search for fast and accurate decision tools before taking any action. In the present study, a semi-analytical method for determining the rainwater harvesting potential of the given location is implemented in the Java programming language. Three major districts of Izmir, Turkey are chosen for the study site, namely Cigli, Bayrakli, and Karsiyaka. The result shows that implementing rainwater harvesting systems only in public buildings recovers less than 1% of the population's water needs. On the contrary, encouraging the free zones, which has large rooftop area such as airports and malls, for implementing and using rainwater increases the water recovery to 13% of that district's water needs. It is still a small portion of the public's water needs; therefore, spreading rainwater harvesting in the communities is necessary. It is believed that more accurate and user-friendly rainwater harvesting simulators would encourage the communities to harvest rainwater.</jats:p>",

Faster seedling reloading increases machine productivity, but that solution might require investments in specially designed seedling packaging. The objective of our study was to compare the cost-efficiency of cardboard box concepts that increase the productivity of tree planting machines with that of todayâs two most common seedling packaging systems in southern Sweden. We modelled the total cost of these five different seedling packaging systems using data from numerous sources including manufacturers, nurseries, contractors, and forest companies. Under these southern Swedish conditions, the total cost of cardboard box concepts that increase the productivity of intermittently advancing tree planting machines was higher than the cost of the cultivation tray system (5â49% in the basic scenario). However, the conceptual packaging system named ManBox_fast did show promise, especially with increasing primary transport distances and increased planting machine productivities and hourly costs. Thus, our results show that high seedling packing density is of fundamental importance for cost-efficiency of cardboard box systems designed for mechanized tree planting. Our results also illustrate how different factors in the seedling supply chain affect the cost-efficiency of tree planting machines. Consequently, our results underscore that the key development factor for mechanized tree planting in the Nordic countries is the development of cost-efficient seedling handling systems between nurseries and planting machines.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Increasing evidence suggests that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) lead to elevated risk of obesity-related conditions, but UPF measurement has been criticized for its subjectivity and lack of clarity on biological mechanism. Sensory-related industrial additives (SRIAs) are a defining feature of UPFs and may encourage overconsumption by enhancing the sensory quality of foods. However, practical challenges have prevented systematic incorporation of SRIAs into UPF measurement.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Objective:</jats:bold> The objectives of this work were to describe a new, open-source ingredient list search method and to apply this method to describe the presence of SRIAs in US packaged foods.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> We developed computer coding to search for 64 common SRIAs related to sweetness, flavor, appearance, and texture in 241,688 foods in the US Branded Food Products Database (BFPD). The BFPD includes manufacturer-provided ingredient lists for ~300,000 branded and private label food items. We determined the total number of SRIAs (0–64) and the number of different types of SRIAs (sweetness, flavor, appearance, texture, 0–4) in each food, then calculated the percent of all foods with SRIAs. This was done for all foods, and by food group for 224,098 items with food group data.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Most (64.9%) foods in the BFPD contained at least one SRIA, and more than a third had at least three. Sweets (89.5%), beverages (84.9%), and ready-to-eat (RTE) foods (82.0%) were the most likely to contain SRIAs. With respect to SRIA types, 25.7% of all food items had at least three of the four types of SRIAs examined, with texture-related additives being the most common. Among sweets, 20% had all four types of SRIAs.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Discussion:</jats:bold> This work confirms the high prevalence of SRIAs in US packaged foods. They are ubiquitous in sweets, beverages, and RTE foods, but also present in substantial proportions of other food groups. Quantifying the presence of SRIAs in ingredient lists offers a novel way to identify UPFs for research; to distinguish more vs. less ultra-processed foods; and to test whether UPFs increase risk for obesity-related conditions through additives that enhance the product's sensory qualities.</jats:p>"

This study has been carried out to determine the best mechanism in the design crowdsourcing supply chain and coordinate each supply chain member whose desires meet each other. Thus, we identify contracts under which conditions can coordinate the crowdsourcing supply chain by a newsvendor model with a manufacturer and a retailer with a crowdsourcing platform. To see that, we study the coordination of the crowdsourcing supply chain through the following contracts: wholesale price, buy-back, and revenue sharing contract. For the forecasting, we present a framework of the design crowdsourcing supply chain and compare supply chain performance under crowdsourcing supply chain coordination. The summarized result shows that the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the crowdsourcing supply chain efficiently. In contrast, buy-back and revenue sharing contracts can coordinate the crowdsourcing supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Aquaculture plays an increasingly important role in meeting the rising global demand for fish fuelled by economic and demographic growth. However, in many middle income countries, the growth of aquaculture is constrained by rising labor costs, limited input supply, environmental concerns, and infectious diseases. In this paper, we developed a multi species, multi sector equilibrium model and applied it to the fishery sector of Egypt, a leading aquaculture producer in Africa, to examine these barriers. Projection results show that rising wage rates would slow down the growth of labour-intensive aquaculture compared to those that use relatively less labour. The demand for feed, seed inputs and water use for aquaculture would substantially increase. The results also show that disease outbreaks would possibly affect production sectors via output reduction and also consumers via increases in fish price. Our findings suggest that stabilising the prices of feed and seed, investments in disease control and input use efficiency improvement technologies, including water use, are important while the overall effectiveness of tax instruments is modest. Though calibrated to Egypt, our approach can be applied to other middle size national aquaculture industries.</p>"

Indeed, since February 2020, the COVID-19 has constituted a major challenge for the health system, in general, and an organizational challenge for all hospitals, in particular, where the quality of inter-functional relationships plays an essential role. Thus, the internal services of the hospital require critical interactions in order to anticipate a significant influx of patients. In this perspective, this research aims to conceptualize the hospital as a Hospital Supply Chain (HSC) and explore the causal relationship between organizational commitment and cross-functional relationships in the HSC context. In doing so, the analysis of the literature makes it possible to deduce a series of propositions. In this sense, an exploratory qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews, makes it possible to compare our theoretical framework with the empirical framework.</jats:p>"

The study covered major mudcrab producing areas in Region 10. Reconnaissance survey, courtesy calls and visits to the Local Government Units, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and Department of Agriculture Offices in the mudcrab producing areas were done to identify the study sites. Results revealed that almost half (49.42%) of the mudcrab production in the country is from Region 10 which were majority caught/sourced from Panguil Bay. There are four specific supply chains traced. Computation of the marketing cost and margin for each key player revealed that the profit margin is higher towards downstream key players (traders). Also, the shorter the supply chain the more equitable distribution of income is observed. There is no face to face interaction between the local traders and the metro manila traders which resulted to information asymmetry. Some of the issues included mortality of mudcrabs during transport, price fluctuation, opportunistic behavior of the fisherman, and political intervention. Finally, common perception of the interviewed respondents pointed out that mudcrab supply is decreasing in Region 10. Therefore, the need for further intervention project on the production technology/ reinforcement of mudcrab industry should be done.</jats:p>"

The flow of materials and commodities in the opposite direction of the normal chain is inevitable too. So, in this paper, a new multi-echelon multi-period closed-loop supply chain network is addressed to minimize the total costs of the network. The considered echelons include suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, customers, and recycling and recovery units of components in the proposed network. Also, a linear programming model considering factories' vehicles and rental cars of transportation companies is formulated for the proposed problem. Moreover, the products demand is predicted by Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model to decrease the amount of shortage may happens in the network. To solve the proposed model, GAMS software is used in small-sized problems and a genetic algorithm in large-sized problems is employed. Numerical results show that the proposed model is closer to the real situation and the proposed solution method is efficient. Accordingly, sensitivity analysis is performed on important parameters to show the performance of the proposed model.</jats:p>"

It focuses on the role of environmental information exchange in strengthening relationships and improving responsiveness to overcome uncertainty while understanding and adapting to the changing environmental realities. A case study strategy of an SME in Argentina was conducted to obtain insights regarding the experiences, perceptions and opinions about how achieving trust acts as an instrument of partners' support during an uncertain time. A series of semi‐structured interviews were conducted in Argentina and China to collect empirical data. Data were analyzed to understand partners' mutual support and the emergence of trust. The importance of supply chain partnership is that partners go to the market together, meaning that there are more opportunities to benefit from for each partner. The results demonstrate that it is incorrect to assume that an SME can prosper alone in an unknown landscape. However, because of their responsiveness and experience in operating in a turbulent working environment, decision‐makers rapidly develop skills to adapt to uncertainty. Information sharing is at the core of establishing successful long‐term relationships, overcoming uncertainties while transforming them into opportunities.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to explore the fertilizer effect of different potassium levels on banana production under drip irrigation to provide a theoretical basis for the efficient and rational utilization of potassium fertilizer in banana production. Brazilian banana was used in the field experiment in this study. Under the condition of applying nitrogen fertilizer (N 750 kg/ha) and phosphate fertilizer (P<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> 450 kg/ha), five potassium supply levels of CK (without potassium fertilizer), K1 (K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O 225 kg/ha), K2 (450 kg/ha), K3 (675 kg/ha), and K4 (900 kg/ha) were employed to study the effects of drip irrigation on banana yield, fruit quality and economic benefits. The results showed that drip irrigation with potassium application could significantly increase the pseudo-stem diameter, fruits per comb, and green leaves of bananas (P&amp;lt;0.05). The banana yield with K3 treatment was 45.11 t/ha, which was 73.97%, 37.87%, 11.11%, and 5.67% higher than those with CK, K1, K2, and K4, respectively. The net cash income with K3 treatment was 122400 Chinese yuan/ha, increased by 57.32% compared with the CK treatment, and the output/input ratio increased from 1.41:1 to 3.11:1. Considering the increasing yield and economic benefits of bananas, application of drip irrigation coupled with the optimized potassium dosage (K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O 675 kg/ha) could achieve the highest banana production.

The classical time series forecasting methods compared are the moving average, weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, adjusted exponential smoothing, linear trend line, Holt’s model, and Winter’s model. These methods were evaluated to determine the method with the least Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) value and hence the highest forecasting accuracy. From the results, the weighted moving average forecasting method had the lowest MAD value of 1,987, making it the forecasting method with the highest accuracy for predicting the 50cl bottled water demand. While the exponential smoothing forecasting method had the highest MAD value of 2,483, making it the forecasting method with the least accuracy for predicting the 50cl bottled water demand.

Based on the problem description and basic assumptions, analyze the manufacturer’s profit and the retailer’s maximum profit in the case of centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making. The genetic algorithm is optimized by introducing a collaborative genetic operator, and the optimized genetic algorithm is used to obtain dual e-commerce channels. The maximum profit of the supply chain, so far, the model design is completed. Through comparative experiments, the optimized genetic algorithm used in the model is compared with two traditional algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm takes shorter iteration time to solve the problem, its convergence is better, and it can effectively obtain a global optimal solution instead of a local optimal solution.</jats:p>",

For proper integration, an adequate delivery infrastructure will be required, to be deployed in parallel to the electric grid and the gas network. This work adopts an optimization model to support the design of a future hydrogen delivery infrastructure, considering production, storage, and transport up to demand points. The model includes two production technologies, i.e., steam reforming with carbon capture and PV-fed electrolysis systems, and three transport modalities, i.e., pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and liquid hydrogen trucks. This study compares a multi-modality formulation, in which the different transport technologies are simultaneously employed and their selection is optimized, with a mono-modality formulation, in which a single transport technology is considered. The assessment looks at the regional case study of Lombardy in Italy, considering a long-term scenario in which an extensive hydrogen supply chain is developed to supply hydrogen for clean mobility. Results show that the multi-modality infrastructure provides significant cost benefits, yielding an average cost of hydrogen that is up to 11% lower than a mono-modality configuration.</jats:p>"

It has also brought to light the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities of emerging economies, like the ASEAN nations. This has resulted in collapsing of both domestic and foreign sectors like retail, accommodation, and food services. This has prompted the regional governments to boost up regional cooperation through structural reforms for sustainable economic recovery. In this respect, three sectors of tourism, agro-processing, and garments can be improvised, while two other sectors like electronics and E-trade have greater potential for future growth. In this context, the paper using content analysis and exploratory methods focuses on the impacts of Covid-19 on the sectors of tourism, agro-processing, and garments in the ASEAN region and the possible options for improvising the sectors of Electronics and E-trade to further economic recovery in the ASEAN region.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Irrational transfer of carbon emissions in the supply chain refers to the phenomenon that after the transfer of carbon emissions occurs, the profits of any party in the supply chain are reduced compared to before the transfer. Identifying and optimizing irrational transfers of carbon emissions in supply chains under environmental regulation are the bases for establishing green supply chains. By constructing a manufacturer-led Steinberg model, we obtained identification intervals for such transfers, then analyzed the influences of the changes in various coefficients. Finally, we designed a carbon emission transfer cost-sharing contract to obtain optimized intervals for shifts from irrational to rational transfers and used a Nash bargaining model to obtain the optimal share rates within the intervals. The results indicated irrational transfer intervals existed in supply chains. When a supplier has a low ability to receive transfers, the range of the irrational transfer intervals increases as the supplier’s capacity coefficient for receiving carbon emission transfers, the transfer investment cost coefficient, the emission reduction investment cost coefficient, and the consumer’s low-carbon awareness intensity increase. Otherwise, the range decreases as these coefficients increase when the supplier’s ability to receive transfers has a large coefficient. In this range, a cost-sharing contract can effectively shift the transfers from irrational to rational and an optimal cost-sharing ratio can help the transfers reach the optimal level, which is beneficial in terms of constructing a green supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, heat pumps of air split-conditioners are energy-intensive equipment, and, therefore, the need to increase their energy efficiency arises.  It is important to reduce energy consumption during the refrigeration machines operating in the mode of heat pump in air split-conditioners, which is possible using a modern method of thermodynamics — an exergetic one.  Exergetic analysis allows for establishing the maximum thermodynamic capabilities of the system, determining the losses of exergy in it, and substantiating recommendations for improving some of its elements.  The exergetic method of analysis of the operation of one-stage steam-compressor freon heat pumps of air split-conditioners developed by the authors is used in this article.  As a result, the universal dependence for determining the exergetic output-input ratio (OIR) for the air split-conditioner heat pump by \"Mitsubishi Electric\" with a heating capacity of 3200 W has been established, which makes it possible to select the parameters of its operation with the maximum exergetic OIR.  The described algorithm for obtaining such a universal dependence can be used for heat pump air split-conditioner of any firm and any heating capacity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>All through the entire supply chain, the agri-food sector has been negatively affected by significant shortages of resources, food loss, and waste. Managing the supply chain and pursuing sustainable lifestyles can be made easier through the assessment of food loss and waste. This study examines seven staple crops in the Hungarian food supply chain. The following food items were selected for analysis: wheat, maize (corn), rice, sorghum, barley, rye, and oats. Secondary data were compiled from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) between 2009 and 2017. A PAST program was used to analyse the data, generate descriptive statistics, and pairwise comparisons with the Mann-Whitney tests were used to measure all seven crops’ performance. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to classify similarities between variables and, through the comparison of the amount of crop loss and waste, data in a two-dimensional space is depicted. This study provides two key findings. First, food loss and waste (FL&amp;W) translate into resource shortages and unsustainable practices. Second, surplus food donation by corporations and conscious consumption at the consumer level is a solution to FL&amp;W reduction. Furthermore, the use of five sustainable consumption guidelines is strongly suggested at the consumer level. To stabilize food security and sustainability, food producers, distributors, stakeholders, and policy planners must work together to improve food systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Voluntary non-remunerated blood donation is well-established in many countries; however, this approach is under pressure to provide sufficient plasma for future needs. In this article we consider various aspects of plasma donation, including donor characteristics, health and safety issues, and motivating factors, including the potential role of incentives. The status of plasma donation in various European countries, and challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed. Common motivators for plasma donors include the benefit that donated plasma provides for other people, the sense that helping others is in their nature, a sense of pride at undertaking a special task, and the desire to achieve donation goals. Motivations may differ between age groups and gender. Donating plasma is safe and adverse events are infrequent, with the most common being hypotensive/vasovagal events and phlebotomy events. The main reasons plasma donors discontinue are socioeconomic, relating to the time required and conflicts with work and other commitments. When persuading donors to convert from whole blood to plasma donation, face-to-face requests are more successful than leaflets or telephone/email requests, and clear information addressing health and safety concerns is needed. However, telephone/email communication can be helpful for encouraging plasma donors to return for future donations or to donate more frequently. There is ongoing debate about non-remunerated versus remunerated plasma donation. Remuneration may be an incentive for some individuals, whereas it may deter people who have a strong altruistic drive. It has been suggested that a combination of paid and unpaid donation systems could cover a wider range of potential donors. Most European countries currently have non-remunerated donor systems, but a few do allow monetary compensation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimal planning of utility supply station location is an integral part of infrastructural projects. In general, this is a multi-objective optimization process by considering engineering, financial and geographical constraints. A shift from conventional 2D-CAD, manual quantification and design application-based approach to Building Information Modelling (BIM)-Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated approach is found to be suitable for minimizing optimal planning time, cost and increasing automation. In this paper, an Autodesk Revit add-in tool is proposed aimed at integrating BIM and GIS for Genetic Algorithm (GA) based utility supply station location optimization and to assess the possibilities of this integration. From the case study it is observed that up to 90% of cost saving can be accomplished by this proposed approach. It is found that compared to the traditional multi-software approach with manual data transfer, this integration can be utilized for multi-stage optimization and is suitable for automating heterogenous data integration with increased accuracy. The platform in which the add-in tool is developed for the utility network can be at either BIM or GIS and this selection is influenced by the availability and ease of data retrieval from the respective semantic information system and the level of automation that is to be accomplished. Standardised BIM-based modelling combined with concepts like artificial intelligence and image processing techniques can be promising for attaining desired results in industrial applications.</jats:p>"

Applying an appropriate amount of P fertilizer for alfalfa in the establishment year improves winter survival, helps achieve sustainable high yields, and promotes the best economic returns. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different P fertilization rates (0, 22, 44, and 66 kg P ha−1) on winter survival, forage yield, and root traits of two late-summer seeded alfalfa cultivars (dormant and semi-dormant) in the establishment and first production year. Our results showed that applying an appropriate amount of P fertilizer can increase forage yield and enhance the persistence of late-summer seeded alfalfa by promoting the development of crown and root traits and improving winter survival, especially for semi-dormant cultivars. Late-summer seeding and application of appropriate P fertilizer rates are effective agronomic methods for alfalfa in cold and arid winter regions, and can be used as strategies to improve fertility and stabilize soil from wind erosion for sustainable agriculture. To obtain high rate of survival in winter, the optimal P fertilization rates for the dormant and semi-dormant alfalfa cultivars in this study were 31.4 and 41.3 kg P ha−1, whereas the optimum P application rates for high forage yields were 31.3 and 31.5 kg P ha−1, respectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The livestock production and trade structures that connected the Italian peninsula and, in particular, the city of Venice with the vast Hungarian lands have been the subject of various inquiries in the secondary literature. Nevertheless, many questions remain. In this essay, I analyze the meat market in Venice (where the complex supply chain and slaughterhouse activities had considerable economic and social importance) in relation to the production and exchange structures of meat in the Hungarian lands (where the breeding of livestock and, in particular, cattle underwent considerable growth and specialization over the course of the centuries). I contend that Venice was an important end market for Hungarian beef exports. In other words, growing Venetian demand and the similarly growing Hungarian export of beef met and connected with mutual satisfaction, although not always in an entirely efficient way, giving rise to several cases of shortage and sometimes starvation and famine on the lagoon city markets. And this is a second point to investigate. If the individual and institutional Italian and Hungarian intermediaries that were interested in beef as an item of commerce can in a large part identified, many questions still surround the involvement of these economic operators in food crisis phenomena and economic practices aimed to give rise to famines in order to obtain greater profits (such as hoarding, raising prices, speculation, and export to more profitable markets). In this sense, I seek to clarify the link between the activities of operators and companies involved in the cattle trade from Hungarian territories and the famines (understood as “high price phenomena”) created in part by the lack of beef on the Venetian markets. I also examine the causes and functions of legislation and practices adopted in response to (and to prevent) starvation and/or famine and the roles of the attitudes of specific groups and economic actors involved in the meat market. Ultimately, I seek to further a more nuanced assessment of the connections between the Hungarian markets and the Italian markets between the late Middle Ages and early modern period.</jats:p>"

In response to these changes, the concept of supply chain was developed to help companies from procurement to sales of products. This paper examines the effects of supply chains on competitiveness using the example of agro-food companies from the Republic of Croatia. The research was conducted through a questionnaire which included 188 agribusiness companies. The responses were systematized and statistically processed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis. The results showed that the effects of supply chains play a major role in determining the competitiveness of agro-food companies. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the effects of the supply chain in these companies in order to improve competitiveness and achieve better results of these companies on the market.</jats:p>"

The basis of the research process was a systematic literature review using the technique of in-depth analysis of full-text articles and expert consultations. The structural model concept was described in two dimensions in which the identified variables were embedded. The first dimension includes the supply chain phases: procurement and production with warehousing and distribution. The second dimension takes into account a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach and includes the following factors: technical, economic–logistical, locational, and formal–legal.</jats:p>"

These groups of people mainly are the company staff involved indirectly in the supply chain process. This research is conducted to investigate the knowledge of engineers that play a crucial role in the manufacturing process. The research is exploratory in nature where a qualitative approach using the focus group interview was conducted to uncover the theme and issue on the subject research.

The measurement strategy is based on the search for the minimum sum of the power supplied to the excitation circuit and the stator circuit for the assumed load torque values. The process of searching for the minimum sum of power can be significantly shortened and simplified by using a network parameter meter. The research confirmed the usefulness of the proposed method for determining the optimal operation parameters of a synchronous motor. The tested motor was a machine with a cylindrical rotor, but the developed method will also be applicable to synchronous machines with salient pole rotors.</jats:p>",

In conventional flushing, all the contaminated water is discharged to the environment, thereby harming it. A new method is proposed here as an alternative solution, in which a containment pond lined with impermeable material will be constructed in a suitable place within the municipality. Network modelling was performed to investigate the feasibility of the new method. It was found that (1) the proposed flushing method can successfully reduce environmental impacts compared to hydrant flushing only, (2) a containment pond cannot clear the system periphery away from the containment pond, (3) the best location of a containment pond is not always at the furthest location from the source reservoir, and (4) for some systems, some pond locations might be better from an economic perspective, while other locations will be better environmentally.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The semiconductor supply chain is characterized by a global and complex production network in a competitive market. The time when work at one location ends and can be resumed at another is defined as Transit Time (TT). Therefore, planning Transit Time accurately and minimizing delays is crucial as it is used in the execution system to determine the Available to Promise (ATP) and thus important for daily order confirmation. By determining the ATP, the customer receives a response to the resource availability and a due date to the customer requests. Due to tool inherent differences, we choose semantic integration via Knowledge Graph (KG) to match the planned TT used in the execution system and the actual TT measured in the monitoring tool. KnowGraph-TT thereby serves as a role model for further matching and alignment tasks using KG. It connects actual and planned TT, highlights the gaps via applied queries, and enables an optimized update of planned TT. With our solution, deviations of actual and planned TT can be minimized and confirmations of unrealizable deliverable times are avoided.</jats:p>"

Based on incentive-compatibility theory, the optimal subsidy allocation policy and green investment level were explored. Fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP) is used to clarify the uncertainty factors of this model; while genetic algorithm (GA) and CPLEX are used to find and compare a calculating example's approximate optimal solution about this model. The main calculating results indicate that: (1) Enterprises can make optimal recycling, production and sales strategies according to different potential demand; (2) Without government subsidy, enterprises' higher green investment level will reduce their average gross profit, increase the quality level of recycled products and decrease the recycling rate, hence reduce their environmental protection willingness; (3) Based on incentive-compatibility theory, when government subsidy weight is set as 0.34~0.41 for consumers, enterprises' higher green investment level will enhance their average gross profit, reduce the quality level of recycled products and increase the recycling rate, which will improve their environmental protection willingness; (4) Under uncertain environment, the combination of reasonable government subsidy policy and enterprises green investment can make up for the defect of enterprises green investment alone, maximize utilities of government and enterprises, and optimize the green closed loop supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\t      &lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

Further, it investigates consumers' behavior during the covid-19 pandemic. A questionnaire was used to examine a sample of 400 Thai consumers who were using online food delivery platforms. Collected data were analyzed using a statistical package program in 3 steps: Confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, structural equation model analysis (SEM). Thai consumers increasingly used food delivery on online platforms during the covid-19 epidemic. The study also found that the platform's ease of use, the food delivery service fees, offers or privileges, and payment security on online food delivery platforms influenced consumers’ future use of online food delivery platforms. The food delivery service fees are the most influential factor in using online food delivery platforms. Future research can explore the role of using online food delivery platforms and their impact on the online food delivery platforms. Online food delivery platform providers should lower their service fees, always be implementing new promotions, provide various coupon codes, and create games so that consumers can win prizes. The online food delivery platform providers need to develop consumer trust, ensure that payments are secure, and enhance the ease of use of their platforms. This study contributes to the emerging literature related to online food delivery platforms by studying the relevancy factor that influences consumers’ preference to use online food delivery platforms, which are critical for the success of any online food delivery platform provider.</jats:p>"

This thesis is about how to transform the usage of fossil fuel vehicle to electrical vehicle in Bali. Bali is an island with the longest distance from one of its districts to Denpasar city is 95,6 km. This distance is reachable by the common electrical vehicle that available in the market now. The usage of the electrical vehicle requires good development and planning, otherwise it will cause problem for the electrical systems. The consumption of electrical energy will increase.  In 2019, Bali used 5,908 GWh electricity in a year. And if all the 2 wheels and 4-wheels vehicles now are electrical vehicle, it will require extra 2,823 GWh per year. It will impact the planning of power generation in Bali.Another challenge for the electrical systems is the duck curve problem. The habit of the user charges their vehicle will also impact the daily load curve of an electrical systems. If all the two wheels and four wheels vehicles now are electrical vehicle, and all   users conduct the charging at the same time in 4 hours duration, the load will increase about 1,934 GW. The practical and applicable solution is the independent power producer concept by the solar PV. If every electric vehicle user installs the solar PV for their electrical vehicle consumption, this will solve all the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of thermal insulation materials to reduce the heating and cooling demand of the building in order to provide energy efficiency is the main solution. But there is a wide range of these products on the market and, therefore, the choice and application of these materials is a rather difficult task, since many factors must be taken into account, such as environmental safety, cost, durability, climatic conditions, application technology, etc. Basically, comfort microclimate systems are designed based on normative standards, where the thickness of the thermal insulation material is selected depending on the required heat transfer resistance. These values are calculated taking into account climate conditions, that is the duration of the heating period, as well as taking into account sanitary and hygienic requirements. This article discusses the thermal performance of building materials, and also provides a comparative analysis of the use of thermal insulation materials depending on climatic factors and on the system providing comfort microclimate. Based on the calculations by mathematical modeling and optimization, it is advisable to choose the thickness of the thermal insulation, taking into account the capital and operating costs of the comfort microclimate systems. Comparing the optimization data with the normative one, the energy efficiency of the building increases by 50-70% when applying the optimal thickness of the thermal insulation layer, and when the thermal insulation layer is increased, the thermal performance of the enclosing structures has improved by 30%, which contributes to energy saving.</jats:p>"

Considering the dual smart innovation of the manufacturer's production and retailer’s service, the manufacturer-led Stackelberg game model is constructed in the smart supply chain. Under the single and coordinated government subsidy strategies, the optimal decisions of the smart supply chain are researched, and the impacts of manufacturers' risk aversion on the government subsidy strategies and supply chain decisions are analysed. In addition, the efficiencies of different government subsidy strategies are compared and analysed by numerical simulation. Finally, the results show that: (i) The moderate risk aversion by the manufacturer can improve social welfare and help provide consumers with more affordable products. (ii) The government expenditure and product prices are highest under the coordinated subsidy strategy. (iii) Subsidising manufacturers is more beneficial than subsidising retailers among the two single government subsidy strategies. (iv) In general, the coordinated government subsidy strategy is more effective than the single subsidy strategy for the innovative development of a smart supply chain. In conclusion, the research provides a significant practical reference for jointly building the smart supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, it should be noted that Chinese enterprises are characterized by an immature supply chain management mechanism, and weak environmental protection awareness and social responsibility awareness. Therefore, from the perspective of sustainable development, a performance evaluation system for a prefabricated building supply chain was established based on SEM (Structural Equation Model) and virtual frontier SBM–DEA (Slacks-Based Measure and Data Envelopment Analysis). Upon summarization of a great deal of literatures, the most influential 34 indexes were selected, after which the weight calculation and index screening were performed using SEM method. Second, the performance evaluation was conducted using the virtual SBM–DEA method. Horizontally, a comparison is made on the performance and total performance of the four sub-units (supply chain operation, economic benefit, environmental protection and social liabilities) in the supply chain; vertically, the dynamic changes of the supply chain in time dimension are assessed. After the evaluation system was applied into enterprises, research results show that factors affecting the performance of the corporate supply chain are ranked as: supply chain operation &gt; economic benefits &gt; environmental protection &gt; social responsibility. At the same time, the performance of 14 supply chains was evaluated, in order to provide guidance for supply chain management in enterprises.</jats:p>"

Academic/practical relevance: Established findings suggest that SI may alleviate double marginalization and improve the efficiency of a decentralized distribution channel. However, no studies consider the role of SI under chain-to-chain competition. Methodology: We build a two-period model consisting of two competing supply chains, each with an upstream manufacturer and an exclusive retailer. The retailers compete on either price or quantity. We characterize the firms’ strategies under the concept of perfect Bayesian equilibrium. We consider cases where contracts are either observable or unobservable across supply chains. Results: (1) SI still exists under chain-to-chain competition. Retailers may carry more inventory when the competition becomes fiercer, which further intensifies the supply chain competition. (2) Different from the existing findings, SI may backfire and hurt all firms. Interestingly, firms may benefit from a higher inventory holding cost. (3) Under supply chain competition, the prisoner’s dilemma can arise if competition intensity is intermediate; in other words, manufacturers are better off without strategic inventory, and yet they cannot help allowing strategic inventory, which is the unique equilibrium. Managerial implications: Despite its appeal among firms of a single supply chain, the role of SI is altered or even reversed by chain-to-chain competition. Conventional wisdom on SI should be applied with caution. </jats:p>",

The resource-based view of the firm is used to frame the direct effects of strategic supplier selection, arguing that a buyer's ability to select a supplier with resources and expertise in a specified domain should improve the buyer's performance capability in the \"matched\" domain (but not necessarily in \"unmatched\" domains). Two supplier integration techniques are considered as potential mediators, assuming indirect pathways. The research hypotheses examine both direct and indirect impacts for each of the matched domains, but do not assume cross-domain interactions. For instance, supplier selection for new product development capability should have an effect on buyer product innovation (in matched domains), but not always on buyer quality capability (unmatched domains). While the direct impacts of strategic supplier selection on buyer performance are supported in each matched domain, the indirect effects via supplier integration are not substantial for the matched domains. Strategic supplier selection is identified as a viable source of competitive advantage in the resource-based view. By contrast, supplier development and supplier partnership do not provide additional performance benefits in a particular domain over and beyond those obtained from strategic supplier selection in that domain; rather, it is the type of the resources selected that determines competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

The contributions of this study identify that investing in big data within a certain threshold can improve the channel service level, reduce the channel price and improve the income of the supply chain. Supply chain members improve the channel service level and increase the corresponding channel price. The supply chain can get the most advantages when manufacturers and retailers make centralized decisions. This paper provides a starting point for new retailing academic and practical research in a domain that is deficient in empirical research, provides the theoretical framework to new retailing enterprises and decision-making model for their sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Globalisation allows corporate organisations to rise above the national and regional regulatory constraints through global value chains. This is especially due to the fact that national boundaries do not limit the flow of investment capital, labour, goods, or the environmental consequences of such activities. In parallel, the evolution of sustainable development has brought with it social, environmental, and economic activities for the benefit of future generations. The 2030 Agenda reflects the notion of sustainable development with 17 individual goals and 169 targets. While many welcomed such development, enforceability of sustainable development goals (SDGs) remains a challenge, primarily as voluntarism is central to the system of SDGs. In theory, consumers and end-user companies opt for sustainably produced goods to contribute towards sustainable development in their own countries and other countries in global value chains. In the absence of a national or international binding regulatory framework, contract emerged as the most effective solution for enforcing the SDGs in global value chains. This article explores the current challenges in the enforceability of sustainability clauses in global value chains through the lens of sustainable consumption and production patterns and SDG 12. It contributes to the ongoing academic debates and practical considerations through the lens of proactive law theory. </p>"

The CEASAMINAS unit (Greater Belo Horizonte) was responsible for 76% of the annual commercialization of strawberry in Minas Gerais, through the CEASAMINAS units, which fluctuated between 6038.4 and 7413.4 Mg ha-1 yearly. In the periods of transition from winter to mid-season and summer, it is possible to observe striking variations in supply and prices of strawberry in market assessed, referring to the lowest productive averages and the highest average prices observed year to year. The seasonal variations in supply and prices of strawberry clearly reflected the need for new cultivars that can satisfactorily produce during the mid-season and high temperature months.</jats:p>"

Based on the characteristics of the filled function, a new filled function algorithm that can obtain the global optimal solution is designed. Numerical experiments verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm.

Recent studies are increasingly focusing on the expanded flexibility of soft open points (SOPs) compared to conventional tie-switches to increase the restoration rate of critical loads; however, the potential of this novel technology is not limited to this aspect, with SOPs being used to improve the voltage level and increase the hosting capacity of renewable energy sources (RESs). This paper proposes a deterministic model for the optimal coordination of SOPs and distributed resources in an active distribution network (ADN) aiming at re-establishing the energy supply to critical loads after a prolonged interruption occurrence. At the same time, the support of DC microgrids with integrated RESs, embedded in SOPs, for the restoration process is explored. The efficiency of the proposed optimization model is verified based on a 24-h analysis performed on the modified IEEE 33-bus system, while considering the load and generation uncertainties as well.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural gas has been attracting increasing attentions all around the world as a relatively cleaner energy resource compared with coal and crude oil. Except for the direct consumption as fuel, electricity generation is now another environmentally-friendly utilization of natural gas, which makes it more favorable as the energy supply for urban areas. Pipeline transportation is the main approach connecting the natural gas production field and urban areas thanks to the safety and economic reasons. In this paper, an intelligent pipeline dispatch technique is proposed using deep learning methods to predict the change of energy supply to the urban areas as a consequence of compressor operations. Practical operation data is collected and prepared for the training and validation of deep learning models, and the accelerated predictions can help make controlling plans regarding compressor operations to meet the requirement in urban natural gas supply. The proposed deep neutral network is equipped with self-adaptability, which enables the general adaption on various temporal compressor conditions including failure and maintenance.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the parameters involved in the decision-making process should be looked into carefully as they may not always be of a deterministic nature. In the present study, a multiobjective nonlinear transportation problem is formulated, wherein the parameters involved in the objective functions are assumed to be fuzzy and both supply and demand are stochastic. Supply and demand are assumed to follow the exponential distribution. After converting the problem into an equivalent deterministic form, the multiobjective problem is solved using a neutrosophic compromise programming approach. A comparative study indicates that the proposed approach provides the best compromise solution, which is significantly better than the one obtained using the fuzzy programming approach.</jats:p>"

Aging of the population has a significant impact on national economies, as well as within individual regions of the country. The old age index has a significant impact on regional supply of services. It is worth stressing that in order to improve a community’s quality of life and reduce disparities between regions, it is necessary to continually assess the level of development and regional development opportunities.

The proposed power system can supply energy to shelter hospitals for better treatment of patients in remote states, particularly in the event of a pandemic situation such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For this reason, a hybrid power system in which a diesel generator is used with a photovoltaic energy source for reliable availability of power supply. Moreover, battery and ultracapacitor are also integrated to obtain a hybrid power generation and storage system to ensure the smooth operation of mobile hospitals irrespective of weather conditions. A boost converter is used with PV panels to operate them in either maximum power tracking mode or power curtailment mode. The battery is connected to a bidirectional reversible DC-DC converter for direct-current (DC) bus voltage regulation and state of charge control. The ultracapacitor is associated with the battery to compensate for the peak power. The diesel generator is connected in parallel with the photovoltaic generator, battery, and ultracapacitor to continuously provide the power required by the load. The integrated operation of all generation sources and storage systems is complex for shelter hospitals. Therefore, an efficient energy management algorithm is developed to manage the continuous energy flow between different elements of the hybrid power system and mobile hospital load through the control of the power converters. Finally, validation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed energy management algorithm for the hybrid power system.</jats:p>"

The retailing firms are also taking several efforts for marketing those products and thinking more about the fairness of the business. Keeping this in mind, this study investigates the effect of recycling activity and the retailer's fairness behavior on pricing, green improvement, and marketing effort in a closed-loop green supply chain. In the forward channel, the manufacturer sells the green product through the retailer while in the reverse channel, either the manufacturer or the retailer or an independent third-party collects used products. The centralized model and six decentralized models are developed depending on the retailer's fairness behavior and/or product recycling. The optimal results are derived and compared analytically. The analytical results are verified by exemplifying a numerical example. A restitution-based wholesale price contract is developed to resolve the channel conflicts and coordinate the supply chain. Our results reveal that (ⅰ) the manufacturer never selects the third-party as a collector of used products under fair-neutral retailer, (ⅱ) the fairness behavior of the retailer improves her profitability but it diminishes the manufacturer's profit, and (ⅲ) if the manufacturer does not pay much transfer price, then the collection through the third-party is preferable to the fair-minded retailer.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

During the 20-year period of solar power plant construction in Slovenia, feed-in tariff subsidy models have been developed for the electricity generated from solar power plants, in the form of guaranteed feed-in or operating support, which have been very profitable in the past. The disbursement of subsidies for renewable electricity has exceeded the planned volumes. With the changed policy of subsidy reductions, investments started to decrease. After 2017, self-consumption and self-supply of electricity started to be promoted and had good promotional support. The main focus of this section is an economic analysis of the viability of investing in the construction of a solar power plant under normal and changed conditions, in terms of the potential risks and additional benefits of using electricity from a self-sustaining solar power plant. Economic indicators of investment performance from the investor's point of view, such as payback periods, net present value, internal rates of return under normal conditions and in the case of risks and uncertainties, and taking into account the additional social benefits of the average price of emission allowances were analysed for the Cost Benefit Analysis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>From the angle of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this research note explores renewable energy in food supply chain and sustainable marine fishery. With an initial theoretical analysis, it is observed that the share of renewable energy, as reflected by SDG Indicator 7.2.1, can contribute to the measurement of and data computation for SDG Indicators 12.3.1 and 14.7.1. This is because renewable energy becomes a significant component of on board cost for harvesting, processing, and preserving fishes by marine vessels/fleets. Also renewable energy can be used to estimate food waste because it functions as an estimation for municipal solid waste if data is not directly available. A number of scientific and practical implications are generated. For example, more interdisciplinary studies on the interactions across SDGs should be encouraged, and more in-depth empirical research are also expected in future. The connections between renewable energy, food supply chain, and sustainable marine fishery also call for more holistic policies for sustainable development, with adequate consideration of disparities in country contexts. Effective actions should be taken to further enhance the statistical capacities of countries and international organizations, which will be a foundation for applying more sophisticated techniques into the analysis of data in this field. The main objectives of this short research note are to provoke more scientific thoughts and provide policy-oriented recommendations. It leaves spaces for more empirical evidence-based future research including another study under the author’s plan.</jats:p>",

In order to adapt to the new normal, businesses must make both micro and broad changes to their supply chain strategy. The goal of this research is to create plans to minimize any disruptions caused by upcoming pandemics. To restore the broken supply chain, a number of new implications and adjustments to the current attributes were proposed in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution. Finding the fundamental drivers that are frequently impacted by the disturbance is part of the technique. The afflicted locations were the focus of the models' development. The ideas work as preventative measures intended to thwart the disturbance when and if it happens. In order to assess the model's viability, the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) value was ultimately retrieved with the aid of 25 industry experts. These suggestions may result in improved transparency, real-time monitoring, cost effectiveness, and responsiveness, among other benefits. Our analysis indicates that the KPI scores for procurement, production, and distribution are 92.86%, 82.14%, and 87.50%, respectively. The models' total viability is 87.50%. The most recent Covid-19 pandemic has provided us with a vivid illustration of what could go wrong in such circumstances. In both pandemic and non-pandemic conditions, the adaptation of stated suggestions at the aspect of sourcing, production, and distribution might result in a significant shift to organization-wide activities.</jats:p>"

In this regard, analytical methods are just for some aquifers with regular boundaries. Numerical methods used for this aim are finite difference (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM) which are engaged for some simple aquifers. Using them in the complex cases with irregular boundaries has some shortcomings, dependent on meshes. In this study, meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method based on the moving kriging (MK) approximation function is used to simulate groundwater flow in steady state over three aquifers, two standard and a real field aquifer. Moving kriging function known as new function which reduces the uncertain parameter. For the first aquifer, a simple rectangular aquifer, MLPG-MK indicates good agreement with analytical solutions. In the second one, aquifer conditions get more complicated. However, MLPG-MK reveals results more accurate than FDM. RMSE for MLPG-MK and FDM is 0.066 and 0.322 m respectively. In the third aquifer, Birjand unconfined aquifer located in Iran is investigated. In this aquifer, there are 190 extraction wells. The geometry of the aquifer is irregular as well. With this challenging issues, MLPG-MK again shows satisfactory accuracy. As the RMSE for MLPG-MK and FDM are 0.483 m and 0.566 m. therefore, planning for this aquifer based on the MLPG-MK is closer to reality.</jats:p>",

The contributions of this study identify that investing in big data within a certain threshold can improve the channel service level, reduce the channel price and improve the income of the supply chain. Supply chain members improve the channel service level and increase the corresponding channel price. The supply chain can get the most advantages when manufacturers and retailers make centralized decisions.

The research had two goals: to study the strength under static loading of a mortar liner reinforced with a composite mesh frame and to define the maximum depth of underground location of a coating element, which is of significant importance if a host pipe cannot bear external loads any longer. Within the research, two specimens of coating with the length of 1000 mm and diameter of 800 mm were tested. The compression results showed that for both specimens the loss of bearing capacity occurred to the fluidity of composite reinforcement under the load of approximately 30 kN. After the strength test, a calculation was made to evaluate the maximum depth of liner location in case if a host pipe fully exhausts its bearing capacity. The results of the calculation showed that the maximum height of the soil layer above the crown of a pipe is 2.8 to 3.2 m depending on the type and features of the soil.</jats:p>"

In this work, an improved stage-wise superstructure of HENs is proposed to integrate with a Rankine cycle-based utility system. Inner- and inter-stage heaters are considered in the new structure. Furthermore, the selection of steam in different levels is also investigated, extending the possibilities of steam utilization in HENs and generation in utility systems. The presented methodology is able to realize the optimal design of HENs by considering the supply and utilization of steam. Heaters’ allocations, matches of streams, steam distribution and utilization are optimized accompanying with the trade-off amongst equipment investment, fuel consumption and power generation in objective, which is highly related to the final structure of the system. The optimization problem is formulated into a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model and solved towards the lowest total annual cost (TAC) of the entire system. Finally, a case study with two scenarios is studied.

Due to an unreliable manufacturer and transportation hazards, shortages arise, which negatively impact the reputation of the retailer. Moreover, customers are more conscious of the environment, as a result, most of the industry focuses on the production of green products. To reduce the holding cost of the retailer, a fuel consumption-based single-setup-multi-unequal-increasing-delivery policy was utilized in this current study. With this transportation policy, the number of shipments increases, which directly increases carbon emissions and transportation hazards. To protect the environment, the green level of the product is enhanced through some investments. The demand varies with the price of the product as well as with the level of the greenness of the product. Due to uncertain demand, the rate of the production is treated as controllable. A classical optimization technique and distribution-free approach have been utilized to obtain the optimum solution and the optimized system profit. To prove the applicability, the study is illustrated numerically and graphically via a well-explained analysis of sensitivity. The study proves that single-setup-multi-unequal-increasing delivery policy is $ 0.62 \\% $ beneficial compared to single-setup-single-delivery policy and $ 0.35 \\% $ better than the single-setup-multi-delivery policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

To generate the complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage, the voltage of a PN junction generated by a PMOS transistor - which is part of the bias circuit - is used. Generation of proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) voltage is carried-out by utilizing three stages of   self-cascode transistors biased in the sub-threshold region. A fraction of the CTAT voltage is added to the PTAT voltage without using an additional circuit to enable acquiring an output reference voltage of about 0.648 V with minimal temperature dependence. The proposed voltage reference is simulated in 0.18 μm of CMOS process and its area occupation is 0.0023 mm2. The obtained post-layout simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FMVR has a temperature coefficient equivalent to 12.9 ppm/°C under the temperature variation from -25 °C to 120 °C. Moreover, the line regulation under supply voltage variation from 0.9 V to 2 V is found to be equal to   0.02 %/V, and a power supply rejection ratio of 44 dB is acquired. Comparing the main parameters of the proposed FMVR - to the state-of-the-art circuits - shows that it has higher efficiency with smaller area and lower power consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the heat balance of buildings, the main heat loss occurs through enclosing structures. Determining the heat transfer coefficients on the exterior facades of buildings is not an easy procedure, as they depend on a wide range of parameters: wind speed in the surface atmosphere, wind direction relative to the orientation of facades, surface orientation relative to wind, surface angle relative to the ground plane, type terrain, the impact of adjacent buildings, surface texture, surface and air temperature differences, surface size and aspect ratio, etc. The paper presents the results of a numerical study of heat transfer from the outer surfaces of separately located structures in the surface layer of the atmosphere. Schematic models of the building have the same heat transfer surface area, but different heights and lengths. CFD-modeling of heat transfer of buildings in the wind flow in a three-dimensional setting allowed to establish some features of heat transfer of enclosing structures depending on the height of the building and the characteristics of the wind flow. In particular, it is shown that the average surface values of heat flux density increase with increasing building height. The results of the calculation of the average heat flux density on the surface of buildings indicate its dependence on the height of this building. This dependence is observed only for houses with a height of less than 30 m. For taller houses, this dependence is insignificant. The local values of heat transfer coefficients on the windward and leeward facades of the building obtained as a result of modeling indicate incorrect application of heat transfer coefficient values αк = 23 W / (m2 ∙ K) for construction practice for external surfaces of enclosing structures. For windward facades, a polynomial model for the heat transfer coefficient is more suitable, and for leeward ones, the Frank formula for αk.</jats:p>"

The contributions of this study identify that investing in big data within a certain threshold can improve the channel service level, reduce the channel price and improve the income of the supply chain. Supply chain members improve the channel service level and increase the corresponding channel price. The supply chain can get the most advantages when manufacturers and retailers make centralized decisions. This paper provides a starting point for new retailing academic and practical research in a domain that is deficient in empirical research, provides the theoretical framework to new retailing enterprises and decision-making model for their sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

Utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) for predictive modeling and the Cox Proportional Hazards Model for risk assessment, the study develops a comprehensive model to optimize procurement processes. Integrating these advanced analytics techniques provides a data-driven approach to forecasting procurement needs, managing supplier risks, and improving overall cost efficiency. The research incorporates a detailed survey conducted via SurveyMonkey to gather insights on procurement practices and supplier performance, which were analyzed using Alteryx for data visualization and integration. The findings demonstrate that the SVM model achieved an 85% accuracy rate in predicting procurement needs. At the same time, the Cox Proportional Hazards Model successfully identified critical risk factors with a concordance index of 0.78. Applying these models led to a 15% reduction in procurement costs and a 20% increase in inventory turnover rates. The study highlights the practical implications of advanced analytics in procurement, emphasizing the potential for improved decision-making, enhanced cost efficiency, and strengthened risk management. The results underscore the importance of leveraging data-driven insights to address procurement challenges and optimize supply chain performance. Recommendations for future research include expanding data sources, exploring additional advanced analytics techniques, and conducting longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of these approaches.</jats:p>"

The collector offers a reward or incentive to consumers to influence them to return the used items. The shortfall amount of collected used items, if any, is meet up by the supplier by supplying fresh raw materials. In three separate cases viz centralized, decentralized and revenue-sharing contract, optimal incentives for end-customers and optimal profits of supply chain members are determined. The revenue-sharing contract is implemented in two different settings - one including the supplier and the other one excluding the supplier. The win-win outcome for the supply chain members is investigated and a specific range of the sharing parameter for win-win outcome is obtained. Optimal results are supported by numerical analysis, and sensitivity of the optimal results with respect to key parameters is analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

With the increase in water consumption for domestic use and irrigation, it becomes more challenging. Many more difficulties, such as non-convex, nonlinear, multi-objective, and discontinuous functions, exist in real life. From the past two decades, heuristic and metaheuristic optimization techniques have played a significant role in managing and providing better performance solutions. The popularity of heuristic and metaheuristic optimization techniques has increased among researchers due to their numerous benefits and possibilities. Researchers are attempting to develop more accurate and efficient models by incorporating novel methods and hybridizing existing ones. This paper's main contribution is to show the state-of-the-art of heuristic and metaheuristic optimization techniques in water resource management. The research provides a comprehensive overview of the various techniques within the context of a thorough evaluation and discussion. As a result, for water resource management problems, this study introduces the most promising evolutionary and swarm intelligence techniques. Hybridization, modifications, and algorithm variants are reported to be the most successful for improving optimization techniques. This survey can be used to aid hydrologists and scientists in deciding the proper optimization techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When creating and improving power supply systems, steady-state calculations are the most common, they contain nonlinear elements in the form of generators and loads, therefore their steady-state mode is described by nonlinear equations. The solution of such equations is possible only by iterative methods, which is associated with the problem of convergence of the iterative process. Due to some features of electrical systems, which are inherent, including power supply systems of the agro- and forestry complex, the convergence of the iterative process may be slow and not even secured. (Research purpose) The research purpose is developing a method for calculating the steady-state modes of power supply systems that meets the condition of convenience of implementation on an electronic computer and removes the problem of convergence of the iterative counting process. (Materials and methods) Proposed a direct calculation method with cyclic correction of the initial information for each cycle in order to take into account the nonlinearity of elements of power supply systems. (Results and discussion) The calculation formulas for determining the intrinsic and mutual resistances that underlie the proposed method are given, their main feature is that they are distributed with elements included in the nodes corresponding to sources and loads, and obtained by the authors as a result of the transformation and solution of nodal equations. It was established that the method is implemented through the operation of the following algorithms: calculation of intrinsic and mutual resistances; calculation of current distribution, that is, determination of currents in the branches of the network; calculation of voltages in all nodes of the power supply system; calculation of power flow distribution in order to subsequently identify power losses and electric energy consumption. (Conclusions) It was shown that the derived universal calculation expressions can also be used for equivalence purposes. It was revealed that the proposed method and the algorithms implementing it are relatively easy to program and provide the necessary speed and accuracy of calculations; they are designed to solve practical problems related to the design and operation of complex closed power supply systems, increasing their reliability and efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological changes accompanied by rapid market changes have made it increasingly difficult for SMEs to develop their business in the future. Today, many organizations are shifting to e-procurement as an integrated supply chain support function to achieve strategic business goals. E-procurement or electronic procurement and supply chain Innovation have allowed for more flexibility in responding to market changes and improving the performance of the company's supply chain. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the implementation of e-procurement and supply chain innovation on the supply chain performance of SMEs in Indonesia. The method used in this study is a quantitative survey method using structural equation modeling (SEM) and partial least squares (PLS) with data processing tools, namely SmartPLS 3.0 software. Respondents in this study were 390 employees of SMEs in Indonesia determined by the simple random sampling method. The research data was obtained through an online questionnaire distributed through social media. From the results of the analysis, it can be concluded that the implementation of e-procurement has a significant effect on supply chain performance. Supply Chain Innovation has also a significant influence on SMEs supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

As with other aspects of social life thrown into disruption amid the global health, economic and environmental downturn, the early weeks of the pandemic seemed to offer the hope of transformative possibility, a “portal” towards different food systems. The time seemed ripe for the kinds of radical transitions that social movements and peasants’ organizations have requested for decades: subverting the “conventional” food system without going back to “corporate normality”. However, when the multiple crises are characterized as exceptional rather than structural, a narrative of emergency and urgency is deployed to reinforce the power of the incumbents. The overlap between the pandemic and the climate crisis can be an opportunity, but hardly for peasants and indigenous people. As in Naomi Klein’s <jats:italic>Shock Doctrine</jats:italic>, corporate actors and billionaire philanthropists are using the rhetoric of urgency to push for changes that reinforce the status quo and do not address the root causes that have brought us here. In order to spark debate and reflections, my contribution engages with one example of ongoing co-optation of the state of climate and sanitary emergency: the 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit as a new food policy arena where decisions are distanced from peasants, indigenous communities and citizens and put in the hands of corporations, financial investors and billionaire philanthropists.</jats:p>"

This study first introduces the different kinds of main emergency electric power sources and analyses their advantages and disadvantages. The battery of an electric vehicle as a new potential emergency power source is introduced that can also avoid the loss caused by unexpected power failure. Finally, three different EPS methods are explained in detail for different emergency occasions. Among them, the energy router is reviewed comprehensively considering it is the most potential emergency power distribution approach in the future because of its various applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recreation opportunities exist as a system at multiple scales and are offered by a variety of recreation providers sometimes with different goals and objectives. Incremental and disparate planning across providers can lead to mismatched supply and demand and inefficient use of resources. Furthermore, traditional recreation supply and demand studies have not systematically considered compatible benefits from conserving recreation lands including demand for and provision of biodiversity and wildlife conservation, ecosystem services, human health, and environmental justice issues.Historically, the supply of outdoor recreation and conservation lands was assembled by different state and federal agencies, counties and municipalities, Native American tribes, non-governmental organizations, or private organizations for the lands they directly managed with little systematic coordination. A national level Protected Area Databased (PAD-US) developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Gap Analysis Project is changing this. It is the official, publicly available, and comprehensive spatial inventory of every park and protected area in the US. The PAD-US program has developed a standardized data set with consistent protocols and methodologies for data collection for continuous updates.Demand assessments are currently conducted by various federal and state agencies, industry associations, and academics. These studies are independently conducted at various levels form recreation site, across land ownership, by activity, or state and national studies. Initiated in 1960, what became the National Survey of Recreation and the Environment (NSRE) collected recreation demand data for analysis at state and national levels. Many recreation planners used this data until it was discontinued in 2014. While there has been coordination and systemization and standardization of recreation supply data collection, no similar actions have occurred for demand.Following the PAD-US, we identify opportunities to coordinate, standardize, and systematize the collection of demand data across agencies, ownerships, and scales. We propose a parallel publicly available National Recreation Demand Database (NRDD) with consistent protocols and methodologies to be the comprehensive and authoritative inventory of recreation demand. We suggest that a new National Survey on People and the Environment (NSPE) be developed to replace the NSRE to collect improved data on outdoor recreation, other resource uses, and compatible benefit demand information.</jats:p>"

The Supply Chain Management (SCM) plays an important role in achieving potential cross-company success because the SCMS allows us to control the development, design, management and identification of the most effective and efficient inputs, information and other resources required to complete the project. An effective SCMS is of essential importance for the strength of the competition and for the success of the entire organization. Therefore, the competitive advantage in this new environment no longer depends on the company's performance, but also on the entire supply chain partners, including competitors. The main objective of this research is to conduct the relationship between the supply chain management system, project success, project performance, to identify, and to determine the potential impact of SCM on project completion and success. In this study, a random sample was drawn from a population made up exclusively of construction companies, and project departments from other companies in Amman, the capital of Jordan. As a tool for data collection, we chose a questionnaire. Based on this, many statistical analyzes were carried out and the hypotheses of this study were tested. As a result of this test, we found out that in general there is a clear and positive relationship between supply chain management and project completion. The dimensions of supply chain management (knowledge, skills, and tools) have different effects on the project closure process. The knowledge dimension has the strongest effect.</jats:p>"

Firms controlling these resources hold excessive power over others. This study adopted resource dependence theory as a theoretical lens to explore the role of relationship power in supply chain sustainability practices between a South African private healthcare provider and its suppliers. The study employed a generic qualitative single-case study design. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 12 participants at various levels of the case organisation’s hierarchy. The main findings revealed several types of environmental and social practice used in the supply chain of the private healthcare provider. Some of the environmental practices were effective waste management and recycling, while the social practices included supplier selection and periodic reviews. The healthcare provider exercised extensive power over its suppliers to implement these practices. By exploring the advantages and disadvantages of sustainability practices, the findings showed that relationship power acted as a driver of supply chain sustainability. Mutual commitment, continuous communication, and training support these practices. Healthcare managers must be aware of the importance of relationship power for supply chain sustainability practices implementation, and are advised to invest time and effort in building buyer—supplier relationships to aid sustainability. This study expands the literature on relationship power in supply chain sustainability practices in an underexplored developing country healthcare context.

What is more, AFNs are often characterized by their ‘sustainability promise’ – or the idea that their networks foster social, ecological or environmental improvements over conventional food networks. Based on a purposive sample of 286 producers across five Swedish AFNs (i.e. community supported agriculture, REKO-rings, farmers’ markets, farm stores and food nodes), we explore how differences in how supply chain activities are managed and relate them to profitability, fair wages, cooperation, logistics efforts, happiness and future beliefs. Using a combination of correlation analysis, linear regression and means comparisons, we challenge the notion that AFNs achieve their sustainability promise or enhance value through novel combinations of supply chain activities. Our findings include several key differences in how supply chain management (SCM) activities are organized across AFNs and their variant importance for profitability. Moreover, we find significant differences in happiness across AFNs that are better explained through beliefs about the future than profitability or fair wages. By exploring happiness and profitability, we offer insights into why some AFN actors thrive despite poor economic returns.</jats:p>",

Compared with traditional ventilation strategy, IAJS system creates heterogeneous conditions around the occupants, which complicates the relationship between thermal sensation and thermal comfort. The effect of different intermittent cycles on the thermal comfort of occupants needs to be further discussed. In addition, it is necessary to investigate whether IAJS system can play a better role in hot and humid summer conditions in China. Experiments were conducted in a chamber with two rows of seated occupants. Twelve cases were designed, including different combinations of room air temperatures (24°C, 26°C and 28°C) and intermittent period (start 90 s stop 90 s, start 3 min stop 1.5 min, start 1.5 min stop 3 min and start 3 min stop 3 min). Twelve subjects were recruited for subjective investigations. The subjects performed sedentary work and wore summer clothing. Subjective responses to the thermal environments were collected. Wind speed, temperature and CO2 concentration in the occupied area were measured. The results show that IAJS has a potential to be used as a primary ventilation system primary ventilation system such as classrooms in China. When the indoor air was set between 24°C and 26°C, IAJS could create a thermal climate that made the occupants thermally neutral.

The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is used to cyclical downturns, but the speed and strength with which COVID-19 has struck are unprecedented. Projects are being delayed or canceled. Supply chains are under threat. National and International policies are being revamped to deal with the transformed landscape. In 2019, the USA receives more than 530 thousand metric tons of steel from Russia, Germany, Italy, Canada, Mexico, and other such countries. The US building industry is dependent largely on other countries for the supply of raw materials, which make the construction industry at risk due to trade restrictions that have ensued in the post COVID world. One way to deal with such a changing environment is to diversify the dependence portfolio in supply chains to reduce shocks. The other alternative is to look to build an inventory based on predictive analytics. This research aims to implement the two reactionary measures of portfolio diversification and inventory infrastructure development by leveraging predictive analytics and big data. The project will be mainly divided into three phases – PHASE 1 will be mainly focused on the gathering of the relevant manufacturer and supplier data of construction materials both within and external to geographical borders of the USA. PHASE 2 will focus on the selection and integration of algorithms with the live database that has been created in phase 1. PHASE 3 will be devoted to the creation of custom-made user interfaces for the project owners. This phase will also focus on the automation of live reports, notifications,s, etc. to be sent to project owners. The deep learning algorithms would need continuous feedback and improvement to increase their credibility and reliance on a continuous basis. Thus, it will help to reduce the risks generated through uncertainties by developing a resilient smart responsive database that will provide stockholders accurate data and predictions in response to the market and industry behavior.</jats:p>"

Several types of existing generators are considered and the structural similarity with the proposed prototype is described in detail, as well as a number of fundamental shortcomings.The result of the development was the creation of a system with increased vertical force of the magnetic suspension with its mechanical transmission to the wind turbine, minimizing the pulsations of the vertical forces of the magnetic suspension and reducing scattering fluxes and simplifying the manufacture and repair of windings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobility as a Service (MaaS) gilt als alternatives Mobilitätskonzept zur privaten PKW-Nutzung. Da die Covid-19-Pandemie das Mobilitätsverhalten beeinflusst, wirkt sie sich auf die Verbreitung und Entwicklung von MaaS aus. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es, den Einfluss der Corona-Pandemie auf die Bereitschaft zur Nutzung von MaaSAngeboten zu untersuchen. Methodisch greift dieser Beitrag hierzu auf eine Online-Befragung von 245 potenziellen MaaS-Nutzern aus Deutschland zur persönlichen Einschätzung dieses Konzepts vor und während der Pandemie zurück. Die Pandemie hat vor allem zu Beginn das Mobilitätsverhalten und damit die MaaS-Nutzung stark beeinflusst. Insgesamt hatte sie für die Mehrheit der Befragten eher geringen Einfluss auf die MaaS-Nutzungsbereitschaft, doch bei etwa einem Drittel ist die Nutzungspräferenz gesunken. Einflussfaktoren wie z. B. die Angst vor Ansteckung in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln oder eine geringere Mobilitätsnachfrage könnten die veränderten Präferenzen erklären. Für die Praxis bedeuten die Ergebnisse dieser explorativen Studie, dass bestehende Projekte offensiv weiter beworben werden sollten, um in einer Phase des Übergangs von der pandemischen zur endemischen Situation grundsätzliche Befürworter von MaaS zurückzugewinnen.</jats:p>"

Firstly, through principal component analysis, the location characteristics and divergence characteristics of multiple related performance responses were transformed into the principal component comprehensive score of supply chain performance; secondly, the Kriging metamodels of location characteristics and divergence characteristics of multiple performance responses were constructed respectively, and the principal component comprehensive score model of comprehensive performance based on Kriging meta-model was constructed. Thus the optimal operating conditions by optimizing the constructed robust optimization strategy were obtained in order to realize the robust optimization of supply chain system with correlated multiple responses. Finally, a supply chain simulation case was given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimization method, and the robustness of different methods was also discussed. The comparison results showed that our proposed was more robust.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to analyse the social perceptions of the supply and demand sides of CES in Dhaka City. A questionnaire-based social preference method was used. Questions in the survey concerned the respondents' satisfaction with green spaces, connected activities, limitations, CES preference and motivation. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the 405 surveyed questionnaire data to understand variation in respondents' opinions. Respondents were mostly dissatisfied with the quantity of green spaces. Respondents' family status and age influenced their satisfaction with green space quantity. Single and teenage respondents prefer green space for active recreational activities, whereas young and old respondents preferred passive kinds of recreational activities. Both space-related issues and respondents' barriers limited CES provisioning. This contextual factor particularly affected female, single and young respondents. Respondents most preferred CES was recreation. Respondents' gender, family status and age are drivers for differing perceptions of the green space-based CES. To develop sustainable city planning in the face of global environmental change, those divergent perceptions should be taken into consideration through urban development strategies. Moreover, understanding the supply and demand sides of CES help facilitate a more inclusive planning process to address urban sustainability issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: This paper investigates how counterfeits influence a global supply chain and how the supply chain should effectively take anticounterfeit actions. Academic/practical relevance: The impacts of counterfeiting have been increasingly profound on global supply chains. It is critical to understand how counterfeiting impacts supply chains when supply chain members act in their own interests, and how supply chains can effectively combat counterfeiting when all the members can contribute to it. This is the first paper that offers insights into these important questions. In particular, we examine who among the supply chain members is in the best position to perform counteracting activities, how these members can cooperate in anticounterfeiting, and what economic implications the anticounterfeit actions have to the supply chain, individual firms, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Methodology: We consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, and analyze a game-theoretical framework to derive the equilibrium. Results: The manufacturer prefers to induce the retailer to combat counterfeits rather than to combat itself. Contrary to conventional wisdom, counterfeits can increase the supply chain’s profit even in the absence of network externality effects. The crux is that the manufacturer lowers wholesale price to incentivize the retailer’s counteraction and, consequently, the threat of counterfeits can mitigate double marginalization and benefit the supply chain. Managerial implications: Our results demonstrate that a sustainability risk can trigger collaborative endeavors of supply chain members and thus be advantageous to the supply chain. The findings also underscore the important role that retailers should play in anticounterfeiting. Particularly, it can be in the supply chain’s interest that the manufacturer does not execute the counteraction, either jointly with the retailer or by itself. </jats:p>",

Demirin dayanıklı olması ve erişilebilirliğinin yüksek olması onu tersaneler açısından vazgeçilmez bir ihtiyacı haline getirmiştir.\n                        Demirin binlerce yıl öncesinden beri insanoğlu tarafından bilinip işleniyor olması bu alanda uzmanlaşmanın yaygınlık kazanmasını sağlamıştır. Demiri işleyen demirciler demire duyulan ihtiyaca paralel olarak tersanelerin nitelikli\n                        işgücü arasındaki yerlerini almıştır. Ham demiri ayrı ayrı kazalardan toplayarak tersanelerde kullanıma hazır hale getirmek ciddi bir organizasyonu gerekli kılmaktadır. İşin hammadde, emek, nakliyat, bütçe, personel ve dağıtım\n                        gibi unsurlarını planlayarak birbirini tamamlayan ve devamlı çalışan bir sistem kurmak lazımdır. Bu sistemin denetim mekanizmasını oluşturmak ve yasal alt yapısını meydana getirmek aynı derecede önemli olan hususlardır. Bu konuların\n                        üstesinden gelebilmek ise ciddi bir organizasyon bilgisi ve becerisi gerektirir. Osmanlı Devleti’nde ham demirin temin edildiği kazalar genelde Balkan coğrafyasında yer almaktadır. Burada bulunan Samakov, Filipe, Sofya, Tatarpazarı\n                        ve Demirhisar gibi kazalar ham demir üretimiyle ön plana çıkmışlardır. Devlet bu kazalardaki ahaliden talep ettiği ham demiri, genelde ocaklık usulü ile toplamakta ve kara yolu vasıtasıyla Varna, Selanik, Kavala ve Tekirdağı gibi\n                        iskelelere taşımaktadır. Daha sonra ise gemilerle bu demiri, İstanbul’da yer alan Tersane-i Âmirede depolamaktadır. Burada depolanan demir gerek İstanbul’da inşa edilen gemiler için gerekse İstanbul dışında inşa edilen gemiler\n                        için sarf edilmektedir.18.yüzyılda kalyon teknolojisine geçiş, diğer gemi inşa ve donatım malzemelerinde olduğu gibi ham demire olan ihtiyacı artırmıştır. Kalyonların klasik Osmanlı savaş gemilerine kıyasla daha büyük olması onların\n                        küçük tonajlı diğer gemilere kıyasla daha fazla ham demir tüketmesine neden olmuştur. Bu ise önceki yüzyıllardan beri devlete ham demir temin eden kazaların yükünü artırmıştır. Olumsuz iktisadi koşulların da etkisiyle bu durum\n                        bazen ham demir konusunda ahalinin şikâyette bulunmasına neden olmuştur.

Due to the dichotomous nature of the traditional theoretical approaches, this study utilizes Mattli’s demand-supply approach to reconcile the role played by market factors and politics, specifically actors and institutions, for seeking deeper integration. Mattli contends that the demand condition is mainly supported by market players and big businesses with larger economic interests while the supply condition is provided by an ‘undisputed leader’ and “commitment institutions”. He underscored that the combination of these two sets of conditions will mainly contribute to a successful regional integration process. However, this paper argues that ASEAN’s inability to satisfy both conditions does not automatically translate to the region’s eventual failure in seeking deeper levels of integration.</jats:p>"

The main objectives of this research are (1) to establish the main risks posed by COVID-19 to the existing supply chains established by multinational manufacturers in the UK, and (2) to evaluate whether multinational manufacturing businesses in the UK can learn from challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic by referring to the concept of supply chain resilience and (3) to provide practical recommendations to multinational manufacturers in the UK on how the key impacts of COVID-19 could be overcome and leveraged as a source of new knowledge in the area of supply chain management. The posed objectives were realized via the mixed methods research strategy involving a quantitative survey and its triangulation with the results of qualitative interviews conducted with managers of such organizations. We used two different data collection channels (1) LinkedIn and (2) Reddit. Our data set was constructed with 12 questionnaires and three interviewers. Using these data sets, our findings strongly suggest that the seven identified risk dimensions influenced the supply chain integrity of these companies both before and after the global COVID-19 pandemic. It could be attributed to the insular state of the UK and other macro-environmental factors limiting the procurement capabilities of local firms. However, most of these dimensions were severely affected by the pandemic, demonstrated by both the performed Friedman tests and the statements voiced by the interviewees. While some mitigation strategies were cited as relatively effective for addressing the emerging risks, most of the respondents noted that the systemic nature of encountered problems and their magnitude made it difficult for individual companies to avoid, mitigate, or transfer these risks.</jats:p>"

Moreover, Lean principles, with the aim of reducing wastes, could be one of the main research streams in SC in recent years. Therefore, it is valuable to figure out the mutual effects of Lean principles and digital technologies as two growing areas in SC. Previous works did not pay attention to investigating this relationship at the SC level and were more focused on the production level. However, the present work addresses this issue by conducting a multi-perspective Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Additionally, in the present SLR, the impact of individual Industry 4.0 technologies in relation to Lean principles was investigated from various SC perspectives. The results reveal the necessity of studying single SC processes in Lean Digital SC. Moreover, the applicability of each technology should be illustrated to alleviate SC operational and organizational issues. The results provide useful insights about applying single digital technologies as well as a combination of them to each SC process to solve specific issues.</jats:p>"

This was done by using 3 objectives that became themes for data collection in the literature review section. Additionally, this study took into account the secondary technique by gathering data from Google Scholar, which provided useful peer-reviewed journal papers. These stated that applications of big data encompass information technology administration, manufacturing, sales, HRM operations, and business organisation across sectors like healthcare, tourism and retail. All of these industries require a great deal of information handling and handling at different levels in order for it to be categorised and processed for each individual within the business for efficient use. The phases of research, data collecting, documentation, insertion, preparing, data evaluation, publication and communication, keeping information, and data repurposing are all used to explain big data administration. Businesses determine target markets and make service and goods recommendations by using and analysing consumer behavioural data.</jats:p>"

The paper also analyses the influence of the farmers’ investment capacity on their own performance and how that performance in turn influences the investment requirements demanded by buyers. We developed a structural equation model applied to a sample of 199 farmers including piglet farmers (n=91) and finishers (n=108) working under production contracts. The model includes two constructs that assess performance – financial performance and production and quality performance. The results show that buyer support positively influences both performance constructs and investment requirements for piglet farmers and finishers. The relationship between buyer support and investment capacity was significant only in the sample of finishers. Farmers’ investment capacity positively influences both performance constructs in the sample of piglet farmers. For finishers, investment capacity influences only financial performance. Moreover, only production and quality performance of finishers influences investment requirements. The results provide buyers and farmers with insights for refinements in support policies and management.</jats:p>",

Data were gathered by a questionnaire distributed to managers from all levels in public universities. The questionnaire was developed based on related works on benchmarking. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed to the sample members and 167 questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 83.5%. The results indicated university internal assessment is the most influential reason for benchmarking success, followed by benchmarking benefits, benchmarking partner, top management support, and finally, employee participation. It was found that benchmarking competitors had no effect on benchmarking success. Therefore, universities are called for considering such reasons when heading for benchmarking. Researchers also are requested to validate such findings and to explore more reasons for benchmarking success.</jats:p>"

Thanks to their ability to perform challenging and hazardous tasks with high mobility, safety, and low cost. As academic researchers, we are concerned with commercial multi-rotor UAVs, which are revolutionizing many public services, including search and rescue operations, wireless coverage, delivery services, precision agriculture, wildlife surveys, and real-time surveillance. One of the UAVs main issues when it comes to mobility is the limited energy autonomy/endurance. Many types of power supplies can be implemented in UAVs, each with its specific strengths and shortfalls in terms of size, charging/discharging time, energy density and power density. This paper focuses on UAVs energy aspect, with a comprehensive review of the main power sources available for multi-rotors UAVs, and energy management systems to uncover gaps and provide further insights and guidelines for future research.</jats:p>"

The improved constructive scheme of the developed high - temperature air heater - heat generator with air heating for technological processes of drying is described. The main technical and operational advantages of the accepted scheme of heating of air which differs in high economy and reliability are noted. New technical solutions in the developed design of the TG heat generator are considered for the purpose of increase of its efficiency and reliability at long operation. The adoption of these decisions on the basis of laboratory and computational research is substantiated. The scheme of the fire stand on studying the process of heat removal from heat-stressed heating surfaces by radiation-convective heat transfer with the use of heat-absorbing screens is given. Designed cooling systems for heat pipes of heat generators are described on the basis of bench researches and the calculation model is developed. The calculated dependences of the change in the temperature of the metal of the heated walls on the velocity of the air flow in a single channel and on the width of the double air channel with a heat-absorbing screen are given. The results of calculation researches for the purpose of optimization of a convective surface of heating and entrance sites of chimneys in the form of dependences of change are shown: length of convective packages depending on speed of flue gases; temperature of gases, metal of walls and air on the initial section of chimneys at various options of its configuration. Patented technical solutions in the designs of industrially implemented high-temperature air heaters - gas heat generators TG-0.95-200, TG-1.9-200 and ТГ-2,4-200 with an air heating temperature of 200 oC have been implemented. Their high efficiency and reliability during many years of operation as a part of drying installations at the enterprises of the food industry of Ukraine, Belarus, the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland are confirmed.</jats:p>"

To minimize the undesirable effects of drought, there is a need to quantify and project the drought trend. In this research, the drought was estimated and projected using Standardized Supply-Demand-Water Index (SSDI) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Field meteorological data was used in which interpolated was conducted using kriging interpolation technique within ArcGIS environment. The results indicate those moderate, severe and extreme droughts at varying magnitudes as detected by the SSDI during 1972-2010 at different meteorological stations, with SSDI values equal or less than -2.0. In a spatial domain, the areas in south-eastern parts of the UTaRB exhibit the highest drought severity. Time-series forecasts and projection show that the best networks for SSDI exhibit respective ANNs architecture. The projected extreme droughts (values less than -2.00) and abundant water availability (SSDI values ³ 2.00) were estimated using Recursive Multi-Step Neural Networks (RMSNN). The findings can be integrated into planning the drought-mitigation-adaptation and early-warning systems in the UTaRB.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to evaluate and elucidate the outcomes of national policies on improving water supply management in rural Africa through a case study of Senegal. This case study examined the actual conditions of water supply facilities and residents’ water use in villages. I also attempted to identify the remaining challenges for sustainable water management by local communities. In summary, despite improvement in access to safe drinking water resources for rural populations in Senegal, the national policies were not completely successful. My findings highlight that improving water quality is as crucial as expanding water supply facilities in rural Africa. Meanwhile, for the sustainable self-management of water resources in rural Africa, the case study suggested the importance of local people’s transparent management, information sharing, and mutual aid. Rural residents in Africa have great potential to improve their current water environment through their own initiatives. This potential should be considered as a key to achieving the goal of sustainable water supply management in local communities.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a dual energy storage system (DESS) concept, based on a combination of an electrical (supercapacitors) and an electro-chemical energy storage system (battery), used separately depending on the required transport distance. Each energy storage unit (ESU) in this DESS is capable of supplying the AGV completely. The concept takes into account requirements for a complex material flow as well as minimizing the energy storage capacity required for the operation of the AGV. An energy flow analysis is performed and further used as a basis to derive three possible circuit concepts for the technical realization. The circuit concepts are compared to other approaches from related work, differentiating the functionality to hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). The functionality of the concepts was validated by mapping the energy flow states to active circuit components. Finally, an approach for implementing the control strategy as a state machine is given, and conclusions for further investigations are drawn.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable development and environmental preservation are now widely regarded as overriding imperatives for protecting the earth from human activity. For organisations facing competitive, regulatory, and community challenges, balancing economic and environmental performance has become increasingly crucial. The number of organisations incorporating environmental principles into their strategic goals and operations is steadily growing. Environmental concerns about supply chain management are becoming more prevalent now as a result of a wider debate about how industry should address the issues of sustainability. Stakeholder pressures made it challenge for supply chain managers to integrate sustainable practices into their supply chain management. Green supply chains aim to reduce resource and energy consumption as well as pollution emissions, all in the pursuit of a socially responsible firm that balances economic, social, and environmental benefits. Environmental performance is integrated into the enterprise's internal and external management in green supply chain management, which is not the case in traditional supply chains. Hence, performance measurement benefits the green supply chain management process by stabilizing it and providing chances for improvement. However, developing performance measures for the green supply chain is a difficult task. Internal and external processes must both be assessed when it comes to green supply chain management. Thus, conducting an empirical study on the performance of green supply chain management is critical. In this backdrop, the present study examines the performance of green supply chain management in small and medium enterprises. The study is empirical and uses a survey method. For the study, the researchers employed both primary and secondary data sources. The research begins with the gathering of secondary data about small and medium-sized enterprises. Books, reports, journals and periodicals, websites, and other sources of secondary data were used. A questionnaire was used to obtain primary data from small and medium manufacturing enterprises. Analysis of one-way variance, student t test, analysis of co-efficient of variation, and percentage analysis were used to study the performance of green supply chain management. The paper suggests suitable measures for effective green supply chain management in small and medium enterprises.</jats:p>"

The study discusses the impact of the benchmarking mechanism on the decision-making of the electricity supply chain enterprises. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Investing in carbon abatement technology increased electricity demand, customer surplus, and profits of the electricity supply chain enterprises. (2) Carbon abatement technology investment and profits of the supply chain enterprises increased with the unit carbon quota.

Improving the service level of presales service will increase service costs and reduce profits, but it can also increase the demand for products. The change in market demand under the influence of services will result in a series of chain reactions, such as changes in supply chain inventory costs and distribution costs. Thus, this paper considers the changes in the product service supply chain (PSSC) network caused by changes in presale service levels and service prices from the overall perspective of the supply chain and chooses a reasonable service level and price so that service integrators and product suppliers in PSSCs can achieve a win-win situation while meeting customer needs. First, a PSSC network optimization model is established considering the presale service level and price. Then, a double-layer nested genetic algorithm with constraint reasoning is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, by calculating the PSSC case of a building material company that produces a water mist spray system for ships, the feasibility and practicability of the algorithm was verified.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Off-site construction is becoming more popular as more companies recognise the benefits of shifting the construction process away from the construction site and into a controlled manufacturing environment. However, challenges associated with the component supply chain have not been fully addressed. As a result, this study proposes a model for three-echelon supply chain supply management in off-site construction with stochastic constraints. In this paper, multiple off-site factories produce various types of components and ship them to supplier warehouses to meet the needs of the construction sites. Each construction site is directly served by a supplier warehouse. The service level for each supplier warehouse is assumed to be different based on regional conditions. Because of the unpredictable nature of construction projects, demand at each construction site is stochastic, so each supplier warehouse should stock a certain number of components. The inventory control policy is reviewed regularly and is in (R, s, S) form. Two objectives are considered: minimising total cost while achieving the desired delivery time for construction sites due to their demands and balancing driver workloads during the routeing stage. A grasshopper optimisation algorithm (GOA) and an exact method are used to solve this NP-hard problem. The findings of this study contribute new theoretical and practical insights to a growing body of knowledge about supply chain management strategies in off-site construction and have implications for project planners and suppliers, policymakers, and managers, particularly in companies where an unplanned supply chain exacerbates project delays and overrun costs.</jats:p>"

This paper reveals that applying the requirements of IEC 61869-2:2012 standard, which determines the worst combination of series of unfavorable factors for current transformers in transient mode, can influence a serious impact on the correct operation of relay protection based on current, reactance or differential principle of action. Saturation of the current transformer can lead to both negative results: false operation of relay protection devices and their failure.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSION. According to the results of the study, it was determined that the presence of a DC component in the primary short-circuit current has the greatest effect on the protection operation. The delays in the restoration of the RMS value of the short-circuit current reached up to 0.3 seconds, which is comparable with the response time of the second protection zones for microprocessor-based relay protection devices. The DC component of the primary current and the presence of residual magnetic induction of the current transformer provides the largest content of the magnetization current, the largest angular error and also the largest content of the second harmonic component in the secondary short-circuit current.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the study aimed at identifying the causes of road traffic, assess the effect of road traffic on supply chain performance, examine the effect of road traffic on customer service and assess the effect of road traffic on productivity. The study employed explanatory design of the quantitative approach. Employees of Kwasi Oppong Company Limited were target where 50 of them were selected using simple random sampling technique. Questionnaire was administered to the respondents and the data was analysed descriptively. The study found that road traffic is caused mainly by poor road network/narrowness of road, driving behaviour of drivers, concentration of economic activities in an area, encroachment of roads by residents and street vendors, unauthorized parking vehicles on the roads as well as breakdowns of vehicles on the road. Road traffic affect supply chain performance of Kwasi Oppong Company Limited by making its strategies for marketing strong, very competitive in the market, increase market share comparatively. However, it increased transportation cost, increase prices of goods and service though customer base is not affected. Road traffic increase the price of goods and services, road traffic affect customer satisfaction, cost of transportation is increased and customer complaints are addressed on time as well as customer base is increased despite the incidence of road traffic. Road traffic affect productivity of positively. It increased sales of organization, increase return on investment and market share. Nevertheless, it increased operating costs of vehicles, costs of delays on raw materials. Therefore, it was recommended that Kwasi Oppong Company Limited should maintain or improves upon its strategic management in order to be highly competitive and increase in market share. Also, Kwasi Oppong Company Limited should adopt proper transportation planning and management in order to reduce transportation cost, cost of goods and services and operational cost. Moreover, Kwasi Oppong Company Limited should adopt different time aside peak and rush hours for delivery of goods and services in order to improve upon its service quality and customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

Improper supply chain design can undermine an organization's strategy, lead to lower revenues, less competitiveness, market share and profits. As product lines and markets change or expand, the design or redesign of supply chains becomes an even more critical issue. The risks to which supply chains are exposed are different, and their functioning can be disrupted by a number of situations, which have had serious global consequences in the past. In addition to wars, nuclear accidents, cataclysmic earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, explosions, fires and tsunamis, epidemics of SARS, MERS, HIV, Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as the latest Covid-19 pandemic, have led to the knowledge that humanity is powerless in the face of such catastrophes. Regardless of the achievements in science, extensive and long-term medical research, epidemics (pandemics) have taken millions of lives and had negative effects on society as a whole, but also on the efficiency of business and supply chains. Past epidemics have attracted the attention of scientists and industry experts, resulting in the need to reengineer organizations and adjust supply chains to future challenges. In the context of the current pandemic, serious disturbances have been reported, so a large number of industries have had unprecedented consequences. Responses to such epidemics suggest that global supply chains need to be more integrated and digitally ready. Digitization of supply chains could improve the quality of responses to epidemic-related disorders by increasing their flexibility in such circumstances. This paper identifies the most important disruptions and measures to mitigate the consequences of these disruptions in global supply chains, as well as risk management in conditions of uncertainty.</jats:p>"

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, global industries that were unprepared for disruptions experienced a decline due to the pandemic. A global supply chain is a complex system set of dynamics that could be analyzed by the system dynamics approach. In this article, the impact of the recent pandemic on the global supply chain is simulated in different scenarios. A system dynamic model is developed to carry out the simulations. In order to consider the impact of the pandemic on the exogenous and endogenous variables, a force majeure factor is defined in the model. Global features considered in this article are the export and import operations, the exchange rate and the rate of tariff. In this article, a scenario analysis is performed to analyze two important factors of the global supply chain: force majeure factor and delivery delay. Results showed that improving the flexibility of production capacity is one of the important strategies that global supply chain managers should pursue. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: F23, P45, C15, C63, E37, F17 </jats:p>",

Doch wie kam es zu dieser „Toilettenpapier-Krise“ und wie lange würde sie anhalten? Dieser Beitrag beschreibt eine retrospektive Einschätzung, wie sich bereits März 2020 der weitere Krisenverlauf abschätzen ließ. Anhand des im Supply Chain Management wohlbekannten Bullwhip-Effekts lassen sich Nachfrageschocks und die Auswirkungen auf die verschiedenen Stufen von Supply Chains analysieren. Im Falle der Toilettenpaper-Krise waren die Gründe für das Nachfragesignal für alle Institutionen offensichtlich. Es war also von Anfang an nicht von einem Bullwhip-Effekt zu sprechen: Der tatsächliche Toilettenpapier-Verbrauch ist langfristig konstant, was ein Aufschaukeln der Nachfrageschwankungen verhinderte.</jats:p>"

By establishing the centralized, manufacturer-led, and retailer-led CLSC models, we analyze the equilibrium solutions of channel players and the government. We obtain the following results. (1) The manufacturer can accept a higher collection target and exit the market later in the centralized model than in decentralized decision-making models. Moreover, the manufacturer exists the market earlier in the retailer-led model with regulation compared with the manufacturer-led model. (2) The government's optimal collection target is the same under manufacturer-led and retailer-led models when the regulation comes into force. (3) Revenue-sharing and two-part tariff contracts can effectively coordinate manufacturer-led and retailer-led CLSCs under take-back legislation. Finally, we conduct several numerical examples and obtain relevant managerial insights. Our results indicate that the correlation between take-back legislation and channel structure has a significant impact on the pricing and coordination decisions of the CLSC; furthermore, the government should flexibly set the collection target when facing different supply chain and channel power structures in a CLSC.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The unreliable manufacturer delivers a percentage of the ordered quantity to the retailer, which causes shortages. At the same time, the retailer provides wrong information regarding the amount of the sales of the product. Besides intelligent technology, a single setup multiple unequal increasing delivery transportation policy is applied in this study to reduce the holding cost of the retailer. A consumed fuel and electricity-dependent carbon emission cost are used for environmental sustainability. Since the industries face problems with smooth functioning in each of its steps for unreliable players, the study is proposed to solve the unpredictable player problem in the supply chain. The robust distribution approach is utilized to overcome the situation of unknown lead time demand. Two metaheuristic optimization techniques, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to optimize the total cost. From the numerical section, it is clear the PSO is $ 0.32 $ % more beneficial than GA to obtain the minimum total cost of the supply chain. The discussed case studies show that the applied single-setup-multi-unequal-increasing delivery policy is $ 0.62 $ % beneficial compared to the single-setup-single-delivery policy and $ 0.35 $ % beneficial compared to the single-setup-multi-delivery policy. The sensitivity analysis with graphical representation is provided to explain the result clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

About one-third of all food produced for humans are either lost or wasted causing increased food insecurity and immense economic and social costs. In a world where famine has been an alarming issue, any action to reduce food loss and waste (FLW) is crucial. This chapter reviews, from a sustainable supply chain perspective, the extant literature on food supply chains and discusses FLW issues, especially within the context of sustainable consumption of fruits and vegetables. A framework for sustainable food supply chains (SFSCs) from both production and consumption ends are discussed. In doing so, such current disruptive intelligent technologies as blockchain and the internet of things are emphasized as potential enablers for SFSCs. Mainly driven by consumers' awareness of the pressing issues in the world and consumption behaviour, mitigating FLW in SFSCs would not only result in efficient land and water use but also positively impact climate change and livelihoods towards sustainable development. </jats:p>"

With the developed models, this research compares the total inventory cost of ownership and the number of suppliers for two supply chain management scenarios. Further, a third model (hybrid cost model) was established where spare parts are supplied partially by traditional manufacturing and partially by 3D printing according to maximize cost savings. The cost analysis from the three models concludes that the mixed model shows the best outcome for simplifying supply management complexity and ultimately reducing total cost of spare parts inventory.

By investigating the main factors affecting the priority of the supply of land used for transportation, this paper evaluates the transportation condition of all cities in China from five aspects: dominance, dependence, coordination, accessibility, and land demand for transportation. Furthermore, this paper constructs a multi-objective decision support system for land supply, which aims to find out which cities are in urgent need of the supply of land for transportation and what types of transportation infrastructure need to be focused on. The results of this paper show that most of the cities with high land supply priority are non-provincial capital cities and are important growth poles of regional economic development. The construction of a comprehensive transportation system is the short-term goal of these cities. Most cities with low land supply priority are sparsely populated, in good ecological condition, and far away from the core areas of economic development. The preferred transportation mode of these cities is generally land transportation. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive decision support system for the land management department to determine land supply priorities and achieve the sustainable use of land.</jats:p>"

The design data of a motor yacht in its different operating modes are considered, as well as the energy mix related to the fuel consumption at shore supply of the yacht during its stay at the port. The use of modern technical systems for shore supply includes the application of specific frequency converters, through which compatibility between the different voltage standards and the frequency for different shore power supply systems is realized. The costs of onshore power, compared to those of marine fuel, can be calculated from the current prices of onshore electricity and the energy produced from its own generators. The analysis of the basic design data of the motor yacht and the assessment of the energy costs on board, fuel economy and emission reductions will provide a clear answer to the advantages of the power supply from the shore of the vessel.</jats:p>",

In a supply chain consisting of an e-tailer and third-party logistics (TPL), both the promotion effort of the e-tailer and the logistics service effort of TPL can affect the demand. Considering that logistics service contracts may be provided by the e-tailer or TPL, this study defines two different timing sequences. Three types of contracts, i.e., fixed-price, revenue-sharing, and cost-sharing contracts, are used to coordinate the supply chain. The game models under different timing sequences and different contract scenarios are established and solved. The promotion effort and logistics service effort under different scenarios are compared theoretically and numerically. The results indicate that both the promotion effort and logistics service effort change with timing sequences and contract types. The timing sequences depending on the contract provider significantly affect the performance of the supply chain. The cost-sharing contract provided by the TPL can motivate the e-tailer to apply the largest effort, and vice versa. The cost-sharing contract provided by the e-tailer can achieve the largest demand that is optimal for both the e-tailer and supply chain. However, the optimal contract for the TPL is conditional.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Based on the background of suppliers in intelligent manufacturing enterprises, the evaluation method of supplier efficiency was studied by using machine learning. In this paper, based on the traditional backpropagation (BP) neural network, combined with the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and on the basis of the supplier evaluation index system, the supplier efficiency evaluation model of intelligent manufacturing enterprises based on DPMPSO‐BP neural network is constructed. Through the collected sample data, the network is trained and simulated, and the results are analyzed. Finally, the designed model is applied to a large battery manufacturing enterprise, and the supplier efficiency evaluation method based on DPMPSO‐BP neural network is validated and analyzed. Compared with the traditional BP neural network method, the supplier efficiency evaluation method is effective and feasible.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the generalization of such experience and the processing of statistical data on the use of UAV units appears as a hyper-promising direction of scientific activity. Considering the dynamism and rapidity of military actions, as well as the need to adapt to the conditions of hostilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are constantly acquiring the ability to repel the offensive of the overwhelming forces of the aggressor by equipping units with weapons of the domestic military-industrial complex, weapons supplied by partners, volunteer forces and enterprises of the national economy, supplying civil models of UAVs to military units. Such supply requires generalization and reasoning for the purpose of equal distribution in accordance with the purpose of military formations (units). Considering the fact that the UAVs used are often not of purely military purpose and are classified according to a very wide range of characteristic features, it is advisable to highlight a number of principle features to generalize the experience. The work distinguishes four such categories: by the scale of the tasks to be solved; by flight duration; by radius of action; by type of control system. The authors determined that these characteristic features are decisive for the formation of a system of providing combat units with unmanned aerial vehicles. It is known that with the active use of the enemy's radio-electronic warfare and the imperfection of the technological implementation of the drones used, there are delays in the performance of flight tasks, which can directly or indirectly reduce the combat potential of combat units. The purpose of the work is to model the system for calculating the needs of units for the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles for the formation of a reasonable approach to the distribution of resources of armed formations of various purposes.</jats:p>"

The study borrowed annual time series data from the World Bank online secondary source for the period from 1971 to 2014. Empirical results revealed a positive statistically significant short run relationship and a negative statistically insignificant long run relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. The results further reveal that renewable electricity has a short run negative statistically significant and positive statistically significant long-run relationship with economic growth in South Africa. Based on empirical results, it can therefore be recommended that the policymakers should implement policies that promotes renewable electricity generation and evaluate policies on electricity consumption so that it can significantly boosts economic growth in the long run.</jats:p>"

Stackelberg game theory is used to construct four models, one with no carbon cap and three with a carbon cap respectively. And we get the equilibrium solutions of the degree of emission reduction, degree of promotion, sharing ratio, market demand, manufacturer and retailer profit of low-carbon products. Through comparative analysis, it is found that the MKM model is the optimal one in which the government implements carbon cap and carbon subsidy policies and the manufacturer shares the cost of low-carbon promotion. In this model, the degree of manufacturer’s emission reduction is positively correlated with the influence coefficient of low-carbon emission reduction, manufacturer’s marginal revenue, government unit subsidy for low-carbon emission reduction and the initial price of carbon trading. Meanwhile, it is negatively correlated with the government’s carbon emission quota, elastic coefficient of carbon emission quota and the cost coefficient of low-carbon emission reduction. The results are closely related to the government unit subsidies for low-carbon emission reduction and the government carbon allowances. The manufacturer is more willing to accept the MKM model only when they exceed a certain threshold. Finally, the validity of the models would be verified by a numerical example.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The framework of collaborative water governance (CWG) has been championed as a promising model for water management across the globe. China is a country confronted by serious water pollution and shortage problems. In recent years, many scholars and practitioners have turned to CWG as an effective model for water crisis management in China. However, the political nature of CWG and China’s Authoritarian Environmentalism is inherently conflictual, hence, the development of CWG in China poses a theoretical puzzle, i.e., how the bottom-up CWG model can coexist with the top-down Authoritarian Environmentalism in China’s water politics. To better understand this puzzle, this article explores CWG’s intertwinement with environmental authoritarianism through a case study of “safe water supply project” in 11 coal-mining villages in Shanxi province of North China. Drawing on fieldwork between 2019 and 2021 in H city of Shangxi province, this research shows that the central government’s pledge to provide safe water to every villager in rural China has not materialized so far. The dilemma of safe water supply in coal mining villages in H city shows that, on one side, the central government attempted to show its great will and commitment to providing safe water to everyone in rural China through an approach of environmental authoritarianism; while on the other side, the local governments tended to select the CWG model as a method for practical implementation as well as a blame avoidance strategy. Our study identifies five stakeholders in the villages’ safe water supply projects: the Department of Water Resources of the City Government, the Township Government, Coal Mining Enterprises, village cadres and villagers. The outcome of the safe water supply project in these villages is constrained by the transparency and trust deficit among stakeholders when facing cooperation and conflict management obstacles.</jats:p>"

Based on the survey of 208 retail consumers the proposed model was validated using variance-based structure equation modeling. Findings of the study emphasize the significant role of perceived security and privacy in developing trust, ease of use, and usefulness of blockchain-enabled systems. The relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude is mediated through perceived usefulness.

The present study was designed and conducted with the aim of comparative assessment of the vulnerability of a gas supply network to natural and technological threats. This descriptive-analytical and cross-sectional study was carried out in Tehran metropolis gas supply network including town board stations, gas supply, and distribution networks in 2019-2020. The study was based on the vulnerability analysis method including three factors of likelihood, severity of consequences, and the degree of preparedness for threats. Comparative vulnerability assessment in these three sections of the gas supply network was performed using IBM SPSS software v. 23.0. Out of eleven identified hazardous elements, the vulnerability index for three hazardous elements was estimated as a weak level threat; four hazardous elements as a medium level threat and the vulnerability index for four hazards were evaluated as a severe threat. The results of comparative vulnerability assessment based on three parts of gas supply network showed that the highest vulnerabilities related to the gas distribution network (133.66±24.63), gas supply network (115.0±35.35), and town board stations (79.49±68.51. In addition, the results of Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the vulnerability difference in these three sections was not significant (p&gt;0.05). The findings of the comparative assessment of vulnerability between   different parts of the gas supply network including town board stations (TBS), gas supply and distribution network indicated that the resilience of these parts is relatively low and requires special attention in order to reduce vulnerability in Tehran metropolis gas supply network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In response to rising public demand for corporate, industrial, and private expansion, as well as low- cost residential construction, Turkey's development sector has burst in recent decades, and the Turkish government has placed a significant focus on industry. As a result, a methodical approach is required to cut down on money, time and waste. In the building business, dealing with the problem appears to be critical. It is debatable whether Supply Chain Management), a concept that first appeared and progressed in the automobile manufacturing industry, where it has found success, is one of the reliable practices that could primarily be the remedy for the construction industry's dispute, time, and cost excess. According to the construction sector, supply chain management has a lot of promise for increasing project productivity. This method, however, has not been effective in many nations, notably in Turkey. The major purpose of this study is to evaluate and examine the SCM implementation process in the Turkish construction sector based on previous studies, with an emphasis on efficient building procurement and supply. This will be accomplished by a rigorous literature analysis that will distinguish the industry's flaws and strengths. The benefits of SCM application in the construction sector, hurdles to successful SCM implementation in the purchase and delivery of building materials, and elements that reinforce the implementation will all be part of our study's model framework.</jats:p>"

This induces competition among workers at a node to manage these two types of links within fixed constraints and creates bargaining to decide the optimal degree of both types of links at a node. We use the Nash security point to obtain the bargaining solution describing the optimal links. We reduce the carrying cost and ordering cost of inventory, which are contrary in their nature by introducing horizontal and vertical links, respectively.

Due to the complexity of the aerodynamics of the process, theoretical developments can not be used as a basis for calculating the design and efficiency of their operation. Because of this, a number of simplifications are allowed in the theoretical provisions, as a result of which the calculated data do not coincide with the experimental data.\n\nThe use of modern software products, which have great graphics capabilities, allows you to get new results in solving such problems in the form of high-quality graphic illustrations.\n\nThe aim of the study is to determine the motion of a material particle that enters the inner surface of a vertical cylinder with a given initial velocity.\n\nA number of simplifications were introduced in the calculations: air resistance, the effect of particles on each other, their size, etc. were not taken into account. Accompanying Frenet and Darboux triangles were used to find the trajectory.\n\nDifferential equations of motion of a material particle on the inner surface of a vertical cylinder are compiled. The equations are solved using the MatLab system.\n\nIt is established that the velocity of particles that fall on the inner surface of the cylinder decreases to a certain value, and then begins to increase. For specific conditions (coefficient of friction and radius of the cylinder), the value of the minimum speed to which the movement of particles is slowed down is approximately the same and does not depend on the value of the initial speed. This means that there is a minimum value of the initial velocity at which the particle will not slow down when it hits the surface of the cylinder. Since particles with different coefficients of friction at the initial stage of their movement on the cylinder are poorly scattered on its surface, for the effective operation of the cyclone you need to make an inlet window of sufficient size in the vertical direction.</jats:p>"

However, the city is encountering a rapid depletion of groundwater, and its groundwater-based water supply is at risk of failure. This study was carried out to analyze the groundwater depletion scenarios occurring from 1970 to 2019 in the city and to find suitable options to sustain its water supply. The trends in groundwater levels (GWLs) were quantified by the non-parametric Sen’s slope and their significances were assessed by the modified Mann-Kendall test. Contour maps of GWL were generated to develop the contemporary GWL scenario in the city. Key informant interviews (KIIs) with the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) officials, groundwater experts and researchers, in addition to semi-structured interviews with the DWASA consumers were conducted to assess current adaptation practices and to develop potential adaptation options. The effectiveness of the options was assessed by strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and the options were ranked through a normalization process of the weights given by the KIIs for future adaptabilities. The GWLs were found to be decreasing all over the city, varying from 0.6–2.4 m/year. The contour maps demonstrated that the groundwater of the central area had depleted more than the peripheral areas. The locations vulnerable to severe groundwater depletion were identified to be the Khilgaon, Sobujbagh, Motijheel, Dhanmondi, and Sutrapur areas and some parts of the Cantonment and Mirpur areas. Potential options identified were adopting more surface water treatment plants, rainwater harvesting, implementing a block tariff system, reducing non-revenue water, metering water consumption, and promoting public awareness. Spatially-varying adaptation strategies were also suggested for different zones. Some measures adopted by DWASA were not supported by the respondents.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, air-to-water heat pumps are in high demand, which, thanks to the high coefficient of heat conversion, reduce energy consumption and negative impact on the environment. The advantages of using a heat pump are safety, environmental friendliness, economy, and the fact that when using it, dependence on rising prices for natural energy sources is reduced. One of the main problems of the air-to-water heat pump is a decrease in productivity when the outside air temperature drops in winter. This paper analyzed the efficiency of air-to-water heat pump Mitsubishi Electric PUHZ-SHW230YKAR1 for providing a private house with heating, hot water supply and air conditioning. On the basis of the obtained results, graphs of the efficiency of the heat pump were constructed depending on the temperature of the environment and the coolant. The installation is able to generate heat at an external temperature of minus 28°C. The maximum heating temperature of the coolant is 60°C.</jats:p>"

In the  present study, the  method of grounded theory has been used to develop a  model.

The  sampling continued until the  saturation of categories using theoretical sampling  method.  The  research  data  were analysed  simultaneously with the  data collection during the  three stages of open, axial and selective coding.

T he  findings of this study suggest that managers must carefully consider all categories and subcategories identified in this study and have the  necessary and sufficient information about each item to implement the  green supply chain management successfully based on NPD in the  automotive industry. Moreover, this research indicates the  need to pay attention to green supply chain management based on the  development of new products in the  automotive industry.</jats:p>",

In the scientific work, the assessment of the food supply level of the region was carried out, using the example of the Saratov region. The authors have identified the dynamics of indicators characterizing the food security of the region: acreage, livestock and poultry population, cost of agricultural products produced, cost of importing food and agricultural raw materials. The production dynamics of certain types of products, their production and personal consumption, as well as losses by volume are considered. With the help of these indicators, the level of self-sufficiency of the Saratov region with food resources of its own production is determined. The dynamics of the staple food consumption and the diet compliance with the recommended norms in kilograms per person per year are considered. The consumption by residents of the Saratov region of such types of food as potato, meat and meat products, vegetables, milk and dairy products does not comply with scientifically established medical standards, which causes a high share of imported products in actual food consumption and threatens the food security of the region.</jats:p>",

Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technique has proved to be an efficient tool in drainage network delineation and update in morphological analysis. For detailed study, ASTER DEM was used for delineation of the watershed boundary, and GIS was used in evaluation of basic, linear, areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. The Tidi watershed occupies an area of 114.36 km2 with a dendritic drainage pattern. The study area is designated as fifth order basin and lower and middle order streams mostly dominate the basin with the drainage density value of 1.74 km/km2 which exhibits gentle to moderate slope terrain and medium dense vegetation. The mean bifurcation value of the watershed is 3.88 and the value varies from 2 to 4.14 which shows that the drainage network formed on homogeneous rocks when the influences of geologic structures on the stream network were negligible. An elongation ratio of 0.79 implies that the watershed is less elongated in shape. The results from the morphometric analysis of the watershed are very beneficial for developing and designing conservation structures of soil and water and watershed management measures.</jats:p>",

Existing studies, concentrated in business to consumer rather than inter-organisational contexts, have not undertaken the fine-grained assessments of statements needed to identify which aspects of reporting performance are particularly poor and the underlying reasons that need to be addressed by policy makers. In a novel design, this study utilises the ethical trade initiative assessment framework to evaluate the content of 95 UK government suppliers’ modern slavery statements. The findings suggest that in a modern slavery context, discovery challenges are more important than firms’ attitudes to disclosure. We contribute to the transparency literature through a model contrasting discovery costs and disclosure risks and by identifying the disclosure of <jats:italic>unknowns</jats:italic> as an additional relevant dimension of disclosure. We then discuss the model in relation to normativity theory to consider options through which the currently low legitimacy of the reporting governance regime can be enhanced and the intended norms established.</jats:p>",

The equilibrium solutions of the supplier's wholesale price and the retailer's order quantity are obtained under two financing strategies: supplier financing (SF) and supplier investment (SI). It is found that the supplier's risk aversion is a crucial factor affecting both parties' financing decisions, and the supplier should offer different financing strategies to the retailer based on his risk attitude and the profit-sharing coefficient. However, the retailer prefers SF regardless of the supplier's risk aversion. Taking bank credit financing as a basic model, the advantages of SF and SI have been investigated. A Pareto improvement region for the two finance strategies has been identified and some suggestions are provided for the supplier's optimal utility. Then we extend to the situation that both parties are risk-averse and use the financing cost-sharing mechanism to achieve centralized decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The mixed approach of both qualitative and quantitative data were used as research design to collect results from 121 respondents from 174 who were expected as sample size of the study by the use of simple random and stratified sampling techniques. Before, the actual process of data collection the researcher pre-tested the questionnaire survey and the key informant interview, which were used later for collecting data from the field. Thus, the quantitative data were analyzed using both descriptive as percentage distribution and inferential statistics represented by multiple linear regressions. Thus, the regression coefficients demonstrated that ?1 =.241, with p=0.002 &lt; 0.05 at sig. level of 5% which proves that IOP had a statistically positive and significant effect on the satisfaction of retailers; ?2 = .311 with p=0.001 &lt; 0.05 at a sig. level of 5% implying that ISM had a positive and statistical significant effect on satisfaction of retailers; and  ?1 = .402 with p= 0.000 &lt; 0.05 at a sig. level of 5% implying that IDM had demonstrated a positive and statistical significant effect on retailers’ satisfaction in IIL between 2016 and 2021. The respective coefficients further indicate that 24.1 %, 31.1% and 40.2% of the variability in retailers’ satisfaction can be attributed to inventory order processing, inventory storage management and inventory distribution management respectively. The research recommends IIL to adopt JIT inventory practices all the time to avoid inventory costs while retailers need to accurately forecast demand and make orders before they experience stock-outs which affects the supply chain. It is hoped that this study will encourage IIL to sustainably adopt inventory management activities that will continue to sustain their retailer satisfaction. The study may also motivate other researchers to conduct research covering the whole country in order to improve its reliability.

The results reveal environmental performance partially mediates the link between environmental strategy and financial performance. By considering the mediating effect, this study contributes to the literature by addressing the intervening mechanism of environmental performance on the inconclusive relationship between environmental strategy and financial performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as a disruptor to Britain’s beef and sheep supply chains. The assessment of COVID-19 impacts is based on the triangulation of farming and industry news reports, submissions to a government COVID-19 enquiry and interviews with industry experts. We find that livestock farming and farm services were least affected compared to processing, retailing, foodservice, or consumers. Primary and secondary processors continued to operate during the first COVID-19 lockdown but had to quickly become ‘COVID secure’. The most dramatic effect was the overnight closure of hospitality and catering and the redirection of supplies to the retail sector. This picture of a resilient British beef and sheep industry may also be conceptualised as relatively locked in and resistant to change. Red meat production is tied to the land it farms on and operates on 12–36-month production cycles, making it difficult to change trajectory if disruptions do not directly affect farming. Emerging changes in agricultural payments, trade post-Brexit, and societal and environmental pressures may well be the disruptors that have far-reaching impacts on the beef and sheep supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high fluctuations in the demand for medical supplies. Therefore, emergency medical supplies enterprises have faced challenges in decision making and need to consider more corporate social responsibility (CSR) in production. At the same time, the government needs to take considerable measures to support emergency medical supplies enterprises. As such, our paper researches the decision and coordination problems for emergency medical supply chain considering CSR with the government, manufacturer, and retailer. The manufacturer produces emergency medical supplies. It has additional production technological innovation efforts to improve supply efficiency and assume CSR. The retailer faces uncertain demands and is responsible for undertaking CSR to meet the demands. The government must implement a certain degree of subsidies to ease the impact of the pandemic on emergency medical supply chain enterprises. Meanwhile, our paper further explores the obligations of the economy, society, and efficiency of enterprises under the COVID-19 pandemic and the decision making of enterprises for the implementation of CSR. Based on the principle of maximizing social welfare, we discuss decentralized decision making (without government and with government) and centralized decision making, respectively. On this basis, our paper not only designs a wholesale price–cost sharing joint contract coordination mechanism but also proves that a joint contract can achieve supply chain coordination under certain conditions. Through the analysis, we observe: (1) Government subsidies can improve the enthusiasm of supply chain members to undertake CSR; (2) With the improvement of the retailer’s CSR level, the profits of supply chain members and overall performance have improved to a certain degree; (3) To improve supply efficiency and assume social responsibility, the manufacturer implements technological innovation investment. However, it will impose some burden on the manufacturer. Government subsidies allow the manufacturer to balance between social responsibility and its profit.</jats:p>"

The researchers conducted unstructured interviews with 41 industrialists and analyzed them via open-source coding and deducing reasoning. A questionnaire was developed by analyzing critical scientific literature and unstructured interviews. Empirical responses were taken from 202 industrial corporations. The structural analyses indicate that the effective execution of SSCM significantly improves firms’ operational and financial performance. The findings also provide detailed information about different components of SSCM, namely supply chain strategy (SCS), supply chain network design (SCND), organizational structure, and information system, and explain how it relates to the previous literature review by using a multivariate statistical analysis, followed by structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings of current research highlight the significant role of SSC in accelerating firms’ operational and financial performance and suggest that SSCM should be taken as a secondary strategy and must be integrated with the overall business strategy.</jats:p>"

There are some indirect causes like lead time, the number of echelons, and some direct causes of bullwhip effect such as rationing or price variation. Due to capacity constraints, retailers are forced to experience rationing of their demands. Fear of rationing usually gives rise to manipulable demand and hence increases the bullwhip effect. Moreover, if the retailer’s demand is price sensitive then it will cause price variation. The offerings of premium payment by retailers due to unfulfilled demand lure the supplier to extend his existing capacity and to allocate them more supply. In this paper, an attempt has been made to mitigate the impact of the bullwhip effect using a premium payment scheme. A technique has been coined that will help in reducing the bullwhip effect. The increased value of the supply chain on using a premium payment scheme is proof of the reduction of the bullwhip effect. Results are validated through numerical analysis.</jats:p>",

The cross-sectional data were collected from 185 manufacturing firms of Pakistan using a questionnaire, which was analyzed through structural equation modelling. In the current era, with the advent of Industry 4.0 technologies, there is emphasis on technology in every field. Organizations must acknowledge Industry 4.0 innovative contributions towards IGSCP and broaden their understanding as the literature on Industry 4.0 is still lacking and needs empirical investigation. The results indicated that Industry 4.0 has a positive and significant effect on IGSCPs. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that IGSCP practices have a positive nexus with economic and environmental performance. This research presents valuable insight for policymakers, manufacturers, and managers interested in promoting GSCM practices for improved economic and environmental sustainability. </jats:p>"

The energy optimization of a pumping station can significantly affect the energy consumption of a water utility. This article deals with the energy optimization of water pumping stations. The work assumes several variants of optimization of water supply pumping stations through changes in the water supply system, pressure changes in the pumping station, and modification of the number of pumps. After analyzing the network, conducting field tests, and creating a model of the water supply network, the network was calibrated in order to reproduce the existing water network as accurately as possible. Then, a variant analysis was performed, and the best optimization method for the pumping station was selected. In two variants, there was a decrease in electricity consumption; in three there, was an increase; in one, there was no change. By connecting the DMA zones and modifying the pressure in the pumping station, the energy consumption of the pumping stations was reduced. On this basis, it was found that it is possible to optimize the water pumping station by modifying the pumping station and work related to the network layout.</jats:p>"

The primary use case for this method is to estimate the functional integrity of an unknown device unit based on the behaviour of a known and proven reference unit. This method is based on the so-called virtual sensor network (VSN) approach, where the output quantity of a physical sensor measurement is replicated by a virtual model output. In the present study, this approach is extended to model the functional behaviour of electronic hardware by a neural network (NN) with Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers to encapsulate potential time-dependence of the signals. The proposed method is illustrated and validated on measurements from a remote-controlled drone, which is operated with two variants of controller hardware: a reference controller unit and a malfunctioning counterpart. It is demonstrated that the presented approach successfully identifies and describes the unexpected behaviour of the test device. In the presented case study, the model outputs a signal sample prediction in 0.14 ms and achieves a reconstruction accuracy of the validation data with a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.04 relative to the data range. In addition, three self-protection features (multidimensional boundary-check, Mahalanobis distance, auxiliary autoencoder NN) are introduced to gauge the certainty of the VSN model output.</jats:p>"

This Research aims to implement multiple linear regression as an approach to review the implementation of HSCM at hotel food service by looking at the interrelationship of the contributing factor in HSCM. There are seven relationships between variables that form hypotheses, namely halal management, quality and hygiene of halal food, halal warehousing, halal transportation, halal raw materials, halal production facilities, and halal suppliers. ANOVA testing (F-test) shows that all factors influence HSCM. However, Partial testing (T-test) shows that the most influential factors on HSCM are given by halal management and halal warehousing.</jats:p>"

As such, it answers the call for investigating the moderators of firms’ FP in their environmental supply chain management. The paper presents the results of a study conducted among 500 firms located in Poland with the use of the CATI technique. The research results show that increasing the intensity of ICT utilization in ECPs, in most cases, does not affect the firms’ FP. Statistically significant relations were observed only in green design ECPs, which shows that increasing the intensity of ICT utilization in green design ECPs reduces the likelihood of revenue growth thanks to ECPs implementation. The paper fills a research gap in the moderating role of the intensity of ICT utilization in increasing financial benefits thanks to the implementation of ECPs in the supply chain. As such, it contributes to the environmental supply chain management literature. The results highlight the need for further research on the moderators of firms’ financial benefits from ECPs implementation, which should be studies in isolation but also jointly, to verify their combined effect. Also, the character of different ECPs categories should be studied to link them with the most appropriate ICT.</jats:p>"

The introduction of deposits in CBDC account decreases credit supply by banks, raising the nominal interest rate and lowering a bank's reserve‐deposit ratio. This increases the likelihood of bank panic in which banks exhaust cash reserves. However, once the central bank can lend all the deposits in CBDC account to banks, an increase in the quantity of CBDC which does not require reserve holdings can enhance financial stability by increasing credit supply and lowering nominal interest rate.</jats:p>",

In parallel, the increasing scholarly interest on the subject is reflected in the number of publications. In such fast-growing research fields, mapping the whole research activity is useful in highlighting research areas that could provide a better knowledge accumulation in the field. With this aim, this chapter conducts co-citation and co-word analysis to identify future research directions. According to results, there is a need for future research to investigate 1) the consumer reaction when the service level received conflicts with the retailer environment (un)friendly operations, 2) the impacts of retailer return policies on their reverse logistics management, 3) the implementation difficulties of handling omni-channel returns in different organizational structures, and 4) the effectiveness of technological tools and applications used to avoid returns. This chapter also discusses the implications of COVID-19 on the commercial product returns research. </jats:p>",

Although intelligent algorithms are developing, their challenges including real-time nature of supply chain planning and the complexity of scenarios hinder their true potential. In this study, we proposed an improved genetic algorithm (GA)-long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network prediction algorithm to solve various optimization planning problems for the supply chain from suppliers to production enterprises. Specifically, to determine stable suppliers, we first constructed the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) model to quantitatively evaluate each supplier, and the rationality of the index weight of the TOPSIS algorithm can be enhanced by the entropy method. Finally, the GA and LSTM were used to solve the decision-making and planning problem in raw material supply chain. Our results indicate that the algorithm we proposed can not only efficiently solve the decision planning problem in the raw material supply chain, but it also reasonably analyzes the suppliers quantitatively.</jats:p>"

To date, both countries have taken full advantage of the international convention that assigns responsibility only for emissions within a country’s borders. However, climate activists, First Nations, and green politicians increasingly have challenged fossil fuel production via campaigns centered on issues salient to voters in nonproducing regions: opposing new exploration licenses in Norway and pipelines in Canada. While supply-side campaigns have sometimes succeeded in ending expansion, neither country has seriously entertained restricting current production. We attribute these outcomes to continued public support for fossil fuel–driven prosperity; institutions that assign responsibility for production and climate to different government agencies; and the success of counternarratives that unilateral supply restrictions are futile, prosperity from petroleum exports will fund domestic clean-energy transitions, and gas exports advance global climate action.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: The U.S. influenza (flu) vaccine supply chain is decentralized and experiences frequent supply and demand mismatches caused by two key factors: (1) the vaccine production process (yield) is highly uncertain; and (2) individuals are self-interested and do not completely take into account positive and negative externalities that they impose on others. To improve matching of supply and demand, we counteract these factors by developing an ex ante budget-neutral incentive program. Academic/practical relevance: We establish the sources of inefficiency in the flu vaccine supply chain. To eliminate the inefficiency, we develop a two-sided incentive program that policymakers can implement to finance vaccines under an ex ante balanced budget. Methodology: We model the flu vaccine supply chain as a decentralized system consisting of self-interested individuals on the demand side, and a profit-maximizing manufacturer with uncertain yield on the supply side. We use backward induction to characterize the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the sequential game that models the interactions between individuals and the manufacturer. Results: We develop a two-sided incentive program that proposes “vaccination incentives” to be given to individuals on the demand side, and “a menu of transfer payments” between the social planner and manufacturer on the supply side. When the realized vaccine supply is high (or low), our incentive program provides positive (negative) vaccination incentives for individuals to stimulate (or curb) the demand and eliminate positive (or negative) externalities by making vaccination more affordable (or costly). When social benefits from vaccination are significantly high, our incentive program uses a menu of transfer payments to penalize (or subsidize) the manufacturer for low (or high) yield realizations so that it produces the socially optimal quantity. We show that our incentive program can attain the social optimum, maintain an ex ante balanced budget (i.e., budget-neutral in expectation), and distribute the maximum social welfare between individuals and the manufacturer arbitrarily. Managerial implications: Vaccination incentives to individuals can ensure their access to the vaccine, but they are not enough to entice the manufacturer to ensure vaccine availability. A menu of contracts contingent on realized yield provides necessary incentives to the manufacturer and assures the availability. </jats:p>",

Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable nature, coupled with AI’s ability to analyze vast data sets and detect patterns, can create tamper-proof financial records and enhance trust in supply chain operations. Blockchain-backed smart contracts can automate processes, ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency in trade finance. These smart contracts execute predefined actions based on agreed conditions, and the integration of AI allows for real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and anomaly detection. This synergy enhances the security and reliability of trade finance transactions, significantly reducing the potential for fraud, errors, or disputes. AI can continuously analyze blockchain transaction data to identify fraudulent activities, unauthorized access, and discrepancies, further bolstering security. By leveraging these technologies together, supply chain networks can achieve greater operational efficiency, minimize financial risks, and ensure the integrity of financial records. This review explores the potential of blockchain and AI synergies in creating secure, transparent, and fraud-resistant trade finance ecosystems, highlighting their impact on reducing fraud and increasing overall supply chain reliability. The integration of these advanced technologies holds great promise for transforming global trade by enabling more secure, efficient, and trustworthy financial operations across interconnected supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We study supply chain coordination in a setting with transshipment. We use centralized and decentralized transfer prices as a way to increase supply chain coordination. Academic/practical relevance: The ability to transship can improve channel efficiency by improving the match between supply and demand. We study how human decision makers behave in this setting and provide clear insights to improve coordination. Methodology: We use controlled laboratory experiments with financially incentivized human subjects. We study a broad set of critical ratios under both decentralized and centralized transfer-price settings. In the decentralized transfer-price setting, retailers negotiate a transfer price. In the centralized transfer-price setting, we use two different approaches: theoretical and behavioral transfer price. Both approaches suggest opposite recommendations. Results: Analytically, the optimal transfer price should depend on the critical ratio; but results from the decentralized setting show that participants set prices as if they ignore the critical ratio and instead focus on splitting potential profit from transshipped units in half. However, there is a positive relationship between transfer prices and ordering decisions. Moreover, generalizing the pull-to-center effect, we find that subjects do not place orders that coordinate the supply chain. For the centralized setting, we find that using the theoretical approach does not coordinate ordering decisions and does not improve decisions compared with the decentralized setting. The behavioral approach suggests a transfer price close to product selling price for a high critical ratio and a transfer price below product cost for a low critical ratio. These recommendations lead to coordinating ordering decisions. Managerial implications: We draw two practical conclusions from our research. First, transshipments are unambiguously beneficial, resulting in higher profitability, and, when feasible, should be encouraged. Second, when possible, transfer prices should be set centrally but taking into account subjects’ behavior. Otherwise, price negotiation might lead to better performance. </jats:p>",

Yet, the performance of at Mbinga Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (MBIUWASA) for such a long time became very poor due to different problems such as dissatisfaction of customers making them delay paying their bills on time in lieu of unreliable services. This study analysed the effects of customer satisfaction on water utility business performance at Mbinga Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (MBIUWASA). Specifically, the study aimed at examining the influence of customer satisfaction on return on asset (RoA), the relationship between customer satisfaction and return on equity (RoE) and the impact of customer satisfaction on return of investment (RoI). Case study research design was used along with mixed approach. A sample size of 50 customers and MBIUWASA staff was utilized. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents as to get views from them. Tools used included questionnaire, in-depth interview and documentary review. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed descriptively along with the use of content analysis. Moreover, regression analysis was used to capture the relationship between variables. The study revealed that MBIUWASA customers are not satisfied with the service provided leading to poor performance. The regression analysis indicates that the coefficient of correlation R was 0.840 an indication of positive relationship between variables. Coefficient of adjusted determination R2 was 0.706 which changes to 70.6% an indication of changes of dependent variable (RoA, RoE and RoI) that can be explained by customer satisfaction. The residual of 29.4% can be explained by other variables beyond the scope of the current study. The study concluded that MBIUWASA needs to find out ways of investing much on water sources to be able to supply water to the large number of customers while adhering to quality service provision.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to analyze the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the forest supply chain in Austria using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods. The forest supply chain consists of several processes like site preparation and tending, harvesting, and transport. In total, 30 relevant forest processes from seedling production until delivery of wood to the plant gate were considered. Results show that in the year 2018, a total of 492,096 t of CO2 eq. were emitted in Austria for harvesting and transportation of 19.2 hm3 of timber. This corresponds to 25.63 kg CO2 eq. per m3. At 77%, transport accounts for the largest share of emissions within the supply chain. Extraction causes 14% of emissions, felling and processing cause 5%, and chipping causes 4%. GHG emissions for felling, delimbing, and crosscutting are much lower when using a chainsaw compared to harvester. The high numbers for the transport can be explained by the high transportation distances. Especially for the transportation of wood, it is necessary to find more climate-friendly solutions from a technical and organizational point of view. The provision of wood is climate-friendly, and its use enables the substitution of fossil fuels or materials with higher negative effects on climate change such as aluminum, steel, or concrete.</jats:p>"

The present study proposes and evaluates an integrated framework to optimize reservoir operation in which hydropower loss and economic loss of irrigation supply are minimized while ecological degradations at downstream river are alleviated. The ecohydraulic simulation was utilized in the structure of the reservoir operation optimization. Reservoir operation losses and environmental degradations were minimized in three hydrological conditions including dry years, normal years and wet years. Moreover, the cropping pattern optimization was applied to mitigate the economic loss of irrigation supply as the main responsibility of the reservoir in the study area. Particle swarm optimization was applied in the reservoir operation optimization. Based on the results in the case study, reliability indices of hydropower production and farmers’ revenue are 15–25 and 30–60%, respectively. Moreover, the physical habitat loss is considerably reduced in all hydrologic conditions by proposing optimal environmental flow. The proposed method is able to provide a fair balance between downstream environmental degradations and economic benefits of the reservoir including farmers’ revenue and hydropower production. Low computational complexities are the most important strength point for the developed model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South African mining sector faces numerous challenges that limit the performance of firms, chief among them environmental management, labour, and operational issues. An important research gap exists on how the adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) can contribute to the mitigation of some of these challenges. This study investigates the connection between GSCM, employee satisfaction, operational and relational efficiency, and enterprise performance in the mining sector in South Africa. The study employed a quantitative method using a cross-sectional survey design. A structured research questionnaire was used to collect data from supply chain professionals at two leading mining firms based in the North-West Province, South Africa. The collected data were analysed using a structural equation modelling procedure based on the partial least squares technique. The study reveals the positive influence of GSCM on employee job satisfaction, operational efficiency, relational efficiency, and enterprise performance. The study also confirms that relational efficiency and operational efficiency both exert a positive influence on enterprise performance. However, employee job satisfaction exerted no influence on enterprise performance. GSCM itself exerted a direct positive influence on enterprise performance. The application of GSCM in the mining sector should be recognised as part of the solutions to motivating supply chain professionals and stimulating important internal and external efficiencies, leading to the enhanced performance of the firm.</jats:p>"

This paper carries out in-depth research and analysis based on the half-year shipping data derived from Hai Gong You 31, the oil supply vessel of Shanghai Chimbusco Marine Bunker Co., Ltd. After classifying 3946 pieces of shipping data, and there are 119 valid sequences. As for 13 characteristic parameters ,which include time, distance, average acceleration ,etc., they are eigenvalues of kinematics sequences ,and there are principal component analysis and contribution rate analysis relevant to them. Instead of original eigenvalues, three principal components whose contribution ratios are the highest and the accumulative one is around 85% are selected to be analyzed then. By means of between-groups linkage, this paper calculates the distance among clusters ,and the nearest two clusters are regarded as a new cluster. Afterward, calculations and combinations are made over and over till there is only one cluster. Eventually, the navigation condition of oil supply vessels is successfully formed, that is the one with a total length of 9240s.</jats:p>"

Because the single-source supply design is becoming the mainstream choice in the existing ozone-driven systems, the input supply reliability of the ozone-driven system is crucial. Therefore, this proposed design involves a modified-bridge circuit combined with inductors and transistors, which can be augmented with the energy storage device as a backup source to improve the reliability of the input supply for the ozone-driven system. In addition, considering that the original source directly connected to DC BUS can re-charge the energy storage device, the energy recycling operation mode is designed in this proposed system to extend the duration of the energy storage device, which improves the supply reliability of the ozone-driven system further. To validate this proposed system, both model formulation and hardware realization are assessed through different test scenarios. Experimental outcomes of these tests confirm the practicality of the proposed design.</jats:p>"

In the case of exogenous wholesale prices, we find that the retailer's risk aversion has a non-monotonic effect on its total ordering quantity. We also show that when the suppliers' default correlation increases, the retailer's total ordering quantity is non-increasing. In the case of endogenous wholesale prices, we find that the profits of the suppliers and the retailer are non-monotonic in retailer's risk aversion level or suppliers' default correlation. As risk aversion level increases, the retailer becomes less sensitive to wholesale prices. Finally, the numerical results indicate that when the suppliers' delivery rates are different, the supplier with a low delivery rate can benefit from the retailer's risk aversion under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Specifically, the research noted both elasticities of output supply and input demand for egg production, as well as the short run profit value. This is necessary due to the acute shortage of information on the study area’s elasticity of output supply and input demand for egg production. A well-structured questionnaire and in-person interviews were used to gather data from the 360 egg producers that made up the sample size. The respondents were chosen using a snowball sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to evaluate the data. By taking the first derivative, six equations were constructed from the generalized Leontief restricted profit function. The parameter estimates of the formulas were examined using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). Results demonstrated that the egg’s own-price elasticities were positive as predicted, at 0.434, and the supply of spent layers was, at 1.12. Additionally, all estimated own-price elasticities of input demands were discovered to be negative, as predicted. The study found that input demands were highly responsive to own-price change except for the day-old-chicks. The results also showed that labour was the most highly elastic input employed compared to other factors. The cross-price effects between the feed demand and day-old-chicks was found to be complements, while the cross-price effect between the feed demand and labour price was found to be substitutable. The study, therefore, concludes and suggests that price elasticities of demand for labour, feed and vaccines in poultry egg farming are keys for policy formulations to stimulate competitiveness in poultry industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Literatura dotycząca Powstania Warszawskiego jest ogromna. Dotyczy ona różnych jego aspektów, począwszy od zagadnień strategiczno-operacyjnych, problemów politycznych, uwarunkowań wewnętrznych i międzynarodowych, analizy militarnych działań powstania, reakcji na powstanie, poprzez eksterminację ludności i powstańców, po zburzenie miasta. Mimo takiego bogactwa literatura powstańcza zawiera wiele luk i rozbieżności, wiele zagadnień czeka na bardziej obszerne zbadanie i opracowanie.\nWykorzystując materiały archiwalne, w tym dokumenty z archiwów w Nowym Jorku, Londynie, Freiburgu oraz Polsce, jak również istniejącą literaturę przedmiotu, autor przedstawia nieznane dotychczas kwestie związane z zabezpieczeniem oddziałów AK w żywność i wodę na czas Powstania Warszawskiego. Wskazuje na stan przygotowań i występujące problemy z zaopatrzeniem. Twierdzi także, iż zabezpieczenie Armii Krajowej w żywność na czas walki było niewystarczające, a przez to miało istotny wpływ na rozwój wydarzeń w Warszawie latem 1944 r. \nW artykule autor dowodzi, że zaopatrzenie oddziałów powstańczych w żywność i wodę miało bardzo istotny wpływ nie tylko na morale, ale przede wszystkim możliwość prowadzenia działań zbrojnych w poszczególnych rejonach Warszawy przez powstańców. Wnikliwie opisuje brak przygotowania intendenckiego w okresie okupacji, jak również czynione próby uporania się z tym problemem w przed wybuchem walk przez kwatermistrza Okręgu Warszawa AK i wskazuje dlaczego nie mogły się w pełni powieść. Stan przygotowania obnażyły nie tylko pierwsze dni walk, ale przede wszystkim kolejne tygodnie zmagań w Warszawie. Dający się zauważyć chaos w kwestii zaopatrzenia miasta w żywność i wodę wynikał z wielu czynników, w tym przede wszystkim przyjęcia założenia o czasie trwania walk, jak również przygotowywania się do nich w warunkach okupacji, co skutkowało daleko posuniętą tajemnicą planowania i rozbieżnościami w wydawanych wytycznych między Komendą Główną AK a Okręgiem Warszawa AK.</jats:p>",

The relationship between money supply and inflation is addressed in economic theories and models and has been studied by many experts in different economies in different periods. To examine the relationship between money supply and inflation in Vietnam in the period of 2005-2021, the research team collected data on money supply and inflation rate, then analyzed this relationship during three periods of 2005-2011, 2012-2019 and 2019-2021. Next, the research team collected data on money supply (MS - total means of payment) and consumer price index (CPI), quarterly data from the first quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2021 and uses Eviews 8 software for analyzing. The research team uses a linear regression model to evaluate the impact of money supply growth (GMS) on consumer price index (CPI), a variable representing the inflation rate, of Vietnam during the research period. The model results support the view that money supply growth and past inflation are among the factors affecting inflation in Vietnam. From the research results and the actual money supply, the money supply growth rate as well as the inflation rate in Vietnam during the research period, the research team makes some policy recommendations to achieve the targets of supporting economic recovery, controlling inflation, stabilizing the macro-economy in Vietnam after the Covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

The pressure‐dependent nodal demand (PDD) model is added to the hydraulic analysis to avoid the problem of node negative pressure in the hydraulic analysis of low‐pressure pipe networks. The linear search and backtracking algorithm was used to control the iterative step size of the nonlinear equations of the pipe network nodes, which ensures the global convergence of the low‐pressure hydraulic analysis of the pipe network.</jats:p>",

To improve its efficiency, it is necessary to minimize the costs of manufacturing products, performing work and providing services. Effective and rational internal control contributes to the solution of this task. In this regard, issues related to the organizational and methodological support of control over production costs are of particular relevance. The research was carried out in order to study organizational aspects and develop directions for improving the methodological support of internal control of production costs. As one of the internal control tools, it is advisable to use the internal control working document (ICWD) “Test for assessing the accounting system of production costs”, which allows you to collect information on the validity and reliability of accounting for production costs and calculating the cost of production; on the procedures used in the system of internal control over production costs and the effectiveness of these procedures; on the general principles of organizing the primary, synthetic and analytical accounting of production costs, on the rationing of material resources at the enterprise. To systematize the information collected during the internal control of primary accounting, the ICWD “Checking the primary accounting of production costs” is suitable. Using the ICWD developed within the framework of the study “Checking compliance with the norms of consumption of material assets in production”, it is possible to establish the validity of material costs and generalize the results of checking the norms of inventories for production. For internal control of work-in-progress, it is proposed to use the ICWD “Questionnaire for assessing the organization and accounting of inventory of work in progress”.</jats:p>",

The unit consists of two circuits, which use a steam turbine with a temperature of up to 200 ° C, with a degree of dryness of water vapor is 5% and a turbine on R12 refrigerant with a capacity of 5 MW. Electric power is 12 MW. Hybrid power plants are also used in metallurgy, cement and glass industries where the heat of exhaust gases with temperatures up to 350 ° C is used. A feature of the design calculations is the uncertainty of changes during the future life of some of the initial data, in particular, specific cost indicators. The available experience and the analysis of approaches to development of flowing parts of turbines have shown that depending on degree of expansion and expenses of working bodies the corresponding type of flowing part is chosen. The calculated studies of the three-circuit thermal circuit (at a discharge temperature of 350 ° C) showed that increasing the parameters of the working fluids is not always rational. Increasing the heat drop on the turbine leads to an increase in the number of turbine stages, but the cost of the working fluid is not enough to abandon the partial drive. The one-dimensional calculation does not show a complete picture of the flow in the flowing part of the turbine, which will have large losses from secondary flows and flows of the working fluid due to the low height of the blades and a high degree of partiality. The results also allow us to conclude that the most appropriate is the implementation of a double-circuit thermal scheme and increase the consumption of working fluids. Increasing the number of circuit elements and possible combinations of their connections, expanding the range of changes in the initial data, factors of systemicity and uncertainty significantly complicate the choice of the final version of the thermal circuit.</jats:p>"

It still leads to a lack of data transparency. In the past, data traceability could not be made efficient at every stage, so the record data transaction was not real-time, less accurate, and inefficient coordination between actors. Blockchain is one of the technologies in the 4.0 era as a distributed ledger technology. It can be transparency, traceability, security, immutability, and decentralization.

Ethereum is a proof-of-work convention based on the Ropsten test-net on the Metamask wallet. The sugar supply chain system that has been successfully developed allows consumers to track the purchased sugar products based on the transaction hash code sent by the seller. The data listed is the location of the plantation, the quantity (quintal) and quality of sugarcane (percentage), and the purchase price. A web-based blockchain application could be used as a model by national sugar factories to help them make enough sugar food for themselves.</jats:p>"

The manufacturing industry must begin to prepare for the development of technology infrastructure, especially in supply chain integration, supply chain performance, and information sharing. Based on the problems experienced, a supply chain strategy mapping was carried out to identify challenges and improvements that needed to be made. The supply chain strategy is mapped with market trends and defines divisions affected by constructing new technology infrastructure. This strategy is taken into consideration in defining challenges and improving supply chain processes. This study aims to map supply chain strategies in the form of a mindmap to maximize processes and prepare technology infrastructure. Supply chain strategy mapping allows the manufacturing industry to implement strategies to react quickly if there are problems with suppliers, missing orders, spikes in demand, or other unexpected things.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to prove, on the basis of analysis of selected academic sources and examples from business practice, that Industry 4.0, as a global transformation of production and other business segments based on digitalization and the Internet, increasingly transforms existing supply chains into supply chains 4.0 and affects their business performance. There are three key parts of this paper. The first part presents the conceptual and business framework of Industry 4.0, as well as its dependence on certain digital technologies. The second part points to the business relevance of supply chains 4.0 and the technological conditionality of their adaptation to customer expectations. The last part proves the fact that Industry 4.0 enables the company to be transformed into a digital supply chain (supply chain 4.0) that can successfully respond to changes in the environment.</jats:p>"

Two types of bargaining systems with power structures are compared: one adopts the generalized Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) solution and the other adopts the generalized Nash solution. Our analyses show that, for any KS bargaining system with a given bargaining power structure, there is a Nash bargaining system with another bargaining power structure, such that the two systems are the same. However under the same power structure, the generalized KS solution results in lower wholesale price and higher total supply chain profit than the Nash solution does. Finally, we characterize the necessary and sufficient condition of the bargaining power structure under which the KS bargaining system Pareto dominates the Nash bargaining system, and the set characterized by such condition does not shrink to an empty set as the number of echelons increases to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The value-add is more enhanced with COP26 determination to curb methane minimum minus thirty percent. The change obviously embeds benefits, through intent on societal empowerment, initiative on water waste energy rehaul, immersion with gender aligned supply chains. This paper is on the construct of mixed method based qualitative methodology on value-add change that embeds benefits in the renewable energy embedded sustainable supply chains with methane harness. Embedded energy in supply chains can now focus on innovation retaed to methane and not alone carbon dioxide. Developing regions are vibrant with economic activity that proliferate supply chains. They innately depend on water waste energy footprint. There is resonating need for positioning sustainable supply chains with renewable energy that is gender aligned.  Methane is a ultra-potent greenhouse gas that has a win win focus on adoption of renewable energy as well as attain sustainability of energy needs of supply chains. Methane traps one hundred times more heat when present in the atmosphere. Focus on methane is potent as it gets removed within a decade, in contrast to carbon dioxide that lingers over centuries. The linkgage options through innovation, intent, impact is a contribution of this paper. Supply chain resource corridors are tenable to potential renewable inclusion. The possibility of varying the impacts of different values of the independent variables, future research can confirm the extent of renewable energy adoption with sustainable supply chain growth. One could also design for variance on the changes of location or habitats, that can define the need of a distributed and differentiated range of combinations. A metric could be designed which is responsive to varying combinations of water quality, waste parsimony and renewable energy minus methane feasibility. </jats:p>"

In this study, the Hydrological Engineering Center–Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to simulate snowmelt runoff in the Kırkgöze–Çipak Basin that has a complex topography where altitude differences range from 1823 m to 3140 m above the sea level. The Kırkgöze–Çipak Basin, located in eastern Turkey, is a basin where snowfall is highly effective during the cold season. There are three automatic meteorology and snow observation stations and three stream gauge stations in the basin, which are operated especially for the calibration and validation of hydrological parameters at different altitudes and exposures. In this study, the parameters affecting snow accumulation–melting and runoff were investigated using the simulations on an hourly basis carried out over a three-year period for temporal and spatial distribution at the basin scale. Different from previous studies focusing on the rate of snowmelt, the temperature index method, which is calculated with physically-based parameters (R2 = 0.77~0.99), was integrated into the runoff simulations (R2 = 0.84) in the basin. The snowmelt-dominated basin is considered to be the source of the headwaters of the Euphrates River.</jats:p>"

The aim of this work is to predict the supply and demand for jobs up to 2022, using the method of exponential alignment of time series. With the existence of natural unemployment, not all job positions will be filled. In such a situation, organizations will have to demand labor from abroad. In the event that organizations are unable to secure labor from abroad, they will have to reduce their activities and the associated volume of production they produce. Last but not least, the organization can start going bankrupt. In the forecast, we do not address the structure of unemployment by the highest attained education or by profession. We see the application benefits of the work in companies that manage human resources. At present, the prediction of future development is mostly at the national level and in the Czech Republic it is at the beginning of its journey.

Despite the growing importance in the international market in the last harvests, activities related to this product threaten this position. Due to its economic importance for the country, this study aims to identify the competitiveness drivers of soybean destined for the international market and to measure their impacts on the export process. Therefore, the used methodology considers the systemic character of different factors that affect the supply chain positively or negatively. As a result, the logistics infrastructure dimension was the only competitiveness driver classified as unfavorable among the analyzed factors. The advances in agribusiness are being subsequently followed by some sectors of the economy such as science and technology. On the other hand, the logistics sector has not been showing the same development, causing some weaknesses to persist, either due to the lack of infrastructure of transport production, or the inability to properly store the national harvest. The current challenge for the State is to ensure the maintenance of the quality of the infrastructure already installed and to promote an environment capable of attracting private capital and a new investment cycle.</jats:p>"

The “bright side” of encroachment exists for all players only when the encroachment cost is at a moderate level. However, in manufacturer encroachment under simultaneous quantity decisions, the “bright side” skips the distributor but benefits the retailer directly as the encroachment cost increases from zero to a certain level. The main reason lies in that the distributor loses its pricing power because the end-market has been disturbed by the simultaneous quantity decisions. A comparison of the results of sequential and simultaneous quantity decisions reveals the merit of simultaneous quantity decisions. The authors find that the intermediate role (the distributor in our model) in three-echelon supply chains may benefit more from simultaneous quantity decisions.

Currently, the Sri Tanjung cracker company lacks structured risk management, particularly in supply chain activities One of the known risks is that companies run out of raw materials, suppliers who ship late, and defective products. The goal of this study was to identify risks and develop appropriate preventive measures to reduce risks in the fish cracker production supply chain. This study maps supply chain operations using the SCOR model then uses the HOR method to classify risks and related mitigation strategies using Pareto diagrams and a probability impact matrix model. The results showed that the HOR phase 1 model comprises 60 risk events, 35 risk agents, and 7 priority risk agents for HOR phase 2 computation. HOR phase 2 shows 4 mitigation strategies that need to be addressed first. To conduct further research, if the suggested action is in the form of preventive action, it is required to quantify the impact of risk reduction and can add variables in the review of risk events, risk agents, and preventive measures to identify supply chain activities at the Sri Tanjung Fish Cracker Company.</jats:p>"

The supply of many plant‐derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions.

To consider issues related to the study of methods for determining the sources of violations of the quality of electrical energy in power supply systems, in particular consumers which create rapid voltage changes or voltage fluctuations that create rapid changes in the luminous flux in electric lighting installations. Show that electrical receivers with a sharply variable operating mode are sources of fluctuations in the consumed current and voltage in the electrical network of power supply systems, which in turn manifests itself in the form of unacceptable values of one of the indicators of the quality of electricity - flicker, defined as the subjective perception of fluctuations in the luminous flux of lighting devices. To study the possibilities of determining the places of occurrence of significant voltage fluctuations without the use of expensive and complex instruments for measuring flicker values in the electrical network. To develop a simplified method for determining the locations of electricity consumers that negatively affect the operation of electric lighting systems and, ultimately, the vision of personnel. Conduct a check on a computer model of a simplified method for determining the places of occurrence of voltage fluctuations that are inadmissible in their magnitude, which are expressed in the appearance of significant doses of flicker that exceed the standard values.</jats:p><jats:p>METHODS. Solving the problem, a computer model was used, created in the Simulink extension package of the Matlab scientific and technical calculation system.</jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS. The article describes the relevance of the problem, discusses the quality of electricity in power supply systems. It has been shown using experimental data that in electrical networks there is an excess of the standard values of flicker doses. The possibility of using interharmonic components of the mains voltage to determine the sources of unacceptable doses of flicker is considered. A simplified method for finding flicker sources based on obtaining the values of the derivatives of currents at various points of the electrical network is presented. Computer simulation of an electrical network diagram with electrical receivers, which have both calm and sharply variable nature of work, has been performed. It is shown that the use of the values of the derivatives of the current at various points of the electrical network makes it possible to identify the sources of the occurrence of unacceptable doses of flicker.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSION. The occurrence of significant rapid voltage changes in the electrical network negatively affects vision, which is inevitably accompanied by increased personnel fatigue and can lead to industrial injuries. The results obtained by the authors of the article show that it is possible to use it to determine the places of occurrence of large voltage fluctuations, which are manifested in unacceptable doses of flicker of the derivatives of currents. It should be taken into account when conducting surveys of power supply systems in order to use fairly simple hardware to identify sources of disturbance in the quality of electrical energy.</jats:p>"

The cooperatives belonging to the four main cooperative credit systems in the country were considered: Cresol, Sicoob, Sicredi and Unicred. To meet the proposed objective, a documentary research was carried out as from the survey of secondary data from official agencies, in addition to data from the financial and accounting reports of the analyzed institutions. The literature consulted points out that credit unions have a greater incentive to carry out solidarity credit and microcredit operations, given their social nature. The results presented evidence that the microcredit offer by the analyzed cooperative systems is not very significant, representing, on average, less than 10% of the total microcredit portfolio in the analyzed years. The main conclusion is that most Brazilian credit unions, with the exception of those that compose the solidarity segment, have not had a significant participation in the supply of microcredit. It is hoped that these findings can contribute to the development of policies capable of changing this picture, that is, that these institutions, considered by the literature as the ideal model of organization to operate microcredit, can potentialize actions towards a greater insertion in the supply of microcredit.</jats:p>"

In addition to the availability of oxygen and other electron acceptors, the remineralization rate of OM is controlled by its biochemical quality. Enhanced microbial respiration of OM can induce anoxic microzones in an otherwise oxygenated water column.

It contains the concept of Logistics Support and presents a part of the supply and maintenance system through Public Procurement in the Logistics Battalion of the Armed Forces. Methods: The theoretical system of supply and maintenance is very complex and consists of a number of elements, organizational units, as well as certain principles. During the implementation, it is necessary to take into account all the principles and adhere to the rules and instructions. Also important was the help of colleagues from the Armed Forces and other state institutions who are in relevant positions and are important for logistics support. Results: The final result of the work is a presentation of some activities performed by the logistics body in the battalion with a review of procurement under account 4252. In the final part of the paper, the emphasis is placed on the instructions which regulate and define the division of procurement in more detail, as well as on the implementation according to expenditure account 4252 on \"ongoing maintenance and repair of equipment\". Conclusion: During the preparation of the paper, the biggest difficulty was the change of various rules and laws. Some rules and literature were written in the 1970s, and are still in force. A proposal for further tendencies would be to define new rules and organizations based on the experience of the countries in the region where the system has taken root.</jats:p>"

To eliminate these detrimental impacts, designers have attempted to detect the characteristics of these waves. Flow interaction with chute piers generates triple waves in the middle walls and sidewalls of spillway conduits. The present study quantitatively investigated the characteristics of these waves with respect to variations in the bottom inclination angle (θ), wall contraction (φ), and Fr numbers (). The results indicated that with the increment of θ, , (φ, ), and (θ, ), the height () and distance () of the first wave increased, which can be helpful for flow aeration. Furthermore, owing to a boost in θ, , (φ, ), and (θ, ), the height of the second wave was decreased. Therefore, the amount of dynamic pressure on the spillway walls was reduced. Moreover, the distance of decreased with a rise in θ, φ and increased with the increment of and (φ, ). As for , raising φ and (φ, ) elevated the height of this wave and declined its distance. An increase in the height of boosted the flow turbulence and aeration.</jats:p>",

However, the runoff time series consists of complex nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics, which makes forecasting difficult. To contribute towards improved forecasting accuracy, a novel combination model based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) for runoff forecasting is proposed and applied in this paper. Firstly, the original runoff series is decomposed into a limited number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual based on CEEMD, which makes the runoff time series stationary. Then, approximate entropy is introduced to judge the complexity of each IMF and residual. According to the calculation results of approximate entropy, the high complexity components are predicted by Gaussian process regression (GPR), the medium complexity components are predicted by support vector machine (SVM), and the low complexity components are predicted by autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). The advantages of each forecasting model are used to forecast the appropriate components. In order to solve the problem that the forecasting performance of GPR and SVM is affected by their parameters, an improved fireworks algorithm (IFWA) is proposed to optimize the parameters of two models. Finally, the final forecasting result is obtained by adding the forecasted values of each component. The runoff data collected from the Manasi River, China is chosen as the research object. Compared with some state-of-the-art forecasting models, the comparison result curve between the forecasted value and actual value of runoff, the forecasting error, the histogram of the forecasting error distribution, the performance indicators and related statistical indicators show that the developed forecasting model has higher prediction accuracy and is able to reflect the change laws of runoff correctly.</jats:p>",

The results show that in the MRM mode, both the wholesale and retail prices may become higher with encroachment. Improving the service efficiency may hurt the retailer, and increasing the operating cost for direct channels harms the retailer, while benefits the manufacturer. In addition, only in the MRM mode, the retailer maybe benefits from encroachment under certain conditions. We further study the equilibrium mode and the result shows as follows. The MR mode, widely adopted by the literature on manufacturer encroachment, always is worst for the manufacturer. Only when both the operating cost for direct channels and the service efficiency are low, the equilibrium decision mode is the MRMR mode, otherwise the MRM mode is the equilibrium decision mode.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The initial problem was approached by using the commercial CFD code based on the finite volume method to numerically simulate a 2-D incompressible turbulent flow and by conducting direct experimental measurements in the wind tunnel. The results of CFD simulations have been compared to experimentally measured data for two considered cases of inlet velocities and five different angles of attack. Numerical solutions show an adequate level of agreement with experimental measurements. The obtained results indicate the possibility of using a staggered cascade of airfoils for gradual deflection of the air-flow.</jats:p>"

Interestingly, the revenue share decreases in the acceptable bankruptcy risk, but the buy-back price increases in the acceptable bankruptcy risk when the retailer has financial constraints.

The improper rating and use of BoP components has been found to increase parasitic loads, which consequently has a direct effect on the polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) system efficiency. Therefore, the minimisation of parasitic loads while maintaining desired performance is crucial. Nevertheless, little has been found in the literature regarding experimental work on large stacks and BoP, with the majority of papers concentrating on modelling. A particular interest of our study was the anode side of the fuel cell. Additionally the rationale behind the use of hydrogen anode recirculation was scrutinised, and a novel anode purging strategy was developed and implemented. Through experimental modelling, the use of cathode air blower was minimised since it was found to be the biggest contributor to the parasitic loads.</jats:p>"

The response is estimated as the yield and area responses to prices, temperature, and rainfall. The study depended mainly on secondary data obtained from the records of the Ministry of agriculture and animal resources, Elobied Crops Market, and Elobied Airport Metrological Station. The co-integration and vector error correction approaches were applied to estimate the response. The results found that the estimated responses of crop yield in the long run to price were negative and inelastic for sesame, groundnut, and elastic for sorghum. It was positive and inelastic for yield millet yield. The estimated responses of crop area to price in the long run were negative and inelastic for sesame, sorghum, millet, and elastic for groundnut. The estimated responses of crop yield in the long run to temperature were negative and elastic for all crops and ranged from-24.01 to -197.83. The estimated responses of crop area in the long run to temperature were positive and elastic and ranged from 37.121 to 411.747.The estimated responses of crop yield to rainfall index, in the long run, were positive and elastic for groundnut (2.357), sorghum (4.667), and millet (1.142), but it is inelastic for sesame (0.509). The responses of crop area to rainfall index were negative and elastic and ranged from -13.745 to -1.086. The study concluded that rainfall index and temperature factors are the most dominating factors influencing yield and area behavior in the long-run, hence farmers’ decisions.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the quality of pre-sale services provided by the provider has significant impact on software sales and on the performance of IT service supply chain (ITSSC). However, the existing research on IT service supply chain management (ITSSCM) lacks attention to this issue. In this study, we consider an ITSSC with a software developer, a service provider and client enterprises. Two scenarios are discussed in this study. Our study finds that the quality of pre-sale services provided by the provider and the price of extended warranty service (EWS) provided by the developer (in centralized decision-making (CDM)) are both higher than those in decentralized decision-making (DDM); when the sensitivity of clients to the software price is lower than a certain critical value, the software sales price (in CDM) is unexpectedly higher than that in DDM; however, when it is higher than the certain value, the software sales price (in CDM) is lower than that in DDM. Due to the double marginal effect between the developer and the provider, the total profit of ITSSC (in DDM) is always lower than that in CDM. By providing a combined coordination contract based on \"guiding price &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M1\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ + $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; service cost sharing &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M2\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ + $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; product revenue sharing\", not only the total profit of ITSSC can be increased, but also the profit of ITSSC members can be Pareto improved.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Of these, the business must carry out the activities effectively and efficiently to achieve maximum profit. However, the study that focuses on the moderating role of the value chain in its relationship to firm performance is still limited. Thus, the present study aims to examine the effect of intellectual capital and environmental uncertainty toward firm performance and the mediating role of the value chain in the relationship between intellectual capital and environmental uncertainty to firm performance. This study was designed using a quantitative approach through an online survey. A total of 207 staff from non-financial state-owned enterprises consists of 10 clusters and 76 companies. The data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Square method (SEM-PLS) and assisted by statistical software, namely SmartPLS 3.3.3. The result indicated that intellectual capital and environmental uncertainty have a significant effect on firm performance. Also, this study found that a value chain moderates the relationship of intellectual capital and environmental uncertainty toward firm performance. In conclusion, this study has successfully examined the effect of intellectual capital and environmental uncertainty on firm performance—also, the role of a value chain in the relationship of studied variables. In addition, the findings of this study showed that a value chain is an important tool for companies to improve their business performance.</jats:p>"

Customers’ requirements simultaneously emphasize quality, variety, and fast response time in current markets. To satisfy customer needs, most manufacturers in various industries (e.g., clothing, household goods, automotive, etc.) plan their multiproduct fabrication by incorporating a postponement strategy, rework process, and an outsourcing option. Motivated by the viewpoints above, this study offers a decision support system to address customers’ external expectations while optimizing internal operating expenses and machine utilization. We propose a single-machine, two-stage delayed differentiation system under a rotation cycle policy. All needed common parts are made in stage one, and stage two fabricates different end products. An external provider is hired to supply partially needed common parts to shorten uptime. The defective items are inevitably produced in both stages. They are categorized and reworked to maintain the desired product quality. Finally, we derive an optimal cost-minimization rotation cycle for our model and use a numerical example to investigate the collective and individual influences of reworking, postponement, and outsourcing to external providers on the multiproduct fabrication problem. In summary, this study can offer an optimization solution for production planning in various modern industries.</jats:p>"

An important pathogenetic mechanism of the influence of insulin resistance and hypothyroidism on the cardiovascular system is the alteration in the autonomic regulation of heart rhythm.&#x0D;\nObjective. The aim of the study was to evaluate the dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) in rats with insulin resistance and obesity under the conditions of adequate and limited iodine supply.&#x0D;\nMaterials and Methods. Studies were performed on 90 nonlinear rats pandomized by random sampling. The response of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) was studied using a computer program to analyze HRV “Poly-Spectrum.NET” with the additional module “Poly-Spectrum.NET/Veterinary”.&#x0D;\nResults. It was determined that the co-directed dynamics of geometric and statistical analysis of HRV and balance shift in the direction of the low-frequency component in spectrum analysis of the heart rate regarding control data were revealed in rats with isolated insulin resistance, obesity and combined endocrinopathy (insulin resistance and obesity under the conditions of limited iodine supply). &#x0D;\nConclusion. The prevalence of sympathetic ANS activity under the conditions of insulin resistance and obesity can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias, the development of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and with a high probability to cause some cases of life-threatening arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular). Iodine deficiency contributes to the depletion of regulatory effects of ANS and limits the range of adaptive capabilities and resources of the organism.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, costs related to virtualization such as security, energy consumption, recall and IoT facilities along with the usual costs of the SC are considered in the model. Due to real-world demand fluctuations, in this model, demand is considered fuzzy. Finally, the problem is solved using the Grey Wolf algorithm and Firefly algorithm.

Also, the results of the sensitivity analysis using the IoT in a VCLSC showed that the profit of the virtual supply chain (VSC) is higher compared to not using IoT due to tracking defective parts and identifying reversible products. In proposed model, chain members can help improve chain operations by tracking raw materials and products, delivering products faster and with higher quality to customers, bringing a new level of SC efficiency to industries. As a result, VSCs can be controlled, programmed and optimized remotely over the Internet based on virtual objects rather than direct observation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>There are limited researches on designing and optimizing the VCLSC network. This study is one of the first studies that optimize the VSC networks considering minimization of virtual costs and maximization of profits. In most researches, the theory of VSC and its advantages have been described, while in this research, mathematical optimization and modeling of the VSC have been done, and it has been tried to apply SC virtualization using the IoT. Considering virtual costs in VSC optimization is another originality of this research. Also, considering the uncertainty in the SC brings the issue closer to the real world. In this study, virtualization costs including security, recall and energy consumption in SC optimization are considered.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list id=\"list1\" list-type=\"order\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Investigates the role of IoT for virtual supply chain profit optimization and mathematical optimization of virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) based on multiperiod, multiproduct with emphasis on using the IoT under uncertainty.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Considering the most important costs of virtualization of supply chain include: cost of IoT information security, cost of IoT energy consumption, cost of recall the production department, cost of IoT facilities.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Selection of the optimal suppliers in each period and determination of the price of each returned product in virtual supply chain.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Solving and validating the proposed model with two meta-heuristic algorithms (the Grey Wolf algorithm and Firefly algorithm).</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

Production management consists of planning, coordinating, and regulating the manufacturing process to guarantee that things are produced effectively, on schedule, and in sufficient numbers. This process often entails managing production resources such as people, materials, and equipment to fulfill production targets while minimizing waste and increasing productivity. On the other hand, inventory management is the management of a company's stock of finished items, work in progress, and raw materials. It is concerned with ensuring that the appropriate quantity of inventory is available at the appropriate time to fulfill customer demand while reducing the expenses associated with surplus inventory. Effective production and inventory management are required for businesses to satisfy client demand, sustain profitability, and compete in the market. Businesses may cut costs, enhance productivity, and raise customer happiness by streamlining manufacturing processes and successfully controlling inventory levels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">&lt;p style='text-indent:20px;'&gt;Currently, many upstream software developers not only sell software through downstream service providers, but also directly sell it to clients. However, in the field of IT service supply chain management, there is a lack of research on the channel encroachment of software developers. In this study, we consider an IT service supply chain with a software developer, a service provider and client enterprises. Clients can either purchase the software (developed by the software developer) from the provider with a high price and additional pre-sale services, or directly purchase it from the developer with a low price but without pre-sale service. After purchasing the software, the clients can also purchase the extended warranty service from the developer. The study shows that the market size occupied by the developer and the intensity of competition between the two parties will neither affect the developer's product and service pricing decisions, nor influence the total demand for software products and extended warranty services, and thus will not impact his own profit. However, these factors will impact the provider's decisions for pre-sale service quality and software sales price, thereby affecting the provider's software demand and profit, and thus impact the performance of the supply chain. In addition, as the intensity of competition between both parties increases, the provider will simultaneously choose to reduce the pre-sales service quality and the software sales price to compete with the developer. Different from conclusions of the existing research on competition, we surprisingly observe that as the sensitivity of client enterprises to the extended warranty services price increases, both parties will increase the software price to compete. The encroachment of the developer will reduce the provider's software demand and profit, and thus lead to a decline in the performance of the supply chain. Therefore, the encroachment of the developer is an act of squeezing out partners by decreasing the profit of the provider, but without affecting his own profit.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

When procuring electricity, the large consumer faces the risk of insufficient electricity supply. Such insufficiency may be caused by the supply disruption of the upstream electricity generator and the fluctuation of electricity prices in the electricity pool. We establish an expected cost model for the large consumer and a revenue model for the electricity generator by introducing robustness and opportunity functions to analyse the impact of supply disruption and price fluctuation on both members. Then, we obtain the optimal reliability level and subsidy rate. Our analytical results reveal the following points: (1) During an electricity price fluctuation, the sufficient and necessary condition for the large consumer to expect high robustness of his own decision‐making is to pay a high cost. (2) The high uncertainty of electricity price leads to less revenue for the electricity generator; thus, the electricity generator should perform well in price forecasting. (3) Without disruption risk, the electricity generator is reliable. Furthermore, the electricity pool is unreliable from the perspective of price. However, the electricity supply of the electricity generator is no longer reliable when considering disruption risk, whereas the electricity pool is reliable because the large consumer is tolerant of price fluctuation under this circumstance. Moreover, the impacts of market uncertainty and players’ attributes on the optimal strategies are explored.</jats:p>",

The issue of demand uncertainty has been addressed using a scenario-based analysis approach. The main contribution of this research is to investigate the optimization of cross-dock based supply chain under uncertainty using scenario-based formulation and metaheuristic algorithms. The problem has been formulated as a two-objective mathematical model with the objectives of minimizing the costs and minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain. Two metaheuristic algorithms, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO), have been developed to optimize this mathematical model. This paper focuses on the use of new metaheuristic algorithms such as MOIWO in green supply chain network design, which has received less attention in previous studies. The performance of the two solution methods has been evaluated in terms of three indices, which measure the quality, spacing, and diversification of solutions. Evaluations indicate that the developed MOIWO algorithm produces more Pareto solutions and solutions of higher quality than NSGA-II. A performance test carried out with 31 problem instances of different sizes shows that the two methods perform similarly in terms of the spread of solutions on the Pareto front, but MOIWO provides higher quality solutions than NSGA-II.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This study aims to create a mechanism for estimating the productivity of subterranean sources of lakes water supply, based on bathymetric survey data. Lake Svitiaz was chosen as the study site as the deepest closed lake of natural origin in Ukraine with an area of 2500 ha and a maximum depth of 58.4 m. To get depth data, ground-based measurements were conducted using an echosounder <jats:italic>Lowrance LMS-527cDF</jats:italic>. The Lake morphometric changes were investigated, using bathymetric data and Sentinel A, and B data in the digital elevation model (15×15 m). Bathygrahic analysis was performed, allowing selecting areas for further echo-sounding, taking into account complex relief and specific basin forms of the Lake. To develop an appropriate technique for estimating the productivity of subterranean water supply sources, GIS and image (echogram) processing techniques were applied. The research tasks are completed as a technique for detecting ‘tracks’ and a mechanism that is quite effective, particularly for early evaluation of subterranean sources of water supply productivity that can be repeated on any similar water objects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Russian aggression has destroyed much of Ukraine's infrastructure. The mechanism of functioning of supply chains has become unbalanced. Rapid response to challenges and identification of measures to prevent them is identified as a component of the Ukrainian economy in the struggle for victory. Uncertainty is understood as a situation when the probability of a certain event is not fully known. The import of missing data is considered to be a main approach to deal with the issue. The existence of uncertainty means the impossibility of clearly defining the future outcome and the need to respond to a threat that is likely to be an economic risk. The application of Monte Carlo methods in economics is not always acceptable to measure uncertainty. Classical probability theory has certain limitations for practical application to treat uncertainty. The Bayesian theory is applied as a preferable toolkit to address the issue. In practical terms, the main difficulty is to reduce the initial uncertainty given the results of statistical observations. The main approach to solving problems of uncertainty – imputation – enables to substitute the missing data with values determined by a certain algorithm. The main types of imputation are examined in the article. The goal of the research is to set forth an approach dealing with the impact of uncertainties on the economic risk of a supply chain link. The research was performed on the basis of a manufacturing enterprise. The task was to forecast orders for the supply of special metal shapes to fix the roads destroyed during the war. Due to the need to to make decisions when potential consumers of its products have not yet decided on their orders for the supply of its products, the company faces uncertainty challenges. To solve this problem, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm was applied to treat to predict initially missed data. By obtaining full data due to the EM-algorithm under the uncertainty, an equation was obtained to predict the relationship between the technological parameters of roads and the future demand for the company`s products. The equation obtained enables to determine the forecast output of special profiles required to meet the need in rolled shapes. The statistical evaluation of research results testifies to their reliability.</jats:p>"

The optimization for the CLSC network is a complicated problem, since it often has a large problem scale and involves multiple constraints. This paper proposes a general CLSC model to maximize the profits of enterprises by determining the transportation route and delivery volume. Due to the complexity of the multi-constrained and large-scale model, a genetic algorithm with two-step rank-based encoding (GA-TRE) is developed to solve the problem. Firstly, a two-step rank-based encoding is designed to handle the constraints and increase the algorithm efficiency, and the encoding scheme is also used to improve the genetic operators, including crossover and mutation. The first step of encoding is to plan the routes and predict their feasibility according to relevant constraints, and the second step is to set the delivery volume based on the feasible routes using a rank-based method to achieve greedy solutions. Besides, a new mutation operator and an adaptive population disturbance mechanism are designed to increase the diversity of the population. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, six heuristic algorithms are compared with GA-TRE by using different instances with three problem scales. The results show that GA-TRE can obtain better solutions than the competitors, especially on large-scale instances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

On the basis of analysis, a contract is designed to achieve the coordination of the supply chain when members are fairness concern. Some findings are as follows. First, when consumers' purchasing behavior is significantly affected by the reference low-carbon effect, and they have higher expectations for the product's emission reduction level, consumers' reference low-carbon effect will discourage the manufacturer's enthusiasm to reduce emissions, and do harm to the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer. Second, the fairness concern behavior of both parties will aggravate the adverse effects of reference low-carbon effect, bring a detrimental effect on the performance of the supply chain, aggravate the double marginal effect of the supply chain, and cause continuous negative social influence. Third, the bilateral cost-sharing contract can encourage the manufacturer to increase emission reduction investment, the retailer to increase low-carbon promotion investment, and can achieve a Pareto improvement of both parties' profits and utilities. In addition, the two cost-sharing ratios are only proportional to the marginal revenue and fairness concern intensity of both parties. Finally, when the two cost-sharing ratios and the revenue-sharing coefficient meet a certain relationship and are within a reasonable range, the bilateral cost sharing-revenue sharing hybrid contract can reduce the double marginal effect and achieve supply chain coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is to identify which of the factors such as realized price differential, heat-side revenues, generation utilization, optimized plant operation, scaling, etc. have an impact on the investment, operation, as well as the overall business model and profitability, and to what extent.</jats:p>"

Their commonly small size and spatial occurrence suggests addressing volatility issues locally, using local flexibilities to mitigate their impact. This calls for simple and effective signalling that enables interaction among local stakeholders, including local producers and customers. According interfaces and information formats appear to not yet exist. In this article, we propose a traffic-light-like system that enables the local grid operator to trigger situation-aware customer behaviour, supporting grid stability when needed and, in return, allowing customers to fully exploit temporary grid capacity when no safety or stability issues persist. The applied intuitive deduction method based on existing coordination mechanisms and objectives indicates, without proof, that the proposed granular traffic light system can enable the distribution grid flexibility required to facilitate more renewable energy being produced and inserted by local customers, to relieve grid levels above from transporting and equalising volatile energy shares, and to improve the economics of distributed renewable energy sources.</jats:p>"

The government also actively applies technologies to traditional fields to promote social progress. In agriculture, the agricultural supply chain has a low information level and low degree of digitization. The application of blockchain technology in agriculture offers exceptional advantages because of its decentralization, openness, and transparency. Based on the application of blockchain in an agricultural scenario, an evolutionary game model made up of governments, telecom operators, and agricultural enterprises was established to analyze the model’s equilibrium stability and evolutionary stable strategy. Then, numerical simulation was carried out to study the influence of the initial green level, equipment deployment cost, technology operation cost, and other core factors on the tripartite evolution behaviour. The results show that each factor influences the behaviour of a third party in different ways. Finally, according to the simulation results, this paper puts forward practical suggestions, explores the long-term impact of the application cost and sustainable income of blockchain technology on cooperation, and provides new ideas for the governance of China’s traditional fields from the perspective of new technology application.</jats:p>"

The term supply chain transparency is used very loosely in this discourse. Therefore, this article aims to clarify the understanding of supply chain transparency in the context of sustainability to enable future research. In a content analysis-based literature review, 92 peer-reviewed articles were identified in the intersection of sustainability, supply chains, and transparency. Only 30 articles contained a definition of transparency. Supply chain transparency was used and defined very differently among the researchers. By providing a general definition and framework of sustainable supply chain transparency, the term “supply chain transparency” gains more clarity. Three dimensions of transparency were identified: sustainable supply chain information, involved stakeholders, and perspective. The supply chain transparency research was conducted primarily in the context of the food and apparel industry. Transparency was characterized differently among the industries and was studied with different foci. Furthermore, the review revealed a focus of supply chain transparency research on the social dimension of sustainability. Additionally, a wide range of topics on supply chain transparency has been covered in the existing literature, and opportunities for future research are outlined. Future researchers are also encouraged to define transparency more clearly.</jats:p>",

Focusing on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with recovery competition (on collecting price and collecting service) and distinguishing collecting quality, we propose two models (decentralized and centralized models) to study the collection strategies and profits of the CLSC. Moreover, we analyze the impact of the collecting competition and quality on the CLSC. Finally, a revenue-cost sharing contract (RCSC) is introduced to coordinate the supply chain. And a numerical example is illustrated to verify the contract's efficiency. It is found that the collected quantities and profits of the CLSC members are positively correlated with the remanufacturable ratio. The collecting competition dampens consumers' enthusiasm for recycling, which is not conducive to collectors to carry out collecting activity, resulting in the reduction of the CLSC's profit. The collectors appropriately improving collecting prices and service levels can increase the collected quantities, but to cope with the increasing competition, increasing collecting price is the main means for collectors to attract consumers to recycle. In addition, the designed RCSC can effectively improve the CLSC's efficiency and increase the profits of each party.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Heavy equipment machines are essentially required and vital role in construction and production to be done in a shorter time, low cost, and massive amount of production. In Myanmar, Heavy equipment machines and spare parts were not able to produce, and such kind of products are importing from abroad. Therefore, supply chain management (SCM) process is main characteristics, and performance of SCM process is playing as a critical role in Myanmar Heavy Equipment Machinery Industry (Myanmar HEMI). Purpose of this review paper is to present the current SCM practices of Myanmar heavy equipment machinery industry and applying of SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) latest model SCOR 12.0, and to explore the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to be developed the process of SCM in Myanmar HEMI. This paper has conducted review and evidence-based research design, and qualitative method for surveying authorized dealer organizations of worldwide market share top 10 brands in Myanmar HEMI. The results of this review paper stated that current SCM practices of Myanmar HEMI are reached to below SCOR 12.0 standard operation processes, and organizations within industry must learn more knowledge about SCM and benefits of applying SCM practices. This paper suggested that how to apply and implement the standard processes of SCOR 12.0 in Myanmar HEMI. Additionally, this paper introduced and recommended to apply SCM 4.0 version in near future, which is fully applied the Internet of Things (IoT), modern technologies, and digital based supply chain management latest model and it contributes for more benefits in competing and developing within Myanmar HEMI organizations.</jats:p>"

First, the author sets out the steps taken in international regulations and in various state-made legislations in this field, highlighting the pioneering nature of US legislation, the transcendence of the English model, and especially French legislation, in this latter case for inaugurating a more substantive due diligence requirement. And, based on a comparative analysis of these and other legislations, as well as on a series of reports of relevance in this area, the author highlights diğerent functions that this legislation holds (to protect human rights, fair competition and a general public interest beyond those aspects). The author also shows the evolution that this legislation has undergone over time. Finally, the author presents the most relevant questions and options for dealing with them, favoring a regulatory “pattern” to be followed by state or supranational legislation that has not yet dealt with this issue or to pay attention by those others which, having regulated it, identifies possible gaps to be filled in.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of society and the improvement of environmental consciousness, the performance of corporate environmental responsibility (CER) has elicited increasing attention in recent years. In previous studies, the exploration of the antecedents of CER is far less evident than the exploration of its results, and only few studies have investigated what determines CER engagement from the perspective of supply chain concentration (SCC). Using data from 2413 firms in China from 2013 to 2019, our study uses the fixed effect model and performs multiple robustness tests to examine the impact of SCC on the fulfillment of CER, its transmission mechanism, and the moderating role of technology uncertainty (TU). Empirical results show that SCC has a pivotal negative impact on CER performance, wherein both supplier concentration (SUP) and customer concentration (CUS) are detrimental to CER performance. Further mechanism analysis shows that such negative effect can be explained by the adverse effect of SCC on the operating cash flow (OCF), in which OCF has a partial mediating effect. Moreover, the negative impact of SCC on CER performance is more significant when the uncertainty of firms’ technological environment is stronger. Our study opens the transmission “black box” between SCC and CER performance and incorporates the behaviors of firms, inter-firm relationships, and environmental factors into the same research framework, and provides a theoretical guidance for management practices.</jats:p>"

The study examined the relationship between fast delivery, accidental management, top management and sustainable logistics growth. Top management is used as a moderating variable. In this study, the Thai logistic companies are investigated, therefore, the population of the study is on logistics companies of Thailand. Data were collected from the employees of logistics companies to examine the effect of fast delivery, accidental management and top management on sustainable logistics growth. A survey was carried out and 450 questionnaires were distributed among the employees. Results of the study show that sustainable logistics growth is the most important for the logistics companies influenced by the fast delivery, accidental management and top management. Fast delivery has a positive effect on sustainable logistics growth. Increase in fast delivery increases the sustainable logistics growth. Moreover, accidental management also has a positive effect on sustainable logistics growth. Better accidental management has a positive role to enhance sustainable logistics growth. Additionally, top management also shows a positive role in sustainable logistics growth.</jats:p>"

However, many evidences show that a retailer wants to choose the decision-making involving random demand which provides him with minimum regret. In this paper, we consider the impacts of retailers' anticipated regret aversion and experiential regret aversion on the equilibrium decision-makings of a random SCN with multiple production periods. Due to the random demand, the decision-makings of retailers are influenced not only by their anticipated regret, but also by their experiential regret after they have encountered bad or good experiences during past periods. The equilibrium conditions of the model are established. A numerical example is solved to illustrate the benefit of retailers obtained by considering their regret-averse behaviors. Moreover, it is found that retailers should consider their anticipated regret aversion or experiential regret aversion according to different situations of the demand markets.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Vegetable waste is a collection of various kinds of vegetables after being sorted because they are not suitable for sale. Almost all vegetable waste will undergo lactic acid fermentation carried out by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gram-positive bacteria, do not form spores, are catalase negative, are resistant to acidic conditions, and are facultative anaerobes. The purpose of this study was to determine the correct composition of rice washing water and granulated sugar for the highest number of microbes in MOL. MOL optimization was carried out by means of anaerobic fermentation for 14 days. The results of this study indicate that the microbes contained in MOL are Bacillus subtillus, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Spirillum, Streptoverticillium, and Leuconostoc mesenterousdes. The highest total population of microorganisms in variations in the composition of rice washing water and sugar is in sample C1 which is 91 x 105 Colonies/100 mL in MOL vegetable waste, which is 650 mL of rice washing water and 100 grams of sugar.</jats:p>"

As a country where a large majority of adults identify on the ideological scale but whose weak political parties primarily function as short-lived personalist platforms, Guatemala represents an extreme case of a demand supply mismatch. Using six AmericasBarometer surveys from 2008 to 2018, we analyze the supply-side (partisanship) and demand-side (ideological identification) effect on voter turnout to identify whether the manifestation of this market failure applies evenly to voters across the ideological scale. We report a nuanced outcome: partisanship and identification on the right of the ideological scale increase turnout, but identification on the center or the left display no significant effect. The absence of parties that effectively represents left-wing or centrist voters—or that at least induce them to turn out to vote—points to a supply-side problem in Guatemala's political representation market. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The pandemic has an impact on almost all sectors of people's lives, in the economic, political, and socio-cultural sectors. The government has implemented large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) as an effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. With the PSBB, it causes disruption to the hospital supply chain management. As a step to anticipate the hospital's impact on the PSBB, the hospital needs to evaluate the performance of supply chain management. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the performance evaluation of hospital supply chain management using a balanced scorecard approach. A new finding from this study is to measure the performance of hospitals experiencing various disruptions in their supply chain management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with a balanced scorecard. The author concludes that measurements with the balanced scorecard approach can provide information about the performance of hospital supply chain management broadly in areas experiencing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>"

Based on the theory of spatial accessibility and spatial balance of supply and demand, this paper constructs the evaluation system of rural basic education facilities and layout rationality. In this study, we took 42 primary and secondary schools and 2089 rural areas with concentrated population in six township areas of Hancheng City as the research subjects. We used ArcGIS network analysis, population coupling model, and other methods, from the administrative scale and rural population concentration area scale for evaluation. The accessibility of basic education facilities and its coupling relationship with the spatial distribution of student population describe the spatial and geographical pattern of basic education facilities in rural areas. The results show that the accessibility of rural administrative scale and the spatial balance of supply and demand of population concentration area scale are associated with great problems, the differences between towns are obvious, and the overall level of the best performing towns is still low. On the scale of population concentration area, the overall coupling degree is too low, the “dislocation” distribution of educational facilities and student population is obvious, and the matching degree of the student population and school in different towns is significantly different, showing a more obvious “core-periphery” spatial structure characteristics centered on the eastern and southeast regions. The terrain characteristics of rural areas in Shaanxi province are prominent, and the accessibility of the road network is particularly significant. Therefore, optimizing the construction of rural roads and optimizing school layout according to local conditions will become an important solution to promote the balanced allocation of basic education resources in Shaanxi province.</jats:p>"

The case sheds light on the gathering of information concerning the milk production through a network of advanced internet of things sensors, the output of which is employed both for data-driven decision-making and for information certification through blockchain. This trustable and certified information could be shared and employed by other stakeholders to get informed about the status of the production process and, in turn, to potentially deliver an enlarged set of details about the product, progressively up to the end consumers, with implications of technology adoption for food tech-firms and on related impacts on a circular economy. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses the features of the distribution of ferrous scrap between the main metallurgical enterprises of the Russian Federation. It is revealed that the current configuration of the actual raw material zones of metallurgical enterprises of the Russian Federation is due to the uneven nature of scrap sources and end users, the export orientation of regions and the established institutional structure of regional ferrous scrap markets in the post-Soviet period. Based on the use of geoinformation technologies, the optimal configuration of raw material zones of metallurgical enterprises in the field of procurement of ferrous scrap has been determined. To assess the optimality of raw material zones of enterprises, two methods are proposed in the work – cartographic and economic. As a result of a comparative analysis of the calculation results, it was revealed that the economic method best evaluates the optimality of raw material zones in connection with the best consideration of the features of territorial schemes for the movement of ferrous scrap between producers and end consumers. According to the economic method, the metallurgical enterprises of the Ural metallurgical base have a low degree of optimality of raw material zones and, as a result, large losses in financial terms, mainly due to the extremely high concentration of metallurgical enterprises, small/medium losses have enterprises in the north, center and east of the country, where the demand for raw materials is a limited number of enterprises remote from each other. In the final part of the article, recommendations are presented to increase the economic efficiency from optimizing the distribution and the use of ferrous scrap for individual economic agents and the economy as a whole.</jats:p>"

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has affected over 179 million people and killed approximately 3.9 million people in more than 200 countries across the globe (WHO,2021). This outbreak has not only affected people’s lives but also disrupted global supply chains. It has shown significant effects on businesses, consumers, and the global economy. Fear of the virus has led to many companies scrambling to respond regarding employees’ job security, ensuring supply security, risk mitigation strategy, and addressing market uncertainties that are driving down demand. Broadly, the objective of this article is to highlight issues faced by the upstream palm oil supply chain actors during this pandemic. Based on the problem, the study concluded that some forms of actions (short-term &amp; long-term) have been proposed to ensure an agile palm oil supply chain.</p>",

The authors examine the relationship between people and food, not only supplied from outside and sold in rural stores, but also produced within the community in the course of the interaction of local people with the landscape. The research presents the results of fieldwork conducted in 2017–2019 in the Iultinskiy rayon of the Chukotka autonomous okrug. The paper analyses the temporality of food as well as the supply paradoxes that local people face on а daily basis. Trying to answer the question about the reasons for the appearance of expired food products in the villages of Chukotka, the authors focus on the processes of the transformation of materiality of food and the mobility of food products. The article discusses strategies for maintaining food autonomy by local people in order to minimize dependence on supplies from public and private trading companies in a context of limited and low-quality supply. The authors conclude that expired food is the result of infrastructural inequality and, accordingly, unequal opportunities for organizing high-quality supply. Overdue food products act simultaneously as a temporal and spatial phenomenon. They appear as a result of a combination of both multiple displacements and states of immobility.</jats:p>"

Data were collected using online energy monitoring and commercial metering system. Features of the static and dynamic load regulation of hot water systems have been investigated. The effect of methods for regulating the heat load of hot water supply systems on their actual heat consumption has been analyzed. An assessment has been made of the possibility of bringing the actual operating mode of the hot water systems to the specified value which is the basis for calculating the consumption rate. Ways to improve the efficiency of hot water supply systems have been determined. Conclusions have been drawn concerning the need to revise the standardized indicators of hot water quality and adjust the methodology for calculating the consumption rate in hot water supply systems.</jats:p>",

Based on modern research methods using statistical data and a review of domestic and foreign literature, a review of methods and technologies for desalination and desaltation of highly mineralized natural waters was carried out. The use of sea water for domestic purposes is impossible due to the high content of minerals, however, after desalination, such water can be used for drinking. The choice of technologies and methods of desalination is primarily determined by the quality of source water, as well as the requirements for the quality of treated water, plant productivity and technical and economic calculations. For the drinking water supply purposes, the most efficient and cost-effective method is desalination using reverse osmosis technology, used for both sea and groundwater with high salinity. Reverse osmosis technology has significant advantages over thermal desalination, especially when applied to small-scale plants of small domestic water supply systems. The use of reverse osmosis plants will significantly increase productivity of drinking water output per watt of electricity consumed.  Conclusions. The introduction of modern technologies and careful attention to water consumption play a significant role in maintaining water balance in different countries. The most cost-effective and efficient method is seawater desalination using reverse osmosis plants. Despite the fact that water desalination and desaltion plants are very expensive, the conservation of natural waters is a priority nowadays.</jats:p>"

Показано, что цифровая нить должна обеспечить, с одной стороны, перемещение материальных потоков в рамках логистической цепочки, а с другой – обмен информационными потоками при взаимодействии цифровых платформ управляющего центра и объектов организационной системы. Задача заключается в принятии управленческого решения о необходимости модернизации эксплуатируемой системы цифрового управления логистическим процессом в сравнении с результатами многовариантного моделирования и оптимизации структуры цифровой нити. В первую очередь, осуществляется модельная оценка показателей эффективности информационного обмена в случае базовых структур взаимодействия цифровых платформ управляющего центра и объектов, образующих логистическую цепочку: централизованной и децентрализованной. С целью расширения возможностей экспертного оценивания нового варианта цифрового управления логистическим процессом осуществляется имитационное моделирование процессов перемещения материальных потоков и обмена данными для оптимизации трехуровневой кластерной структуры цифровой нити.

The task is to make a managerial decision regarding the necessity to modernize the operating system of the logistics process digital control in comparison with the results of multivariate modeling and optimization of the digital thread structure. First of all, a model assessment of information exchange efficiency indicators is carried out in the case of basic structures of interaction between digital platforms of the control center and objects that form the supply chain: centralized and decentralized. In order to expand the expert evaluation possibilities of the new version of the logistics process digital management, simulation of the material flows movement processes and data exchange is undertaken to optimize the three-level cluster structure of the digital thread. All these stages of making a managerial decision are combined into a structural scheme for choosing an effective option for implementing a digital thread of supply chains.</jats:p>",

The large number of medicinal plant shops (Attari) in the center of Mazar-e-Sharif city indicates that the citizens of Balkh province are familiar with medicinal plants and their uses. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the socioeconomic characteristics, medicinal plant distribution patterns, consumption methods, and types of medicinal plants in the Mazar-e-Sharif city Attaris. Materials and Methods: The study focused on 102 Attaris in the research area, research factors such as the age of medicinal plant sellers, monthly income, education level, marital status, number of people working in Attaris, and work experience of Attaris were studied. Findings: The results revealed that the average age of people in Attaris is 49 years with a work experience of about 15 years, and only 3% have an education related to medicinal plants. About 20 % of medicinal plant sellers had a university education but not related to medicinal plants science, about 17 % had a diploma, 30 % had a high school education and the remaining 12 % had primary education. Unbelievably, about 50 % of consumers were rich people and the remaining 50 % of the clients were low-income. People visited Attari's to heal their digestive system disorders are the most common health issues, followed by issues with the kidneys, bladder, and urinary system, respiratory conditions, skin and wound issues, hypertension and cardiovascular conditions, liver issues, diabetes, typhoid, pain, helminthiasis, anorexia, gynecological complaints, sexual dysfunction, weakness, fever, and obesity. Lemon balm, Common jujube, Starflower, Black pepper, Cumin, and Turmeric were the high-selling medicinal plants offered in Mazar-e-Sharif Attaris'. Conclusion: A large number of medicinal plant shops (Attaris) in the center of Mazar-e-Sharif city indicates that the citizens of Balkh province are familiar with medicinal plants and their uses. However, unfavorable economic situation of some people who referred Attaris showed that the existence of traditional medicine systems (Attaris) is considered to be one of the urgent needs of the Mazar-e-Sharif.</jats:p>"

Moving raw materials, semi-finished products and finished products are possible in the case of the use of vehicles, which adequately reflects the practical importance of the concept of transport and logistics activities. Therefore, to achieve optimization of logistics functions and operations, and, as a consequence, the goals of logistics, an important aspect is the choice of modern vehicles for the transportation of goods. Vehicle operations usually represent the largest total logistics cost due to the purchase of fuel and lubricants, proper organization of vehicle service, including the timely and comprehensive performance of all types of maintenance. In this regard, the concept of introducing electric vehicles is rapidly developing in the world, changing the idea of possibilities of an electric car not only as an individual vehicle for transportation but also as a transport, acquires relevance in the field of logistics and freight transport. The purpose of the work is to analyse the current state of the electric vehicle industry in the world and Ukraine. As well as to substantiate ways to optimize the use of electrically powered vehicles in supply chain management, depending on their technical characteristics.Results. Samples of electric vehicles produced in the EU and the USA are shown. The possibility of using electric vehicles as the main vehicles is considered, provided that their dispersion in the middle of the supply chain is taken into account. A scheme for the use of electric vehicles in the supply chain management process is proposed, which covers the dispersion of electric vehicles following the functional areas of logistics. The proposed scheme for the use of electric vehicles in the supply chain management process, taking into account the functional areas of logistics, has established that it is most expedient to use electric vehicles with a carrying capacity of 1,75−36 tons at the stages of procurement and production, and additionally with a carrying capacity of up to 1,75 tons to distribution points. Electric vehicles with a carrying capacity of up to 700 kg can be effectively used to provide services and technical support in the process of supply chain management. The scientific novelty of the research is that, for the first time, using the \"Model of one vehicle on the route\", the dependence of the stay time of electric vehicles Renault Kangoo Z.E., Volkswagen e-Crafter and Tesla Semi in the operating conditions of the route, on the distance of transportation was obtained.</jats:p>"

The need to improve performance on multiple fronts is compounded by sources of uncertainty that include upstream diversity of supply chain (SC) partners, internal diversity of clinical specialties provided, and downstream diversity of patient conditions. Information processing theory (IPT) suggests two strategies for dealing with uncertainty: reduce the amount of information elevated to higher levels for processing and accommodate the amount of information by increasing information processing at other levels. We apply IPT to investigate (i) the relationship between the two information processing strategies in a hospital's SC and its cost containment, clinical quality, and patient satisfaction performance, and (ii) how these relationships may be moderated by diversity in the hospital's SC partners, clinical specialties, and patients, the common sources of uncertainty in hospital SCs. These questions were examined using regression analysis of primary data from acute care hospitals matched with secondary data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, American Hospital Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measuring hospital operating characteristics and performance. The analysis yielded several important findings: (i) while a slack resources strategy (uncertainty reduction) is effective for improving patient satisfaction performance, it is ineffective for reducing cost, (ii) a lateral relations strategy (uncertainty accommodation) is effective in improving all three performance dimensions, and (iii) these relationships are moderated differentially by the three diversity dimensions only for lateral relations. These findings offer important managerial insights about hospitals’ efforts to improve potentially conflicting performance outcomes and suggest interesting opportunities for future research applying IPT to this important topic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance The article is devoted to the study of the possibility of occurrence of ferroresonant processes in power supply systems with distributed generation. Ferroresonant processes cause overvoltages in electrical installations and lead to their failure. In backbone and distribution networks without distributed generation facilities, the phenomenon of ferroresonance has been studied quite deeply, effective hardware and operational measures have been developed to prevent the occurrence of ferroresonance surges in electrical installations. However, the issue of the occurrence of ferroresonant processes in power supply systems with distributed generation, which is a promising direction in the development of the energy sector, seems to be little studied. Aim of research The main aim of the research is to investigate circuit-mode conditions for the occurrence of ferroresonant processes in power supply systems with distributed generation. Research methods To study the circuit-mode conditions for the occurrence of ferroresonant processes in power supply systems with distributed generation, the main provisions of the theory of electrical complexes and systems, the theory of nonlinear electrical circuits, and the principles of controlling objects of electrical complexes and industrial systems were used. Results The circuit-mode conditions for the occurrence of ferroresonant processes in power supply systems with distributed generation are studied. The power supply system of a HF radio center, containing a power plant with a lower installed power or corresponding to the maximum power consumption of the load, was chosen as the object of study. The features of the scheme-mode conditions for the occurrence of ferroresonant processes under conditions of distributed generation are as follows. Due to the insignificant remoteness of distributed generation facilities and consumers, additional opportunities arise for subharmonic ferroresonant processes. When a generating plant is connected to low-voltage busbars, conditions are created for the occurrence of a ferroresonant process involving low-voltage windings of power transformers. The low dynamic stability of generating installations of distributed generation facilities based on synchronous generators reduces the likelihood and duration of ferroresonant processes in the event of phase wire breaks and short circuits on the power line. Generating plants connected via grid inverters have a limited output current and can be turned off by emergency automatics in the event of an emergency operation of the grid, which, as a rule, precedes the appearance of ferroresonant overvoltages in electrical installations. Thus, in power districts with distributed generation facilities, the circuit-mode conditions for the occurrence of ferroresonant processes, known in the centralized power supply system, undergo changes, and it is also possible to form new ferroresonant oscillatory circuits.

In these systems, it is very important to provide autonomy of permanent, reliable and quality power supply. In this case, the power supply system is in effect based on the use of solar energy i.e., photovoltaic (PV), in combination with the mains power supply 230V, 50Hz. Solar power is the primary source of power during the day, while in night conditions the secondary power supply is a distribution power grid (more precisely, the distribution power which is used for supplying the night street lighting). This hybrid power system is realized with two controlled chargers (MPPT solar and mains with input power factor correction), battery bank 12V/110Ah with the corresponding system for its monitoring and secondary DC/DC power converters for supplying telecommunication and measuring electronic modules. The key implementation and experimental results obtained during the realization of a SAWS remote measuring station on the river Ub (municipality of Ub), will be presented in the paper.</jats:p>"

In the complex supply chain of agricultural products, they are scattered upstream and downstream. It is difficult to form agglomeration scale effect, information asymmetry between supply chain nodes, and poor hardware environment of supply chain. Logistics operation is difficult. By analyzing the supply chain of agricultural products, optimize the supply chain by using the push‐pull supply chain. According to the change of market demand, the push mode and the pull mode are properly allocated and the government’s attention to the supply chain is increased, intentionally the Internet is combined with the supply chain, the stability of the supply chain is increased, and there is a certain adaptability to market demand fluctuations. Problems can be fed back to the suppliers and final buyers of agricultural products in time, and the delivery rate of the whole supply chain should be improved.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, during uncertain situations today, the stakeholders need to enhance the capability of import and export activities to improve logistics performance. The study focused on the competitiveness of the manufacturing products traded by these countries. The study used panel data analysis based on the panel data of 11 years (2008-2018) from the 10 ASEAN+3 countries. Export value and Net Comparative Advantage (NCA) index (including net export and trade openness) were used as dependent variables in the two model studies, and logistics performance was the primary variable. The result shows that logistics performance positively affects the export and trade competitiveness models of ASEAN+3’s manufacturing products. The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) provides estimates that suggest that logistics performance has a significant impact on ASEAN + 3 export value (ExpM) and manufacturing trade competitiveness (NCAM). Meanwhile, there are different results of the effects of macroeconomic variables between the model of export value (ExpM) and the NCAM in the manufacturing in ASEAN+3’s. The ExpM model follows the theory that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increase the competitive value in ASEAN+3 countries. Meanwhile, in the NCAM model, GDP and FDI reduce trade competitiveness because of the high value of ASEAN+3 manufacturing imports.</jats:p>"

To improve the efficiency of value chain activities such as manufacturing, distribution, and consumption, an innovative research solution has been proposed: ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)'. Sustainability through ICT is significant for the industry in terms of its sustainable effects on production processes, environment, and community. This research seeks to gauge ICT—as knowledge management—for industries in the successful adoption and execution of SCP. In so doing, potential key ICT-based factors to SCP are identified from the literature and experts' feedback. The present work suggests a decision framework for assessing the interrelationships among and between the ICT oriented factors by utilizing graph theory and matrix approach. Data for this work derives from three automotive companies operating in India. From findings, ‘Governance and Management', is the topmost factor for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production in value chains. The relationship among the index values is further evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This research can facilitate practitioners, government agencies, and customers for a better understanding of ICT-driven factors in managing resources, reducing waste, and improving cost, which would further help in meeting sustainable development goals of the United Nations of responsible consumption and production and innovation, industry, and infrastructure.</jats:p>"

We document that this covenant style effect is smaller when borrowers have recently violated a debt covenant or when the loan issue amount is large, and it is larger when the costs of contracting are highest and when a borrower provides collateral. We also find that the covenant style effect decreases following changes in a bank's CEO or CFO.

A nexus-based approach is developed to explore cooperation opportunities in transboundary river basins while considering system operation and coordination under uncertain hydrologic river regimes. The proposed approach is applied to the Nile river basin with a special focus on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), assuming two possible governance positions: with or without cooperation. A cooperation mechanism is developed to allocate additional releases from the GERD when necessary, while a unilateral position assumes that the GERD is operated to maximize hydropower generation regardless of downstream users' needs. The GERD operation modes were analysed considering operation of downstream reservoirs and varying demands in Egypt. Results show that average basin-wide hydropower generation is likely to increase by about 547 GWh/year (1%) if cooperation is adopted when compared to the unilateral position. In Sudan, hydropower generation and water supply are expected to enhance in the unilateral position and would improve further with cooperation. Furthermore, elevated low flows by the GERD are likely to improve the WFE nexus outcomes in Egypt under full cooperation governance scenario with a small reduction in GERD hydropower generation (2,000 GWh/year (19%)).</jats:p>",

By comparing the equilibrium results of each game model and conducting numerical simulation analysis, we reveal the effects of the competition-cooperation relationship and R&amp;D mode on supply chain decision-making. The results show the following: (1) A fully cooperative innovation strategy can maximise the total profit of automobile manufacturers, but it will reduce the profit of the automobile dealer. (2) When the horizontal competition is not fierce and the consumption preference for technical content is weak, innovation strategy of competition cooperation (competition but cooperative R&amp;D) can enable the automobile dealer to obtain the maximum profit.

Like many other cancers, survival in Black adults lags behind Non-Hispanic White adults. One explanation for the mortality and survival gap may be due to the propensity for Black adults to be diagnosed at later stages. The prognosis for early stage oral cancer can be quite positive. Despite inconsistent screening reccomendations, dental professionals have established oral cancer screening as a standard of care for all comprehensive evaluations. However, in addition to the lack of access to dental coverage, limited availability of dental professionals may be, in part, driving the disparity in late stage diagnoses for Black Americans. Objective: This study aims to estimate the relationship between the Black-White disparity in late stage oral cancer diagnoses and the supply of dentists. Methodology: Data for this study comes from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Wonder portal and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) provider dataset. To develop a measure of Black-White disparity in late stage oral cancer diagnoses, first, the proportion of late stage diagnoses of all oral cancer diagnoses were obtained for both Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White adults for years 2011-2015. Data was aggregated to Health Servica Area level and restricted to states in the Southeast. The outcome of interest was derived by the difference between the Non-Hispanic Black proportion of late stage diagnoses and the Non-Hispanic White proportion. This exploratory study utilized a linear regression model to estimate the relationship between this difference and the supply of dental professionals per capita in each paired Health Service Area (HSA). Results: The mean proportion of late stage diagnoses were 70.8% and 61.9% for Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White adults, respectively. The mean difference in late stage diagnoses, at the HSA level, was approximately 8.0%. This differnce, appeared to decline as the per capita supply of dentists increased (Est = -0.03, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Putting this association in context, to reduce the Black-White disparity in late stage diagnoses by 1-percentage point, 33 dentists per 100,000 population must be added to the HSA. Conclusion: Greater availability to dental professionals may play an important role in reducing racial disparities in oral cancer. Still, this exploratory work is only the begining for inferring a causal relationhip between increasing dental supply and decreasing differences in late stage oral cancer diagnoses. Even under the assumption of causality, policies aiming to increase dental supply in shortage areas must ensure equitable and just access for Black communities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Jason Semprini.

To fill this knowledge gap and capture the latest developments in this field, a systematic literature review was performed. Forty-one papers were selected and thoroughly examined and analysed to identify the enablers of BD in the food supply chain. The review primarily attempted to obtain an answer to the following research question: “What are the possibilities of leveraging big data in the food supply chain?“ Six significant benefits of applying BD in the food industry were identified, namely, the extraction of valuable knowledge and insights, decision-making support, improvement of food chain efficiencies, reliable forecasting, waste minimization, and food safety.

The purpose of this paper is to formulate a three echelon supply chain model when the demand of items is assumed to be stochastically dependent on price, quality and reduction of energy. In the centralized model, suppler, manufacturer and retailer are the three members of the supply chain. The model is solved analytically to obtain optimal values of order quantity, unit price, promotional effort and amount of energy consumption which maximizes the profit function of the supply chain. Two decentralized models namely MR-Nash and MS-Nash have also been considered in a separate section. These two models have also been solved analytically to obtain the optimal solution of the decision variables. Three proposed models have been illustrated with a numerical example by considering exponential distribution of customer's demand. The sensitivity of the optimal solution revealed the appropriate channel strategy in case of decentralized scenario.

Seedlings experienced 32 days under daytime-fed (DF), night-time-fed (NF), or continuous (CT) N supply. The root N uptake rate (NUR) differed between DF and NF from day 3 of treatment, after which NUR was significantly increased (by up to 82%) in DF and NF plants. The increased NUR during each half-day did not fully compensate for lost access to N during the other half-day, resulting in lower N accumulation by the end of the treatment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Big data technology can collect data, store it, mine it, and create an accurate portrait. It can assist financial institutions in resolving information asymmetry between banks and enterprises, as well as lowering the likelihood of default of small and medium-sized financing enterprises (SMEs). The credit risk system for SMEs in supply chain finance can realize “visualization” management of credit risk with the help of open public data in government affairs, collaborative development of various technologies, and the establishment of an ecological platform with transparent and accurate data portraits. The platform with accurate risk warning capability can reduce the risk monitoring cost and improve the risk management efficiency of financial institutions. The core enterprises are more willing to grant credit to SMEs through the big data technology supervision platform, which significantly improves the financing efficiency of SMEs. Moreover, a better financing credit circumstance also could improve transaction efficiency of enterprises and deeply connect the business relationship between enterprises. The main conclusion of this research: big data technology has a significant impact on supply chain in the digital economy era. Firstly, big data technology can identify credit risks accurately, which narrows the \"information gap\" between financial institutions and supply chain financing enterprises, and lower the likelihood of credit default. Secondly, financial institutions can allocate funds accurately based on the “visualization” information provided by the big data platform, and strengthen supervision of the use of funds. Lastly, the supply chain finance credit risk supervision system based on big data technology promotes the deep integration of big data and real economy. Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainable development of supply chain finance and financing risk management, it is necessary to create a digital ecosystem of supply chain finance with supply chain finance control tower as its core, as well as a supply chain finance credit risk control system based on big data in the context of the continuous development of big data technology.</jats:p>"

The control of the water supply system is influenced by a combination of pump installation in parallel and series to produce the required performance. The plant simulator water supply system is designed in several types of installations, namely single pumps, series pumps, parallel pumps, and faucets as disturbances. In addition to the effect of installation, plant simulator control using PID is needed to produce the desired water pressure. The plant simulator for each installation is modeled using system identification, so that the control process can be designed in a simulation before being implemented. The results of this study indicate that the parallel pump installation on the plant simulator water supply system provides the smallest average drop in water pressure when disturbed, which is 16.92% for each tap opening.Keywords: water supply, parallel series pump, identification, simulator, PID</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Counterfeiting is common in many industries. For the authenticity of online channel products and to combat counterfeiting, many companies have begun to use blockchain technology to trace product information. This paper investigates a dual‐channel supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, in which the manufacturer sells its standard products through the retailer and adopts blockchain technology to launch the online channel to sell the traceable products. A Stackelberg game is developed to depict the pricing decision and channel strategy choice for the manufacturer. It shows that both the manufacturer and the retailer can benefit from blockchain adoption. And the longer it takes for product traceability, the lower the price of online traceable products. It is beneficial for the manufacturer when consumers in the market are less concerned about information transparency. For consumer sensitivity, as consumers’ acceptance of direct sales channels increases, the selling prices of online traceable products have risen. Furthermore, as the traceability time‐sensitivity coefficient increases, the sales price of the traceable products decreases, and the retail price of offline standard products rises. The conclusion of this paper has a certain guiding role for the dominant manufacturers in choosing whether to apply blockchain technology to improve the demand for traceable products.</jats:p>",

To cope with the recent client demand trend asking for rapid response, quality, and diversified goods, today’s manufacturers require a multi-item production-shipping scheme to satisfy customers’ needs in cost-saving, quality, and timely matter. In our model, we first produce all needed mutual components and postpone manufacturing of finished goods in the second phase. To expedite mutual parts’ fabrication time, overtime is used. Product quality is reassured through screening the defeats and reworking repairable defectives in both fabrication phases. To decide the optimal fabrication-shipment policy, we build a math model and apply the cost minimization technique to the problem. Upon deriving the optimal policy, we utilize an example to demonstrate how our model works and its capability in exposing various previously inaccessible information to the problem. These detailed results can facilitate managerial decision-making and boost the performance of such a specific multi-item postponement fabrication-shipment system in cost-saving, product quality, and timely response.</jats:p>"

The location of Grudziądz on the high escarpment of the Vistula River made it difficult to supply water to the town. The innovative technical facilities, such as a water-work and water supply tower had to be constructed because the gravitational waterworks could not be applied. The basis for the research was the analysis of historical sources. In this study, non-invasive methods were used (aerial prospection, LiDAR scanning and geophysical surveys with Ground Penetrating Radar), since the hydrotechnical objects are located in a functioning urban space and no excavations could be carried out. The research included: (i) the measurements, exploration and preparation of photo-documentation of the water tower, (ii) providing a digital model of the tower, (iii) finding the tunnel inside the tower, and (iv) attempting to locate the tunnel's course outside the tower.</jats:p>",

The majority of existing studies focuses on sensitivity or burst identification ability of monitoring systems based on certain specific operating conditions of WSNs, while nodal connectivity or long-term hydraulic fluctuation is not fully considered and analyzed. A new method of pressure sensor placement is proposed in this paper based on Graph Neural Networks. The method mainly consists of two steps: monitoring partition establishment and sensor placement. (1) Structural Deep Clustering Network algorithm is used for clustering analysis with the integration of complicated topological and hydraulic characteristics, and a WSN is divided into several monitoring partitions. (2) Then, sensor placement is carried out based on burst identification analysis, a quantitative metric named “indicator tensor” is developed to calculate hydraulic characteristics in time series, and the node with the maximum average partition perception rate is selected as the sensor in each monitoring partition. The results showed that the proposed method achieved a better monitoring scheme with more balanced distribution of sensors and higher coverage rate for pipe burst detection. This paper offers a new robust framework, which can be easily applied in the decision-making process of monitoring system establishment.</jats:p>"

These formulations are developed in the presence of demand, budget, and local supply uncertainties and for single-items delivery. Academic/practical relevance: The immediate period aftermath of a disaster is the most crucial period during which humanitarian organizations must supply relief items to beneficiaries. Yet, because of many unknowns such as time, place, and magnitude of a disaster, supply management is a significant challenge, and these decisions are made intuitively. The features and complexities we examine have not been studied in the literature. Methodology: We derive properties of the optimal solution, identify exact solution methods, and determine approximate methods that are easy to implement. Results: We (i) characterize the interplay of supply, demand, and budget uncertainties, as well as the impact of product characteristics on optimal prepo stock levels; (ii) show in what conditions the prepo stock is a simple newsvendor solution; and (iii) discuss the value of emergency funds. Managerial implications: We show that budget level is a key determinant of the optimal policy. When it is above a threshold, inventory increases in disaster frequency and severity, but the reverse is true otherwise. When budget is limited, the rate of savings from improved forecasts is amplified (attenuated) for critical (noncritical) items, reflecting opposing directional effects of mismatch cost and cost of insufficient funding. Our model can also be used to estimate the value of initiatives to mitigate constraints on local spend (e.g., a line of credit underwritten by large donors that is available during the immediate relief period). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tunnel widely exists in highway, subway and other underground buildings. Due to the structural limitations, the direction of evacuation is consistent with the main flow direction of smoke in the tunnel. For the design of smoke exhaust system, traditional methods aim at reducing the overall smoke concentration in the whole tunnel. However, when fire hazard occurs, rapid personnel escape requires higher visibility. In this paper, a novel air supply device designed for smoke-insulation passageway establishment and ventilation in tunnel fire is introduced. Wall-attached jet and orifice plate jet are combined in this device, which enables passageway to isolate smoke intrusion. In this study, an approach has been devised combining Response Surface Method (RSM) with numerical simulations as well as visualization experiment to get better performance of the device. Parametric optimization was conducted for the three influencing variables, i.e., the air supply volume, opening rate of orifice plate, and width of wall-attached jet. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that all the three factors are significant. Moreover, the optimal combination can be obtained within the admissible range of the three factors through response optimization. A regression equation is developed to predict the effect of the novel air supply device for any input values of the three influencing variables.</jats:p>"

In this condition, the company must have the right strategy to minimize the risks that occur to increase competitiveness. The sugar industry is an industry that has a complex supply chain flow, and of course,every process is inseparable from risks. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the potential risks in the company's supply chain as a basis for preparing the right strategy for the company. The Supply chain Operation Reference (SCOR) and House Of Risk (HOR) methods were used in this study to identify possible processes and risks. House Of Risk Phase 1 results in 30 risk events and 44 risk agents. And of the 44 selected risk agents, 13 priority risk agents have the highest probability of occurrence. The 13 risk agents come from the plan, source, make, and delivery processes, but the dominant risk agents appear in the make and source processes.</jats:p>"

Consequently, firms search for factors that influence supply chain resilience and improve firm operational performance. The current research develops an integrated resilient supply chain model that combines factors underpinned DART model, innovation, digital technology, and value co-creation to investigate supply chain resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research framework was empirically tested with a data set of 329 responses from employees working in logistics firms. the study find that supply chain resilience is determined by value co-creation, the DART model, innovation, and digital technology. The factors underpinning the DART model, including dialogue, access, risk assessment, and transparency, have positively impacted value co-creation. The structural model shows that dialogue has a positive impact on developing value co-creation between manufacturing firms and stakeholders, Empirical investigation revealed that value co-creation in supply chain operations is estimated by dialogue, access, risk assessment, transparency, innovation, and digital technology and revealed substantial variance R^2 71.9% in measuring value co-creation. This research is significant as it develops a resilient supply chain model with the combination of the DART model, innovation, digital technology, and value co-creation and investigates supply chain resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although current research contributes to theory, practice, and method, disclosing research limitations opens numerous avenues for future researchers. This study does not claim to include all factors that impact the value co-creation process in supply chain operations. For instance, other factors, such as IT infrastructure, commitment, and integrative quality, may positively influence value co-creation. Second, supply chain resilience is determined by value co-creation and network capability. Therefore, the research encourages academicians and policymakers to investigate the supply chain resilience phenomenon with other market-oriented facts. future researchers are suggested to investigate the current research model in longitudinal method</jats:p>"

At the outset of 2021, as the decade of action to deliver the sustainable development goals (SDG) by 2030 gets underway, Ikuru Town is not on track to achieve Goals 6 (clean water and sanitation). Assessment of the Ikuru water supply project involved two ways: visitation to the treatment plant to observe the condition of the facility and use of the unstructured interview. Water samples were collected after treatment from the user point. Sampling was repeated three times on three different days. Physicochemical and microbial qualities of water samples were analyzed, using the standard for examination of water and wastewater by APHA. Results showed that total coliform bacteria were present in the water sample. Iron concentration was above the WHO limit. The concentration of manganese was above the recommended level and Iron bacteria were also present after treatment. In conclusion, the water is not potable and palatable due to its objectionable taste and orange brown colour. Therefore, there is needs for drastic treatment of Ikulu community water project at the point source, using shock chlorination as a recommended method to improve its performance level. Moreover, supportive intervention is required from governmental institutions to overcome the challenges of this water project for sustainability.</jats:p>"

The oil and gas industry is divided into upstream, downstream and mid-stream respectively in Nigeria. Each of the petroleum sectors performs different functions in terms of exploration, refining and distributions and with respective supply chains. In course of the supply chain distribution, distractions in form of turbulence and disruption can occur which could have serious effects on operations and performance. Hence this study focused on the mitigating effect of supply chain risk management in marginal field oil and gas companies in Nigeria. It is field survey and case type of research. A total of 687 Management and Senior staff of nine marginal filed oil and gas companies constituted that population while 325 formed that sample size. The main instrument was questionnaire administration and analysed using descriptive statistics. The study found that application and proper management of supply, demand, information, transportation and monitoring risk mitigation strategies are critical factors enhancing reduction of risks in marginal field oil and gas in Nigeria. It therefore recommended that there should proper coordination of information, monitoring, demand and supply chain risk management in order to reduce vulnerability of disruptions and distraction in operations.</jats:p>"

The study findings reveal a significant positive relationship between board nationality diversity and CSR performance and its-related subdimensions including environmental performance and social performance. Furthermore, we find that educational diversity is positively and significantly related to CSR performance and environmental performance, though not to social performance. The findings remained robust under the instrumental variable approach and dynamic panel model. Additional tests compare between two groups of firms—those from heavily and less regulated sectors—and find that the former group has more educated directors, but a similar level of nationality diversity is found among both sectors. Although diversity in terms of nationality and education is still modest at best, its effect on CSR performance and its related sub-dimensions is more pronounced within heavily regulated sectors only. This result contends that when board nationality diversity and educational diversity are properly incentivized (with regulating CSR activities, for instance), the board tends to improve the social and environmental activities of the firm.</jats:p>"

The analysis is based on field observations, interviews and participatory workshops in four community-managed water supply systems in Brazil and Tunisia. To sustain the access to water, communities limit their dependance on community-managed water supply systems and diversify water sources for different uses; they adapt the technical and organizational dimensions of water supply systems through <jats:italic>bricolage</jats:italic>; and use political leverage to obtain financial and technical support.

For example, in a water supply reservoir, DOM is an important parameter since it can react and form disinfection by-products during water treatment. Thus, the understanding and determination of photodegradation rates are especially relevant for water resources management since they can influence DOM transformation in the water column. However, besides its relevance, few studies were conducted in the southern hemisphere for photodegradation rates determination. Therefore, we carried out field experiments to characterize and evaluate DOM photodegradation rate ‒ at different depths and in two solar irradiation periods ‒ through the application of absorption spectroscopy techniques in the UV-Vis region and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEM) combined with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurement. Low concentrations of natural DOM and nutrients in the aquatic environment were measured during the field monitoring. Our results indicate that photodegradation rates for a temperate oceanic climate reservoir were proportional to the availability of solar radiation, being more representative considering the time scale.</jats:p>"

Customers expect simultaneous deliveries and pickups, and retail service start times have soft and hard time windows. Transportation expenses, noncompliance with the soft time window, distributor construction, vehicle purchase or leasing, and manufacturing costs are all part of the system costs. The problem's conceptual model is developed and modeled first, and then General Algebraic Modeling System software (GAMS) and Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) algorithms are used to solve it in small dimensions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>According to the mathematical model's solution, the average error of the two suggested methods, in contrast to the exact answer, is less than 0.7%. In addition, the performance of algorithms in terms of deviation from the GAMS exact solution is pretty satisfactory, with a divergence of 0.4% for the biggest problem (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 100). As a result, NSGAII is shown to be superior to MOSPSO.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Since this paper deals with two bi-objective models, the priorities of decision-makers in selecting the best solution were not taken into account, and each of the objective functions was given an equal weight based on the weighting procedures. The model has not been compared or studied in both robust and deterministic modes. This is because, with the exception of the variable that indicates traffic mode uncertainty, all variables are deterministic, and the uncertainty character of demand in each level of the supply chain is ignored.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The suggested model's conclusions are useful for any group of decision-makers concerned with optimizing production patterns at any level. The employment of a diverse fleet of delivery vehicles, as well as the use of stochastic optimization techniques to define the time windows, demonstrates how successful distribution networks are in lowering operational costs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>According to a multi-objective model in a three-echelon supply chain, this research fills in the gaps in the link between routing and location choices in a realistic manner, taking into account the actual restrictions of a distribution network.

The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry is now in its establishing phase, and if successful, massive storage volumes would be needed. It will hence be important to utilize each storage site to its maximum, without challenging the formation integrity. For different reasons, supply of CO2 to the injection sites may be periodical or unstable, often considered as a risk element reducing the overall efficiency and economics of CCS projects. In this paper we present outcomes of investigations focusing on a variety of positive aspects of periodic CO2 injection, including pressure management and storage capacity, also highlighting reservoir monitoring opportunities. A feasibility study of periodic injection into an infinite saline aquifer using a mechanistic reservoir model has indicated significant improvement in storage capacity compared to continuous injection. The reservoir pressure and CO2 plume behavior were further studied revealing a ‘CO2 expansion squeeze’ effect that governs the improved storage capacity observed in the feasibility study. Finally, the improved pressure measurement and storage capacity by periodic injection was confirmed by field-scale simulations based on a real geological set-up. The field-scale simulations have confirmed that ‘CO2 expansion squeeze’ governs the positive effect, which is also influenced by well location in the geological structure and aquifer size, while CO2 dissolution in water showed minor influence. Additional reservoir effects and risks not covered in this paper are then highlighted as a scope for further studies. The value of the periodic injection with intermittent CO2 supply is finally discussed in the context of deployment and integration of this technology in the establishing CCS industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Approximately one third of the food produced globally is lost or wasted along the supply chain. Reducing this would be an important measure to increase the global food supply as the world continues the struggle to feed its people sustainably. Not merely a waste of food, these losses also represent a waste of human effort and agricultural inputs from expensive fertilizers to natural resources as well as contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions. Measuring the extent of, and understanding the reasons for, these losses can assist in developing appropriate measures required to prevent or reduce such losses. Therefore, the objective of this research was to quantify postharvest losses in quantity and quality of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears at farm and simulated retail levels. Pears were sampled from two farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, the largest deciduous fruit production and export region in Southern Africa. The greatest losses measured along the supply chain were on-farm immediately after harvest, with 18% recorded. The main reasons for on-farm losses were small size (65%), deformity (26%), and chafed peel (9%). After 14 days in cold storage (−0.3 ± 0.7 °C, 81.3 ± 4.1% RH), mean pear losses were 0.86% which increased to 1.49% after 28 days. After 10 days of further storage under simulated market conditions (5.4 ± 0.6 °C, 83.7 ± 2.9% RH), fruit losses were 1.52% during retail marketing and 2.09% during export. Storing pears under ambient conditions (25.1 ± 1.3 °C and 46.6 ± 6.0% RH) resulted in a higher incidence of losses, increasing from 0.90 to 1.55 and 2.25% after 3, 7, and 10 days, respectively. The socio-economic impacts of these postharvest losses amounted to financial losses of between ZAR 492 million (USD 34.1 million according to the conversion rate of 14 April 2021) to over ZAR 831 million annually, and this was associated with the loss of 301 million MJ of fossil energy, 69 million m3 of fresh water and contributed to the emission of approximately 19,690 tons of CO2 equivalent. The fresh water lost could sustain 3.7 million individuals daily for a whole year at a daily minimum usage rate of 0.05 m3 per day while it will require planting 0.5 million trees to sink the 19,690 tons GHG emissions of the pear losses (0.039 metric ton per urban tree planted). Decreasing postharvest losses will conserve resources as well as improve food security and nutrition, objectives of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda led by the United Nations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The result of the work of the enterprise's supply service directly affects the possibility, rhythm and effectiveness of the carried out production processes. Their natural result is the emergence of a finished product, which has a certain consumer value, which should exceed the total amount of costs incurred by the firm in its manufacture. At the same time, in determining the unit specific value of the produced product, directly attributing to it the costs of the supply service activity presents a certain difficulty. These costs are overhead costs, and their allocation per unit of production assumes the existence of an adequate conditional base of distribution. The purpose of the study in the article – to identify sources, information which may be optimal enough to use in determining the basis for allocation of overhead costs, which are the costs of the supply service. In the process of work were used general scientific methods of research, analysis and synthesis. The study revealed that the most rational is the use of natural indicators, rather than monetary, because the latter are subject to inflationary distortions. The study of the market has shown that the range of requirements of supply specialists is wide enough, taking into account modern trends in automated planning and accounting of supply activities, as well as in the organization of quality management of material movement. Time spent on the performance of functional responsibilities that meet the requirements of the employer, in general, should represent the current list of the currently applicable means of labor standards. However, the available methodological basis of planning the norms of time spent by employees of the supply department is currently outdated, and does not reflect the automation of processes and the expansion of the authority and functionality of employees. At the same time, the methods for determining the optimal size of the staff have not undergone any significant changes and are still relevant. The possibility for the enterprises to use the methodical help of the branch ministries in definition of the time expenses of the employees for performance of the certain kinds of works, allows to show process of occurrence of separate elements as general economic, and general productive expenses, and also to prove the size of these expenses within the limits of calculation actual cost price of unit of production, or the size of average cost price on branch.</jats:p>"

To meet the demand, electricity generation has been relying on fossil fuels. This practice has three major drawbacks: inevitable resource depletion, environmental concerns, and supply risk. Renewable fuels are touted to be the future of sustainable power generation. However, there is a need to assess and optimize the use of the available resource in an effective and efficient manner. In order to accomplish the desired objectives, this study adopted the multi-perspective approach for efficient utilization of resources, both in terms of cost and diversification, and also aimed to propose the optimum combination of technologies for electricity generation in Malaysia. In this regard, first, the potential of the resources was identified from the Malaysian prospective compliance with the five fuel energy action plan 2020. All the five fuels were examined in terms of economic, environmental and security parameters, and evaluated in the terms of cost to measure the total exposure in monetary units. For the economic analysis, the LCOE cost quantification method was used. Similarly for the restriction of carbon emission, a carbon-tax policy was proposed and a novel technique was designed for the quantification of excessive cost of security in the electricity generation industry. This study applied the simulation mathematical modelling and the graphical evaluation approach to optimize the power generation mix in terms of cost and diversity index. Hence, this study will assist the policy-makers in making efficient long-term policies considering the impact of various factors on total generation cost while adopting the concept of diversification for an efficient and uninterrupted power generation process.</jats:p>"

Urbanization has major role in logistics performance. However, being a significant energy user, logistics has negative consequences. As the logistics performance increases, carbon emissions increase as well because of more transportation and urbanization. Logistics performance has positive effects related to trade openness which reduces carbon emissions. As a result, it is necessary to understand function of logistics from both economic and environmental standpoint. Logistics performance is affected by urbanization of any region. The dataset for this research is made up of 10 Asian nations with 550 observations from 2010 to 2018 and is based on the theoretical underpinnings of impact of population affluence and technology (IPAT) and stochastic impacts by regression on population affluence and technology (STIRPAT). After applying various tests like cointegration analysis, unit root test, cross-sectional dependence now long &amp;amp; short-term relation of variables is studied by Cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL). As indicated by the discoveries, the logistic performance index (LPI) is basically effective on economic growth and carbon emissions, particularly when related to IPAT and STIRPAT. The findings are reviewed, and policy implications are offered, which say that current logistical infrastructure should be transformed to more environmentally friendly operations.

Given their role in plant P nutrition, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may improve crop yield in nutrient-poor tropical soils. In the Vakinankaratra region, a field experiment was conducted at 908 m asl on an acidic Ferralsol during the 2019–2020 growing season. The aim was to test the ability of four promoted rice varieties to respond to AMF seed-coating inoculation with a commercial strain of <jats:italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</jats:italic> in the absence or presence of P fertilizer (20 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of P<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>) under no expected nitrogen (N) limitation. In absence of P fertilization, both at tillering and at maturity and irrespective of the rice varieties, AMF inoculation significantly improved plant performance and finally grain yield, grain N, and grain P amounts by an average of 28%, 30%, and 39%, respectively. In contrast, when P fertilizer was supplied, no significant effect of AMF inoculation was observed. Rice growth variables were significantly higher with the application of P fertilizer than with AMF inoculation both at tillering and at maturity. P fertilizer without inoculation provided an average grain yield improvement of 85%. At tillering, mycorrhizal parameters for root colonization assessment were not positively linked with rice growth variables suggesting an early effect of AMF inoculation. We concluded that, with no P fertilization, AMF seed coating inoculation at the field scale significantly improved upland rice plant performance in a limited soil P environment. Our rice genetic variability did not interfere significantly both with mycorrhizal parameters and crop AMF inoculation benefits.</jats:p>"

However, it is unclear how these technologies might contribute to CE. We hypothesize that Industry 4.0 technologies are positively related to the level of integration among actors along the supply chain and within the firm supply chain integration (SCI), which, in turn, explains superior CE results. By employing partial least square structural equation models on original survey data based on a sample of more than 1200 Italian manufacturing firms and almost 200 adopters, we find that disentangling for the type of technologies is essential to understanding both their direct and indirect role toward CE. Smart manufacturing technologies have a stronger impact on CE outcomes than data processing technologies; the mediating effect of SCI is verified for the former but not for the latter type, questioning the possibility for those technologies to support sustained CE performance in the long run.</jats:p>",

In the entire supply chain, we assume the deterioration rate increases with time and it also depends on the product’s expiration date. On the other hand, the demand for deteriorating items at the buyer’s end is assumed to be the dense fuzzy number because of learning effect. The model is developed by defining the exact profit functions for the vendor, the buyer and the entire supply chain and solved by classical method. These lead to the determination of individual optimal policies, as well as the optimal policy for the joint integrated supply chain. Fuzzifying the final objective function <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> dense fuzzy rule, we have employed extended ranking procedure for its defuzzification.

This research implements both quantitative and qualitative research, where the population of this research consists of shipper’s groups which transport products via the Thai Lao border located along R9 route. The research tools are questionnaire and structured interview form passed variability and reliability tests. Then the questionnaires are distributed to 3 large size firms (sample size of 316 people) and an in-depth interview with 18 people. This research analyzes gathered data using descriptive analysis, construct validity, structural equation modeling (SEM), path analysis, and content analysis for qualitative data. The analysis results reveal important findings according to each research objective as follows. For the first objective, to improve cross-border transportation, the case study firms should concentrate on three measures as: 1) transportation safety in terms of sound safety control and monitor, increasing rest areas and truck stops including those on pavement or roadside, safety monitoring during transportation, and weather conditions checking; 2) documentation procedure in terms of reducing the procedure steps, IT implementation, and procedure improvement both inbound and outbound; and 3) vehicles management in terms of appropriate resources allocation, facilities availability, and appropriate resources selection. For the second objective, the study of the case study firms’ performance after implementing the developed measures, it reveals benefits in several aspects of 1) cheaper (they can deliver items with lower costs, lower expenses, or lower price than before implementation as well as other competitors); 2) faster (better customers responsiveness, faster delivery and operating than other competitors, and lead time reduction), and 3) better (in operations with less bottlenecks, mistakes, and disruptions manifested in delivery; higher competitiveness and better service quality). To summarize, the implementation of the developed model can help the shippers to increase their capability as well as their competitiveness.</jats:p>"

Meat of terrestrial animals, milk, and eggs resulted in 76,966 Kt crude protein compared with 13,950 Kt or 15.3% from aquatic animals in 2018.While aquaculture produced a greater tonnage of aquatic animals, capture fisheries resulted in 7,135 Kt crude protein while aquaculture yielded 6,815 Kt. Capture fisheries production has not increased in the past two decades, and aquaculture production must increase to assure the growing demand for fisheries products by a larger and more affluent population. We estimated based on<jats:italic>status quo</jats:italic>consumption, that aquaculture production would need to increase from 82,087 Kt in 2018 to 129,000 Kt by 2050 to meet the demand of the greater population. About two-thirds of finfish and crustacean production by aquaculture is feed-based, and feeds for these species include fishmeal and fish oil as ingredients. Aquaculture feeds require a major portion of the global supply of fishmeal and fish oil. An estimated 71.0% of fishmeal and 73.9% of fish oil are made from the catch with the rest coming from aquatic animal processing waste. The catch of small, pelagic fish from the ocean is not predicted to increase in the future. Aquaculture should reduce its fishmeal and oil use to lessen its dependency on small wild fish important to the integrity of marine food webs and food security for the poor in many coastal areas. Fishmeal and fish oil shortages for use in aquaculture feed will result in a limit on production in the future if goals to lessen their use in feeds are not met.</jats:p>",

Due to the differences between products, the postmerger manufacturer can choose focus strategy to generate synergy effect or differentiation strategy to implement price collusion. We give equilibrium results for the supply chain under different strategies. Theoretical analysis shows that for supplier, no matter which strategy is chosen, the price sensitivity for suppliers will increase. Surprisingly, the merger has the opposite effect on the profits of two suppliers under differentiation strategy. Regarding the strategic options after the merger, our research indicates that with the increased substitutability between products, shifting from differentiation strategy to focus strategy should be taken by the postmerger manufacturer. In addition, when focus strategy is chosen and the synergy effect is weak, or when differentiation strategy is chosen and the substitution between products is small, the merger may be beneficial to nonparticipating manufacturers.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, in view of tariffs established for regulated entities, an investment program is often the only way to take measures aimed at heat system reconstruction and modernization. Currently, there are a number of gaps in the legal regulation of investment program approval, which, if not addressed, make it impossible to fully implement heat supply investment programs. The lack of requirements for refusal to approve investment programs cause a lot of problems for heat supply organizations.

The FLW management includes all activities allowing to prevent, reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover the discarded food from the market during the postharvest supply chain. Although many strategies allow pursuing these actions, in most cases the availability of FLW generated in Primary Processing Centers does not meet the demand of stakeholders able to manage it. To increase the environmental, economic, and social benefits of FLW reuse, suitable strategies have to be adopted. Consistent with this aim, a conceptual model to be implemented in a business-to-business web platform is proposed to support the decision-maker in identifying the best FLW management strategy under a sustainable perspective, adopting a multicriteria decision method. The numerical simulation results proved the model's effectiveness in identifying the most appropriate FLW management strategy within a set of alternatives.</jats:p>"

Data analysis used the partial least square. The result revealed that top management commitment affects green purchasing, green production practices, and operational performance. Furthermore, operational performance is directly affected by green purchasing and green production. The green purchasing affects green production. In addition, top management commitment indirectly improves operational performance through green purchasing and green production. This result provides essential insight for the manager in the manufacturing industry that top management commitment and practicing green purchasing, and green production enhances operational performance. Furthermore, this research extends the acceptance of previous research related to top management commitment, green purchasing, and green production in improving operational performance. The novelty of this study is the revelation of the mediating role of green purchasing and green production in the influence of top management commitment on operational performance.

These control nodes include the core enterprises of the aviation supply chain network, the upstream suppliers, and the downstream distributors. It is observed that the control effect is better when the control input is applied to the upstream suppliers of the aviation supply chain network than to the core enterprises of the aviation supply chain network. It is also more desirable to apply the control input to the core enterprises than to the distributors. That is, the control effect is the weakest when the control input is applied to the distributors, whereas the effect is best on application of the control to the upstream suppliers in the supply chain (that is, by choosing the upstream suppliers as the controlled nodes in the aviation supply chain network).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\t      &lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

The transition toward CE requires system redesign and business process modification. Embracing disruptive technologies produces several benefits including improved productivity and resource utilization. Thus, organizations become eager to adopt and sustain digital supply chains (DSCs) in globally competitive markets. Additionally, the linkage between DSC with CE and the impact of DSC on organizational performances from the perspective of CE remain unexplored in previous studies. This study aims to develop a framework for DSC adoption from the perspective of CE. The present study recognizes the barriers through literature review and experts' opinions that must be eradicated to attain the objectives of DSCs. In this study, 19 potential barriers to DSCs were identified. A fuzzy best–worst method (BWM) was adopted to prioritize the identified barriers. Further, the study formulates strategies for integrating the CE with DSCs to overcome the barriers. A modified Total Interpretive Structure Model (m‐TISM) was developed to highlight the different levels of suggested strategies. This study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing the identified barriers to DSCs and suggesting overcoming strategies. The integrated methodology assists organizations to develop efficient and integrated strategic measures toward DSC adoption through the application of enhanced knowledge of CE and environmental sustainability. The findings reveal that the “lack of digital skills and facilities” is the most influential barrier in DSC development. Further, the findings indicate that financial and regulatory supports are the primary steps toward a digitalized economy.</jats:p>",

Leadership was focused on the possibilities for action and implementation (ie, dynamic, adaptive, and collaborative) rather than trying to respond within the status quo (ie, a more linear and traditional approach). As a result, few structural items other than the creation of an effective, province-wide digital network to fully visualize the healthcare supply chain are needed going forward.

We identified the long-run and short-run asymmetric relationships of the Saudi stock market development on the stock prices of bank and financial services, energy and utilities, and the petrochemical sector and only a long-running asymmetric relationship with the building and construction sector. We also found the absence of long-run and short-run asymmetric impact of money supply on three sectors, namely, building and construction, energy and utilities, and the petrochemical sector except for the bank and financial service sector where only a long-running asymmetric relation was observed. These findings are appropriate for investors and portfolio managers to make judicious investment decisions.

A model consisting of two constructs of operations flexibility structures: external flexibility and internal robustness is examined to measure health operations flexibility elements in service sectors. Respondents are the health leaders (managers, middle manager, top manager and others) who were working in health service sectors in the United Arab Emirate. The underlying constructs of operations flexibility are empirically verified and validated through Reliability Analysis Procedure, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), First and Second Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Construct Validity Procedures, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to test the model, drawing on a sample of 250. The findings revealed that the model of the UAE health service sector consists of two latent's operations flexibility dimensions namely external flexibility and internal robustness, each dimension consisting of four items. Further research should be considered to validate these findings in the other firms. The two dimensions of health operations flexibility represent a valid instrument to measure the operations flexibility in the services sector in the United Arab Emirate.

The collaborative practices defined in the literature refer to a collaborative culture, joint planning, joint problem solving, and sharing of resources and information. From this perspective, this article aims to evaluate the influence of collaboration in the supply chain on the operational performance of the medium and large industries of the Textile and Metal-mechanic segment of the Vale do Itajaí (SC). Through questionnaires applied in the supply area in a universe of 109 industries, it was possible to collect data from 66 companies. It was found that joint planning and collaborative culture are collaborative practices that influence operational performance. Regarding the performance factors, flexibility was shown as an absent attribute in the industries: after the analysis of the moderating effect by segment, it was concluded that flexibility was not present only in the Metal-mechanic sector. It was also tried to diagnose the influence of the collaboration practices by industrial segment: in the Textile sector the influence of the joint resolution of problems was revealed and, in the Metal-mechanic sector the joint planning as a variable of impact on the operational performance was highlighted.</jats:p>"

On the other side close cooperation with these countries enabled China to turn into the principal customer of minerals and metals in international market, secure continuity of supply and price stability and get excess to mineral resources of other countries of the organization.

The reliability of any system depends on the design, manufacture and operation. The durability and reliability of structures can be increased at the design stage, that is, during research, design, calculations and design development. A hierarchy of factors of influence on the reliability of ensuring energy efficiency of enclosing structures in the junction nodes has been developed. A tree of logical inference of hierarchical links has been built. The root of the tree of logical conclusions, as an integral indicator, allows, at the expert level, to provide intellectual support for the decisions made to choose a heat-insulating material and the design of the junction nodes. The analysis of the influence of factors on the reliability of ensuring the energy efficiency of the enclosing structures at thee junctions points using linguistic variables. In order to assess the reliability of thermal insulation material, expert knowledge bases were formed and fuzzy logical equations were written, as well as the response surface was constructed. Matrices of paired comparisons of scientific and technical design solutions for the terms “low”,”medium”, “high” have been created. Based on the solution of matrices of pairwise comparisons, accessory functions were obtained for all terms. The obtained results of membership functions are normalized by one by dividing by the highest degree of membership. The mathematical assessment of the process was carried out using out the Matlab software. The surfaces of the expert system for decision-making based on fuzzy inference are built.</jats:p>"

The morphological structure characteristics of the leaf layer, node layer and light transmittance of the high-yielding wheat varieties under limited irrigation and nitrogen supply were studied and discussed. The results showed that two-year test yield and nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency (NPF) were the highest in the spring irrigation at jointing and anthesis stages (W2) and 192 kg/hm2 (N1), which achieved high yield and efficient nitrogen utilization. With the decrease of the leaf layer from top to bottom, the leaf area of the two wheat varieties displayed a trend of being higher in the upper layer and lower in the lower layer, while the light transmittance showed a decreasing trend. As the node layer decreased from top to bottom, the node length of the two wheat varieties decreased sequentially. Comprehensive research suggested that appropriate irrigation and nitrogen input improved the vertical distribution characteristics of wheat phenotypic traits, and can obtain higher grain yield and nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency.</jats:p>"

In a fetus of 185.0 mm TKD, the right brachioradialis consisted of two separate parts: upper and lower, which were connected at the level of the middle of the forearm into a common short muscle belly. In another human fetus of 220.0 mm TKD, the right brachioradialis also consisted of two separate parts – upper and lower, triangular in shape, but separated by a pronounced horizontal gap. \nConclusions: The features of the fetal anatomy of the brachioradialis are established: its variability and bilateral asymmetry of shape and size, variability of the places of origin and attachment, etc. In individual human fetuses, the brachioradialis consists of two separate parts that have special topographical relationships. The area of the greatest concentration of both extra- and intramuscular nerves and arteries is the upper and middle third of the brachioradialis. In the area of the forearm, the course of radial vascular-nerve formations is determined by the brachioradialis.</jats:p>",

This paper study the combined impacts of CGP and fairness concern on the supply chain that consists of a manufacturer, a green retailer, and a traditional retailer. Specifically, the optimal decision-makings are solved in seven cases, fairness neutrality (FN), the green retailer and the traditional retailer has vertical fairness concern (VFC) respectively, the two retailers has horizontal fairness concern (HFC) respectively, both retailers have vertical fairness concern (BVFC), both retailers have horizontal fairness concern (BHFC). Our main results via numerical simulation follow. (1) The improvement of CGP benefits the supply chain members except the traditional retailer. (2) The green retailer's VFC benefits itself and the whole supply chain, whereas bad for the manufacturer and the traditional retailer. However, the green retailer's HFC bad for itself, while benefits the manufacturer and the traditional retailer. (3) The traditional retailer's profits are affected by both CGP and fairness concern. (4) The high level of BVFC benefits the two retailers, but bad for the manufacturer. Conversely, the high level of BHFC will intensify competition between retailers and thus bad for them, while the manufacturer can benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: Directive 2020 / 2184 on the quality of drinking water and the European Green Deal introduce new requirements for assessing the quality of water services and the need to reduce water leakage. The main purpose of the article is to compare the methods of determining water losses used in Poland with international standards and to determine the readiness of Polish water supply systems to implement mandatory leakage estimation standards.Research Design &amp; Methods: The article presents a review of the literature on water loss assessment methods in Poland and abroad. Data on water losses in 11 water supply systems were presented, based on the information from the Central Statistical Office and the literature. Based on the data, a comparative analysis of selected entities was carried out.Findings: With a ranking of water utilities created, the impact of input data and the adopted calculation methodology on the position of a given entity in the ranking were analysed. The assumptions made for the calculation of the indicators and the choice of the evaluation method are shown to be important in the assessment of the entities.Implications / Recommendations: Comparing the scope of data collected at the national level and the requirements for international standards, it can be concluded that in Poland these data are not sufficient to calculate the value of the ILI (Infrastructure Leakage Index). The ILI is known in Poland, but its application is limited to the local level. The introduction of new requirements for the calculation of ILI at the national level will require the implementation of methods for collecting large amounts of data from many water utilities.Contribution: Due to the important role water utilities play, the level of infrastructure maintenance in supply systems must be constantly controlled. One of the basic indicators for assessing the condition of the water supply network is water loss. The conclusion from the article can be used by water operators to better evaluate their systems. The results of the analysis indicate the need for further research and the development of new methods of assessing water supply systems. The research contributes to the development of several scientific disciplines: environmental engineering, mining and energy management and quality studies.</jats:p>"

Being focus on two mainstream game models, namely the manufacturer-recycler cooperation game model and the manufacturer-led Stackelberg game model, we explore the connection between optimal pricing decisions and performance levels of the supply chain members. Although researches indicate that the quality of recycled products will not affect the pricing decisions in the forward supply chain, it is positively related to the recycling price, the repurchase price, and the overall profit in the reverse supply chain, and the intensity of competition among manufacturers or recycled products will affect the pricing decisions and the performance levels of the two models. In the manufacturer-led Stackelberg game model, the supply chain does not reach the Pareto optimum, which uses the recycling cost sharing contract to achieve the coordination. Afterwards, the profits of the two manufacturers and multiple recyclers in the supply chain are increased, and the overall profit of the supply chain system is higher than that of the manufacturer-led Stackelberg game model. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to verify the proposed coordination mechanism and its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The optimal trajectory of the knowledge stock and emission reduction benefits of suppliers and manufacturers under different strategies are obtained. The validity of the model and the results are verified by numerical simulation analysis, and the sensitivity analysis of the main parameters in the case of collaborative sharing is carried out. The results show that in the case of centralized decision-making, the KS efforts of suppliers and manufacturers are the highest, and the knowledge stock and emission reduction benefits of GSC are also the best. The cost-sharing mechanism can realize the Pareto improvement of GSC’s knowledge stock and emission reduction benefits, but the cost-sharing mechanism can only increase the supplier’s KS effort level. In addition, this study found that the price of carbon trading and the rate of knowledge decay have a significant impact on KS.

The deterioration rate of raw material is dependent on temperature and other environmental factors with respect to time. Here, the food producer prepares food after collecting the raw material from the supplier and then storing it in cold storage. The refrigeration cost is dependent on the occupied volume in the cold storage (where the products are preserved for freshness) and power consumption. The supplier offers delay-in-payment to stimulate the food producer to buy more raw material (which minimizes the holding cost and earns more revenues), whereas the food producer takes the partial advance payment on purchase cost from the retailers to ensure the order quantity. A mathematical model is developed to obtain optimal production time and the optimal number of deliveries so that the average profit of the food producer is maximum. Finally, a numerical example and sensitivity analysis of the key parameters are provided to illustrate and test the feasibility of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present work serves to improve the stable cooperation relationship among subjects of supply chain such as enterprises, farmers, intermediary organizations, and retailers and enhance the governance and optimization of agricultural product supply chain, thus strengthening the competitiveness of China’s agricultural industry. The supply chain governance of agricultural products is taken as the research object. Initially, the stabilities of two supply chain organization modes, “company and farmer” and “company, intermediary organization and farmer,” are analyzed by static game analysis. Then, based on the above analysis and the characteristics of blockchain institutional technology, a detailed analyzation is made on the mechanism of supply chain of agricultural products governance based on blockchain technology. Finally, the functional framework of agricultural supply chain governance is designed based on the basic framework of blockchain technology, and analyzation is made on the trust mechanism and contract mechanism of agricultural supply chain governance based on blockchain technology. The research results show that problems such as information and cognitive constraints in agricultural supply chain governance cannot be completely solved only through the evolution of blockchain organizational structure and the supply of governance mechanism, and speculative behavior will still appear. Optimizing the governance of supply chain of agricultural products based on blockchain technology can realize the transformation of its governance scenario. Meanwhile, the blockchain technologies such as deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract play an important role in the process of agricultural supply chain governance, which can make it change in many aspects such as organization mode, application operation, and governance mechanism. The rapid development of new generation information technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, and computer technology makes it possible to comprehensively digitize economic activities such as production and transaction in the supply chain of agricultural products. The present work combines the technical logic of blockchain digital governance with the institutional logic of agricultural product supply chain governance and tries to solve the instability problems caused by imperfect organization, lack of trust, and incomplete contract in agricultural product supply chain governance with the characteristics of blockchain such as deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to investigate the nerve and artery supply and the tibial attachment of the popliteus muscle using anatomical methods. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Forty‐four nonembalmed and embalmed extremities were dissected for this study. To measure the attachment area of the popliteus, the most prominent points of the medial epicondyle of the femur and the medial malleolus of the tibia were identified before dissection. A line connecting these two prominent points was used as the reference line, with the most prominent point of the medial epicondyle of the femur as the starting point. This study also investigated the area where the popliteus attaches to the bone and the points where nerves and arteries enter the popliteus muscle when it is divided into three equal parts in the coronal plane. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. The mean length of the reference line was 34.6 ± 2.1 cm. The origin of the popliteus was found to be at a distance of 16.6% to 35.2% on the tibial bone from the proximal region. The popliteus was innervated by only the tibial nerve in 90% of the cases and by the tibial and the sciatic nerves in the remaining 10% of the cases. The inferior medial genicular artery and the posterior tibial artery supplied blood to the popliteus in 90% and 65% of the cases, respectively. When the popliteus muscle was divided into three equal parts in the coronal plane, the nerve and the artery were found to enter the muscle belly in zones II and III and zones I and II in 92% and 98% of the specimens, respectively. <jats:italic>Discussion</jats:italic>. The anatomical investigation of the popliteus in this study will help identify patients with clinically relevant syndromes.</jats:p>",

Trade old for new and trade old for remanufactured have become marketing means to promote product recycling. The extended warranty service is used to promote the recycling of waste products. To design an optimal extended warranty service strategy and analyze its environment impact in a remanufactured supply chain, game theory is used to model the competitive relationship between a manufacturer and an E-commerce platform. Considering whether the E-commerce platform provides extended warranty service, four models are constructed, and the extended warranty service strategy and its environment impact can be analyzed. The results show that, when the level of substitutability between remanufactured and new products meets a certain rage, new or remanufactured products with extended warranty service strategy can increase the demand for new or remanufactured products, respectively. In the four models, the changing trends of manufacturer’s profit, E-commerce platform’s profit and supply chain’s profit, consumer surplus, environmental impact and social welfare are the same, but only the thresholds are different. From the perspectives of supply chain member, supply chain system, consumer, environment and society, the new and remanufactured products with extended warranty service strategy is the best choice.</jats:p>"

This study aims to assess the impact of urbanization and industrialization on Zn pollution in surface sediment at the Umeda River. Triplicate surface sediment samples were collected at nine sample points. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used for analyzing the Zn and Fe concentrations. The surface sediments in the Umeda River contained 48–159 mg/kg of Zn. The results indicated that Zn concentrations were abundant in the ascending order of 600–1,000 μm, 300–600 μm, and smaller than 300 μm. The higher the grain size, the higher the particulate organic carbon which might contribute to the higher Zn and Fe concentrations. In addition, the sediment quality guidelines indicated that the Zn levels in the study area did not constitute a major threat to biota. Normalization with Fe showed that the Zn pollution in surface sediment had been influenced by anthropogenic activities such as industrialization and urbanization.</jats:p>",

Domestic pig farming as an industry began to revive and developed. Powerful factors of pressure on it are the constant increase in the cost of feed, energy resources, and veterinary services. Based on the generalization of the research results, we substantiated the strategic priorities in the development of pig farming for each of the investigated groups of agricultural enterprises - producers of pig farming products. It has been established that one of the main factors that will restrain the development of pig farming in the corporate sector of the agrarian economy, as an export-oriented industry, in the near future is a complex epizootic situation caused by the manifestation of ASF. Such a situation requires the state veterinary and phytosanitary service to intensify its activities in conducting monitoring and selective control on the ground.\nIt is obvious that state support by means of subsidizing agricultural producers working on technologies with low indicators and high resource intensity does not contribute to their achievement of production efficiency, but only slows down the process of their exit from the industry, which leads to the irrational spending of budget funds.\nIn order to effectively develop pig farming by enterprises of the corporate sector of the agrarian economy, it is necessary to simultaneously solve a number of tasks, namely: to create institutional and economic conditions for the involvement of average producers in terms of efficiency indicators and production scales in the innovation-investment process for the development of resource-saving and ecologically safe innovative technologies in the shortest possible time; provide additional support to enterprises in the organization of production of their own grain feed, subsidizing the construction of feed mills and elevators, which will fully satisfy the existing needs of pork producers.\nThe effectiveness of the use of financial resources as budget allocations should be carried out on the basis of national and regional programs for the development of pig farming, indicating the sources of funding and forecast indicators of the development of the industry.</jats:p>"

To overcome the lack of transparency and traceability of the products in the enterprise resource planning system in supply chain (SC) and logistics issues, there is a solid need to employ a method that can efficiently track assets from production to supply decentralized, immutable records of all transactions. A blockchain (BC) is a decentralized software network that follows a digital ledger to exchange entities digitally and a way through which it makes secure transactions. Thus, this chapter proposes integrating BC in logistics and SC monitoring by giving a template on how Python and Flask can be used for BC with the SCM system to improve traceability without involving any intermediary.</jats:p>"

The retailer can solve the limited working capital problem through a bank, an investor, or its supplier. When facing business risks brought by uncertain demand, the retailer and the supplier are risk-averse behavior. To better explore the financing decision, we consider the supplier has two different cases: monopolist firm and non-monopolist firm. We first use the CVaR criterion to incorporate the members' risk-averse behavior into the objectives function. Then the equilibrium results of the supply chain are derived under three financing schemes, respectively. Our analysis finds when the supplier is a relatively low risk-averse monopolist firm, trade credit financing is the unique financing equilibrium. When the supplier is a relatively high risk-averse monopolist firm and non-monopolist firm, schemes, if the valuation level is relatively low, all members prefer bank credit financing. Otherwise, the members prefer equity financing. By tuning the valuation level, we obtain the conditions in which the supply chain realizes Pareto improvement relative to the other two financing schemes. Finally, we use numerical analysis to verify the above theoretical results.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Internationalization has become a strategic business plan by entrepreneurs and industry players to expand the business, especially when their business was already established in the domestic market. However, current international laws began to be tightened by requiring each exporting and shipping firms to implement green sea transport practices and documentations. A limited number of empirical-based evidence has forced the maritime practitioners to conduct business without clear green concepts knowledge and availability of best business practices to be benchmarked. With this in mind, the aim of this chapter is to examine current issues, differences, and dilemmas confronting practitioners, governments, stakeholders, and scholars. This chapter has developed a green maritime supply chain concept based on practitioners' reflections and provides future direction to scholars interested in studying green logistics and supplying chain management in the maritime sector. </jats:p>"

Samples were collected along the Kou River that flows across two districts in the Manyara region of Tanzania. The leaching behavior of Fe was studied using sequential extraction fractionation and kinetics approach. The Kou water failed to meet the irrigation, aquatic, and biological life standards with respect to one of more trace metallic elements (TMEs). Fe concentration in the river water ranged from 4.1 to 5.38 mg/L, exceeding all the three standards. Six pollution indices were applied to assess the contamination and ecological risks of the nine trace metallic elements in the sediments. Overall, the metals were found to moderately contaminate the sediments. Cr, Fe, and Mn fell under the ‘severely polluted’ sediment quality class. Fe was the only metal that was found to significantly pollute both the river water and sediments. The Fe fractions in the sediments were in the order of residuals&amp;gt;Fe-Mn bound&amp;gt;organic bound&amp;gt;carbonate bound&amp;gt;water soluble&amp;gt;ion exchangeable; 7.8% of the total Fe content was bioavailable with a low potential to leach from the sediments. Under natural conditions, the sharpest release of the non-residual mobile fractions of Fe were identified to occur within the first 24 hours with the maximum Fe leached being 0.14% on the 12th day. None of the metals in the sediments were found with a potential to pose ecological risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biodiversity loss has been recognized as one of the major global challenges of current and future society. Land-using processes have been found to be among the most important direct drivers for biodiversity loss. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has established itself as a standardized tool for measuring environmental impacts of products and processes. However, there is no clear consensus on the integration of land-use related impacts on biodiversity in LCA-frameworks due to a lack of methodological guidance, suitable datasets and experience in real-world applications. Closing these gaps could enable political institutions and companies to determine the effects of their products on biodiversity over the entire life cycle. In this study, a method, aiming to integrate the biodiversity impact in LCA, is successfully applied on a product with a complex supply chain. A suitable dataset of the material composition of a modern electric vehicle adapted to match the specifications of the Volkswagen ID.3 is developed. To estimate land use requirements of five important metals a GIS-based approach is elaborated. 164 mines covering an area of 4,123 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in eight different countries are inspected by means of satellite imagery and enhanced with data from industrial reports to build suitable datasets for the impact assessment. Based on these datasets, five unit processes are developed and applied to the VW ID.3 model. The results indicate that cobalt, lithium and copper account for the major biodiversity impact among the assessed metals. A scenario analysis reveals a biodiversity impact reduction potential of at least 23%. To the best knowledge of the authors, this study presents the first biodiversity impact assessment in the supply chain of a modern vehicle. The datasets, the application example and the workflow developed and applied in this study can serve as methodological guidance to support LCA-practitioners and researchers in the integration and application of biodiversity impacts in LCA-frameworks and LCA-studies. Thus, it supplements existing indicators in a meaningful way and makes them usable for future LCA studies.</jats:p>"

In some cases there is a need for electricity supply to remote agricultural facilities, for example, nomadic apiaries, remote pastures, hunting camps, reindeer herder camps. To solve this problem, the article proposes to use power supply devices based on the day-night temperature difference developed by the authors. (Research purpose) The research purpose is increasing the environmental safety and the reliability of energy supply of autonomous hybrid energy complexes based on renewable energy sources using the device of the daily temperature difference in their construction. (Materials and methods) The article proposes a method for producing energy using the day-night temperature difference. The advantages of the method are the absence of harmful environmental influences, safety for humans and nature, the inexhaustibility of the source, the possibility of using the device anywhere and the simplicity of technical implementation at the modern level. The authors have developed a methodology for calculating the device, its structural elements for electrical strength for autonomous power supply of remote agricultural production facilities. Classical methods for calculating charged containers with a dynamic change in their values at ambient temperature drop have been used in the research. (Results and discussion) Equation presented allows the calculation of a converter for a given capacity of autonomous power supply to remote agricultural production facilities. The advantages of the energy converter device, that is free of radioactive materials, there are the absence of combustion processes, gases, odors or volatile fractions. (Conclusions) The service life of the device can be long, up to hundreds of years. This technology can also be successfully used in the power supply on planets and space objects, for example, on the Moon, Mars, and other planets, where the temperature difference can reach up to hundreds of degrees.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, environmental protection is emerging as global warming is becoming an increasing issue of concern worldwide. In addition, the world society has shifted its preference from the conventional product to the environmental-friendly product. But, on the contrary, the manufacturing industry management is still in doubt whether the green practices benefit the company, given that it requires a lot of capital investment and culture change. This study examines the impact of top management commitment on competitive advantage with the mediating role of supplier integration, customer integration, and green innovation. The data collection used a questionnaire designed with a five-point Likert scale to measure the objective opinion of the respondents against the item statement by choosing the predetermined measurement scale starting with 1: strongly disagree up to 5: strongly agree. Questionnaires were created in Google Form link and distributed to 600 respondents via email, WhatsApp groups, and Facebook. This survey received 285 responses (response rate 47.50%) considered valid for further analysis. Furthermore, the data were analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) technique using SmartPLS software version 3.0. The result revealed that top management commitment directly influences supplier integration, green innovation, customer integration. Top management commitment did not directly affect competitive advantage. Instead, competitive advantages were affected by supplier integration, green innovation, and customer integration. Similarly, green innovation was supported by supplier integration and customer integration. In addition, top management commitment indirectly affects competitive advantage through supplier integration, green innovation, and customer integration. This result implies that top management commitment plays a vital role and has multiple effects in enhancing competitive advantage through establishing strategy and policies. This result provides a practical contribution on how the manufacturing companies could improve competitive advantage and at the same time concerns the environmental protection through green innovation. This study could also enrich and extend the acceptance of the recent research in the context of the manufacturing industry. Finally, this work has some limitations, particularly regarding the population and the variables involved. Further studies on the current topic are suggested to apply the variables such as digital and technology capability as these issues are currently in the growing stage. Future research is also suggested to cover a broader population such as the service and health industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, due to the increase in people’s awareness of environmental issues and the strict policies of governments, the competitiveness of companies depends on considering environmental issues at all levels of the supply chain. However, the implementation of green supply chain management strategies has lots of different risks. The main contribution of this research is to evaluate and rank the companies in the tire industry with an emphasis on the environmental risks of the sustainable supply chain using the hybrid best‐worst method (BWM) and fuzzy VIKOR (FVIKOR). First, data analysis was implemented by applying the BWM technique, which has higher reliability than other similar techniques. Next, the importance of the indicators involved in the risk of the green supply chain, including operational, supply, product return, financial, demand, organizational, and government, was calculated. Finally, according to the calculated weights for each criterion, five active companies in the tire industry were ranked using the FVIKOR technique. The results of prioritizing criteria and subcriteria showed that “financial risks” are the most important indicator among the indicators involved in green supply chain risk. Among the subcriteria, “rates related to inflation and currency” from the cluster of financial risks were recognized as the most important subcriteria. Moreover, the results of the ranking of five companies in the tire industry indicated that Dana Company is in the best situation in terms of green supply chain risks. Finally, a series of practical suggestions for managers and a series of scientific suggestions for future research have been presented.</jats:p>",

Aim/Objective: The aim of this study is to find out the outcome and complications of primary pterygium excision utilising the conjunctival tissue over the pterygium itself to cover the bare area retaining its own vascular supply and to preserve the superior bulbar conjunctiva for future uses. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective non-comparative study, 42 eyes with primary pterygium underwent pterygium excision utilising conjunctival tissue over the pterygium itself maintaining its original position and retaining its vascular supply for the period of 2018-2020. Methodology: In this technique two conjunctival incisions were given, one at the neck of the pterygium and other at 5-5.5 mm away from the limbus. The underlying fibrovascular tissue was separated and removed. Conjunctival tissue was placed in its normal position over the bare sclera maintaining its own vascular supply. Results: Mean age of the study population was 44.86 ± 11.68 years. Mean follow-up period was 12.62 ± 3.96 months. No recurrence was detected in the follow-up periods. The main two complications were subconjunctival injection and graft edema which were 100% and 33.33% respectively. Conclusion: This study results provide that utilization of the conjunctival tissue over the pterygium itself with retaining its own vascular supply can be a useful alternative technique for the management of primary pterygium and thus the superior bulbar conjunctiva can be preserved for future uses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern conditions of companies functioning engaged in foreign economic activity are complicated and unpredictable due to the situation with quarantine restrictions, transformation of global supply chains and difficult economic situation. Therefore, such problems as effective risk management in supply chains and minimization of their impact on companies become relevant. Risk management in the supply chain is based on prevention and minimization of the negative impact on companies, by identifying and assessing risks, as well as developing recommendations to avoid them using modern integrated, innovative instruments and technologies. In this study, the logistics risks were identified, such as an untypical and unpredictable situation that appears during logistics operations in the foreign supply chain, which causes the absence of goods on time, in the right place, with the right quality and expected price and leads to disruption of delivery and non-compliance with terms of contract. A study of risk management problems in the international supply chain, namely the assessment of risk management methods was made. An approach to risk assessment in the supply chain based on the formation of an index system of risk management was proposed. Based on this approach, the sequence of risk analysis of the logistics company activity was determined using the risk assessment matrix, risk analysis matrix and risk management response, information and information support matrix. The problems that arise in the process of quality assessment of risk management were identified and the most effective risk management instruments for supply chain risks minimization were proposed. Forms of globalization and market risks neutralization were proposed, taking into account external environmental factors (pandemic and quarantine restrictions; exchange rate fluctuations; unstable economy; increased complexity of customs procedures; market speculation, etc.). It is necessary, primarily, to improve logistics processes and make efficient logistics by all supply chain participants, flexibly approach customer needs and monitor global changes attentively, quickly respond to them and form a flexible and reliable supply chain to minimize risks in the goods supply chain.</jats:p>"

A fixed speed asynchronous generator used in a wind power conversion system (WECS) without a power converter interface draws a significant portion of the reactive power from the grid. This configuration features simple, reliable operation. Wind turbine asynchronous generator with dual power supply. can improve overall power conversion efficiency by performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and an increase in speed of about 30% can improve dynamic performance and increase resilience to system disturbances that are not available for turbine types 1 and 2. The use of full-scale 100% power converters will significantly increase the productivity of SPEV wind energy conversion systems, but will slightly increase the cost of the power converter, up to 7% - 12% of the total equipment cost. By using a large number of pole pairs for all types of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMG), the turbine gearbox can be removed. This type of wind energy conversion system is more resilient to grid disruptions compared to type 1, 2 and 3 wind systems. The review shows that types 3 and 4 technologies are used to most efficiently sell and recycle wind turbines in electricity markets.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSION.

By introducing the customer sensitive coefficient and block chain technology into these dual‐channel supply chain sales models, we analyzed pricing decisions and online channel selection strategies in dual‐channel supply chains in terms of the adoption and nonadoption of block chain technology. In the two different dual‐channel sales models, the results showed that (1) without block chain technology, retail prices increase when the manufacturer’s unit retail cost increases; (2) with block chain technology, retail prices are higher than those of sales models that do not adopt block chain technology; and (3) with block chain technology, the manufacturer should choose the online direct + delegation sales model to sell its products.</jats:p>",

In the past, people only paid attention to economic growth and neglected environmental protection. Now, environmental problems have restricted economic development, leading scholars at home and abroad to reflect on it deeply. Supply chain management, as the key to the sustainable development of the current enterprise economy, can realize the key consideration of environmental factors in the complete supply chain, reduce the negative impact of economic production activities on environmental protection, and can also make better use of resources to achieve effective assessment of the impact of economic‐environmental performance in the supply chain process to ensure its healthy and orderly development. This article makes an in‐depth analysis of the use of a green supply chain in the impact of economic‐environmental performance by using the method of a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and provides a relatively complete calculation method. An example is given to analyze the IKEA company. The results of the example analysis show that green supply chain management not only promotes economic growth in economic‐environmental performance but also plays a continuous role in the improvement of the environment. The proportion of resource consumption in regions with a high level of economic development is also high. Driven by factors of green supply chain management, green economy can effectively alleviate environmental pollution and further promote economic and green sustainable development.</jats:p>",

The time-series data from 1968/69 to 2017/18 of Sindhuli and Nepal along with 6 years supply data (2013/14-2018/19) from different districts to Kalimati market were collected from reliable sources (Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board) and analysis was done using Microsoft Excel. Between 1968/69 and 2017/18, the area under potato cultivation in Nepal and Sindhuli has changed by 573 percent and -46 percent respectively while production increased by 907.6 percent in Nepal and 46 percent in Sindhuli. After 1982 dramatic shift in production was observed in Nepal as there was 7 percent of growth rate while in Sindhuli, the production trend highly fluctuates throughout the period. The average yield was 9.75mt/ha and 8.75mt/ha for Nepal and Sindhuli district. Sindhuli district contributes 1.16 percent of Nepalese potato growing area and 0.91 percent of Nepalese potato production. The trend of quantity supply reveals that during 6 years, Indian potato contributes 58 percent of the total amount that came into Kalimati market, while within-country Kavre has the largest share of 19 percent followed by Kathmandu-6 percent and Dolakha-4 percent. However, the trend of quantity supply of potatoes seems highly fluctuating and the Nepalese market is dominated by Indian imports.</jats:p>"

This paper constructs a two-sided GNPO–hospital game model in a Chinese context, and explores the strategies and influencing factors of medical supply distribution in public health emergencies based on evolutionary game theory. The results show that: (1) GNPOs, as the distributor of medical supplies, should choose strategies that balance efficiency and equity as much as possible. (2) Hospitals, as the recipient of medical supplies, should actively choose strategies that maximize the total benefit to society and strengthen trust in GNPOs. Meanwhile, hospital managers need to pay attention to reducing the impact of communication and coordination costs and strive for the reduction of conflicts between different values. (3) The government should strengthen supervision to avoid conflicts between medical distributors and receivers during a public health emergency and ensure the rescue efficiency.

A comparative analysis of the change in the flow structure in the ejector for different values of the additional gas flow angle has been carried out. The dependences of the flow velocity at the outlet of the accelerating tube, the ejection coefficient and the thickness of the protective layer on the angle of the additional energy carrier supply have been scrutinized. The maximum values of the average output velocities for the given ranges of the additional flow parameters have been determined. Recommendations for the choice of geometric and gas-dynamic parameters of the additional gas flow to ensure the highest efficiency of the acceleration process in the jet mill ejector have been developed. The choice of the angle of the additional gas flow supply, which provides the highest average velocity at the outlet from the accelerating tube with the highest ejection coefficient, has been substantiated.</jats:p>",

Based on the results, our conclusions are as follows: Development of public services offers the opportunity to (1) gaining market power for ourselves while losing market power for others, (2) indirect takeover of control on political and civil societies while losing control for others, (3) to win allies and friends on one hand, potentially losing allies and friends on the other. After spatial analyses of grazing areas, animal markets, trading routes and witnessing the descriptions of basic macroeconomic differences within Ghana; we must conclude that live animal trade is south-orientated, where traders are able to bargain higher prices. Due to northern locational advantages, the price of animals could be reduced. The presumably cheaper workforce and dozens of unemployed young males could also alleviate the financial burdens.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to characterize the pharmaceutical supply chains from an environmental perspective. Our methodology provides a novel contribution to the literature describing green supply chain management, since no detailed analysis of the environmental aspects of the pharmaceutical industry has been carried out this way. Our results can inform pharmaceutical businesses and policymakers about the limiting factors of green supply chain management in the pharmaceutical sector and provide insights to overcome hindrances and to design new tools. By looking at the supply chains of the pharmaceutical sector, we demonstrate that the potentials of green supply chain management may be limited by several factors. First, the relationship between pharmaceutical substance suppliers and medicinal product manufacturers is characterized by long-term partnerships and strong interdependence. Second, interviews suggest that consumers neither have environmental expectations towards medicinal products, nor act in an environmentally conscious manner regarding the disposal of medicinal products. Third, our findings on actual environmental measures implemented by companies suggests that the specific characteristics of pharmaceutical supply chains, such as strict quality and health requirements, impose severe limitations on the greening of supply chains. This study builds on the analysis of the international literature, through which it presents the issues of green supply chains in the pharmaceutical industry.

Attention is focused on the analysis of the steps taken by the main regulator in order to counter the rapid inflationary process, which especially intensified in 2021 and the threat of significant rates of which remains in the current year. The factors that led to significant changes in the national currency, manifested in a significant weakening of its purchasing power, were identified. Among them, some attention is paid to the analysis of the impact of the pandemic on the economy of Ukraine. The fact of slow and insufficient response of the government to the current situation in the country is stated. The named external factor was also strengthened by the political factor, which found its expression in the insufficiently high level of professionalism of a significant part of high-ranking state officials who came to power on the wave of pre-election populism.

The main purpose of this research was to study the relation amongst supply chain capabilities (supply chain network design, supply chain information capabilities, and supply chain integration) and supply chain agility on firm performance in the Gauteng province’s manufacturing sector in South Africa. Structured questionnaires were circulated to different manufacturing firms in the Gauteng province. Data was analysed using SPSS and AMOS 26.0 software. Results showed that the level of firm performance in the manufacturing sector is dependent upon the effectiveness of supply chain capabilities and the existence of a sound long-term relationship between partners in the supply chain. Manufacturing managers and proprietors may be able to enhance the levels of firm performance by making improvements to supply chain technologies and improving supply chain agility by cultivating long-lasting sound relationships with key suppliers and customers.</jats:p>"

However, the variations in environmental factors may have an impact on the quality of water, as changes in these attributes may affect the water bodies. These factors include the topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of the watershed. In this study, the relationship amongst the physico-chemical, topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of the Rawal watershed was evaluated. The parameters included in the present study could be classified as follows: (a) water quality parameters (b) topographical parameters, (c) geological parameters, (d) lithological parameters, and (e) soil type parameters. Water quality parameters consisted of dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity and temperature. The topographical parameters include the slope and aspect of the watershed while the lithological, geological and soil type parameters include the lithology, geology and soil type of the watershed. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship amongst these different parameters. The results have revealed that the correlations of the topographical, lithological, geological parameters with the water quality parameters in the Rawal watershed for the monsoon seasons of June to August mostly have the same trend. Throughout the four-year time period, turbidity and temperature parameters had positive correlations with soil type (ranging 0.03–0.24), but however had weak correlation with geological and lithological parameters. Dissolved oxygen did not show any relationship with topographical and lithological parameters. The results for pH show that it has weak to fair positive correlations with topographical parameters. However, this analysis is based on the Landsat 8 images extracted for the monsoon seasons of the years 2017–2020, and to examine a more prominent impact of geographical or environmental factors on the physico-chemical features, a large dataset should be considered.</jats:p>",

To achieve this aim, the study seeks to determine the sustainability drivers to accommodate the pandemic-ridden environment and if sustainability indicators can help improve the supply chain management of the CPO sector. A methodology is divided into two interrelated parts: first, based on a careful review of extant literature of the CPO sector and sustainable supply chain in the light of pandemic. The proposed methodology is then tested using the response data of 108 oil mills' representatives collected through survey questionnaires and analyzed using statistical tools of reliability, distribution, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and diagnostic tests of CFA. The findings designate the environmental costs, rapidity, and adaptability as core economic indicators; the social and workforce development, health, and safety workforce development and consumer issues as crucial social indicators; while energy and material efficiency, management of waste and emissions, and sustainable suppliers as the best environmental indicators. This study provides a holistic platform on the implications of the pandemic to assess the SSCM of the CPO sector. These findings are expected to aid the industrial managers in employee skills and health protocols, customer service, and environmental management. The study is also anticipated to guide the supply-chain partners and government policymakers to take initiatives on SSCM in the context of the pandemic.</jats:p>"

Combined with the data of the supply chain system of a rice processing enterprise, a case study is carried out.

For enterprises in different positions in the supply chain, a unified anticounterfeiting traceability platform is established through the model, which can provide security and privacy protection for all kinds of enterprise data at the same time; for consumers, the model meets the security and traceability of each data of purchasing goods and ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data.

Considering the impact of the failure outage of power generation and energy storage equipment, as well as the uncertainty of renewable energy on PSR, a multi‐objective bi‐level mixed‐integer optimisation model is proposed. Based on Benders decomposition, the model is decoupled into a master problem (MP) of the equipment optimal configuration considering economy and environmental conservation and a sub‐problem (SP) of the PSR check. Considering the load importance hierarchy, two types of slack variables are introduced into the SP to ensure both the reliable power supply of important loads and the PSR of the system. Through interactive iteration of the MP and SP, the complexity of the optimisation model is considerably reduced, improving the solution efficiency while ensuring the rationality of the optimal configuration scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by a typical stand‐alone wind–photovoltaic–diesel–battery microgrid system and analysed in terms of the impact of reliability requirement and energy storage on the configuration scheme and algorithm convergence.</jats:p>",

The improvement of one of the processes in the technology of growing vegetables and berries, the use of thermal energy in the disinfection of surfaces in protected ground is the main idea of the developed autonomous power supply system of the installation. (Research purpose) The research purpose is developing a technological scheme of the power supply system of the installation for disinfection of surfaces with infrared radiation in protected ground. (Materials and methods) The article presents the scheme of an experimental installation for surface disinfection with infrared radiation, allowing to develop a technological scheme of the power supply system. The experimental setup is designed to study the distribution of the temperature field of infrared radiation on the surface (soil, substrate, concrete floor). (Results and discussion) During the operation of infrared radiators during disinfection of surfaces in protected ground running on liquefied gas, not all the thermal energy from gas combustion passes into infrared radiation; part of the thermal energy is lost to the environment due to convection and thermal conductivity. Losses can reach up to 50 percent. In order to reduce heat losses and reach the autonomy of the surface disinfection unit in protected ground, it was proposed to use thermal generators operating on the Seebeck - Peltier effect, the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy for electricity generation. The Peltier elements are connected both sequentially and in parallel. The electricity received from the Peltier elements enters the battery, accumulates, and then is spent on the operation of the installation. (Conclusions) The technological scheme of power supply system of the surface disinfection plant being developed can be adapted and applied to other technological processes where there are heat losses to the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Bangladesh has made significant progress in social and economic development in recent years, but micronutrient deficiencies and poor dietary diversity remain a significant challenge. This paper developed eight scenarios to explore fish supply-demand futures in Bangladesh using the AsiaFish model, with special emphasis on the role of fish in micronutrient supply to address the nation’s malnutrition and nutrition security challenges. A business-as-usual (BAU) scenario followed historical trends for exogenous variables used in the model. The seven alternative scenarios explored were: the implications of increase productivity of farmed tilapia, pangasius and rohu carp (AS1); productivity changes in hilsa production (AS2); improvements in the quality of feeds (AS3); reduction in the price of plant-based feeds (AS4); disease outbreak in farmed shrimps and prawns (AS5); and climate change impact (AS6) and stagnant capture fisheries (AS7). The BAU scenario indicates that aquaculture growth will be a prominent contribution to increasing total fish supply and demand and fish exports to 2040. Apart from the scenarios that are favourable to aquaculture sector development, other alternative scenarios highlighted the lower growth rate of capture fisheries and aquaculture compared to BAU, resulting in declining in per capita fish consumption, fish exports and nutrient supply from fish as a consequence. Increased availability of aquaculture fish can slightly compensate for the lower growth of capture fisheries in term of their nutrition quality and dietary diversity, particularly for poor consumers. Policies towards sustaining fisheries and a nutrition-sensitive approach to aquaculture is recommended as both capture fisheries and aquaculture are essential for sustaining healthy and nutritious diets in Bangladesh.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of water quality is well understood, and it becomes even more critical when is use for drinking purposes. A case study was carried out to know the applicability of GIS tool for determining the quality of supply water. Water samples from 21 houses at different locations of Delhi were collected. Sample analysis was done for physicochemical parameters viz., pH, EC, TDS, Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, Chloride, Fluoride, and Nitrate. The water quality data from these selected locations was analyzed using Geographical Information System (GIS) Technique. GIS software did interpolation through the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method to know the water quality (WQ) in different part of the city for various parameters mentioned above and prepare thematic maps from the analysis of water quality data as a database. These thematic maps show the distribution of different water quality parameters. Using Weighted Arithmetic Index (WAI) method, Water Quality Index is calculated. After that, the Drinking Water Quality Index (DWQI) map was generated using thematic layer, reclassification, and weight value assigned in weighted overlay tools in GIS software. Five categories viz., excellent, good, satisfactory, poor, and very poor is assign to describe DWQI. Out of all the selected locations, DWQI was good only at two locations, whereas, at the remaining sites, the DWQI was found satisfactory. However, the overall water quality was found suitable for human consumption. The analysis outcome was represented as maps that will be advantageous to know the water quality status for the area under study. The spatial database established can be a reliable technique for monitoring and managing water quality in the water supply system. </jats:p>",

This targeted review provides an overview of the evolution of existing statistical models, grouped into three categories: deterministic, probabilistic and machine learning. The main advantage of deterministic models is simplicity and relatively minimal data requirements. Deterministic models predicting failure rates for the network or large groups of pipes perform well. These models are also useful for shorter prediction intervals that describe the influences of seasonality. Probabilistic models can accommodate randomness and are useful for predicting time-to-failure, interarrival times and the probability of failure. Probability models are useful for individual pipe models. Generally, machine learning approaches describe large complex data more accurately and can improve predictions for individual pipe failure models yet is complex and requires expert knowledge. Non-parametric models are better suited to the non-linear relationships between pipe failure variables. Census data and socio-economic data require further research. Choosing the most appropriate statistical model requires careful consideration of the type of variables, prediction interval, spatial level, response type and level of inference required.</jats:p>",

T1DM patients require care given not only by themselves but also by their family members, particularly in childhood-onset cases. This study aims to identify the relationship between health expenditure, HbA1c and other health outcomes and the socio-economic status of patients and their families, with a focus on family employment status, i.e., whether the caregiver is employed or is a homemaker. To clarify the relationship between the level of health, such as expenditure on health care and HbA1c, and the socioeconomic status of patients and their families, we focus on whether they are “potential full-time caregivers”. Using this analysis, we estimated the hypothetical health care expenditure and HbA1c and showed that male patients have higher expenditure and lower HbA1c when their caregiver is a potential full-time caregiver, whereas younger female patients have higher health care expenditure and lower HbA1c when their caregiver is employed. This finding is not meant to serve as criticism of health care policy in this area; rather, the aim is to contribute to economic policy in Japan for T1DM patients 20 years and older.</jats:p>"

Therefore, applying unstructured job rotation practice (i.e., monthly) frequently and regularly will have a significant negative impact on JC performance as a whole. Qualitative methodology was adopted through conducting some semi-structured interviews with managers from mid and top levels, internal employees, external partners, and customers. Forty-six (46) interviewees participated and shared in this study out of 203, representing a 22 percent response rate (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998). Additionally, it was reviewed many related previous research studies in the literature in order to collect some other qualitative data from secondary sources (i.e., statistics, annual reports, etc.). The findings of this study show that JC applies the current job rotation practice randomly, unstructured, and not in a perfect and scientific way for achieving its goals and objectives; thus, leads to low revenues and performance (Magova &amp; Kessy, 2020).</jats:p>"

An imperfect production at the manufacturer and inspection process involving with Type I and II errors at the retailer are considered. We assume that the manufacturer gives products to the retailer in a number of equal-sized shipments. This model is formulated as a Stackelberg game in which the retailer retains a certain degree of autonomy by reserving the right to choose the retail price and the manufacturer determines replenishment frequency, replenishment quantity and wholesale price. The critical supply chain decision factors including the manufacturer’s wholesale price, the retailer’s price, shipment frequencies and number of shipments are determined maximizing the total profit of each member of the supply chain. A solution procedure is proposed to find the Stackelberg game equilibrium. The performance of the model is assessed by a numerical example. The numerical shows that it is more beneficial for both the manufacturer and the retailer when the demand is less price sensitive.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main problem of modern internal combustion engines at present is the growing shortage of fuel and the increase in environmental safety requirements. To solve this problem, the authors suggest adding alcohol to diesel fuel. This additive – ethanol or methanol – will help reduce harmful emissions of combustion products into the atmosphere and increase the efficiency of the internal combustion engine in the main operating modes. The method of feeding the mixture into the combustion chamber will have a great effect on the combustion process of the fuel-air mixture with alcohol. There is a large number of ways to supply alcohol to the engine, but their comparative characteristics have not been fully studied yet. To evaluate various methods of introducing alcohol into a diesel engine, an experimental installation including an electric brake balanced machine and a diesel engine has been developed. The installation allows the diesel engine to be loaded to the required torque value and makes it possible to record the main mechanical parameters of the engine. In this study, the authors considered the supply of alcohol in the diesel engine cylinders with two methods: in the form of an emulsion with fuel and with air on the intake stroke (in the intake manifold). The unit will quantify at different engine operating modes and the proportion of alcohol delivered both as an emulsion and with air. The research will help assess the feasibility of using alcohol additives and adjust the theoretical justification of the processes occurring during the combustion of the fuel-alcohol mixture in the cylinder.</jats:p>"

This article aims to analyse the food system behaviour of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (in the northeast of Spain) during the first stage of the pandemic by deepening the behaviour of different peri-urban agricultural areas in which local food supply is promoted. Semi-structured interviews to 11 entities and institutions located in the peri-urban area of the BMR based on its productive and management profile have been carried out from March to May 2020. The results obtained highlight the socio-economic, environmental, and health perspective of food supply during the pandemic. Main results show 1) shortcomings in the operation and logistics of the metropolitan food system; 2) the complicity between the local producer and the urban consumer through new sales and distribution initiatives, 3) the role of peri-urban agricultural areas for ensuring food supply and land preservation, and 4) the need to initiate cooperation and mutual aid activities between the different agents involved in the food system. Furthermore, agents underlined the need for rethinking the agroeconomic model to strengthening the producer-consumer nexus and promoting local food policy based on food sustainability, sovereignty, and governance.</jats:p>"

The main task of supply logistics is to provide the required logistical goods for the tunnel-boring machine. Available are track-bound and tyre-bound systems, which are driven by conventional diesel engines or alternatively by hybrid or electric motors. A multitude of regulations set exhaust emission limits, which can only be met by sufficiently dimensioned ventilation. In particular, the use of diesel engines can result in high costs for ventilation, which must not be neglected for an economic optimization of the supply concept. In order to compare the economic efficiency of different systems, a calculation concept is presented, which shows possible economic, but also ecological and logistical advantages of the individual systems by quantifying relevant factors. The costs for the different types of vehicles are examined separately for chassis and drive train, as well as for ventilation. The information and results obtained with the calculation provide a basis for the decision-making process when choosing an optimal logistics concept. Due to the quantities of logistical goods involved, the focus is on supply logistics in shield tunnelling.</jats:p>",

Service models and the uberisation of food, when contract workers use their personal vehicles to deliver food to customers, has gained more acknowledgement during the COVID-19 times. Based on our qualitative study, various peer-to-peer production and collaborative consumption initiatives are presented in this chapter to assess how the idea of sharing economy entered the food sector.

Chronic ingestion can cause potential harm to humans and living things such as damage to kidneys, and cancer of the liver, lungs, and bones. The present study was undertaken to assess groundwater quality using a multivariate approach to the non-carcinogenic exposure of uranium by residents of the Bastar district, Chhattisgarh. The concentration of uranium in groundwater samples ranged from 0.50–26.4 μg/l in 70 samples, with 82% of samples being beyond the recommended limits by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Hierarchical cluster analysis divided all sampling locations into 10 clusters explaining the similarity of geological conditions. Factor analysis extracted four principal components or factors with 70.20% cumulative variance from the entire data set. Chronic daily intake has been found above from the reference dose as 34.29, 42.86, and 51.43% for young children, children and adults. The results of hazard quotient analysis classified the degree of non-carcinogenic risk which was &amp;gt;1 in 34.28, 45.71, and 41.43% for the samples from young children, children and adults, respectively. This study will generate baseline data and suggest the need for revision of water quality monitoring plans and preventive water management practices.</jats:p>",

This work reports a study on the EOP performance of the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyzer, including the optimization of electrode configuration and operation conditions. It is proven that the EOP performance is highly affected by electrode configuration. Tests using BDDs with different B/C ratios demonstrate that BDD-4.9 provides more reaction sites and faster electron transfer rate, exhibiting a high electrocatalytic activity for EOP. Regarding electrode thickness, 0.54 mm in thickness is the most suitable for the EOP from the perspective of less power consumption. Moreover, operation conditions were evaluated. It was found that increasing water flow rate is an effective strategy for promoting ozone dissolution, and within the present experimental range, the water flow rate of 63 L·h−1 was identified. Meanwhile, through the study of all processes occurring inside the electrolyzer at higher current densities, the optimum current density was determined to be 125 mA·cm−2. Based on these results, ozone water presents excellent performance in the killing of Escherichia coli with high inoculum concentrations, indicating potential application performance in the field of environment.</jats:p>",

The date of emergence of the tested maize hybrids was monitored under control (0 kg N ha−1), 120 kg ha−1 N + PK, and 300 kg ha−1 N + PK nutrient levels in a long-term field experiment. In 2020, maize hybrids (H1 = FAO 490; H2: FAO 420–440; H3 = FAO 420; H4 = 490; H5 = 320–340; H6 = FAO 350–370) growing under natural precipitation supply conditions without irrigation were included in the study. During the days of emergence, different moisture, protein, oil, starch, and yield production levels were observed, according to the variance analysis. In diverse maize hybrids, increasing or decreasing fertilizer treatment resulted in diverse productivity metrics. Regression analysis revealed that the day of emergence had a greater impact on protein, moisture, starch, and oil content than N fertilizer; however, yield production was influenced by N fertilization, rather than day of emergence. Regarding productivity parameters, this study suggests that H1 has the best productivity until the fourth day of emergence.</jats:p>"

ERGO is now regarded by some as a ‘longevity vitamin’ that has the potential to mitigate some chronic diseases of ageing and thereby increase life expectancy when present in adequate amounts. However, only limited knowledge exists regarding ERGO content in the human diet. Since ERGO is produced primarily by fungi, mushrooms are known to be the leading dietary source, but ERGO is found in relatively low amounts throughout the food chain as a result of soil‐borne fungi or bacteria passing it on to plants through their roots. Some conventional agricultural practices that negatively impact soil fungi, such as excessive soil disturbance (ploughing), can significantly reduce ERGO content of food crops when compared to regenerative practices such as eliminating tillage of the soil (no‐till). This has led us to the concept that ERGO may be a definitive connection between soil health and human health.</jats:p>",

Increasing the resilience of Water Supply Systems (WSSs) becomes of fundamental importance: along with an adequate level of service, sustainability targets must be ensured. A long-term management strategy is strictly connected to a holistic approach, based on analyses at different scales. To this end, both groundwater modeling tools and water management models, with different spatial and temporal scales, are routinely and independently employed. Here, we propose a coupled approach combining: i) groundwater models (MODFLOW) to investigate different stress scenarios, involving climate change and anthropic activities; ii) water management models (Aquator), to assess the water resources availability and the best long-term management strategy for large-scale WSS. The management models are implemented starting from input and output flows derived by groundwater models: this leads to establish a comprehensive framework usually not defined in management models and including a quantitative characterization of the aquifer. The proposed methodology, general and applicable to any study area, is here implemented to the WSS of Reggio Emilia Province, and its main groundwater resource, the Enza aquifer, considering three different stress scenarios for groundwater models (BAU, ST1, and ST2), and for management strategies (BAU, BAU<jats:sub>RV2</jats:sub>, ST2). Among the key results, we observe that coupling the two model types: i) allows evaluating water resources availability in connection with management rules; ii) leads to examining more realistic operation choices; iii) permits planning of infrastructures at basin scale.</jats:p>",

This work serves to: simplify the frugal innovation approach by reviewing the separate definitions of innovation and frugality, the evolution of the approach throughout history, and comparisons of types of innovation; find the intersections and complementarities of these notions with the supply chain of the future; and seize opportunities to apply this frugal innovation approach in an emerging economy such as Morocco.

In the normal time, although the level of tax revenue shows a rising trend, the tax ratio hasn’t shown any significant increase. Also, it is still left behind other developing countries. Related to the pandemic effect, the world economy is decreasing and resulting to the decline of the Indonesian tax revenue. The concerns of this study are on how to optimize the compliance level of tax payment from Small-Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and the efforts of optimization needed to be done including in helping SMEs for being able to survive and or to be improved in terms of its business performance. Thus, they can contribute to maintaining their tax compliance at the same time from getting worse. This study employed a descriptive research method using a qualitative approach. The data sources were primary and secondary data. In this study, an operational management tool which is the approach of Supply Chain Management (SCM) integration will be implemented as the solution. It is found that the gradual application of the concept of SCM integration will give several significant impacts on the SMEs’ performance including their compliance with the existed tax regulations.

ASTR, a type of managed aquifer recharge, protects and purifies water resources using aquifers, whereas HACCP increases drinking water safety by analyzing and controlling hazards. The system was applied by installing an ASTR pilot plant in the Samrak Park in the Nakdong River delta in South Korea where the deteriorating water quality of the water supply sources has affected the drinking water supply. HACCP analysis revealed that 114 hazardous events occurred during various stages of water processing from the water intake source to the consumers. The analysis of the risks of these events revealed that nine of these risks can be considered as major hazardous events. In addition, the analysis of potential risks using a stochastic methodology revealed that the Gangseo-gu District in Busan exhibited the highest potential risk. Furthermore, critical control points were determined using a decision tree, and management criteria, management methods, verification methods, documentation, and recording methods were proposed. These results indicate that the application of HACCP to ASTR can improve drinking water safety.</jats:p>"

We examine the optimal decision problem for a closed‐loop supply chain (CLSC) considering capacity constraints and stochastic demand under a cap‐and‐trade system. A two‐level CLSC comprising a supplier and a manufacturer is established. To make the model more realistic, we treat demand as a random variable, consider the manufacturer’s production capacity within a certain upper limit, and allow the manufacturer to make investments to expand capacity to complete production demand. Based on this CLSC, the collection activities of the supplier and manufacturer are considered. Meanwhile, government carbon limits and carbon trading controls on the manufacturer are considered based on carbon reduction by enterprises. Through modeling and analysis, optimal decisions are derived for the amount of capacity investment, level of carbon emission reduction, and collection price variables. The results indicate that supplier collection has a positive effect on the sustainability of the CLSC. Moreover, the government’s carbon quota and carbon trading control of manufacturers can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of the CLSC, encourage enterprises to reduce carbon emissions, and improve the sustainability of the CLSC.</jats:p>",

Within this context, food quality losses, changes in temperature regimes, energy use, environmental burdens, and the economic viability of energy efficiency measures are essential aspects to consider for improving cold supply chains’ overall sustainability. This paper presents a dedicated toolbox, developed within the Horizon 2020 project ICCEE, for supporting decision-making and actors to assess energy efficiency path within a specific type of food cold-supply (i.e., meat, fish, milk and cheese products, fruits, and vegetables). More in specific the toolbox offers support for decision-makers to understand and minimize the specific energy consumption, to decrease the overall environmental impact even including non-energy benefit evaluation many times underestimated. The six separated tools merged within a unique toolbox consider different methodological approaches such as: assessment of the whole energy requirements in stock and flows considering the storage impact, the logistics and quality losses over time, implementation of Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle costs within the environmental and financial assessment of energy efficiency measures, based on a benchmarking approach. Finally, a specific approach implementing Multi Criteria Analysis was developed on selected key performance indicators such as specific and cumulated energy consumptions, quality losses and environmental burdens (i.e., global warming potential and water scarcity). The latest version of the ICCEE toolbox is available as free downloadable package on the ICCEE website.</jats:p>",

This work’s statistical method includes confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that a package of resilience capabilities - collaboration, flexibility, visibility, and analytical orientation - positively affect supply chain resilience. Improving such capabilities, therefore, will allow supply chains to recover better from disruptions. It was also discovered, however, that supply chains do not recover from disruptions by way of supply chain risk management alone.

The study focused on the management of water supply and main factors that affected the lack of the sustainability. The next step was the planning of appropriate solution for those problems, such as avoiding drilling of illegal groundwater wells and managing water sector that made the poor water management as well. The use of additional surface water accomplished with the construction of extra water treatment plants was seen as an alternative to consuming groundwater. Reusing of processed sewage for various consumption and recharging of groundwater was considered as sustainable strategy and management for the water field in Erbil City.</jats:p>"

Emergency supply allocation system is an important part of emergency governance system. It reflects social organizations’ credibility, public safety, and the modernization level of social governance. However, emergency supply allocation system still has some problems, such as information asymmetry, different desires of participants, unreasonable allocation, and so on. At present, it is widely accepted that the advantage of blockchain in co‐governance could be of great help in solving above problems. And in order to distinguish the effect of blockchain to the emergency supply allocation, the paper builds a tripartite evolutionary game model among the government, social organizations, and the public to analyse the impact of blockchain platform on emergency supply allocation. The simulation analysis shows the following: (1) The strategy choices of the government have a crucial impact on the evolution and stability of social organizations’ strategies. It needs a long‐term process to guide social organizations practicing active allocation, and the government should accelerate to build the blockchain platform to promote this process. (2) With the help of blockchain platform, the increment of penalty intensity of the government is conductive to increasing the probabilities that social organizations practice active allocation and the government practices strict supervision. (3) Blockchain platform has a significant impact on social organizations’ choice for active allocation in many aspects, such as the positive and negative effects of social organizations, effect’s increasing multiple, and the cost of the public informing. In the end, some suggestions are presented to improve the co‐governance of emergency supply allocation.</jats:p>",

Cstock mHealth also yielded positive impacts through time and cost savings, improved communication, and availability of essential medical stocks at all levels of the supply chain and improved data visibility for decision-making. However, poor network coverage, lack of power source for charging phone batteries, absence of monetary incentives, lack of technical support compromised the effective utilisation of the system. The chapter offers insights to policy makers, implementers, and research practitioners on how to build resilience in the management of medical supply chain in a primary healthcare setting through the use of innovative mHealth technology. </jats:p>"

This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model to design a closed-loop supply chain network and optimizing pricing policies under random disruption. Reusing the returned products is applied as a resilience strategy to cope with the waste of energy and improving supply efficiency. Moreover, it is necessary to find the optimal prices for both final and returned products. Therefore, the model is formulated based on demand function and it maximizes total supply chain’s profit. Finally, its application is explored through using the real data of an industrial company in glass industry.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate precipitation and sediment concentration on the outflow of different forms of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in three primary land-use types along the Pasikhan River, the biggest river entering the Anzali Wetland in the Southern Caspian sea. Water sampling was performed on a monthly basis during the time bracket of 2017–2018. Different forms of P including total, soluble, particulate, total reactive, and dissolved reactive, and total Kjeldahl N, soluble N, particulate N, and were determined in the water samples. Total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen contents lay within the range of 2.2–4.7 and from 0.14 to 0.33 mg l−1, respectively, downstream of the river. The highest monthly outflow of P from the watershed at the Agriculture station was recorded in October. Substantial conformity was found between the monthly trends of and and the trend of precipitation. The results indicated that sediment load intensified after an increase in the rainfall rate, leading to elevated N and P concentrations in the river water, mainly as particulate phosphorus and soluble nitrogen. It can also be inferred from the result that the concentration of N and P is directly related to the sediment concentration increase due to the rainfall. Increasing levels of nutrients such as N and P in the Pasikhan River can cause eutrophication in the Anzali Wetland, which needs conservative measures for reducing these elements' dynamic in the watershed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton growth may be limited by one or more essential nutrients, a phenomenon known as nutrient limitation. Nutrient limitation can vary spatially, including within and among systems, and temporally, including across seasons and years. For systems that are susceptible to eutrophication (the nutrient over-enrichment of water bodies), understanding patterns of nutrient limitation can be useful for water resource managers. We conducted phytoplankton growth bioassays in late February 2019 to analyze the nutrient limitation status of two water supply reservoirs (Oak Hollow Lake and City Lake), as well as an inflowing stream (Boulding Branch), in the North Carolina Piedmont. Two sites within each reservoir were assessed, including one site close to the water supply intake and one site further upstream. Each laboratory bioassay consisted of three nutrient addition treatments: nitrogen (N+), phosphorus (P+), and nitrogen and phosphorus (NP+), as well as a control. After 48 hr incubation under a growth light, chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> was measured in all samples, including initial samples taken prior to growth light incubation, and ANOVA was used to determine significant differences among treatments. The City Lake upstream site was P-limited, whereas the site closer to the intake was co-limited by N and P. The Oak Hollow downstream site closest to the water supply intake was P-limited while the Oak Hollow upstream site was not nutrient limited. Similarly, Boulding Branch was not nutrient limited. These results illustrate the spatial complexity of nutrient limitation. Further studies are needed to better understand this complexity, as well as examine seasonal and interannual patterns of nutrient limitation in these critical water supply reservoirs.</jats:p>",

Using 8‐year panel data collected from 317 US international manufacturers, we analyze the influence of GSCM practices on corporate financial performance (CFP) and the mediating role of a certified environmental management system (EMS) in this relationship. We show that GSCM practices have a positive impact on accounting‐based financial performance, meaning, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). In contrast, firms that implement GSCM practices and a certified EMS simultaneously achieve a higher market valuation in terms of Tobin's Q in addition to a higher ROA and ROE in the following year. Our study demonstrates that, through their synergistic combination with a firm's complementary EMS, utilizing GSCM practices can result in intangible assets as sources of long‐term financial benefits. Our results have several theoretical and managerial implications. They also address the limitations of the prior use of varying survey‐based items for internal and external GSCM practices and add nuance to the existing GSCM practices in the literature.</jats:p>",

In the second case, the necessity of using an MRM electronic signature based on the DVCS oracle is justified. Various options for constructing MRM are discussed. The chapter provides a comparative assessment of the electronic signature validation protocols and the rationale for using the DVCS protocol to implement the blockchain oracle.

As you know, crises almost always give impetus to create new great opportunities. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the problem of food shortages has become acute in the world, primarily because food supply chains have been interrupted across closed borders. Problems arose not only with consumers but also with producers who did not sell goods and did not receive the expected income. The turmoil in production and supply chains required ingenuity and resilience from managers. The world market began to create conditions for the redistribution of cash flows and spheres of influence. Because it was necessary to ensure the proper functioning of global supply chains to support economic activity. This has led to very rapid changes in the way suppliers are managed, combined with the reorientation of existing management tools and methods. The instability of the pandemic period has identified vulnerabilities in the global supply chain and identified the most vulnerable industries in the world. The global economic crisis caused by the coronavirus has affected four main pillars of food security: availability, affordability, usability and stability. This article describes the main trends over the past two years in the formation and modernization of global supply chains on the example of various industries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The phenomenon of copycats is common in a wide range of industries. Recently, to indicate product authenticity and combat copycats, many brand name companies (BNCs) have started selling products through retailers. These BNCs deploy a scalable protocol that is integrated into a permissioned blockchain technology (PBT) platform. We examine how PBT combats copycats in the supply chain and how it benefits BNCs. Although PBT implementation helps novice customers identify product authenticity and the real quality of products, that is, to take advantage of a quality disclosure effect, we show that, if and only if the number of novice customers is large enough, then selling through a PBT retailer can effectively combat copycats. Thus, PBT increases the profit of the BNC, consumer surplus, social welfare, and reduces the profit of a copycat. Moreover, conventional wisdom tells us that PBT ensures supply chain transparency and motivates a firm to improve its product quality. However, the BNC reduces the quality of its products when using PBT, because an improvement in product quality is not profitable if consumers can distinguish between genuine and imitation products. Furthermore, we extend the model by considering the case where the BNC itself implements PBT. Without the double marginalization effect, even if the number of novice customers is small, blockchain technology may exist in the market (the BNC self‐implements). In addition, if the unit production cost of a genuine product is large enough, social welfare increases when production cost increases. </jats:p>",

However, despite the benefits of such developments for organizations, they can lead to supply chain disruptions in many cases. An essential aspect of modern organizations is closed‐loop supply chain management, which reduces risk by coordinating processes. This paper presents a mathematical model of a closed‐loop green supply chain under uncertain conditions. A detailed description of the model and current assumptions for a specific industry are provided. Consequently, the model is developed with several relevant objectives for the design of the network. Our proposed model has the following characteristics: being multiobjective, multiproduct, and multiperiodic. Our analysis indicates that the applied model can be used both to increase profitability and to reduce environmental damage. The problem was made more uncertain using fuzzy logic.

This review explores the pivotal role of Generative AI in developing innovative supply chain strategies and highlights future trends and innovations. Generative AI leverages advanced machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and natural language processing, to provide accurate demand forecasting, optimize inventory management, and support scenario simulations for risk assessment. By analyzing historical data, market trends, and external factors, Generative AI offers predictive insights that enable proactive decision-making and resource allocation. Current supply chains face challenges such as inefficiencies, demand volatility, and disruptions caused by geopolitical events and global crises. Generative AI addresses these issues by creating dynamic, data-driven strategies that adapt to changing conditions. For example, AI-powered predictive models ensure just-in-time inventory management and real-time demand forecasting, reducing waste and improving responsiveness. Additionally, the integration of Generative AI with technologies such as blockchain and IoT creates opportunities for end-to-end supply chain visibility, secure data sharing, and process automation. Future trends in Generative AI include the development of autonomous supply chain ecosystems, enhanced collaboration through AI-driven platforms, and the use of synthetic data to simulate complex scenarios for contingency planning. As supply chains become more interconnected, Generative AI will play a critical role in optimizing operations, mitigating risks, and fostering sustainability. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how Generative AI contributes to innovative supply chain strategies and outlines the transformative potential of this technology in shaping the future of global supply chains. By embracing these advancements, businesses can achieve a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic and complex marketplace.</jats:p>"

In this study, we investigated behavioural and reproductive responses of two cladoceran species Ceriodaphnia dubia and Daphnia magna to water samples collected from metal-contaminated and reference rivers near legacy mines in Japan. The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) of water samples that caused D. magna immobility was conducted to evaluate the key metals causing acute toxicity. The results of our water quality assessment performed using two cladoceran species demonstrated modest to significant adverse effects on their behaviour and reproduction, suggesting the potential for ecotoxicological impacts on natural populations and communities at several contaminated sites that received mine drainage. The results of TIE of water samples that caused D. magna immobility indicated likely contributions of Zn and Cu. These results imply that effect-based water quality assessments such as ours can provide direct and unique evidence of the ecotoxicological impacts of metals in river waters, which will be useful for better understanding and predicting the ecological effects of these metals in the natural environment.</jats:p>",

It can be an alternative source of good-quality water to substitute other freshwater sources, to enable crop production beyond the growing season through supplemental irrigation as well as to improve the environment by minimizing the effect of drought and floods. The Rachuonyo North Sub-County of Kenya experiences low rainfall coupled with high population with limited access to reliable water sources. The study assessed the RWH potential of the Rachuonyo North Sub-Catchment with the aim of providing information on alternative water resources to meet the water demands for agriculture as well as domestic use in the region. The Australian water balance model (AWBM) was used to simulate the RWH potential of the Rachuonyo North Sub-Catchment using the area rainfall, evapotranspiration and river flow data. The calibration and validation of the model were performed with calibration and validation results yielding Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.503 and 1.00, respectively. Research findings indicated that the area has a potential for RWH with runoff harvest of between 104,496 and 43,646,142 m3/month, which can significantly support the residential and irrigation water demands for the area. Policymakers and development agencies in the region should pro-actively put in place measures to promote RWH interventions as a tool for increasing access to water. The methodology in the study is suitable for adaption for rainfall–runoff simulation in other sub-Saharan African regions where data are limiting.</jats:p>",

However, the symmetrical evaluation of enterprise trust is complex, so the decision-makers must understand its quantitative and qualitative characteristics in order to realize a reasonable evaluation. Based on the analysis of the causes and influencing factors of supply chain trust, this paper constructed four primary indexes and 16 secondary indexes to define enterprise trust, and used analytic network process (ANP) to evaluate and rank the indicators. Then, the paper constructed a supply chain directed weighted trust evolution network model based on complex network theory, integrated trust into the network with edge weights, and put forward the merit index of comprehensive node degree, weight, and efficiency to study the supply chain network evolution. The simulation results show that the node degree distribution in the trust evolution network conforms to the power-law distribution rule, and the trust evolution model of the complex network has obvious scale-free characteristics, which effectively avoid the situation that the node influence is too high due to the excessive strength of a single index. At the same time, it can quickly evaluate the node influence of the directed weighted complex network, and provide certain practical value for the node trust prediction of the supply chain network.</jats:p>"

In this regard, efficient supply chain planning for the production and distribution of perishable productsis of particular importance due to its leading role in the human food pyramid. One of the main challenges facing this chain is the time when products and goods are delivered to the customers and customer satisfaction will increase through this.In this research, a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)model is proposedto design a multi-level, multi-period, multi-product closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) for timely production and distribution of perishable products, taking into account the uncertainty of demand. To face the model uncertainty, the robust optimization (RO) method is utilized. Moreover, to solve and validate the bi-objective model in small-size problems, the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math id=\"M1\"&gt;\\begin{document}$ \\epsilon $\\end{document}&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-constraint method (EC) is presented. On the other hand, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is developed for solving large-size problems. First, the deterministic and robust models are compared by applying the suggested solutions methods in a small-size problem, and then, the proposed solution methods are compared in large-size problems in terms of different well-known metrics. According to the comparison, the proposed model has an acceptable performance in providing the optimal solutions and the proposed algorithm obtains efficient solutions.Finally, managerial insights are proposed using sensitivity analysis of important parameters of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Among them, close attention has been given to geothermal energy because of its abundant resources and supply stability. In this article, a deep borehole heat exchanger (DBHE) is coupled with a heat pump system to calculate the heat supply and daily electricity consumption of the system. To make better use of the peaks and valleys in electricity prices, the following three daily operating modes were studied: 24-h operation (Mode 1), 8-h operation plus 16-h non-operation (Mode 2), and two cycles of 4-h operation and 8-h non-operation (Mode 3). Simulation results show that scheduled non-continuous operation can effectively improve the outlet temperature of the heat extraction fluid circulating in the DBHE. The heat extraction rates of Mode 1 is 190.9 kW for mass flowrate of 9 kg/s; in Mode 2 and Mode 3 cases, the rates change to 304.7 kW and 293.0 kW, respectively. The daily operational electricity cost of Mode 1 is the greatest because of 24-h operation; due to scheduled non-continuous operation, the daily operational electricity cost of Mode 3 is only about 66% of that of Mode 2. After an 8-month period without heating, the formation-temperature can be restored within 4 °C of its original state; 90% recovery of the formation-temperature can be achieved by the end of the second month of the non-operation season.</jats:p>"

Considering market randomness and accumulation of production experience, a Stackelberg differential game model is constructed. In the game, the manufacturer is the leader and its pricing and emission reduction strategies over time are deduced in farsighted and myopic behaviors, respectively. In both behaviors, the emission reduction increases over time and a relatively low/high carbon price leads to skimming/penetrating pricing strategy of the manufacturer. Numerical study shows that the manufacturer must adopt a farsighted behavior for profit seeking except that consumers’ low‐carbon awareness is quite low, and the retailer also prefers the manufacturer to adopt this behavior. Increasing carbon price and consumers’ low‐carbon awareness benefits the manufacturer rather than the retailer. The governments can take measures to raise the carbon price to reduce the environmental impact.</jats:p>",

Every manufacturer or distributor has a subset of the supply chain that they have to manage and implement beneficially and efficiently for their survival and growth. Therefore, the production and delivery of products in the proper amounts and at the right time is as important as minimizing costs as well as customer satisfaction. Considering these reasons, supply chain network optimization includes decisions from many different aspects. In this study, a single‐product three‐level supply chain with manufacturer‐customer loops is considered that customer demand, percentage of returned products from customers, and delivery time from manufacturers to customers are considered as fuzzy variables with uncertainty. Simultaneously considering the issues of selecting suppliers and distributors and determining the effective customers in the system is under uncertainty. This project aims to provide a model that, in addition to integrating the conflicting goals of the loops, also increases the number of uncertain parameters of the model. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed model are to maximize product quality; minimize total cost; minimize delivery time from distributors to customers; and maximize revenue from selling products to customers.</jats:p>",

This quantitative study investigates the impact of sourcing strategies and logistics capabilities on the performance of Jordanian pharmaceutical enterprises using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The views and perceptions of 951 managers and assistant manager respondents working in Jordanian pharmaceutical companies were gathered anonymously via an electronic online questionnaire using a convenience sampling technique. The findings revealed that sourcing strategies and logistical capabilities have a significant positive impact on organizational performance in pharmaceutical companies. Insourcing, near-sourcing, few / many suppliers, joint ventures, and virtual enterprises were perceived to be effective sourcing strategies in improving organizational performance. In contrast, outsourcing, and vertical integration were perceived to have a negligible impact on the performance in the context of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the findings confirmed that individual logistic capabilities (safety and compliance, storage, delivery, and imports and exports) of pharmaceutical firms were perceived as impacting positively on firm performance. This research provides useful insight for decision makers in pharmaceutical companies in Jordan when reviewing their supply chain, particularly during challenging and turbulent times such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

As estratégias metodológicas foram revisão bibliográfica, análise de documentos oficiais e dados fornecidos por Farmanguinhos e pelo Departamento de Condições Crônicas e Infecções Sexualmente Transmissíveis do Ministério da Saúde, via Lei de Acesso à Informação. Este artigo mostra que o estabelecimento das parcerias abriu novas perspectivas para o desenvolvimento da política de oferta pública de antirretrovirais para as pessoas vivendo com HIV, por contribuir para a sustentabilidade das despesas financeiras do Ministério da Saúde com medicamentos. Farmanguinhos é o laboratório público que fornece mais quantidades e recebe os maiores valores provenientes do fornecimento desses produtos ao Ministério da Saúde. Embora os medicamentos importados preponderem largamente em quantidade e valores pagos pelo Ministério da Saúde, Farmanguinhos permanece sendo um provedor fundamental na produção local de antirretrovirais. Apesar dos problemas verificados nas Parcerias, os ganhos nas competências tecnológicas na produção de antirretrovirais podem ampliar o horizonte tecnológico e produtivo do laboratório.</jats:p>"

The production yield of mulberry is about 848.6 kg/acre/year; however, it is mostly sold as frozen product. The Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture intends to develop a new marketing channel for fresh mulberry fruit. The present study was to explore the current situation of mulberry fruit supply chain management in Nan province and to propose a new supply chain model for fresh mulberry. To gather information about supply chain management, the supply chain operation reference (SCOR) model was utilized to investigate four members of the mulberry supply chains, including growers, primary middlemen, secondary middlemen, and customers. The SCOR model possibly identifies critical points in the current supply chain and five obstacles in the distribution of fresh mulberries that are improperly handled, affecting market channels and product quality due to a lack of suitable knowledge and technology for postharvest handling. Active packaging technology of fresh mulberries from a previous study was introduced to design a new supply chain model, and it was found that this technology could extend the product’s shelf life and preserve its freshness. Although the cost of the active packaging technology leads to a much higher cost on the newly developed supply chain compared to that of the traditional supply chain, the developed model could enhance new market channels, including selling prices, and provide growers with more benefits than the traditional supply chain.</jats:p>",

Inspired by game theory, we develop an equilibrium model for a retailer-led, closed-loop supply chain under logistics outsourcing. We derive the optimal forward and reverse logistics decisions of each supply chain member. This article analyzes the effects of market size, consumers' sensitivity to sales prices, the proportion of logistics costs, consumers' environmental awareness, and consumers' sensitivity to recycling prices on decision-making process. Finally, we provide a numerical example to verify the validity of our conclusions. Our results indicate that the higher the manufacturer's share in the forward logistics cost, the higher the sales price, the wholesale price, and the forward logistics service price, and the lower the order quantity. The higher the manufacturer's share in the reverse logistics costs, the lower the recycling price, the transfer price, and the recycling amount, and the higher the reverse logistics service price. Whether it is forward logistics or not, the higher the manufacturer's share in the logistics costs, the lower the profits of each member.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Methods: To achieve this, we combine and modify appropriately two recent risk assessment method ologies targeted to cyber physical systems and interactions, as underlying building blocks. By applying the existing method ology, we enable the utilization of well-known software vulnerability taxonomies, to extract vulnerability and impact submetrics for all the interactions among the system components. These metrics are then fed to the risk analysis phase in order to assess the overall cyber-physical risks and to prioritize the list of potential mitigation controls.  Results: To validate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method ology, we apply it in a realistic scenario involving supply chain tracking systems.  Conclusion: Our results show that the proposed method ology can be effectively applied to capture the risks deriving from cyber and physical interactions among system components in realistic application scenarios, while for large scale networks further testing should be carried out.</jats:p>"

The influence of exhaust terminals number and location on the diffusion process of coughed droplet is analyzed under heating mode. The results show that the relative pollutant concentration in the breathing area of stratum ventilation is lower than that of mixing ventilation. When the air exhaust terminals are high from the ground and the number are small, it is more conducive to reduce the infection risk of medical staff. The deposition rate and suspension rate of stratum ventilation are higher than that of mixing ventilation, and the escape rate is lower. When the number of exhaust outlets is large and the location is high, the nonuniformity coefficient is the smallest and the deposition rate is the largest, which are 0.668, 0.029 and 91.4% respectively. The escape rate is higher when the number of exhaust outlets is small and the location is high, and the suspension rate is higher when the number of exhaust outlets is large and the location is low, which are 27.9% and 1.11% respectively.</jats:p>"

The author's approach to assessing the discrepancy between demand and supply of professional skills is based on the calculation of indicators of the share of the unemployed with a certain level of education (higher professional education, secondary vocational education, initial vocational education) in the total number of unemployed with vocational education. The obtained indicators are interpreted as a type of imbalance in the supply and demand of professional skills. As a result of the implementation of the approach, the analysis of the obtained regional situations in the context of each level of vocational education was carried out, the situations were identified and the subjects of the Russian Federation were classified according to the degree of stability of situations of imbalance by its types. To interpret the results obtained, an approach based on the Chaddock scale was applied, adapted to the development of an assessment scale for the stability of imbalances. The conducted research confirms the presence of a variety of regional situations from the standpoint of the imbalance in the supply and demand of professional skills. The conclusions can serve as the basis for developing recommendations for the formation of regional strategies for the development of the labor market.</jats:p>"

The important role of supply chain management has pointed out the requirement of the firm to efficiently develop the supply chain to get the maximum result in terms of its performance and business outcome. The production procedures include many functions inside the company and the further period of the producer in the supply chain. However, it depends upon the whole supply chain to develop a procedure of easy and all possible product movement, the same case occurred to gain the desirable flexibility.</jats:p>"

This paper takes the typical semi-arid agricultural region in China as the research object. The movement of soil water under the three types of underlying surface was simulated by the Hydrus-2D model for the quantitative analysis of groundwater recharge. The influence of drip irrigation under mulch on groundwater infiltration depth and cumulative infiltration amount under different level years was simulated. Taking a normal flow year as an example, the simulated results showed that the maximum infiltration depth of drip irrigation under mulch reached 250 cm, which was greater than that of border irrigation (138 cm) and bare area (158 cm). The cumulative infiltration amounts of drip irrigation under mulch at 80, 120, 140 and 200 cm were respectively 1,484.8 m3/hm2, 686.3 m3/hm2, 554.1 m3/hm2 and 238.1 m3/hm2, which were greater than that of border irrigation and bare land at the same depth. The results proved that drip irrigation under mulch could increase the infiltration depth and cumulative infiltration amount, which is beneficial to groundwater recharge in semi-arid agricultural regions of China.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Salvia sclarea L. is a Cd2+ tolerant medicinal herb with antifungal and antimicrobial properties cultivated for its pharmacological properties. However, accumulation of high Cd2+ content in its tissues increases the adverse health effects of Cd2+ in humans. Therefore, there is a serious demand to lower human Cd2+ intake. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the mitigative role of excess Zn2+ supply to Cd2+ uptake/translocation and toxicity in clary sage. Salvia plants were treated with excess Cd2+ (100 μM CdSO4) alone, and in combination with Zn2+ (900 μM ZnSO4), in modified Hoagland nutrient solution. The results demonstrate that S. sclarea plants exposed to Cd2+ toxicity accumulated a significant amount of Cd2+ in their tissues, with higher concentrations in roots than in leaves. Cadmium exposure enhanced total Zn2+ uptake but also decreased its translocation to leaves. The accumulated Cd2+ led to a substantial decrease in photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and disrupted the chloroplast ultrastructure, which coincided with an increased lipid peroxidation. Zinc application decreased Cd2+ uptake and translocation to leaves, while it mitigated oxidative stress, restoring chloroplast ultrastructure. Excess Zn2+ ameliorated the adverse effects of Cd2+ on PSII photochemistry, increasing the fraction of energy used for photochemistry (ΦPSII) and restoring PSII redox state and maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm), while decreasing excess excitation energy at PSII (EXC). We conclude that excess Zn2+ application eliminated the adverse effects of Cd2+ toxicity, reducing Cd2+ uptake and translocation and restoring chloroplast ultrastructure and PSII photochemical efficiency. Thus, excess Zn2+ application can be used as an important method for low Cd2+-accumulating crops, limiting Cd2+ entry into the food chain.</jats:p>"

The results show that when one of the dual‐channel retailers adopts live broadcast sales, the live broadcast service overflow will have an adverse impact on it, but the degree of the impact depends on the market potential of supply chain members, and different power structures can be used to offset the adverse impact of live broadcast service overflow. Then, the live broadcast sales service overflow will have a certain beneficial impact on online retailers under certain circumstances. Furthermore, with the increase of live broadcast sales service overflow, the retail prices of both companies will decline, while the live broadcast sales service overflow is more beneficial for consumers.</jats:p>",

Special storage conditions, short shelf life, and lack of particular demand for blood products are among the most significant challenges to managing it. In this respect, it is necessary to implement the problem of supply chain network design in uncertain conditions to find a proper solution for the management of blood products. In this study, a multilevel supply chain is designed to supply plasma in the COVID‐19 pandemic. First, the blood is sent to blood donation centers and then to the laboratory. Moreover, after that, it is sent to hospitals. To optimize the transfer rate at each level of the supply chain, a mathematical model is proposed to reduce total costs. Also, the fuzzy programming approach is used to deal with uncertainty in the parameters of the mathematical model. The results of model optimization show that this mathematical model has the required efficiency in finding optimal solutions for the distribution of blood products. According to the obtained results, value objective function in certain and uncertain values is determined. According to the results, the objective certain value is lower than the uncertain value. Uncertain value calculated is of three dimensions. According to this, the categorized objective value increased when the dimension is equal to 0.5. Finally, it shows that when demand increases, more blood and plasma need to be collected to meet the demand, which increases operating and health testing costs and ultimately increases total system costs.</jats:p>",

It is important to encourage firms to effectively undertake social responsibilities and improve social welfare. Recently, it has become very popular for firms to demonstrate their social responsibility through SRD campaigns. With the aim of solving the decision-making problem of a retailer-led socially responsible supply chain considering government subsidy, this study established a three-stage Stackelberg game model. By analyzing the impact of pricing and donation decisions on operations and management, either with or without government subsidy, we found that to achieve better performance, retail firms will choose to implement donation activities. However, it is not the case that the higher the donation, the better the performance. In addition, there is a gap: without government subsidy, social welfare is not optimal when members’ performance in the supply chain is maximized, and more donations are needed to maximize social welfare. This study proves that government subsidy can encourage supply chain members to generate more donations, while improving the performance of the supply chain and social welfare. We propose an optimal subsidy rate to eliminate the gap and maximize social welfare. We also analyze the impact of external parameters, including the cost parameter and consumer preference level, on the equilibrium results. Finally, we extend this research to provide management insights for businesses under uncertain market sizes and centralized decision-making scenarios.</jats:p>"

Three forms of the self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) were used to collect data from three targets; farmers, wholesalers, and retailers using the nonprobability sampling method. Descriptive analysis was used to show frequencies, percentages, and mean scores, while Independent Sample T-Test was used to find the relationship between variables using SPSS software V.26. Results show that there is no statistically significant relationship between characteristics of production and residence.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 has left many multinational enterprises facing extremely severe supply disruptions. Besides considering triple-bottom-line requirements, managers now also have to consider supply disruption due to the pandemic more seriously. However, existing research does not take these two key objectives into account simultaneously. To bridge this research gap, based on the characteristics of COVID-19 and similar global emergency events, this article proposes a model that aims to solve the problem of sustainable supplier selection and order allocation considering supply disruption in the COVID-19 era. It does so by using a multi-stage multi-objective optimization model applied to the different stages of development and spread of the pandemic. Then, a novel nRa-NSGA-II algorithm is proposed to solve the high-dimensional multi-objective optimization model. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated in a well-known multinational producer of shortwave therapeutic instruments. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: M11 </jats:p>",

They had little education (69%) with 11 years of experience. All the small ruminant traders originated from pastoral regions where breeding represented a dominant activity. The most traded species were sheep (90.5%) and goats (9.5%). Diguel’s markets ensured the supply of animals to other markets. Animals are transported to other markets by minibuses (57.1%) and vans (33.3%), at an average price of 1,100 CFA francs per head. The expenses incurred were around 2,376 CFA francs / head / day. Average selling price was 26,577.33 ± 3,801.08 CFA francs for sheep and 19,583.33± 1,878.84 CFA francs for goats. With three (3) sheep and two (2) goats sold per day, the average net margin achieved was 7,752 CFA francs and 6,840 CFA francs for sheep and goats, respectively. The organization of stakeholders and the development of livestock market infrastructure will allow a better supply of small ruminants to the markets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to discuss the accidental events’ impacts on the complicated supply chain systems and reveal the dynamic nonlinear system’s role in enterprises’ logistics financial management. First, the logistics distribution network and nonlinear system are analyzed and introduced, revealing the complexity of enterprises’ supply chain systems. Second, considering the situation of enterprises’ financial management, four major entities, the supplier, the distributor, the retailer, and the manufacturer, are introduced to construct a dynamic nonlinear model for the supply chain system. Finally, the model before and after accidental events are simulated and analyzed using the AnyLogic software. Results demonstrate that in normal states, each node’s inventory in the system changes periodically, while the distributor’s state is the most stable. A notable decrease in market demand has the largest impact on the distributor. Once the market demand is recovered, the decrease in the distributor’s inventory is the most apparent, and the inventories of the supplier, the retailer, and the manufacturer also decrease. The supplier has the highest cost at the beginning of system operation, and the distributor’s cost is the highest after the operation becomes stable. Once an accidental event caused a sharp decrease in market demand, the costs of all major entities in the system show an increasing trend. Once the market demand is recovered, the costs of different node entities will increase instead. As for the profits, the distributor has the highest profit initially, which is significantly influenced by the accidental events. The results provide a reference for revealing the changing laws of complicated supply chain systems and promoting the development of enterprises’ financial management. </jats:p>",

The study considered all currently qualified suppliers according to considerably rigorous standards and specifications and one in qualification process. It is a complex choice, given the strategic importance of the product and the multiplicity of criteria to be considered, both quantitative and qualitative. The strong competitiveness requires a special attention which concerns the supplier selection; not only the price matters; in fact, a day of stoppage due to failure in a delivery, for example, corresponds to high losses that would have justified the purchase from a supplier with a higher price but with no delivery failures. In order to contribute to the problem resolution, the methodologies PROMETHEE and AHP were applied, whose results allow the authors to stablish a ranking of the considered suppliers. The results will support the company on the selection of fiberglass suppliers and in some cases clarify where they can find the main trade-offs. </jats:p>",

Event study estimates reveal that domestic firms experience strong and persistent gains in performance after supplying to a first MNC buyer. Four years after, domestic firms employ 26% more workers and have a 4% to 9% higher total factor productivity (TFP). These effects are unlikely to be explained by demand effects or changes in tax compliance. Moreover, suppliers experience a large drop in their sales to all other buyers except the first MNC buyer in the year of the event, followed by a gradual recovery. The dynamics of adjustment in sales to others suggests that firms face short-run capacity constraints that relax over time. Four years later, the sales to others grow by 20%. Most of this growth comes from the acquisition of new buyers, which tend to be “better buyers” (e.g., larger and with more stable supplier relationships). Finally, we collected survey data from domestic firms and MNCs to provide further insights into the wide-ranging benefits of supplying to MNCs. According to our surveys, these benefits range from better managerial practices to a better reputation.</jats:p>",

On the one hand, information about the products and production is exchanged between each stage in the supply chain system. Such information affects the behaviors of each stage. On the other hand, the transport of products between the stages of the supply chain affects the behavior of the system. Our findings are summarized as follows: First, we find that the supply chain model is a system with four chaotic attractors. Second, we explore the synchronization of such a chaotic system. Third, according to the characteristics of the chaotic system, we design a variety of simple control laws to realize the synchronization of two chaotic systems with the same structure. These control laws for the chaotic system are proved to realize local asymptotic synchronization or global exponential synchronization. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm that the designed controls work well.</jats:p>",

The studies were carried out on a computer model of an isolated power supply system of an industrial enterprise with a turbine generator plant, a wind generator plant and a high-power electric storage unit, for which a fuzzy control system and a prognostic controller were used.

The article describes a computer model of an isolated power supply system, as well as a structural diagram of the proposed autoprognostic speed controller. The simulation results showed that the combined use of an energy storage unit and an auto-prognostic generator rotor speed controller makes it possible to ensure the stability and survivability of an isolated power supply system, increasing its damping properties. The use of a fuzzy control system of a wind-generating plant made it possible to ensure its stable operation in all considered modes.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSION. The auto-prognostic speed controller, which does not require special settings, and the energy storage unit provide high quality control indicators in normal and emergency modes. It is advisable to conduct further studies to coordinate the actions of the control system of the electric energy storage unit and the auto-prognostic speed controller of the distributed generation plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant resource deficiencies, especially with regards to basic facilities required for the safety of Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Resource deficiency can be attributed both to inadequate production and to misdirected distribution due to deficits in the global supply chain, particularly in a time-sensitive situation like this. Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) face the added burden of economic constraints and underdeveloped health-care infrastructure. Lack of a centralized approach, ineffective rapid communication (especially amongst private and public entities), stockpiling and inefficient resource allocation further exacerbate this underlying issue.Approach: Project Alloy has worked on building a platform for “Logistical Triage” to strengthen the coordination of resource networks in crisis situations. We aim to facilitate supply chain optimization by tackling inequitable resource distribution through a centralized management approach. Through our portal, healthcare organizations in need of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other key resources would be connected to non-governmental organizations, government agencies and manufacturers to enable time-sensitive and need-based optimization of resource allocation and distribution. Outcomes: We hope to facilitate near-real time tracking of resource consumption, to guide the efforts of rapidly emerging “pop-up” suppliers and manufacturers. This would ultimately feed into three key outcomes: a) to ensure immediate continuity of supplies to HCPs in the frontline against COVID-19; b) to track and preempt the trajectory of resource deficiencies and demands in order to mitigate the impact of the rapidly rising incidence of COVID-19 cases; and c) to establish a centralized network for healthcare specific e-commerce infrastructure in low-middle income countries to facilitate future crisis management. Future Steps: We plan to expand iteratively, to include e-commerce technology to build our supplier dashboard and to develop a crisis specific e-commerce marketplace for healthcare resources.</jats:p>"

This  study  examined  challenges  of transportation in the supply chain of urban fresh fruits and vegetables in Dar es Salaam City, with a major focus on handling, connection and distribution. Qualitative approach was adopted and data were drawn from a purposive sample of 65 respondents using interviews, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and non-participant observation. Thematic analysis was adopted with the help of MAXQDA 10 software. Findings, proved that transportation challenges were related to inappropriate handling tools, poor transport technology, inadequate knowledge of handling fruits and vegetables by the workers, inadequate number of transportation vehicles and poor maintenance of storage facilities. It was further reported  that  inadequate  road  network  and  connectivity  characterised  by  remote  location  of  the  farms,  poorly constructed roads and bridges, narrow roads, geographical constraints as well as lack of appropriate transport system challenged  the  transportation  role.  Other  challenges  wererelated  to  lack  of  information  exchange  mechanism, inadequate distribution system resulting from absence of distribution and central storage, corruption and bribery, as well as lack of insurance cover. The study advocates for the provision of handling tools, special vehicles for transporting these produce, improvement of road infrastructures, introduction of processing industries and provision of insurance cover to intermediaries. It further proposes to institutions responsible for curbing corruption such as the PCCB and police to address corruption challenge</jats:p>",

The indicators under observation are presented for the EU27 for the purposes of comparison. In accordance with economic theory, the main conclusion of the paper is that supply-side shocks can be a significant source of cyclical fluctuations and an inflation trigger. Therefore, policymakers have a complex task to minimize the effects of these shocks. Nowadays, when energy prices are reaching historically high levels, the scientific contribution of supply-side shocks can be found in the deep analysis and well-grounded estimations of the role of those shocks in the preservation of macroeconomic stability and the economic policy measures necessary for the minimization of their negative effects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the advantages of sustainable competition for manufacturing systems is to make supply chain activities more efficient and effective. One of the major parts of these activities that can save a lot of costs is careful outsourcing. In this study, an approach based on decision‐making policies in order to select suppliers and allocate order volume to them is introduced. The main contribution of this research is a comprehensive approach for optimizing both supplier evaluation and order allocation. In this regard, first, based on the evaluation, 39 key indicators were identified to evaluate the suppliers, and based on the content analysis, 25 key indicators were screened based on the Lavache method. Next, based on the fuzzy Delphi method, 11 indicators were selected from among the 25 key effective indicators. Finally, the Best‐Worst Method (BWM) and a robust multi‐objective formulation are proposed to find the weight of the effective criteria and the optimal order allocation to suppliers, respectively. Moreover, it is proved that the company under study faces a variety of suppliers and there is a need to analyze key indicators such as exchange rate changes and ease of communication. Based on the BWM results, it was shown that the exchange rate change trend with a weight of 0.24 is in the first place, and the quality system support index with a weight of 0.12 is in the second place. Moreover, based on the results of the proposed robust multi‐objective mathematical model, it was revealed that in order to maintain the resilience of suppliers, the total demand should be distributed among all suppliers and the second supplier with a volume of 3600 units of raw materials has the largest share in delivering the required demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main goals of supply chain management is to ensure proper flows of products and information through all nodes to supply them in the right place at the right time. To achieve this objective, it is very important to consider flows of products and finances among supply chain nodes. Traditionally, operational and financial processes have been optimized as separate problems. The developed model addresses the problem of designing a supply chain network and tries to integrate both areas of operations and financial aspects to maximize the value created and measured by the Shareholder Value Analysis (SVA). The results show that with appropriate financial decisions, creating more value for the company and its shareholders is achievable. The developed model with a new financial approach is able to improve the total created shareholder value as much as 0.7% larger than the SVA obtained without financial aspects and 0.93% larger than the value created by the basic model. The main reason for an increase in value creation is due to new operational and financial aspects, which mainly show the possibility of closing facilities and bank debt repayments. To validate and show the applicability of the proposed model, it was solved by GAMS‐BARON solver with data provided from the literature. Sensitivity analyses on financial parameters were performed to evaluate the results.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a two-echelon dual-channel supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Considering the product pricing, CSR level, and service level in the supply chain, this paper employs the Stackelberg game to depict supply chain participants’ optimal decisions and analyze the influence of explanatory variables on the optimal decision with retailer’s payment methods. The results state that market share, service level, CSR, and financing interest rate significantly impact the pricing decision of all participants in the supply chain. In addition, strategies of CSR level and service level are also affected by the discount rate of advance payment, financing interest rate, return on investment, and opportunity cost rate. This paper incorporates CSR and service level into the objective function, considers a variety of retailers’ payment methods, enriches the supply chain’s pricing model, and is of great value to scientific decision-making of enterprises and sustainable development of supply chains.</jats:p>",

Currently applied regulatory changes have several disadvantages ranging from political tensions to the neglect of ecological aspects. The aim of this study is to show some implications associated with a transformation of the recreational drug market that is focused on self-supply of different categories of drugs. The concepts of \"farmability\", the feasibility to cultivate relevant plants and fungi, and \"pharmability\", the feasibility to refine materials to drugs by chemical synthesis, purification etc., are addressed. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p> 68 drug experts were invited to fill out an online survey on the feasibility of self-supply of different categories of drugs.

Cannabinoids were considered easy to cultivate/manufacture, depressants and psychedelics were ranked with moderate difficulty, opioids and stimulants were regarded as difficult to cultivate/manufacture, and empathogens/entactogens and dissociatives were ranked very difficult. The study found that some controlled substances, in particular cannabis, could be decriminalised without the need for a commercial market. However, some drug categories, such as dissociatives and empathogens/entactogens, would require the establishment of professional manufacturers. Psychedelics and depressants are ranked in between. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p> Different drugs are associated with different cultivation and/or manufacturing steps with contrasting difficulty levels. Those differences are likely to shape use prevalence to more accessible and safer drug markets which also decrease the involvement of organised crime groups. Hence, when decriminalising the possession of drugs for personal use, it is therefore recommended to allow also for personal cultivation or cultivation within social clubs. This is particularly relevant for drugs with moderate to high farmability but also if pharmability is sufficiently high. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing number of rice product safety issues and the potential for contamination have established an enormous need for an effective strategy for the traceability of the rice supply chain. Tracing the origins of a rice product from raw materials to end customers is very complex and costly. Existing food supply chain methods (for example, rice) do not provide a scalable and cost-effective means of agricultural food supply. Besides, consumers lack the capability and resources required to check or report on the quality of agricultural goods in terms of defects or contamination. Consequently, customers are forced to decide whether to utilize or discard the goods. However, blockchain is an innovative framework capable of offering a transformative solution for the traceability of agricultural products and food supply chains. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework capable of tracking and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholders in the rice chain ecosystem through smart contracts. The model incorporates a system for customer satisfaction feedback, which enables all stakeholders to get up-to-date information on product quality, enabling them to make more informed supply chain decisions. Each transaction is documented and stored in the public ledger of the blockchain. The proposed framework provides a safe, efficient, reliable, and effective way to monitor and track rice products safety and quality especially during product purchasing. The security and performance analysis results shows that the proposed framework outperform the benchmark techniques in terms of cost-effectiveness, security and scalability with low computational overhead.</jats:p>"

The study also attempts to determine the numbers for the operational flexibility dimensions which will help the researchers in future find healthcare operational flexibility dimensions valid and reliable. A model consisting of two constructs of operations flexibility structures: external flexibility and internal robustness is examined to measure health operations flexibility elements in service sectors. Respondents are the health leaders (managers, middle manager, top manager and others) who were working in health service sectors in the United Arab Emirate. The underlying constructs of operations flexibility are empirically verified and validated through Reliability Analysis Procedure, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), First and Second Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Construct Validity Procedures, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to test the model, drawing on a sample of 250. The findings revealed that the model of the UAE health service sector consists of two latent's operations flexibility dimensions namely external flexibility and internal robustness, each dimension consisting of four items. Further research should be considered to validate these findings in the other firms. The two dimensions of health operations flexibility represent a valid instrument to measure the operations flexibility in the services sector in the United Arab Emirate. This research is important for one to understand the main topics of health operations flexibility in the health services sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, with the rapid development of the Internet, society has entered the era of “information explosion.” Financial data are a particularly important part of network information, and it has also reached a new level of public demand. The frequent appearance of words such as “carbon peak” and “green” indicates the transition of national policies to the field of sustainable development. Sustainable development would become an inevitable choice, and a green supply chain has become a new trend under this policy background. Supply chain finance uses the ideas and methods of key supply management to provide financial services to related enterprises. If an enterprise cannot acquire, organize, and use the information and data in the supply chain, it is likely to be outdated or even abandoned in the short term. This paper takes the artificial intelligence green financial system as the background and uses the cooperation theory model to analyze and predict the big data information of the enterprise supply chain. It realizes the transformation of information into sustainable resources for enterprises and releases the huge potential of big data. In this model, this model not only helped the company’s overall profit increase by about 8.79% but also provided scientific support for corporate decision‐making and promoted the development of the company.</jats:p>",

UAE and the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Excellence in Implementation 2017 report suggests that UAE raises cognizance of, and integrates, sustainability standards into its agenda to promote sustainable lifestyles. Since most products in UAE are imported, the supply chain is lengthy and fragmented, making procurement expensive. Hence, an innovative technology-driven green supply chain can be an effective solution for both cost and waste reduction. </jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the rate of cadmium (Cd) uptake and changes in absorption of other elements using different plants at different cadmium concentrations under salinity conditions. This study was performed as a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications at Zanjan University located in northwestern Iran. For this purpose, three aquatic plants, Azolla Caroliniana, Watercress, and Duckweed, were used. In these experiments, different levels of Cd (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg L−1) in the nutrient solution as well as different NaCl concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mM L−1) were employed. After producing nutrient solutions with salinity and different Cd concentrations, three plants were grown in them for 30 days. The absorption of different elements such as Cd, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na was measured in the plants. The results showed that the studied plants absorbed high concentrations of Cd. It was also concluded that the salinity of nutrient solution directly relates to Cd concentration in the plant tissues. The highest concentration of Cd in Azolla Caroliniana in 40 mg Cd and 80 mM NaCl was obtained with an average of 3,470.8 mg kg−1. In general, the results showed that the use of all three plants is suitable for purifying Cd-contaminated water.</jats:p>",

In the countries that have water resources the financial support is given to the development of small and micro hydropower stations. The present work presents the results of the research on the improved method of calculation of water-diverting structures of low-head hydroelectric power plant with an installed cross-jet hydro turbine that is actual for the power supply of small power consumers. The presented method can be used for the preliminary analysis of morphometric characteristics of water course as well as the basic parameters of a cross-jet hydro turbine.</jats:p>",

In this study, a random yield supply chain, in which the production process of fresh agricultural products is easily affected by factors, such as weather, soil, or plant diseases and insect pests, was considered. Therefore, the actual output is typically less than the planned output. A model in which the producer faces yield uncertainty was considered, and the influence of the producer’s fairness concerns on the planned output of the contract‐farming supply chain was considered. Methods to motivate the producer to increase planned output through reasonable contracts were investigated. The results revealed that the producer’s fairness concern considerably influences the optimal expected profit. In the case of the random output, the planned output and maximum expected profits reduce when the farmer exhibits fairness concerns. As the degree of the producer’s fairness concern increases, the planned output and expected profit gradually decrease The cost‐sharing contract can effectively encourage the producer to increase his planned output and expected utility. Finally, the results were verified numerically.</jats:p>",

The aim of the research is to elaborate on the ways for increasing the available water supply of drainage systems and restoring active water regulation on reclaimed lands in a changing climate. Reclaimed lands are the main factor of sustainable agricultural production in Ukraine and guarantors of its stability. The area of drained lands in Ukraine is about 3.2 million hectares, including 2.3 million hectares drained with the help of closed drainage; in an area of 1.3 million hectares a two-way regulation of the soil water regime is carried out. An increase in air temperature and uneven distribution of precipitation, which has a torrential, local character in the warm period, do not allow for the e ective accumulation of moisture. The recurrence of droughts in di erent justified climatic zones of Ukraine has increased by 20–40%, which prevents sustainable agricultural production in the zone of su cient atmospheric moisture, in particular the Polesie Ecoregion. In this paper, the analysis of water consumption of reclaimed lands in the Polesie Ecoregion of Ukraine is carried out, on the examples of the drainage system “Maryanivka” and the calculation of the water supply for the corn and winter wheat.</jats:p>",

The use of big data technology can lower agricultural production and distribution costs, increase agricultural modernization’s effectiveness, and support the transformation and upgrading of the agricultural economy. Big data technology has garnered a lot of attention as a burgeoning technological area. Big data has revolutionised the service model for “agriculture, rural areas, and farmers” and given agricultural economy supply‐side structure optimization new life. In the age of big data, we should reexamine the way agricultural economic information is currently released, propose more scientific techniques for doing so, and improve the effectiveness of implementation across the board. In light of the background of big data, this research investigates and evaluates the supply‐side structure of the agricultural sector. The big data method is combined in this work to explore and analyse it. This study shows that the supply‐side structure of the agricultural economy, when seen against the backdrop of big data, has a definite impact, with an impact as high as 56.56%.

Under the conditions of global changes in the world economy and geopolitical situation, sufficient supply of domestic power market needs guarantees national security of the Russian Federation. High quality of legal regulation of contractual structures is one of the fundamental factors that contribute to the sustainable development of the power market. At the same time, neither the legislator, nor law enforcers, nor representatives of civil science have not developed a unified classification of elements of the system of civil law contracts that contribute to the supply of customers (consumers) with electricity, which makes it timely and expedient to study this issue in a comprehensive way. Purpose. The study is to develop a classification of civil contracts that contribute to the supply of electricity cus-tomers (consumers) as elements of a unified system. Objectives to study the currently developed classifications of contracts in the retail and wholesale electricity market, to identify the specific features of the legislative approach to the system of civil law related to electricity. Methodology of the study is represented by the dialectical-materialistic method, the systematic method, as well as the analysis, synthesis and formal-legal method were applied. Results. Developed the author's version of the system of civil contracts contributing to the supply of buyers (consumers) of electricity: contracts regulating the wholesale electricity market; contracts regulating the retail electricity markets; service contracts that ensure the functioning of the above-mentioned contracts; organizational contracts that contribute to the production, delivery and consumption of electricity. Conclusion.  General provisions of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation on contracts and obligations, their performance and responsibility are fully valid for contractual forms serving wholesale and retail power markets of our country, but taking into account principles, norms and rules of energy legislation. It is proposed to introduce into the energy legislation a provision that power supply contracts on the wholesale and retail power markets are possible only with participation of commercial organizations or individual entrepreneurs within the framework of civil law supply contract.</jats:p>"

Decision-making on chain management should be based on a comprehensive assessment of all elements of the supply chain in order to further use green methods and technologies. An effective tool for such an assessment is the use of multicriteria decision-making methods (MCDM). The article presents an overview of the research on application of the MCDM «Method of evaluation and testing of decision-making» (DEMATEL) in green logistics and management of green supply chains. A methodology for evaluating and ranking elements of the green supply chain using the DEMATEL method is proposed. The implementation of the recommended methodology makes it possible to assess the relationship between all elements of the supply chain and the strength of their influence on each other. A calculated example of ranking the elements of the green supply chain reveals that the largest number of interconnections in the supply chain is accounted for transport and storage elements of the logistics system. The results of the study may be used as a basis for planning and implementation of decisions to use the green logistics tools.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the impact of changes in contribution rates on wages, labor costs and labor supply using a rich administrative data set covering individual employees in the Netherlands for the period 2006–2012. With a panel-based approach and data on both marginal and average contribution rates we aim to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the incidence and labor supply (in hours) effects of pension contributions. For a two-year change in pension contributions we find that 70% of this change is passed on to the labor costs of employers, while 30% is passed on to the net wage of the employee. No significant effects are found for labor supply. At least in the short and medium run, our results seem at variance with the standard demand-and-supply model for the labor market, but are consistent with a bargaining model.</jats:p>",

Whether the location of emergency temporary blood supply sites is reasonable or not directly affects the rescue efficiency. The paper studies the robust location‐allocation for emergency temporary blood supply after disaster. First, the factors of several candidate sites were quantified by the entropy‐based TOPSIS method, and 12 candidate blood supply sites with higher priority were selected according to the evaluation indicators. At the same time, the uncertainty of blood demand at each disaster site increased the difficulty of decision‐making, and then, a robust location model (MIRP) was constructed with minimum cost with time window constraints. It is also constrained by the uncertain demand for blood in three scenarios. Second, the survival probability function was introduced, and the time window limit was given at the minimum cost to maximize the survival probability of the suffered people. Finally, the numerical example experiments demonstrate that the increase in demand uncertainty and survival probability cause the MIRP model to generate more costs. Compared with the three MIRP models, the MIRP‐ellipsoid set model gained better robustness. Also, given the necessary restrictions on the time window, the cost can be reduced by about 13% with the highest survival probability. Decision‐makers can select different combinations of uncertainty levels and demand disturbance ratios and necessary time constraints to obtain the optimal location‐allocation solution according to risk preference and actual conditions.</jats:p>",

To achieve sustainable development, supply chain management needs to be related to sustainable business practices, which include relevant values and sustainable purchasing policies. Focusing on these principles on the topic of coffee, this study shows the difficulties associated with this product. The study finds that coffee production is dependent on factors unrelated to management. This paper presents a case study of Delta Cafés owned by Grupo Nabeiro, a Portuguese company that shows relevant ways of achieving sustainable business methods to be incorporated in supply chain management. Our research shows a business based on sustainable, efficient handling of the food safety of its product and certification along the supply chain, as well as an adaptable purchasing policy. By reviewing the literature and information provided by the company, we confirm that the case study is a business leader in innovation, thought process, and action related to sustainability practices. Our research illustrates how business operations and culture can be explored to achieve sustainable buying processes and practices.</jats:p>"

The methodological strategy chosen was a systematic literature review. The articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases were screened, and the research corpus consisted of 201 articles published in journals between 2014 and 2021. The results present 13 study categories, showing topics such as pyrolysis, business models, Industry 4.0, and energy generation. The insertion of Industry 4.0 technologies is still in its initial stages, comprising mainly the generation of inputs to reuse waste for 3D printers’ materials. Regarding energy generation, the insertion of processes such as pyrolysis for fuel generation stands out. The proposed discussion in this article suggests a circular ecosystem in which wastes follow a reuse flow according to their properties; incineration can be an option depending on the stage and benefits generated from the removal of plastic waste from the ecosystem. The highlighted issue is the scalability of the developed processes in the research, which is only possible if the state, universities, and civil society integrate efforts in the construction of a circular ecosystem infrastructure for waste management.</jats:p>"

However, regarding water and sanitation services (WSS), the evolution from the original Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is not yet understood. Therefore, analysing whether low- and middle-income nations were able to converge in terms of WSS is fundamental for policy-making. Here, we propose a benchmarking exercise aimed at assessing the performance of 123 low- and middle-income UN Member States regarding WSS development targets over the 2001–2015 period of MDG pursuance. In the end, we show that, on average, the assessed Member States were already fully convergent before the implementation of the SDGs, despite further improvements with the latter. Additionally, we show that all UN regional groupings were able to decrease not only the performance spread of their Member States, but also the gap between the best practice frontier and the worst practice frontier. Besides, the Proportion of population using an improved drinking water source was the indicator with the highest performance growth in the considered period.</jats:p>",

These changes directly affect food supply chain negatively. Thus, transition into more circular approach for green business growth in food supply chains is a necessity. One way to reduce this negativity is to ensure the share of information along the chain. With this context, sharing information and knowledge among the food supply chain can facilitate practices from a circularity and green perspectives. Hence, this research focuses on understanding and revealing knowledge‐sharing networks challenges, barriers, and benefits across every food supply chain layer, presenting tangible contributions to improve traceability in circularity perspectives with refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover challenges. Therefore, and to provide a green business growth, this study examines the practice of knowledge sharing among real‐life industry food stakeholders in the meat sector regarding their dimensions, what type of knowledge is shared and whether there are differences among specific groups of food stakeholders for the knowledge sharing. The aim of this research is to generate a validated conceptual framework to reveal how information technologies contributes to a more efficient knowledge sharing practices, hence, to impact the enhancement of efficient circular food supply chains for green business growth.</jats:p>",

The best possible care after snakebite accidents is to obtain antiophidic sera on time. And the maximum ideal time to reach it is about 2 hours after an accident. Based on public health information and using a tool to analyze geographical accessibility, we evaluate the possibility of reaching Brazilian serum-providing health facilities from the relationship between population distribution and commuting time. In this exploratory descriptive study, the geographic accessibility of Brazilian population to health facilities that supply antiophidic serum is evaluated through a methodology that articulates several issues that influence the commuting time to health units (ACCESSMOD): population and facilities’ distribution, transportation network and means, relief and land use, which were obtained in Brazilian and international sources. The relative importance of the population without the possibility of reaching a facility in two hours is highlighted for Macro-Regions, States and municipalities. About nine million people live in locations more than two hours away from serum-providing facilities, with relevant variations between regions, states, and municipalities. States like Mato Grosso, Pará and Maranhão had the most important participation of population with reaching time problems to those units. The most significant gaps are found in areas with a dispersed population and sometimes characterized by a high incidence of snakebites, such as in the North of the country, especially in the Northeastern Pará state. Even using a 2010 population distribution information, because of the 2020 Census postponement, the tendencies and characteristics analyzed reveal challenging situations over the country. The growing availability of serum-providing health facilities, the enhanced possibilities of transporting accident victims, and even the availability of sera in other types of establishments are actions that would allow expanding the possibilities of access to serum supply.</jats:p>"

The United Nations have thus set the reduction of food loss and waste on the political agenda by means of the Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3. The German Federal Government committed itself to this goal by implementing the National Strategy for Food Waste Reduction in 2019. However, this policy approach relies heavily on voluntary action by involved actors and neglects the possible role of power imbalances along the food supply chain. While current research on food loss and waste in industrialised countries predominantly focuses on the consumer level, this study puts emphasis on the under-researched early stages of the food supply chain from the field to retailers’ warehouses. Based on 22 expert interviews with producers, producer organisations and retailers, this article identifies major inter-stage drivers of food loss in the supply chains for fresh fruit and vegetables in Germany. Its main novelty is to demonstrate how market power imbalances and risk shifting between powerful and subordinate actors can reinforce the tendency of food loss on the part of producers further up the supply chain. Results indicate that prevalent institutional settings, such as contractual terms and conditions, trading practices, ordering processes, product specifications, and communication privilege retailers and encourage food loss. The mechanisms in which these imbalances manifest, go beyond the European Commission’s current legislation on Unfair Trading Practices. This study suggests a research agenda that might help to formulate adjusted policy instruments for re-structuring the German fruit and vegetable markets so that less food is wasted.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivated by a large amount of quality loss and quantity loss of fresh products during transportation, this paper examines the effect of the double loss on decisions and profits by establishing models for a fresh e‐commerce supply chain consisting of one online retailer and one third‐party logistics provider. The online retailer sells fresh products and provides compensation for quantity loss. TPL’s fresh‐keeping effort during transportation can effectively reduce the double loss. We find that: (i) under the centralized model, the basic quantity loss rate and freshness sensitivity can improve fresh‐keeping effort. The online retailer prefers price‐raising strategies as the basic quantity loss rate increases and freshness sensitivity decreases. But, if fresh‐keeping cost is within a certain range and the basic quantity loss rate is high enough, the online retailer prefers price reduction strategies. If fresh‐keeping cost is high, as freshness sensitivity increases, the retailer first reduces prices and then raises prices. (ii) Under the decentralized model, as the basic quantity loss rate and freshness sensitivity increase, product price will increase. (iii) Centralized decision‐making mode is more profitable to the supply chain. Furthermore, we design a “two‐way cost sharing‐revenue sharing” contract to coordinate the supply chain and achieve Pareto improvement.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the urban products have a specific production and distribution channel that should be assessed. In this research, a mathematical framework is proposed for designing the supply chain network of urban products. The main contribution of this research is to incorporate the effect of public service into urban products’ supply chain planning. In this regard, a mixed‐integer mathematical model is proposed. In this mathematical model, an attempt is made to minimize the costs of the product distribution system by considering the effects of production, maintenance, and distribution. Moreover, fuzzy uncertainty has been applied to adapt the mathematical model to real conditions. The numerical results show that if manufacturers and distributors want to strengthen their institutions and maintain their leadership roles as in the past, they can optimize their distribution network structure to achieve the best possible performance. Moreover, technological advances and innovations in production and distribution systems can create a huge leap in profitability.</jats:p>",

The development of a methodology for assessing the energy security of heat supply to determine its level is necessary for public authorities. The subject of the study is a set of theoretical, methodological and practical aspects of improving the energy security of heat supply in the Russian Federation. The purpose of the study is to develop a methodology for assessing the level of energy security of the heat supply system (ESHSS) for its application in order to assess the impact of planned measures in the field of heat supply on improving energy security. The methodological basis of the study is presented by a systematic approach and private-scientific methods: comparative analysis, indicative analysis, statistical methods. The system of indicators of energy security of heat supply at the federal and regional levels is defined in the article based on the consideration of heat supply as an economic system included in the fuel and energy complex of the Russian Federation. The proposed system includes twelve indicators grouped into four components of ESHSS: consumer, industrial, economic and environmental safety. The methodology for assessing the level of energy security of the heat supply system at the federal and regional levels, including a system of indicators, is proposed in the article. The final level of EBST is defined as normal, pre-crisis or crisis, according to the developed methodology. The limits of values for the three levels of ESHSS are calculated for each indicator using statistical methods. The determination of the final level of ESHSS is carried out according to the results of the scoring. To improve state regulation, it is proposed to use the developed methodology for assessing the energy security of the heat supply system in the formation of the fuel and energy complex development program in the part relating to the development of heat supply systems. For example, the reduction of norms of negative impact and waste disposal will lead to the formation of economic entities in the field of heat supply of material interest in the transition to the use of renewable energy sources</jats:p>"

In addition to the studies of the literature, direct shipment between producers and customers and also alternative products possibility are allowed. In this problem, the objectives, such as facilities establishment costs, transportation costs, negative environmental impacts, and social impact (fixed and variable employment rates) are optimized simultaneously. As in real situations, most of the transportation activities of such supply chain are performed by hiring transportation devices, the open routing logic is applied to form the traveling path of each hired transportation device. Furthermore, the possibility of direct shipment from the plants to the customers is considered in order to increase profitability of the plants. Because of the NP‐hard nature of the supply chain design problems, some meta‐heuristic solution approaches of the literature are modified to multi‐objective form and applied to solve the problem. Several test problems from small to large sizes are generated randomly to evaluate the meta‐heuristic algorithms. As a result, among the proposed algorithms, the multi‐objective gray wolf optimizer (MGWO) performs better than others by considering four well‐known evaluation metrics. Finally, a case study from perishable products supply chain of Iran is solved and analyzed to show the applicability of the proposed problem.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, chemical pesticides are used to protect against pathogens, but they can be harmful to the environment and to our health. Thus, there is a strong need to replace them with environmentally friendly substances. Promising biopesticides could be the elicitor harpin proteins studied by our research group. These proteins induce immune responses in plants without an actual pathogen infection, thus increasing their resistance against them. Other beneficial effects of harpins have also been described, such as more intensive growth or higher yields. The mechanisms of action of these proteins are not yet fully elucidated. However, a better understanding could help develop more effective biopesticides. As the average temperature of the Earth rises, ferroptosis-like cell death induced by heat stress may also play an increasingly important role. Although this form of cell death was first described in 2017, its exact molecular mechanism is still unknown. Our results reviewed here suggest that reactive carbonyl species, including acrolein, may play a mediator role in it. Based on the literature, ferroptosis-like cell death is also involved in the hypersensitive response due to pathogen attack, so a better understanding of the cell death process may help protect plants against biotic and abiotic stresses.</jats:p>"

Based on the content analysis of interviews with prominent SCM executives in the country, this work formulates a SCM model contextualized to the Brazilian reality covering three cultural traits and three infrastructural traits. Fourteen propositions offer a fine-grained analysis of feedback mechanisms between said traits that perpetuate the gap between SCM theory and the Brazilian practice, hindering the advancement of SCM in Brazil. The model offers a guide for companies that aim to unclog the bottlenecks to allow the country's participation in the complex 'dance' of the global SCM.</jats:p>"

One key factor contributing to AMR is the ability of bacteria to export drugs through efflux pumps, which relies on the ATP-dependent expression and interaction of several controlling genes. Recent studies have shown that significant cell-to-cell ATP variability exists within clonal bacterial populations, but the contribution of intrinsic cell-to-cell ATP heterogeneity is generally overlooked in understanding efflux pumps. Here, we consider how ATP variability influences gene regulatory networks controlling expression of efflux pump genes in two bacterial species. We develop and apply a generalizable Boolean modelling framework, developed to incorporate the dependence of gene expression dynamics on available cellular energy supply. Theoretical results show that differences in energy availability can cause pronounced downstream heterogeneity in efflux gene expression. Cells with higher energy availability have a superior response to stressors. Furthermore, in the absence of stress, model bacteria develop heterogeneous pulses of efflux pump gene expression which contribute to a sustained sub-population of cells with increased efflux expression activity, potentially conferring a continuous pool of intrinsically resistant bacteria. This modelling approach thus reveals an important source of heterogeneity in cell responses to antimicrobials and sheds light on potentially targetable aspects of efflux pump-related antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>",

Polymetallic nodules lying unattached on the abyssal seafloor of the Pacific Ocean's Clarion Clipperton Zone contain four critical metals (nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper) in large quantities, and the International Seabed Authority may soon enact regulations to allow their commercial exploitation. There are complex global ecological implications of doing so. Nodule exploitation would damage abyssal habitats and may impact midwater‐column organisms; but in the absence of nodule exploitation, terrestrial mining's environmental and social impacts would intensify. This paper adds to the growing systems‐based literature on nodule collection by contributing a preliminary material flow analysis of global‐average cradle‐to‐gate waste streams using either nodules or terrestrial sources as part of a preliminary life cycle assessment, as well as integrated risk assessments of those waste streams. System endpoints are battery precursors (nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, manganese sulfate), copper cathode, and a 40% or 75% manganese product. Overburden, tailings, and processing and refining wastes from terrestrial mining are compared to the nodule industry's anticipated offshore and onshore wastes, including sediment disrupted by nodule‐collection machines. Robustness to offshore technology assumptions is tested using Monte Carlo simulation, while onshore mass‐flow scenarios incorporate a “negligible‐waste” flowsheet and high‐waste flowsheets where manganese is not recovered. A billion‐EV scenario incorporates the effects of declining terrestrial copper and nickel ore grades. Results imply that metal production from nodules may produce less waste of lower severities, caveated by uncertain impacts of disrupted sediment.</jats:p>",

This study aims to map out incense supply chain in North Tapanuli, to analyze the stakeholders who play role, and to determine the added value of incense throughout its supply chain models. Using snowball sampling, this study found different supply chain models and stakeholders who play role, namely farmers, village collectors, large village collectors, sub-district collectors, district collectors, agents, exporters, and consumers. Calculation of the added value of incense for each stakeholder throughout the supply chain was carried out using the Hayami method. The results indicate that farmers who sell their crops to sub-district collectors get the highest added value with R/C ratio of 2.18. Further, the stakeholders were also mapped out into quadrants based on power and interest in incense value chain. Unexpectedly, stakeholders who have high influence and interest are the collectors, while the farmers are only the subjects, namely actors who are high in terms of interest but low in influence. The result of this study is useful for developing of incense trade system that favors its community stakeholder.</jats:p>"

The objective of this article is to analyze the role of agents in the sugarcane supply chain to Peruvian mills and their relationship with the practice of agrarian contracts to sugarcane production. The perception of landowners and farmers about bioenergy and their predisposition to plant energy crops is also investigated. Field interviews are conducted with the main agents of the sugarcane production chain in the major producing regions. Statistical analysis of data from field interviews indicates that the relationship between owners and sugarcane producers is of land leasing. Intermediate agents act as a fundamental part of the sugarcane supply chain. The sharecropping or sugarcane purchase contract is an instrument that is established between middlemen and small independent producers, whether they are owners or tenants. The middlemen participation in commercialization can reach 30–40% of the sugarcane production. Most mills prefer to produce sugarcane in own lands. A relatively high degree of inequity in favor of the middlemen appears in the intermediation process because, in general, the mills prefer this intermediation in their commercial practice. A large number of landowners and tenants are familiar with notions of energy crops, particularly in relation to sugarcane and have a positive vision about them for the environmental sustainability. However, their interest in planting bioenergy crops is less. Friendly and equitable relations between agents will provide more economic and social stability to the Peruvian sugarcane agroindustry.</jats:p>",

The study uses a quantitative method, with a path analysis model, with a total of 40 samples. Research respondents are users of loading and unloading services. The findings, in general, indicate that there is an effect of port service performance, occupational safety, and health and work security on loading and unloading productivity which in turn has an impact on increasing user satisfaction of Yos Sudarso Tual Port services.

However, there is a paucity of research on the technical efficiency of dairies in Poland, particularly in relation to their legal form (i.e., cooperatives vs. non-cooperatives). The existing literature also does not provide insights into the technical efficiency of these entities with respect to different regions’ milk production capacity. Therefore, this paper aims to: (1) evaluate and compare the technical efficiency of cooperative and non-cooperative dairies in Poland, and (2) examine dairies’ technical efficiency due to spatial disparities in milk production potential. We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to investigate the technical efficiency of 108 dairies in Poland for the year 2019. The milk production capacity of provinces is examined by applying the zero unitarization method. The results show that when assuming constant returns to scale (CRS), dairy cooperatives are less technically efficient than non-cooperatives, whereas when assuming variable returns to scale (VRS), these differences are not statistically significant. For inefficient dairies, we observe the greatest potential for improvement in labor costs and depreciation. Both cooperatives and non-cooperatives operate mostly under decreasing returns to scale. Thus, the potential for enhancing the technical efficiency of dairies through the consolidation process seems to be exploited. Our findings reveal that the technical efficiency of dairies in Poland is not differentiated by regional milk production potential.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the betting target settings are classified into three cases: high, medium, and low. Secondly, the optimal valuation models for retailer equity financing in a centralized supply chain without and with introducing a gambling agreement are constructed separately. Finally, this paper clarifies the relationships among factors such as the betting transfer share ratio, ordering price, and optimal valuation level through simulation analysis. The results illustrate the following: (i) There is always an only optimal valuation level and optimal effort level that makes the retailer and supplier might reach an equity financing agreement. (ii) When the betting target is set too high, the betting transfer share ratio varies in the same direction as the optimal valuation level and the opposite direction as the optimal effort level. (iii) When the betting target is set moderately or too low, the betting transfer share ratio has an inverse relationship with the optimal valuation level. However, the retailer will increase its effort level at this time. (iv) In addition, the optimal valuation level is affected by the retailer’s firm growth and ordering price.</jats:p>",

The supply chain management software market offers solutions to the problem by automating the logistics system. The aim of the work is to study the concepts and technologies of SCM, the international and Ukrainian market of SCM-systems; selection of the best SCM system focused on corporate integrated structures; research of technologies of introduction of SCM-systems at the enterprises. Research results. In order to ensure effective management of supply chains, enterprises must take into account var-ious aspects that have both positive and negative effects on the functioning of supply chains. The solution to the problem of effective supply chain management is possible by creating optimization models that most fully reveal the relationships and effects. SCM solutions allow you to make optimal plans for the use of existing production lines, describing in detail what, when and in what sequence should be manufactured, taking into account the limitations of production capacity, raw materials, batch sizes and the need to upgrade equipment to produce a new product. This helps to meet high demand at minimal cost. Modern SCM-systems with digital control provide processing of materials and software for all partic-ipants in the creation of products or services, fulfillment of orders and tracking of information (suppliers, manufac-turers, wholesalers and retailers, providers of transport and logistics services, etc.). Conclusions. In today's environment, the best supply chain strategies require management models that are able to successfully combine processes and technologies and create the conditions for the delivery of goods and services at previously unattainable speeds. Companies that are able to effectively manage their supply chain, adapt to today's technological business environment, will be able to survive and prosper in the future. Cloud technologies are best suited to modern requirements for SCM systems, as they are the most flexible and better adapted to change. An im-portant advantage of integrating cloud technologies into the SCM system is the ability to use individual elements of SCM cloud systems to meet specific business needs without full-scale changes. The supply chains of the future are a network model that provides operational and effective interaction with par-ticipants, each node of which is able to respond flexibly to customer requests, given the variability of the external environment. Future SCM systems need to provide greater consistency between planning and execution, which most companies have not yet achieved. The need for speed and accuracy in SCM will only increase. The use of the intelli-gent SCM system will improve supply chains, increase the company's profitability and strengthen its competitive posi-tion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose\nEffective Product Assortment Planning is critical for fast-fashion products like clothing and accessories\nwith short lifecycles, a large number of Stock Keeping Units and seasonality of the assortments.\nTraditional product-based demand forecasting approaches using past data and repeatability of\npurchase are not very effective for them. Emerging PAP optimization models focus on customizing\nretail assortment at store levels and developing attribute-based approaches. However, these models\nare highly complex, thus restricting their utility in the field. This paper presents a model to help plan the\nsupply chain under these conditions.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors of this paper developed a model with a modified approach to make it computationally less\ncomplex and cost-effective for implementation. The authors developed a Mixed Integer Programming\nmodel and solved a Linear Programming relaxation of the model to obtain an effective solution.\nFindings\nAuthors validated the model utilizing field data and inputs that could capture merchandiser experience,\nconsumer preferences, retailer constraints and environmental factors for a national brand of leather\naccessories sold through multi-brand retail outlets and found that the model showed an improvement\npotential of over 25 % in the objective. Originality\nThis is an original research conducted by the author, including all fieldwork, pilot implementation and\nanalysis. Since the model was prepared from field data and also implemented to see its effectiveness, it\nrepresents a practical and usable model by the Industry straightaway. However, future researchers may\nimplement it in multi-vendor, multi-outlet situations and update the model in accordance with fresh outputs.\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe model requires further testing and refinement to establish its usefulness, as the current testing\nwas on a small set of data of a representative category. However, considering the similarities in the\nconsumer perception and preferences, retailer constraints and environmental factors, the authors\nbelieve this approach of combining data mining with a linear integer model has the potential to\ndeliver superior performance on most categories of fast fashion products.\nPractical implications\nThrough this model, the authors attempted to close a significant gap in research concerning replenishment\nmodels for fast-fashion products applicable in emerging countries. Since critical parameters like changing\ncustomer preferences, and variation in demand due to seasonality, discounting systems etc., have been\nfactored in a while developing  the present model, it can be easily extrapolated to multiple suppliers and\nmultiple numbers of retailers.\n</jats:p>"

This lost resource is no longer worth anything, so its reuse will contribute to both reducing the energy crisis and protecting the environment. For this reason, new ways of converting thermal energy into electrical energy are more relevant today than ever. The use of electric energy and power supply of installations are important in the agro-industrial complex, especially the use of an autonomous power supply system for process automation. (Research purpose) The research purpose is to develop the devices for disinfection of soil and substrate by infrared radiation in protected soil with the utilization of heat from the infrared emitters using Peltier thermoelectric generators. (Materials and methods) The article presents the operation of the developed device. (Results and discussion) During the operation of the installation, the cases of the infrared emitters are heated to a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius, and this thermal energy is released into the atmosphere. To increase the energy efficiency of this installation, infrared radiators are covered with a sealed steam jacket from above, water is poured inside, is heating up, evaporates and settles on the dome, thereby transferring heat from the covers of infrared radiators to the dome. Peltier thermoelectric generators are installed on the dome, which are designed to convert thermal energy into electrical energy, Peltier elements are connected in series and in parallel. The electricity received from the Peltier elements enters the battery, accumulates and is spent on the operation of devices for automatic control of soil and substrate disinfection, which makes it possible for the installation to operate autonomously. (Conclusions) For the functioning of the device is used the utilization of heat losses from the operation of infrared emitters using Peltier thermoelectric generators.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the optimal order and production policies with and without the bidirectional option contract are derived. Further, this paper shows that the optimal conditional value-at-risk of the retailer is non-increasing in the service requirement, while the optimal expected profit of the supplier is non-decreasing in the service requirement. When the service requirement is binding, the optimal conditional value-at-risk of the retailer is increasing in the risk aversion, while the optimal expected profit of the supplier is decreasing in the risk aversion. In addition, it is shown that with the bidirectional option contract, the service level provided by the retailer is equivalent to (higher than) that without them when the service requirement is (not) binding. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the bidirectional option contract can mitigate the effect of risk aversion on the retailer's order quantity, benefit both the retailer and supplier, and improve the performance of the supply chain. Numerical experiments are conducted to further confirm our results.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

China is a largely agricultural country with a large population, and agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 50% of the total water consumption. The application of water-saving irrigation is the main way to realize the sustainable development of water resources and economics. To comprehensively improve crop water-use efficiency and reduce agricultural water consumption, the Chinese central government have promulgated a series of agricultural water-saving policies since 2012, such as strengthening water management, increasing financial investment, and strengthening project construction and operation management and protection. Taking Jiangsu as an example, this paper reviews the main water-saving policies and measures of governments after 2012, as well as the conflicting interest between different water-saving participants. Results showed that, through water-saving policies and measures, its effective utilization coefficient of agricultural irrigation water (EUCAIW) has increased from 0.59 in 2014 to 0.614 in 2019. By 2019, the area of irrigated arable land controlled by water-saving technologies is 2.848 million hectares, accounting for 67.8% of the irrigated arable land area in Jiangsu. Jiangsu's water-saving policies have been implemented well, and it has guidance on water-saving reform work in other places.</jats:p>",

Potted Arabica coffee plants were grown under two P levels: the recommended P fertilization (P), and twice the recommended fertilization (+P), and two water regimes: well-watered and water withholding for 32 days. Leaf, stem, and root P concentrations were increased under +P, with plants showing higher photosynthesis and growth than the ones receiving the recommended P dose. Higher plant growth under high P supply seems to upregulate leaf photosynthesis through the source–sink relationship. Under the water deficit, the reduction of leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, water use efficiency, carboxylation efficiency, chlorophyll content, number of plagiotropic branches, plant leaf area, and vegetative biomass production was similar comparing plants fertilized with the recommended P to those supplied with +P. However, Arabica coffee trees under high P supply and water deficit presented morphological and physiological traits similar to plants under well-watered and recommended P fertilization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Differentiation in (per capita) electricity consumption (PC) between developed and developing countries is decreasing in the world. However, the difference between Russian regions in terms of this indicator in 1990–2020 increased. It is shown that an increase in differentiation in the electric power supply leads to an increase in imbalances in socio-economic development. The relationship between the low profi tability of goods and services in the regions and low EPC was revealed. Unlike developing countries, where electricity consumption is limited by the possibilities of electricity production, in the Russian regions the limiting factor is the underdevelopment of electricity consumers. Under conditions of underdeveloped industry and low power supply, higher losses in power networks are characteristic, which causes a signifi cant increase in electricity prices for local industrial and agricultural consumers. Prerequisites are created for the transfer of industrial and agricultural production to regions with lower electricity supply costs. The mechanism aimed at preventing this negative trend is considered. As a result of its implementation, the modernization of production processes at electricity consumers will be initiated and conditions will be created for the emergence of new points of growth in these currently subsidized regions.</jats:p>"

Materials and methods. Water resources in the source of domestic water supply (before and after their treatment) in the settlements of Bolshoy Tsaryn and Mirny were considered as objects of study. The factual materials for the study were the protocols of laboratory studies of water quality in the distribution network of the settlement of Bolshoy Tsaryn, an explanatory note to the scheme of water supply and disposal of the settlements of Bolshoy Tsaryn and Mirny of Oktyabrsky district of the Republic of Kalmykia (2019), separate sections of the Scheme for the Integrated Use and Protection of Water Bodies of Endorheic Areas in the Interfluve of the Terek, Don and Volga (2014), as well as materials from previously published studies on the topic under consideration.  Results. An analysis of the laboratory testing of samples shows that the water in the considered water supply source is suitable according to radiological indicators and the results of sanitary and hygienic analyzes, however, its quality does not meet the requirements of regulatory documents in terms of color (exceeds 20°) and turbidity (more than 2.6 FMU).  Conclusions. When comparing analyzes of water samples taken from the network before and after treatment, it can be concluded that its organoleptic properties after purification are reduced by 15.9–26.2 % in terms of “color” and by 25.29–47.4 % in terms of “turbidity”, this is not always enough to meet the requirements of Sanitary Rules and Regulations. To address the issues of increased water color and turbidity, it is necessary to carry out deepening measures in the water intake area, as well as systematic cleaning of the canal's water supply network from sediment. In addition, it is necessary to consider the possibility of drinking water post-treatment through additional filtration.</jats:p>"

For remanufacturing closed‐loop supply chain under different circumstances, many factors are considered, such as consumers’ different preferences for the purchase and payment of remanufactured products and the quality of recycled products. In this study, three models are presented for supply chain system, including a manufacturer lead and a retailer recycle. While nongovernment participation and non‐supply‐chain coordination are considered in model I, model II has government participation but non‐supply‐chain coordination, and model III has both government participation and supply chain coordination. The equilibrium decisions are derived for each model using the game‐theoretic approach. The study found that consumers’ preferences affect the pricing decisions of remanufactured products. When consumers’ willingness to buy and pay for remanufactured products is close to that of new products, the total profit of the supply chain will significantly increase; the quality of recycled products will also influence the pricing decisions of new/remanufactured products, which in turn will affect the market demand for products. Government participation is conducive to encouraging manufacturer, retailer, and consumers to actively participate in the recycling and remanufacturing activities of used products. Supply chain coordination contracts can further enhance the role of the consumer market and promote the implementation of government policies. Under certain conditions, revenue sharing contract coordination can significantly increase the total profit of the supply chain system. The research conclusions have certain reference value for the coordination among the nodes of the remanufacturing supply chain and the formulation of policies with government participation.</jats:p>",

The developed method is easily implement using a ring-type discharge valve with electronic control. A valve made in the form of a split elastic ring and installed in a high-pressure line above the plunger pair controls the fuel supply. An electromagnet, located in the cavity of the annular valve, controls the valve, using an electronic regulator, acting at the right moment according to the signals coming from the sensors of the engine crankshaft speed, the volume of incoming air and the position of the piston. The proposed direct-acting fuel supply system with an electronically controlled ring valve reliably ensures the speed and load characteristics of the engine by affecting the number of cyclic feeds. With a decrease in the load and speed of the engine crankshaft, the number of cyclic fuel supplies decreases due to a decrease in signals sent to the electromagnet winding and, as a result, the valve does not attract the fuel and misses the fuel supply. Reducing the unevenness of the fuel supply by the dynamic component that occurs when the supply is switch off is ensured by reducing the inertia of the regulator due to the electronic control of the ring valve. The developed mathematical model of a direct-acting fuel supply system with an annular discharge valve allows us to reveal the relationship of fuel supply parameters with the design dimensions of the split ring. Such direct-acting fuel supply system with an electronically controlled discharge valve allows, due to the skipping of working strokes in low-load and idle modes, redistributing the provided amount of fuel to the working cylinders, significantly reducing fuel consumption.</jats:p>"

The period of growth naturally gave way to a period of efficiency improvement. As a result, the interest in the study and implementation of mechanisms and tools for effective management has increased. In this regard, the development of approaches to labor costing when calculating the cost of services provided is a relevant problem. The timeliness of such studies can also be explained by the observed shortage of labor resources, primarily in the field of highly intellectual labor. The article describes the developed-by-the-authors methodological approach to labor rationing when calculating tariffs for gas supply organizations, which allows not only to reduce labor costs for developing tariffs for gas distribution organizations, but also to correctly form the cost of the service as a whole, the share of labor of the main workers in which is almost 80–90 %. This approach is based on the study of the few available methods of labor rationing for specialists in the service sector, as well as the generalization of practice in a relatively young and rapidly developing area of consulting.</jats:p>"

Governments are concerned with ensuring equitable growth by addressing issues like water scarcity, improving agricultural products, and supporting nutritional health. The primary contribution of this research is the introduction of a methodology for assessing agricultural water delivery systems that allow for collaboration among all stakeholders. The managing the water supply is a MADM. Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) issues, which are characterized by inadequacy and ambiguity, may be efficiently described using single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs). Several strategies, including the PROMETHEE strategy, are offered to address the MADM issue in SVNSs. The PROMETHEE technique ranks potential solutions by first having the decision maker pick a preferred function for every criterion. In this paper, the SVNS is integrated with the PROMETHEE method for water supply management in smart farming.</jats:p>"

Spatial quantification of the supply and demand of public service facilities can reveal relationships between supply and demand agents and provide a foundation for the planning of urban public service facilities. This study proposed a comprehensive framework to assess the current state of supply (accessibility of facilities) and demand (population carrying pressure) of various public services in cities and determine patterns between different public service facilities. This framework contains three elements: (a) multi-scale spatial quantification of the matching of supply and demand, (b) spatial matching of supply and demand, and (c) spatial clustering analysis of the supply and demand balance. This study analyzed 19 major cities in China from a supply and demand perspective and examined implications for matching the supply and demand of public service facilities. The results indicated that education service facilities had the most appropriate supply and demand relationship. Areas where public service facilities had a good matching of supply and demand demonstrated a strong pattern of clustering. There were significant differences in the level of matching of the supply and demand of public service facilities among various regions in China. The limitations of the framework and future directions are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The characteristics of internal combustion engines (hereinafter referred to as ICE)  have the following disadvantages: there is a gap between zero and minimum angular velocity, so it is  impossible to move out of a state of rest; the dependence of torque on angular velocity is not ideal.  They are corrected by the following converters: the first by a clutch or torque converter, and the  second by a gearbox or variator. In addition, the ICE characteristics can be partially close themselves  to ideal.   Electric  motors  (here  in  after  referred  to  as  motors)  of  electric  vehicles  have  an  ideal  characteristic that starts from scratch and has a large zone with a sustainable maximum power. The  addition of the drive with the ICE motor in hybrid electric cars solves these problems.  The different characteristics of ICE, motors and converters increase the number of possible  configurations that affect the characteristics of the supply of power to the wheels.  According to the traction characteristics of the car, the indicators of the traction and speed  properties  of  the  car  are  determined:  the  ability  to  overcome  climbs,  maximum  acceleration,  maximum speed on a horizontal road, acceleration time to a given speed, etc. The last two indicators  depend primarily on the maximum power of ice or motor and are important for supercars, while for  conventional cars or electric vehicles with close values of maximum speed and acceleration time to a  given speed, they mean nothing.  The authors propose to evaluate the efficiency of the drive during acceleration with maximum  acceleration of the power utilization factor k N  0–100  – the particles from the division of the average  value of the realized power on the wheels in the interval of speeds (0; 100) km/h by the maximum  power value on the wheels.  The characteristics of ICE and motors are given, traction characteristics in power coordinates  are  calculated  –  the  speed  of  movement  of  cars  with  typical  drive  configurations,  their  power  utilization  coefficients  are  determined  and  appropriate  conclusions  are  made.  In  the  future,  it  is planned  to  investigate  the  use  of  power  in  more  complex  drive  systems  of  hybrid  cars  with  the recovery of braking energy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon emission reduction has become a common hot topic around the world. Although the previous literature has proven that the asymmetric information and fairness concerns would influence the operational strategy for low‐carbon supply chain, it hardly touched the asymmetric information of fairness concerns, which contradicted practical observations and experimental evidence. Incorporating the asymmetric information of fairness concerns, this paper investigates a low‐carbon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer with discrete types including selfish S‐type and fairness‐concerned F‐type. The manufacturer can observe and thereby know the behavioral type of the retailer in the scenario of symmetric information, while it cannot in the scenario of asymmetric information. In the approach of game theory, the optimal carbon emission reducing strategy and pricing strategy in the symmetric scenario and asymmetric scenario are achieved successively. By comparing the above two scenarios, the impacts stemming from the asymmetric information of fairness concerns at the individual level and systematic level are analyzed, respectively. A case study is offered before concluding some implications for the supply chain management. The findings include the following: Firstly, the asymmetric information of fairness concerns enhances the carbon emission reduction significantly. Although the fairness concerns alone decrease the carbon emission reduction, the asymmetric information increases with the dominating power. Secondly, the asymmetric information of fairness concerns raises the wholesale price and retail price dramatically. Although the impact of either fairness concerns or asymmetric information randomly changes with the behavioral type and information structure, their interactive impacts are stable and change smoothly. Thirdly, the asymmetric information of fairness concerns promotes a fairer profit distribution, while either fairness concerns or asymmetric information alone hardly changes the overall profit of the low‐carbon supply chain.</jats:p>",

The robotic technology provides an informal route where all goods can be transported to different places within a short span of time, and any false identification in transfer of goods can also be easily identified. To drive the autonomous vehicle towards correct location, a precise protocol is chosen, which is termed common industrial protocol (CIP) where proper solutions can be achieved for all control applications using time synchronization model.

The analysis is based on data on solar insolation and wind speed over the past 20 years. It is revealed that the greatest generation of solar electricity during the year occurs in the period from June to July, and the greatest generation of wind electricity during the year occurs in the period from January to March. The total generation makes it possible to provide the botanical garden's own needs with electricity in any month except October and November. The excess electricity generated in the summer can be used for the production of hydrogen, which is used as fuel for a hydrogen fuel cell or its storage in storage devices.</jats:p>"

Moench) como agente floculante e coagulante no tratamento de água de abastecimento humano. O quiabo apresenta cadeias longas de polissacarídeos que podem remover impurezas da água, bem como conceder peso e tamanho às partículas, ajudando nos processos de clarificação. O quiabo pode ser utilizado na forma de mucilagem extraída da vagem (baba do quiabo) ou na forma de solução obtida a partira do pó seco da vagem pulverizada. Os dados levantados em revisão de literatura mostram a eficiência do quiabo como auxiliar de floculação no tratamento de água e como fonte de redução do uso de coagulantes químicos. Essa redução de coagulantes químicos pode minimizar, por exemplo, o risco de contaminação da água por alumínio residual, o qual está associado a doenças neurodegenerativas como Parkinson e Doença de Alzheimer, em decorrência da exposição humana a este metal. Além disso, o emprego de polímeros naturais, como o quiabo, leva a formação de lodos em quantidades reduzidas se comparadas com as dos coagulantes químicos, e com menores teores de metais. Tais lodos são ainda menos volumosos e facilmente biodegradáveis, contribuindo assim com a preservação ambiental.</jats:p>"

The study was both quantitative and qualitative in nature. Interviews and observations were the main primary data collection instruments. Findings showed that the main sectors and institutions that utilised water in the catchment were mining, agriculture, manufacturing industry, and local authorities. Local authorities and farming sectors were the major users of water. WEAP model results showed a steady increase in demand for water as a result of both population growth and agricultural activities water demand. The study mapped possible inter-basin transfer routes and recommends water harvesting as part of development and management in Sanyati catchment to address the problem of water shortage. </jats:p>"

The supply network has a combined topology and consists of three levels of participants: manufacturers, a distributor, and retailers. The authors consider the companies' performance improvement as the motivation of companies to operate in coordinating conditions. Simulation of contract conditions is implemented for different types of supply networks: from a simple case to a more complex one. The contract procedure is modeled as a game between two companies. The game solution is a set of contract parameters, providing Nash equilibrium, achieving the maximum of the supply network profit and Pareto-optimality of the obtained solution. The results show the application of revenue-sharing contracts in such networks has several peculiarities: the role of a coordinator in the supply network should be performed by a distributor; the distributor, by setting unified revenue shares for all retailers and manufacturers, gets a share of the expected profit of the supply network, each retailer gets a share of the supply network profit for its sales channel, and each manufacturer gets a share of the supply network profit for its product.</jats:p>"

From the perspective of the small-world network, simulation is carried out to analyze the risk transmission mechanism in the supply chain network and the influence of various parameters on the supply chain risk transmission and the node enterprises in the supply chain network. Research shows that the process of eliminating node enterprises is also a process of supply chain network’s adjustment and gradual stability. In order to reduce the negative impact of this process on the supply chain network, node enterprises should take effective measures based on their own conditions to improve risk prevention capabilities, coordinate risk transmission, and enhance risk immunity, so as to improve the resistance of the entire supply chain to risks.</jats:p>",

Then, the search direction satisfying the sufficient descent condition is obtained. The global convergence of new method is proved under appropriate assumptions. Numerical experiments show that our method has better performance by comparing with the up‐to‐date method.

One group of viruses whose evolution has not yet been extensively studied is the Phycodnaviridae, a globally abundant family of aquatic large double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. Here we studied the evolutionary change of Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 during experimental coevolution with its algal host. We used pooled genome sequencing of six independently evolved populations to characterize genomic change over five time points. Across six experimental replicates involving either strong or weak demographic fluctuations, we found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at sixty-seven sites. The occurrence of genetic variants was highly repeatable, with just two of the SNPs found in only a single experimental replicate. Three genes A122/123R, A140/145R and A540L showed an excess of variable sites, providing new information about potential targets of selection during Chlorella–Chlorovirus coevolution. Our data indicated that the studied populations were not mutation-limited and experienced strong positive selection. Our investigation highlighted relevant processes governing the evolution of aquatic large dsDNA viruses, which ultimately contributes to a better understanding of the functioning of natural aquatic ecosystems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disaster management is one of the most important actions to protect the property and lives of the victims. Failure to pay attention to logistical decisions of disaster can have irreversible consequences. Therefore, a multiechelon mathematical model for blood supply chain management in disaster situations is proposed in this research. The proposed supply chain includes supplier, central warehouse, reliable distributor, unreliable distributor, distributor, and affected areas. How the proposed model performs is explained as follows: blood is sent from the supplier to warehouses and distribution centers. Also, the capacity of suppliers is limited. The main objective of the mathematical model is to minimize supply chain costs while maximizing the level of satisfaction in order to meet the demand of the affected area. Hence, this research seeks to decide whether or not to establish a reliable distributor, unreliable distributor, and central warehouse. The amount of blood sent to the centers will also be calculated. One of the contributions of the proposed model is to consider the pre‐ and postdisaster modes simultaneously. Locating and investigating the flow between centers are also the other contributions of this study. Solving the proposed model using a robust optimization approach is another innovation taken into account in this research. The proposed model is solved using robust optimization, and finally, the results indicate the proper performance of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

In an MCDM challenge, a competent supply chain pricing considerations solutions supplier considers multiple possibly competing for qualitative and quantitative criteria. This study presented a new extended decision‐making and FBWM method based on type‐2 fuzzy sets TOPSIS for ranking the corporate social responsibility criteria based on competitive supply chain pricing factors. The aim of the ranking is to learn how a company and its supply chain may accomplish joint‐optimization of economic, environmental, and social performance by transparently and strategically integrating sustainability into business operations. To verify the efficacy of the suggested strategy, it is compared to a benchmarking model. IT2F VIKOR is the subject of this benchmarking model. The significance weights of the competitive supply chain pricing selection criterion are determined from BWM for both techniques. The results show that the most probable dimension of social responsibility in knowledge‐based businesses in the oil sector, according to the research, is the environmental dimension in social responsibility, which may produce competitive supply chain pricing mechanisms based on profitability. Other findings revealed that the elements of competitive supply chain pricing factors in oil companies regarding social responsibility are ranked as follows: customer, product, and competitive supply chain pricing procedures. As a result, maintaining customer values is a major price element in establishing contacts, based on the company’s strategic connection with the economy and regional and worldwide partners.</jats:p>",

In this study, cost-efficient adsorbent red mud porous beads (RPB), using red mud – a kind of alumina industry by-product, was synthesized for adsorptive removal of arsenic(V) from aqueous solution. Kinetic studies showed that chemisorption mainly governed the adsorption process. The experimental data were fitted well using the Langmuir isotherm, and the equilibrium adsorption capacity for arsenic of 11.758 mg/g at pH = 7 conditions. The effect of pH showed that the pHpzc of RPB was 6.0 and at pH = 6 the removal rate reached nearly 100%. The removal rate decreased from 91.3% to 79.0% with increase in the initial concentration of arsenic from 2.5 to 20 mg/L. The adsorption performance from column studies illustrated that the velocity of flow and the initial concentration influenced the breakthrough time of the column. This study would facilitate the use of red mud, which can be fabricated into RPB, acting as a valuable adsorbent for removing arsenic in aqueous solutions.</jats:p>",

This, in turn, is highly dependent on the function and organisation of the secretory pathway. The Golgi complex plays a vital role in directing matrix output by co-ordinating the post-translational modification and proteolytic processing of matrix components prior to their secretion. These modifications have broad impacts on the secretion and subsequent assembly of matrix components, as well as their function in the extracellular environment. In this Review, we highlight the role of the Golgi in the formation of an adaptable, healthy matrix, with a focus on proteoglycan and procollagen secretion as example cargoes. We then discuss the impact of Golgi dysfunction on connective tissue in the context of human disease and ageing.</jats:p>",

The results show that there are certain conditions that make supply chain enterprises converge to carbon emission reduction investment behavior under the effect of command‐and‐control environmental regulation and consumer low‐carbon preference, and converge to cooperative carbon emission reduction behavior under the effect of market‐based environmental regulation and consumer low‐carbon preference. On this basis, the factors significantly influence the carbon emission reduction investment behavior of supply chain enterprises are the carbon emission reward and punishment coefficient and the low carbon preference coefficient of consumers. Increasing the carbon tax rate, carbon emission trading price and the proportion of cost subsidies, as well as encouraging consumers to consume low‐carbon products will help promote the realization of cooperative carbon emission reduction.</jats:p>",

In this regard, supply chain management is considered a crucial indicator. This study presents a multiobjective, multifacility, closed‐loop supply chain under uncertain environments considering green supply chain aspects. The model is designed with multiple products, periods, plants, customer markets, collection centers, recycle centers, distribution centers, return facilities, product recovery facilities, and suppliers. After modeling the study, the model is solved by the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA‐II) in order to rank the optimum solutions. The efficiency of the research model is indicated by the results and depicted graphs in the present study. Results show that the exact value of the triple objective functions is calculated. Also, the problem is solved in small, medium, and large dimensions. Then, the accuracy of the proposed model compared to the metaheuristic method is shown. Finally, by performing sensitivity analysis, we showed that target functions are less sensitive to reducing the capacity of centers.</jats:p>",

On the basis of game theory, the optimal quality effort and profits are obtained. Combined with numerical simulation, the effects of revenue sharing rate and market size on the optimal quality effort and profits under different scenarios are discussed. The results reveal that O2O takeout platform should cooperate with more catering businesses, and adopt appropriate strategies considering different market sizes of catering businesses. Additionally, the catering business should properly consider the market size and adopt different online and offline prices.

This study analyzes the current spatial organization of the Brazilian general hospitals and their respective flow of patients to identify the possible benefits of closing inefficient hospitals. We studied how inpatient care referrals may be reallocated without increasing access inequities following the potential closure of inefficient public hospitals. We used data from the Brazilian Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SIH/SUS) and the Brazilian National Register of Health Establishments (CNES). The smallest and least efficient hospitals were selected as units for potential closure, conditioned on an optimization criterion that minimizes patient travel distances to the nearest efficient hospital. Our results show that there is room for hospital resource reorganization in Brazil without compromising health care access equity.</jats:p>"

The water content and its movements in that tectorial gel membrane are controlled by nanoscale pores. Apart from many disease threats and the age and other issue‐related disabling hearing impairment, loss of sensitiveness of nanomaterial, namely, nanopored tectorial gel membrane, is a serious issue. Appropriate supplement must be provided to compensate age‐related hearing loss by measuring some innovation methods. The test for hearing loss and cost of hearing aid are another threat. Many studies reported that people do not feel comfortable with their hearing aid and avoided to use it after purchase. The telephonic survey was conducted at Tamil Nadu, India region, which discloses that the hearing aid center is doing continuous motivation over the phone to wear hearing aid after purchase; many people do not turn back for even battery purchase. Very rare people report for free service too. This piece of research is aimed at analysing the root cause of not wearing hearing aid and addressing various possibilities to support them with IoT‐based solution requirement to discard this issue. The two kinds of test were conducted for the same patient, and hearing aid was provided to give supplement to compensate sensitiveness loss of tectorial gel membrane. Their effectiveness was measured and analysed scientifically. The Taguchi method was incorporated to formulate the experiments with the natural cases like age, gender, and method of testing the nanomaterial, namely, nanopored tectorial gel membrane sensitiveness (hearing loss/or hearing ability) and existing nature of sensitiveness (severe loss and minor loss) at 2 levels. The observations were analysed with Taguchi analysis and discussed. An integrated solution of IOT‐based measuring system was discussed to rid the issues.</jats:p>",

In this study, the DEMATEL method is applied to measure the sustainability performance of suppliers in the sustainable supply chain of a company operating in the natural wood coating sector. At the end of the practice, the weight rating of each criterion is calculated. It has been revealed that the economic, then social and environmental dimension is considered important in the sustainable supplier selection criteria for the company evaluated within the scope of the study and that the cost of supply is the most important performance criterion.

Firms implement low‐carbon practices to achieve environmental sustainability. This paper explores whether digital supply chain networks can influence the sustainable performance of manufacturing firms and the mediating effect of low‐carbon practices in the contingency factor of environmental dynamism (ED). The relationship is examined in terms of information processing theory and stakeholder theory and from the perspective of a resource‐based view (RBV). The proposed framework is tested using structural equation modelling. The results show that low‐carbon practices have a partial mediation effect on digital supply chains and the sustainable performance of manufacturing firms. Furthermore, ED moderates the relationship of low‐carbon practices and digital supply chain networks. The study can support managers as they design strategies to move towards a low‐carbon economy, enhancing the firm's sustainable performance in accordance with ED. The current study strongly contributes to the literature on business strategy and the environment, as it has both theoretical and practical implications.</jats:p>",

В статье рассмотрены основные мероприятия Крымского обкома ВКП(б) по оказанию помощи антифашистскому сопротивлению: подготовка баз снабжения, авиационной техники, летного состава, подвоз продовольствия, организация аэродромов. Акцентируется внимание на факторе содействия советских ВВС в перевозке участников разведывательно-диверсионных и подпольных организаций с баз Северного Кавказа на территорию оккупированного Крыма и в передаче секретной информации в расположение советского командования. Автор приходит к выводу, что благодаря проводимым советским руководством мероприятиям был организован мощный воздушный мост между Северным Кавказом и партизанскими базами Крыма.

The publication discusses the main activities of the Crimean Regional Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks to provide assistance to the anti-fascist Resistance: the preparation of supply bases, aircraft, flight personnel, the supply of food, the organization of airfields. Attention is focused on the factor of assistance of the Soviet Air Force in the transportation of members of reconnaissance, sabotage and underground organizations from the bases of the North Caucasus to the territory of the occupied Crimea, and in the transfer of classified information to the location of the Soviet command. The author arrives at the conclusion that thanks to the measures carried out by the Soviet leadership, a powerful air bridge was organized between the North Caucasus and the partisan airfields of the Crimea. This made it possible to provide the partisans and underground fighters of the Crimea with the necessary supplies of food, medicines, weapons, ammunition at the turning point of the Great Patriotic War.</jats:p>",

Since the establishment of the “rural medical unit”, the legislation has regulated the provision of drugs to hospitals. It was based on a statistical analysis principle. For three years, information was collected on the costs of medication for rural medicine. Based on the average data for the three years, planned allocations were made at the rate of five kopecks for each outpatient and three kopecks for each day of the patient's stay in the hospital. However, it was extremely difficult to comply with the standards. An obstacle to compliance with the rules was the incomplete statistical picture of the needs of rural medicine. The frequent absence of doctors in rural hospitals resulted in unstable expenditure indicators; the average data did not reflect the real situation at the time of drafting zemstvo estimates. In addition, numerous complaints from doctors about the lack of medicines forced the provincial authorities to increase the planned allocations. Zemstvo estimates compiled by local Siberian administrations were approved by a number of central departments. In particular, a special committee at the Ministry of Finance was of decisive importance, considering the legality and feasibility of planned local expenditures. The capital-based departments were sympathetic to the decisions of local authorities. When approving the estimates they usually agreed with the motives for increasing the cost of pharmaceutical provision of rural health care. The practitioners believed that the allocated funds were insufficient for the normal functioning of health facilities. In the materials of the First Congress of the Tobolsk gubernia rural doctors, numerous critical remarks and constructive proposals regarding the provision of drugs for hospitals are seen. The uyezd officials and representatives of the population, during the work of the uyezd management committees, also put forward proposals to increase appropriations for medicines. By 1915, the norms for calculating the need for drugs were changed, allocations were increased, but this did not affect the current situation.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the work is to study the energy characteristics of the SPS under uneven lighting to improve the energy efficiency of solar power plants, including those for agro–industrial enterprises located and operating in remote rural areas, on sloping lands, mountainous and foothill terrain, where the efficiency of the SPS can be higher than on the plain due to a higher level of illumination. The methods of mathematical analysis with application of geometric optics, photoelectric conversion methods and construction physics in solar engineering are used. Analytical calculations were carried out to clarify the design parameters of the SPS that are made in the form of a sphere and a cylinder. The article presents the results of theoretical studies of the electrical characteristics of SPS made in the form of a sphere and a cylinder under uneven illumination of solar photoelectric modules (SPM). The relationship of electrical power and the number of SPS in the SPS is determined by the methods of mathematical statistics. As a result of studies of the electrical characteristics of SPS in uneven lighting, the following results were obtained: for SPS in the form of a sphere, small-area SPS have energy efficiency 32% more than large-area SPS; for SPS in the form of a cylinder of small-area SPS, energy efficiency increases by 19% compared to large-area SPS. The relationship between electrical power and the number of SPS was determined using the coefficient of determination, which is equal to: for a spherical surface - 36.2%, for a cylindrical one - 26.6%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we study the disruptive power of the mobile digital sharing economy to the road freight logistics industry. New information technologies, such as the mobile internet, mobile payment methods, and GPS, have enabled platforms to match freight shippers’ demand with carriers’ supply by utilizing the convenience and mobility of smartphones. We empirically study the influence of the emergence of mobile digital freight matching platforms in the U.S. on the profitability and stock performance of two types of incumbent road freight logistics companies: freight arrangement companies (freight forwarders and brokers) and trucking companies (freight carriers). Since the mobile digital freight matching platforms mainly match small and mid‐sized trucking companies with shipping demand, we expect the platforms to introduce interference (direct) competition to traditional freight arrangement companies and exploitation (indirect) competition to large trucking companies, which potentially raises operational challenges for both types of incumbents. We use Difference‐in‐Differences (DID) analyses to study the incumbents’ profitability and the event study method to evaluate their stock performance. We find that after the advent of the mobile digital freight matching platforms in the U.S., the profitability of the traditional freight arrangement companies counter‐intuitively remained unchanged. In contrast, the profitability of the large trucking companies increased. Furthermore, we examine the changes in sales and costs behind these profitability changes. Our dynamic analyses suggest a time lag of the influence of the mobile digital freight matching platforms. Besides, we find that the stock value of the traditional freight arrangement companies received a significant negative shock, whereas the stock value of the large trucking companies showed no significant reaction. This study contributes to understanding the disruptive power of an emerging technology innovation of sharing economy to firm performances in an increasingly competitive and innovative business environment. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we define manufacturers’ overconfidence as a belief bias that they overestimate the impact of product greenness on demand and the accuracy of demand uncertainty. We build a game theory model based on overconfident beliefs, address the decisions of product greenness and price, and discuss the impact of manufacturers’ overconfidence on supply chain decisions and profits. For the adverse effects brought by overconfidence, we further investigate whether revenue‐sharing contracts can coordinate green supply chains. We find three new insights. (1) Manufacturers’ overconfidence leads to higher product greenness, a higher wholesale price, and a greater retail price, but resulting in lower profits. (2) Under the cooperation based on revenue‐sharing contracts, product greenness is greater, and wholesale price is lower than the case without cooperation. The greenness increases with the manufacturer’s overconfidence, but counter‐intuitively, the wholesale price is not affected by overconfidence. (3) Both the overconfident manufacturer and the retailer have an incentive to reach a revenue‐sharing contract. Retailers benefit from collaboration, and overconfident manufacturers assume that retailers can make more profit through revenue sharing, but this model does not exist.</jats:p>",

However, the current SCM systems are insufficient to provide product legitimacy, transaction privacy, and security. Therefore, this research proposes a secure SCM system for the authenticity of the products based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The IoT-enabled Quick Response (QR) scanner and the blockchain-integrated distributed system will allow all the SCM stakeholders to begin secure and private transactions for their products or services. Resulting, the consumer will receive an authentic and genuine product from the original producer. A lightweight asymmetric key encryption technique, i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain technology with on-chain smart contracts are applied for distributed IoT devices to make the authentication process faster and lighter. Each SCM stakeholder is registered by the service provider and receives corresponding public and private keys, which will be used for the authentication process of the participants and IoT devices. The authenticated QR scanner records all transactions on the blockchain. Consequently, there will be no human intervention for the SCM transactions. The security and scalability analysis demonstrates that the proposed system is more secure and robust than other state-of-the-art techniques.</jats:p>"

Magnetic scanning systems consisting of a magnet and power supply form an integral part of proton therapy and allow the beam position (x, y) to be controlled during spot scanning. Ensuring that the dose is rapidly and precisely distributed within the contour of the tumor requires a high-precision, fast-ramp-speed, and high-stability power supply with accurate control. The present work uses a three-phase bridge rectifier and multiple series-parallel H-bridge converters to propose a prototype power supply for the scanning magnet of a magnetic scanning system. The power supply is controlled using a proportional integral controller using digital signal processing. A prototype of the scanning power supply is developed and tested, and the results demonstrate an output current of ±500 A, a ramp speed of ±40 kA/s, and a short- and long-term stability of less than 20 ppm.</jats:p>",

The strategies applied in SCM are dependent on understanding customers’ demand, the ability to forecast accurately, and maintaining smart inventory management to achieve the full advantages of SCM. This study exploits the integration of SCM concepts with business simulation, along with exploring strategies to improve the whole operation of a chicken supply chain. Witness Horizon software is utilized to model the supply chain of Company X, and information gathered on the demand and sales of poultry (chicken) is applied and computed in the simulation. The study investigates several ordering strategies, which are based on the previous week’s demand (PWD), weighted (forward) 3-point average demand (WAFD), weighted (backward) 3-point average demand (WABD), and moving average demand (MAD). Each simulation result obtained from different ordering strategies indicates the effectiveness and potential of the proposed methodology. These strategies are successfully developed and simulated, in which the results obtained demonstrate a desirable level of inventory, and profitability can be achieved by implementing these strategies in real time. The study concludes with MAD as being a suitable forecasting method for the given scenario.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When the supply and demand of commodities are out of equilibrium, the dynamic changes in supply and demand are mainly manifested in the dynamic fluctuation of commodity prices and the change of price will drive the change of supply and demand. This paper proposes a method for constructing a three‐dimensional cobweb economic model using the “predator‐prey” theory. Firstly, based on the intrinsic driving relationships among supply, price, and demand, a differential dynamic model of the commodity and a pulse differential model when productivity increases are established. Secondly, the differential dynamics theory is used to analyze the existence of the model’s positive equilibrium and to prove its global asymptotic stability, uniform boundedness, persistence, and existence of the periodic solution. Finally, the correctness of the conclusions of the model is verified by numerical simulation. The relevant conclusions of model (1) reveal the evolution laws of supply, price, and demand that fluctuate around the positive equilibrium and tend to balance. Model (32) reveals that with the continuous improvement of production technology, supply quantity, price, and demand will fluctuate, but all three will change periodically. These conclusions can provide valuable help for people in the production, sale, and purchase of goods.</jats:p>",

The impact of empathetic preferences and power structure on the consensus reaching process are analyzed. The results indicate that consumers’ empathy increases the consensus wholesale price and sales price of products, while retailers’ and e‐platforms’ empathy increase the wholesale price and reduce the sales price of products. The empathetic preferences of consumers, retailers, and e‐platforms are helpful for increasing the profits of farmers. The retailer’s empathetic preference is not beneficial to its own profits and the supply chain, while the e‐platform’s empathetic preference can help to improve its own income and increase the overall profit of the supply chain at first, before decreasing. Moreover, the power of retailer is positively correlated with the profits of farmers and the retailer, and negatively correlated with the profits of the e‐platform and supply chain. The sales price and commission price are negatively correlated with the power of retailer, but the wholesale price is not related to the change in power structure.</jats:p>",

To prevent the rapid spread of farmers’ credit default behavior, the diffusion mechanism of farmers’ default behavior is studied with network evolutionary game. The results indicate the following: (a) When some farmers choose the default strategy because their default income is greater than their performance income, the default behavior in the small‐world network will not spread to the whole network. However, in the scale‐free network, when the default rate of return exceeds a certain threshold, it will lead to the spread of default behavior throughout the network. (b) In the small‐world network, the spread of default will be inhibited to some extent with the increase of extra returns. However, the effect of raising extra returns on the spread of default behavior is not obvious in the scale‐free network.</jats:p>",

For the past five years, the gas market in Europe has been exclusively a buyer’s market, аble to dictate the main demand constraints in this market. However, since the autumn of 2021, the trend has changed in favor of suppliers, i. e. the supply side. The trend change occurred due to a number of reasons that led to the fact that world energy prices rose rapidly, reaching such a high level that entire industries, private entrepreneurs and ordinary consumers became insolvent in a short time. The article examines the main suppliers of natural gas to the EU countries, analyzes the dynamics of renewable and non-renewable sources in the production of electricity in the Europe. The possible delivery volumes of major natural gas suppliers, including the supply of compressed and liquefied gas, are analyzed. The purpose of the study is to identify the key causes of the current energy crisis in the European gas market. The research consists in assessing the factors shaping the supply-demand ratio in the regional European gas market in the medium term, as well as in answering the question: will Russian gas really not find its buyer in other regional markets?Conclusions are drawn that the current situation of natural gas supplies from Russia to European countries should be considered from the standpoint of the existing long-term cooperation between Gazprom PJSC and European companies. Otherwise, the European economy will feel the negative impact caused by the shortage of supply оn the gas market.</jats:p>"

The study is based on the previously developed mathematical models of water withdrawal (cross-sectional method) and flow distribution. Effective WSDS manage-ment requires not only consideration of water withdrawal patterns from WSDSs and probabilistic structural variations, but also assessment of the impact of individual components (sections) and their weight contribution on the system performance. During the analysis, Kj and Рj probabilistic reliability indicators of water supply to consumers were used. These indicators include the following compo-nents: probabilities of WSDS fault-free and emergency structural states (ordinary failure stream) and probabilities of supplying water to consumers in these states. The reliability of consumer supply in each state is assessed using partial indicators Kji and Рji. Conclusions about the operational quality of each section can be made by comparing partial indicators with normalized values. Using partial indi-cators obtained in structural states, it is possible to assess the overburden of sections and their im-portance for ensuring the necessary quality of consumer supply, as well as to evaluate their backup line operation. An example of a particular system is used to demonstrate all steps of the proposed methodology. The need to use the previously developed software application for analysing the WSDS operation is justified. The software allows partial reliability indicators Kji and Рji to be determined for each structural state of the system. The proposed methodology for identifying WSDS sections with a capacity inhibiting reliable water supply can be used when designing new or surveying existing WSDSs.</jats:p>"

A novel two-stage process designed to address challenges of mass outdoor microalgal cultivation for biofuels and co-products was previously demonstrated using an oleaginous, haloalkaline-tolerant, and multi-trophic green Chlorella vulgaris. ALP2 from a soda lake. This involved cultivating the microalgae in a fermenter heterotrophically or photobioreactor mixotrophically (first-stage) to rapidly obtain high cell densities and inoculate an open-pond phototrophic culture (second-stage) featuring high levels of NaHCO3, pH, and salinity. An improved two-stage cultivation that instead sustainably used as more cheap and sustainable inputs the organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous from fractionation of waste was here demonstrated in a small-scale biorefinery process. The first cultivation stage consisted of two simultaneous batch flask cultures featuring (1) mixotrophic cell productivity of 7.25 × 107 cells mL−1 day−1 on BG-110 medium supplemented with 1.587 g L−1 urea and an enzymatic hydrolysate of pre-treated (torrefaction + grinding + ozonolysis + soaking ammonia) wheat-straw that corresponded to 10 g L−1 glucose, and (2) mixotrophic cell productivity of 2.25 × 107 cells mL−1 day−1 on BG-110 medium supplemented with 1.587 g L−1 urea and a purified and de-toxified condensate of pre-treated (torrefaction + grinding) wheat straw that corresponded to 0.350 g L−1 of potassium acetate. The second cultivation stage featured 1H NMR-determined phototrophic lipid productivity of 0.045 g triacylglycerides (TAG) L−1 day−1 on BG-110 medium supplemented with 16.8 g L−1 NaHCO3 and fed batch-added 22% (v/v) anaerobically digested food waste effluent at HCl-mediated pH 9.</jats:p>"

Our previous study highlighted that IL-10 mediated immunosuppression established the immune tolerance phase and thereby modulated both microvascular and epithelial integrity, which affected inflammation-associated graft malfunctioning and sub-epithelial fibrosis in rejecting allografts. Here, we further investigated the reparative effects of IL-10 on microvasculature and epithelium in a mouse model of airway transplantation. To investigate the IL-10 mediated microvascular and epithelial repair, we depleted and reconstituted IL-10, and monitored graft microvasculature, airway epithelium, and associated repair proteins. Our data demonstrated that both untreated control allografts and IL-10 (−) allografts showed a significant early (d6) increase in microvascular leakiness, drop-in tissue oxygenation, blood perfusion, and denuded airway epithelium, which is associated with loss of adhesion protein Fascin-1 and β-catenin on vascular endothelial cells at d10 post-transplantation. However, IL-10 (+) promotes early microvascular and airway epithelial repair, and a proportional increase in endothelial Fascin-1, and β-catenin at d10 post-transplantation. Moreover, airway epithelial cells also express a significantly higher expression of FOXJ1 and β-catenin in syngrafts and IL-10 (+) allografts as compared to IL-10 (−) and untreated controls at d10 post-transplantation. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that IL-10 mediated microvascular and epithelial changes are associated with the expression of FOXJ1, β-catenin, and Fascin-1 proteins on the airway epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, respectively. These findings establish a potential reparative modulation of IL-10 associated microvascular and epithelial repair, which could provide a vital therapeutic strategy to facilitate graft repair in clinical settings.</jats:p>"

The number of samples is 80 respondents from national shipping companies, from various types of ships, namely, crew boats, patrol boats, utility boats, supply vessels, and anchor handling towing supply. The results of the study indicate that there is a positive and significant effect of seaworthiness and seafarers' skills on increasing ship operational performance, directly or indirectly through minimum service standards. The minimum service standard variable can mediate the indirect effect of the seafarers' skill and ship worthiness variables on the operational performance of the ship.

Methods: We conducted a case-control study of individuals who experienced a non-fatal opioid-related overdose between January 2015 and November 2016 in British Columbia, Canada. We matched 8,831 cases to 44,155 controls on birth year, sex, and local health area of residence and examined 5-year prescribing history for opioids for pain, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), benzodiazepines/z-drugs, and other psychoactive medications. Results: The overall prevalence of prescription opioid drug use was generally low in the study population. Cases had a relatively higher use of selected prescription medications, a higher physical and mental morbidity burden, and were less connected to health services compared with controls. For opioids for pain, current therapy was associated with experiencing an overdose (OR = 8.5, 95%CI: 7.3–10); history of long-term use had a stronger association than history of short-term use (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 2.6–3.3 vs OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.5–1.8, respectively). While persons on MOUD were more likely to overdose compared to persons who were not on therapy (OR = 2.0, 95%CI 1.7–2.4), recent discontinuation of MOUD greatly increased the likelihood of overdose (OR = 25.6, 95%CI 17.5–37.4). Active therapy of benzodiazepines/z-drugs and other sedating medications also significantly increased the likelihood of overdose. Conclusions: While this study supports expansion of efforts to prevent overdoses among individuals actively using opioids for pain and improve retention among those on MOUD, it is also important to address other clinical, physiological, and contextual risk and protective factors to help curb the current overdose crisis. </jats:p>",

The so-called Amazon Effect has, once again, compelled competitors to rethink their approaches to achieving maximum efficiency. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is part of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Approaches, has been used to offer the preferences of clients of various criteria versus various features (products). AHP is used to compute the weights of criteria, then rank the various alternatives. The AHP method is used to build the pairwise comparison between criteria to check the importance of these criteria. The AHP method checks the consistency of the experts to ensure all data is consistent. </jats:p>"

This is a certain challenge for both the economies of individual countries and world foreign trade relations in general. This fact also had a negative impact on their development, which led to a slowdown in the development of most countries of the world. The current sharply aggravated international situation leaves an imprint on all sectors of global economic development. COVID-19, the food crisis, restrictions on trade relations, a decrease in cargo turnover and more have become a real test for many global companies, most of the companies could not even cope with such pressure and, moreover, completely ceased to exist in the international market. Many industrial, trading and logistics companies found themselves in a situation where the sharply aggravated problems of market participants’ functioning led to disruptions in the movement of material and related flows, and in some cases to breaks in supply chains, which led to a reduction in profits for many companies, which negatively affected them. Quarantine, falling exchange rates, declining imports and other environmental factors are pushing enterprises to deal mainly not with tactical tasks, but to raise the issue of strategic planning, developing an overall coordination strategy within the supply chain, as well as the task of maximizing internal resources and increasing efficiency in difficult economic conditions. The consequences are enormous, but the state is trying to find solutions to keep its economy afloat, bypassing these problems. This article considers the problem of disruption of global supply chains in the context of divergence of global development, assesses the impact and problems associated with disruption in the processes of production and foreign trade, and the economic risks associated with it. It also examines the consequences of disruptions in global supply chains, what measures should be taken to minimize and mitigate them, and what companies need to do to establish production. The question of the role of the state in such a crisis situation is considered.</jats:p>"

A cross-sectional study was conducted; data was obtained based on 365 medical staff (medical doctors, nurses, and medical technologists) from public hospitals in the northern region of Jordan; a covenant sample was used. The authors used structural equation modeling to verify the hypotheses. The results reveal that the quality of health information technology has a significant impact on management capability and operational flexibility. Operational flexibility as a partial mediating variable also showed a significant impact on management capability. The study suggests that increasing the quality of health information technology will enhance the management capability and operational flexibility in healthcare organizations and will increase employee loyalty as a vehicle to trigger positive work-related attitudes. This study is one of the very limited studies in the Middle East that examined the role of operational flexibility in the quality of health information technology and employee management capability.</jats:p>"

Without the proper preparation and sufficient knowledge, instructors learned to teach online during the Winter 2020 semester to allow students to complete their courses when campuses suddenly closed as a safety measure. Normally many weeks of preparation would have been necessary to redesign a course to be efficiently offered online. This paper studies some aspects of the transition from Face to Face teaching in the Fall 2019 semester to Face to face / Online teaching in the Winter of 2020 (beginning of the pandemic) to completely Online teaching in the Fall 2020. This transition is examined in a Managerial Analytics course offered in the first semester of an MBA program at a Canadian University. A survey administered at the end of each semester reveals different levels of students’ anxiety, modification in the communication tools utilized, changes in intensity of weekly study hours and expected recollection of the material learned in the course, a year after completion. Additional variations are also observed by gender.</jats:p>"

The essence of the approach lies in the dynamic assessment the closeness of the relationship between two sets of indicators describing each of the factors. The proposed model for calculating the coefficient characterizing the closeness of the relationship allowed us to consider simultaneously the factors of the formation of demand for labor and its supply, as well as to make quantitative estimates. The approach was tested using the data from the subjects of the Russian Federation situated in the Ural Federal District. The results of the assessment showed that during the period from 2000 to 2019 the closeness of relationship between the indicators of supply and demand factors in the labor market increased. The most significant contribution to the coordination between supply and demand in the regional labor markets is made by the demographic factor, i.e. the share of the population of working age. In addition, in some subjects of the Russian Federation, the functioning of the labor market is quite significantly affected by the retail turnover, the amount of investment in fixed assets and the graduation of specialists. The use of the coefficient of closeness of the relationship allowed us to consider simultaneously all the indicators of the factors of supply and demand in the labor market and make quantitative estimates. Such a unique approach makes it possible to avoid the objectively existing restrictions in the statistical accounting of employment and unemployment</jats:p>"

Here we show that the ribosomal RNA gene operon (<jats:italic>rrn</jats:italic>) copy number, a genomic trait related to bacterial growth rate and nutrient demand, decreases from the abundant to the rare biosphere in the nutrient-rich coastal sediment but exhibits the opposite pattern in the nutrient-scarce pelagic zone of the global ocean. Both patterns are underlain by positive correlations between community-level <jats:italic>rrn</jats:italic> copy number and nutrients. Furthermore, inter-species co-exclusion inferred by negative network associations is observed more in coastal sediment than in ocean water samples. Nutrient manipulation experiments yield effects of nutrient availability on <jats:italic>rrn</jats:italic> copy numbers and network associations that are consistent with our field observations.

This analysis is carried out through an empirical study of a sample of 460 companies in the automotive industry. The results reveal direct positive effects of GBS and EI on performance both, sustainable and financial. In spite of the key role played by SSC, this variable only exerts a mediating effect on the sustainable performance. Nevertheless, although the significant direct effect of sustainable supply chains on financial performance is not verified, there is an indirect effect of supply chains on financial performance through their influence on sustainable development. The findings reveal important implications for managers. They provide rational arguments (increase in performance) that should motivate companies in the Mexican automotive industry to incorporate values, standards, and actions focused on reducing the effects of their activities on the environment. These considerations will lead to a change in behavior which is better aligned with global environmental demands.</jats:p>",

We aimed to evaluate (a) substances and dosages provided, and (b) effectiveness and safety of the program.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all COVID-19 isolation hotel shelter residents during May 2021. We extracted data on medication and alcohol dosages provided each day. The primary outcome was residents prematurely leaving isolation against public health orders. Adverse events included (a) overdose; (b) intoxication; and (c) diversion, selling, or sharing of medications or alcohol.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Over 25 days, 77 isolation hotel residents were assessed (mean age 42 ± 14 years; 24% women). Sixty-two (81%) residents were provided medications, alcohol, or cigarettes. Seventeen residents (22%) received opioid agonist treatment medications (methadone, buprenorphine, or slow-release oral morphine) and 27 (35%) received hydromorphone tablets. Thirty-one (40%) residents received stimulant tablets with methylphenidate (27; 35%), dextroamphetamine (8; 10%), or lisdexamfetamine (2; 3%). Six residents (8%) received benzodiazepines. Forty-two (55%) residents received alcohol, including 41 (53%) with strong beer, three (3%) with wine, and one (1%) with hard liquor. Over 14 days in isolation, mean daily dosages increased of hydromorphone (45 ± 32 to 57 ± 42mg), methylphenidate (51 ± 28 to 77 ± 37mg), dextroamphetamine (33 ± 16 to 46 ± 13mg), and alcohol (12.3 ± 7.6 to 13.0 ± 6.9 standard drinks). Six residents (8%) left isolation prematurely, but four of those residents returned. Over 1,059 person-days in isolation, there were zero overdoses. Documented concerns regarding intoxication occurred six times (0.005 events/person-day) and medication diversion or sharing three times (0.003 events/person-day).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>An emergency safe supply and managed alcohol program, paired with housing, was associated with low rates of adverse events and high rates of successful completion of the 14-day isolation period in COVID-19 isolation hotel shelters. This supports the effectiveness and safety of emergency safe supply prescribing and managed alcohol in this setting.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

The single strain was identified as Stenotrophomonas through the physiology and biochemical characteristics as well as the 16S rRNA sequencing experiment. This strain was named as Stenotrophomonas sp.sp3 (strain sp3). The experimental results showed that for the strain sp3 growth and S2− oxidization, the optimal conditions were as follows: 25 °C of temperature, initial pH 7, 2.5 g/L of initial glucose concentration and 1.00 g/L of initial cell concentration. It was found that there were 31 kinds of sulfur oxidation-related genes in the strain sp3 through the whole genomic analysis. The results of the transcriptome analysis suggested that the main metabolic pathway of S2− to SO42− was the paracoccus sulfur oxidation process. The bioconversion processes of S2− to S0, S2− to SO32−, S2O32− to S0 and SO32−, and SO32− to SO42− were controlled by hdrA, cysIJ, tst and sox gene, respectively.</jats:p>",

The strategies applied in SCM are dependent on understanding customers’ demand, the ability to forecast accurately, and maintaining smart inventory management to achieve the full advantages of SCM. This study exploits the integration of SCM concepts with business simulation, along with exploring strategies to improve the whole operation of a chicken supply chain. Witness Horizon software is utilized to model the supply chain of Company X, and information gathered on the demand and sales of poultry (chicken) is applied and computed in the simulation. The study investigates several ordering strategies, which are based on the previous week’s demand (PWD), weighted (forward) 3-point average demand (WAFD), weighted (backward) 3-point average demand (WABD), and moving average demand (MAD). Each simulation result obtained from different ordering strategies indicates the effectiveness and potential of the proposed methodology. These strategies are successfully developed and simulated, in which the results obtained demonstrate a desirable level of inventory, and profitability can be achieved by implementing these strategies in real time. The study concludes with MAD as being a suitable forecasting method for the given scenario.</jats:p>"

Pesquisa de caráter qualitativo, realizada mediante análise de documentos institucionais e entrevistas semiestruturadas com feirantes e técnicos da área de abastecimento, informantes-chave. Destacou-se a importância social desse local enquanto espaço de comercialização de alimentos produzidos sem agrotóxicos e provenientes da agricultura familiar. Um vínculo de solidariedade construído com os consumidores foi observado, constituindo um ambiente de cooperação para a alimentação saudável, de socialização de saberes e de empoderamento dos envolvidos. No entanto, a população de baixo poder aquisitivo manteve-se distante desse consumo por causa dos preços elevados e da localização distanciada da periferia da cidade. Identificou-se também um risco para a continuidade da comercialização direta com o consumidor em função de nova política de pagamento pelo uso do espaço a partir de valores considerados elevados para os agricultores. Conclui-se que a busca pela inclusão da agricultura familiar nas Feiras Orgânicas e pela democratização do acesso a esses alimentos devem nortear as políticas de abastecimento, considerando sobretudo, a necessidade de soberania e segurança alimentar e nutricional tanto no campo quanto na cidade.</jats:p>"

A total of twelve SSCM parameters have been verified, and then the authors conducted the TOPSIS approach process to determine the importance level of these SSCM parameters. The analysis results suggested that \"Collaboration\", \"Distribution and Logistics service\", \"Customer\" have supreme importance, respectively. On the contrary, at the bottom of the prioritized list is three variables consisting of \"Warehouse/Storage\", \"Organizational social responsibilities\", and \"Processing and packaging\". This is the unique study to consider SSCM practice through the case of the Taiwanese fresh-fruit chain; hence, these key findings could be a valuable reference for the top managers to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

In terrestrial systems, plant nutrient supply is mediated by soil microbes, suggesting a potential role of soil microbes in plant diseases beyond soil‐borne pathogens and induced plant defenses. Long‐term nitrogen (N) enrichment can shift pathogenic and nonpathogenic soil microbial community composition and function, but it is unclear if these shifts affect plant–pathogen and pathogen–pathogen interactions. In a growth chamber experiment, we tested the effect of long‐term N enrichment on infection by Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV‐PAV) and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Virus (CYDV‐RPV), aphid‐vectored RNA viruses, in a grass host. We inoculated sterilized growing medium with soil collected from a long‐term N enrichment experiment (ambient, low, and high N soil treatments) to isolate effects mediated by the soil microbial community. We crossed soil treatments with a N supply treatment (low, high) and virus inoculation treatment (mock‐, singly‐, and co‐inoculated) to evaluate the effects of long‐term N enrichment on plant–pathogen and pathogen–pathogen interactions, as mediated by N availability. We measured the proportion of plants infected (i.e., incidence), plant biomass, and leaf chlorophyll content. BYDV‐PAV incidence (0.96) declined with low N soil (to 0.46), high N supply (to 0.61), and co‐inoculation (to 0.32). Low N soil mediated the effect of N supply on BYDV‐PAV: instead of N supply reducing BYDV‐PAV incidence, the incidence increased. Additionally, ambient and low N soil ameliorated the negative effect of co‐inoculation on BYDV‐PAV incidence. BYDV‐PAV infection only reduced chlorophyll when plants were grown with low N supply and ambient N soil. There were no significant effects of long‐term N soil on CYDV‐RPV incidence. Soil inoculant with different levels of long‐term N enrichment had different effects on host–pathogen and pathogen–pathogen interactions, suggesting that shifts in soil microbial communities with long‐term N enrichment may mediate disease dynamics.</jats:p>",

However, the traditional earth-air heat exchanger has the problem of large fluctuations in air temperature with the outdoor air temperature fluctuations. A system that combines an air supply chamber with an EAHE is proposed to address this problem. The outdoor air first enters the underground air supply static pressure chamber for initial cooling, and then enters the EAHE treatment. To investigate the effect of this air supply static pressure chamber on the cooling performance of EAHE, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed in ANSYS Fluent and validated with field measurement data. Then comparative studies of the EAHE system with a supply air static pressure chamber and the traditionnal EAHE system were conducted under summer conditions in Chongqing (China). The results show that the air supply static pressure chamber can reduce the EAHE outlet air temperature fluctuation by 31.98% at the maximum under the continuous operation of different air volume systems for 7 days. At the same time, the cooling capacity can be increased by 19.89% at maximum compared with the conventional EAHE cooling capacity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper considers the evolution of the money supply concept in economics through the lens of contemporary discussion on the degree of its endogeneity. It is stated that the model of exogenous money supply formation, widespread in the literature and actively criticized in recent decades, is an artifact of macroeconomic thought. Its dominance lasted a very short time period, and various forms of endogeneity were attributed to money supply much more often in the course of monetary theory development. Authors cover the debates between the currency and banking school in the XIX century, the birth of the theory of money multiplier, Keynes’ position, the monetarist view of money supply and its criticism by Post- Keynesians. Particular attention is paid to the turn in views within the mainstream, from the Real Business Cycles doctrine to state-of-the-art models of the New Synthesis. It is emphasized that the complete exogeneity of money supply is a distinctive feature only of the monetarist approach, which has relied on the specifi c assumption of the stability of money demand function. The paper shows that, despite the visible convergence between the New Keynesian and Post- Keynesian positions, based on the modeling of interest rate targeting rather than money supply targeting by the central bank, fundamental differences still remain between two camps regarding the endogeneity mechanism.</jats:p>"

One of the reason behind the decision was that considering the potential economic of Indonesia that has consistently shown positive trend of growth. As the economic and population growth, the energy demand in Indonesia is also increasing over the time. Indonesia has an abundant natural gas reserves and in fact is the largest reserves in Southeast Asia. In line with the increasing of global awareness toward the sustainable development and environmental concerns, choices over an affordable source of energy with a less carbon footprint is inevitably. With the latest LNG technology, has made distribution even possible to reach remote areas of Indonesian archipelago. The Indonesian government had set up a strategy to promote the use of natural gas in power generation. The Ministerial Energy and Mining Resources Decree No. 13 K/13/MEM/2020 (Ministerial Energy and Mining Resources, 2020e) issued, January 2020, has mandated the state owned enterprise PERTAMINA to establish LNG supply within 2 years time frame to support the conversion of 52 power plants from diesel fueled to natural gas. This study, is offering stages of research, first is determining supply and demand of natural gas in Indonesia, and then conducting a market analysis. A market review analysis on gas supply and demand is done upon various sectors, ie power plants (in relation to additional demand for the conversion of 52 power plants), industries, transportation and households. From which, it will be analyzed, whether or not the gas supply meet the demand. The result of the simulation is revealing the fact that there will be deficit of supply starting sometime in 2031 (much earlier than Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre’s prediction by 2040), with short gap of about 55 MTPA by end of simulation time, thus if the Government is deciding to maintain the existing export commitment.</jats:p>",

The object of research is project management in the field of reverse logistics. 102 The purpose of the article was to investigate the process of making project decisions on the projects implementation in the field of reverse logistics and to propose a system of criteria that allows to choose a single set of standard project decisions that best affect the strategic goals of organizations in supply chains. Methods of the study are the analytical approach and mathematical methods. An important aspect of research in this area is the use of a systematic approach to the management of reverse flows, taking into account the interests of all participants in the logistics chain, which allows creating conditions for further socio-economic development of the state and society. The paper considers the peculiarities of the formation, evaluation and decision-making on the implementation of projects in the process of managing reverse flows in supply chains. According to the proposed approach, each organization should take a number of measures to create conditions for sustainable development, which will form a matrix of strategic goals and develop several projects in the field of reverse logistics. In order to improve the efficiency of reverse flow management, the authors propose to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach based on indicators of strategic goals with criteria for selecting the optimal set of project decisions, which will avoid excessive allocation of resources through sharing hardware and software resources between different reverse logistics projects. The results of the study can be recommended for implementation in organizations that are directly involved in bringing the material flow from supply to consumption.

A brief description of the research methods used is given: titrimetric, potentiometric and inversion-voltammetric. The results of determining the following quality indicators are presented: hardness, oxidizability, content of nitrates and heavy metals – copper, lead, cadmium. Excess of permissible values of hardness, oxidizability, concentration of nitrates, lead and cadmium in a number of water samples was found. The possible reasons for the discrepancy of these indicators with the normative values are considered. An explanation is given for the excess of the values of the oxidability of samples of tap and ground water. The negative effects of high concentrations of nitrates and heavy metals on the human body are described. The features of heavy metals contributing to their migration in groundwater are listed. Special attention is paid to the causes of excessive lead content in water samples from water vending machines. It is established that the most common pollutants of the studied waters are organic compounds and lead ions. It was revealed that groundwater containing more than two ecotoxicants is more polluted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a potential substitute for traditional power plants in tropical islands and coastal regions. However, the OTEC power generation cycle has low thermal efficiency and the integrated utilization is imperative, in which an OTEC coupled with seawater desalination is the most attractive option. Membrane distillation (MD) has distinct advantages making itself a competitive process for seawater desalination, especially the feature that the drained warm seawater from the OTEC power plant can be recycled, improving the integrated output of the OTEC system. In this study, an innovative OTEC system coupling a power generation sub-cycle (PGC) and a water production sub-cycle (WPC) was proposed, composed of the upstream organic Rankine cycle and the downstream membrane distillation modules. The mass, energy and exergy balance of the individual equipment, the sub-cycles and the whole system were performed by constructing the corresponding balance models. The thermal dynamic parameters were calculated, and the performance of power generation and water production was predicted. The results showed that by coupling with the MD desalination, the thermal efficiency of the OTEC system can be greatly improved from 2.19% to 25.38% while the exergy efficiency changed little. For a 100 kW OTEC power generation cycle, the water production rate approached 58.874 t/d. In addition, the economic analysis based on the electricity and water sale was carried out, and the profit can be improved by extra water production, especially in the Hawaii and Rainbow Beach by nearly 20%.</jats:p>"

If there is a sufficient resource base and the factors of time, speed, and priority of delivery of funds are secondary, resource support is carried out according to the principles “if necessary” and “if possible”. However, the practices of resource support for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine considering the limited resource capabilities of the national economy and other similar tasks, as a rule, demonstrates the necessity of acting in the conditions of quantitative and qualitative restrictions of the resource base. Moreover, in the conditions of requirements for reducing the time of implementation of resource support, considering the priority of resource assignment objects and different levels of their initial resource provision. The purpose of this study is to find the best, rational, and even optimal distribution of resources for certain characteristics in three types of business conditions: certainty, uncertainty, and risk in managerial decision-making. Based on the analysis of available methods of nonlinear programming in distribution problems, proceeding from the condition of maintaining mathematical correctness and accessibility to practical use, the study presents the procedure for applying the maximum element method. The proposed approach to optimising the distribution problem is considered on the example of possible distribution options for equally efficient resource supply between the resource supply facilities. The options differ in the values of the importance of objects and the levels of initial supply in relative units at the time of decision-making on the allocation of resources upon providing resources for a certain final management task. The methodology of this study can be used in planning and decision-making related to the distribution of resources in organisational systems of military and civil administration, considering the importance and initial state of adequate supply of destination facilities in case of limited capabilities of the resource manager</jats:p>",

It also specifies the mechanism by which Institutional isomorphism affects green innovation performance, through alliance institutional processes and further to increase their competitive advantage in the global market. Data were collected with questionnaires distributed to Taiwanese companies that are listed on the stock market which produced 242 usable responses for the analysis, both multiple regression analyses and SEM were used to test the hypotheses. Our results showed that the majority of our hypotheses were supported, which is similar to the existing literature. The outcomes imply that institutionalization processes and alliance green knowledge sharing play salient functions in firm alliance performance while implemented in the context of green supply chain management. Furthermore, the results indicate that the concept of institutionalization and isomorphism are relevant and Mimetic pressures were found to be the most significant in both internal and external green SCM practices, while also providing instructive managerial implications through empirical evidence.</jats:p>"

These counterfeit drugs not only fail to aid in the recovery of patients but also pose serious health risks due to their inferior quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that in developing nations, approximately 10% of medications consumed by patients are counterfeit. This alarming statistic, coupled with the estimated annual loss of over $200 billion faced by US pharmaceutical companies, underscores the urgent need for an effective monitoring solution to safeguard against counterfeiting. Aim of Work: The primary aim of this study is to develop a robust drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR) that leverages blockchain technology and machine learning to ensure the integrity of medications throughout the supply chain while providing consumers with effective medication recommendations. Methods: The proposed DSCMR comprises two main modules: Blockchain-Based Drug Supply Chain Management: This module uses Hyperledger Fabric to create a secure and transparent system for monitoring and tracing the delivery of medications through the supply chain. This technology ensures that all transactions are recorded and verifiable, enhancing trust in the pharmaceutical process. </jats:p>"

The aim of the paper is to analyze barriers in the development of a sustainable fashion industry, including: the complexity of establishing a sustainable supply chain, unclear certification and labeling system, high prices of sustainable fashion products, the high growth rate of the fast fashion industry, low consumer awareness of the importance of sustainability in the fashion industry which leads to a gap between consumer attitudes and buying behavior, and low demand for sustainable fashion products. In addition, sustainable fashion is a contradictory term. The whole point of fashion is a change of styles from season to season, which in turn accelerates purchases. This is contrary to the concept of sustainable fashion, which implies a slowdown in consumption.

Thus, container ports in the Southeast region are undergoing digital transformation. The study sheds light on whether the digitization of the service supply processes of these terminals meets the needs of the stakeholders in the transport supply chain. The study examines and analyzes the relationship between technology complexity and compatibility to the continuance to use of container terminals through an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The study mainly uses quantitative methods with the analysis technique of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Survey subjects from 222 respondents are parties in the transport supply chain, including: shipping lines, forwarding companies, logistics service providers and trucking companies in the Southeast region. This study contributes to enriching and expanding the TAM model on container terminal digitization. Research results show that the compatibility and usefulness of the technology has a significant influence on the continuance to use of container terminals. Container terminal managers should consider developing technology and operating systems with the appropriate level of utility and compatibility and according to the needs of the stakeholders in the transport supply chain.</jats:p>"

The impact of bullwhip is one of the factors that could lessn the supply chain efficiency and increase the cost and delivery time of products and services. In this study, we explored the demand forecasting in supply chain, a four‐level chain of retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Each level of the chain forecasted demand by moving average method, exponential smoothing, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, and regression. Also, we provide a hybrid model based on statistics and mathematics to reduce the effect of bullwhip. For this purpose, at first, the supply chain simulation was performed. The results were then evaluated applying analysis of variance and the best combined model to reduce the amount of bullwhip effect was introduced. The model of this research could be useful for other studies. Finally, forecast for retail demand using the regression model; wholesale demand using the exponential smoothing model; manufacture demand using the neural network; and supplier demand using the moving average method have been done.</jats:p>",

In addition, the proposed model was optimized by the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to find the best solution in large‐scale instances in a short and reasonable time.

This paper used a survey research design, and the study unit of analysis consists of selected customers among Nigerian consolidated banks. This study used a purposive sampling technique whereby structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 750 customers of the 5 focused banks in Kano State, Nigeria. Partial least square–structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to evaluate the study hypotheses. The outcome of the study revealed that CRM has a significant effect on CL while CS partially mediates CRM and CL relationship. This paper provides substantial results to practitioners to realize the role of developing a CRM strategy in the Nigerian banking industry. In line with that, the management of the banks should build sound CRM components such as process fit, customer information quality and information system support to deliver sound services in order to operate and compete in the banking ecosystem effectively. This paper has made a substantial contribution to the body of knowledge in the CS, CL, and CRM literature by operationalizing it within the Nigerian banking industry.</jats:p>"

This paper studies a low‐carbon dual‐channel supply chain based on behavioral economics, incentive theory, and optimization models to better formulate pricing decisions. This paper constructs a fair and neutral decentralized decision‐making model (FNDD), a decentralized decision‐making model considering Nash bargaining fairness concerns (NBFDD), a decentralized decision‐making model considering absolute fairness concerns (AFDD), and a fair and neutral centralized decision‐making model (FNCD) considering consumer preferences and the situations where supply chain members are fairness concerns or fairness neutrality. This paper analyzes the effect of low‐carbon advertising level on pricing strategies of online retailers and offline stores and compares pricing strategies of online retailers and offline stores in four decisions. The results show that Nash bargaining fairness concerns of supply chain members could effectively reduce the retail price of low‐carbon products and increase their sales volumes. Absolute fairness concerns intensify the dual marginal effect of decentralized decision‐making.</jats:p>",

These issues make the strategy of sustainable development more relevant than ever, which determines the goals of this study. The purpose of the article is to analyze the features and prospects of improving modern methods of supply chain management based on sustainable development. Green logistics reviewed as the system of modern improvement trends of resource flow management, its key advantages, stages and reasons for development are described. The impact of modern market requirements and sustainable development goals on the tasks of logistics is evaluated: changes in the goals of reducing the overall level of costs and creating additional value for the consumer are described in the article. The main areas of improvement of green logistics are systematized according to their sphere of influence. Such organizational methods of improving logistics as Lean Production, standardization, integration and changes in legislation have a significant impact on how planning and interaction in supply chains works, these improvements contribute to the active involvement of labor resources in the implementation of sustainable development. Technological methods for improving green logistics rely heavily on digitization, automation, and robotization of many processes; artificial intelligence technology has great prospects for forecasting and modeling, which allows to reduce operational costs of logistics. The electrification of transport, the transition to ecological materials and alternative energy, which contributes to the development of circular supply chains, are also relevant directions of development. Conclusions are made regarding the significant prospects for the development of supply chains on the basis of sustainable development and the practical possibilities of upgrading logistics in the future, such as: reducing polluting and carbon footprint, reducing total costs and creating additional value, improving level of the competitiveness, are evaluated.</jats:p>"

We found evidence that decision-making of soybean production is related to rural production aspects such as climate, financing, cost of inputs, and soil quality rather than marketing and logistics. The novelty of this paper is the empirical analysis of the decision-making in agricultural production using AHP. The decision model was created and tested considering 21 farmers and 19 experts linked to the soybean production. Three different scenarios were considered: farmers' view, experts' view, and combined view. Our findings indicate that farmers and experts agree with rural aspects are predominant in the decision to plant soybean. Moreover, logistics have been used as an important flag of soybean competitiveness on international trade by soybean stakeholders in Brazil. However, our results show that logistics impact in the soybean decision-making process is low. Due to data limitation access, this study focuses only on Mato Grosso. However, this study has an exploratory character and presents empirical results that may help to understand soybean production over the country.</jats:p>"

The total demand is not well known and official data are inaccurate and underestimated. This research characterized and analyzed the maize grain demand and supply for animal feed in the last 15 years at the Rio Grande do Sul State. The state supply was obtained from governmental harvests measurement. The demand was obtained by the total animals (swine, poultry and dairy and beef cattle), while the total state demand was obtained using the relative national consumption from these segments in relation to the total. The current maize grain demand was at the order of 6 million tons for the feeding of swine, poultry and cattle, while total demand was between 9 to 12 million tons in the Rio Grande do Sul State. The state maize production supplied near half of the total demand for the animal protein chain, characterizing a significant deficit for this sector, providing instability and making this productive chain economically unfeasible in the state.</jats:p>"

Although heterotopic thyroid has been reported in different parts of the body, only a few cases of intra-pericardium have been reported so far. In most articles, intracardiac, intrathoracic and heterotopic thymus cases are mistakenly included as IPTH cases A 57-year-old man with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who was treated 8 years ago and recovered, is now a candidate for surgery due to clear cell renal carcinoma in the left kidney with inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus tumor that has spread into the right atrium. At the same time, he was operated on by two teams of urology and heart surgery. The patient’s kidney was removed, and then he was subjected to sternotomy by the heart surgery team to remove the thrombus tumor. After opening the pericardium inside the pericardial cavity, a pericardial mass measuring 1×2 ×3 cm, which was connected to the lower surface of the aortic arch by a 1 cm long stalk, was observed. It was resected and sent to pathology laboratory. The rest of the surgery to remove the thrombus tumor from inside the right atrium and IVC continued according to the procedure. The pathological report was benign thyroid tissue. Actual cases of IPTH are underreported, and due to the small number, it is not yet possible to comment on the prevalence of malignancy in it or its functional role; However any lesion or abnormal mass in the pericardial cavity should be respected and sent to pathology laboratory therefore by collecting information about these masses, in the future, decisions can be made and summarized.</jats:p>",

A literature review was conducted to build an online questionnaire that was applied to manufacturing firms in Brazil. This work’s statistical method includes confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that a package of resilience capabilities - collaboration, flexibility, visibility, and analytical orientation - positively affect supply chain resilience. Improving such capabilities, therefore, will allow supply chains to recover better from disruptions. It was also discovered, however, that supply chains do not recover from disruptions by way of supply chain risk management alone. Mutual impacts also exist between the group of resilience capabilities and supply chain risk management.</jats:p>"

From these statistics, individuals are now hocking up to alternative renewable energy sources. In this work we propose a Pay As You Go (PAYG) solar module as solution. The objectives of this work are; improve energy access in off grid areas, design an electronic system that can monitor and control the system, ensure sustainability and affordability by an average Cameroonian. A 13 watts energy system is designed around an Arduino board associated with other modules. A XoJo desktop platform is used to monitor and control the solar module. The user can recharge the module by sending the SMS “RECHARGE PAYG” and the platform will respond by sending a guide to follow. If this is done, the platform automatically initiates the activation. If successful the owner will receive a Short Message Service (SMS) confirming the activation, otherwise an activation code is sent to manually activate the system using the keypad. Payments are done through mobile money operations. In case there is a fault on the system, based on the received information, the owner will be instructed on what to do for maintenance. Thereafter, they will be a feedback indicating the fault has been eliminated.</jats:p>"

Therefore, in this research, a multiobjective, multilevel, multiperiod, and multicommodity mathematical model is presented. The proposed model has five levels in the direct direction and three levels in the reverse direction. This research is one of the few studies that has considered the sustainable closed‐loop supply chain of cellulosic‐based products (paper and corrugated board) in the model and has considered it at all levels of the chain. Also, the quality of returned products in the reverse supply chain and its impact on the collection and recycling of products and returning to the supply chain are other contributions of this research. The results show, by increasing the transportation costs, the number of established distribution centers increases to a certain extent and finally remains constant. As it is shown, the reduction of transportation costs to the point of establishing four centers in the recession scenario and five centers in the boom scenario becomes saturated and is no longer able to minimize the number of established centers.</jats:p>",

This article examines issues related to the provision of medicines and the development of the pharmacy network of the Kursk region in the first post-war twentieth anniversary (1945-1965), when our country not only restored what was destroyed by the war, but also made a significant step forward in many areas, including in the field of healthcare. The experience gained during this period in the development of such an aspect of healthcare as drug provision and the development of a pharmacy network is of great interest. This is all the more relevant, since at present the world civilization, including our country, is facing such a challenge as the coronavirus pandemic. The purpose – the study of the problems of restoration and development of drug supply and pharmacy network of the Kursk region in the first post-war twentieth anniversary. Objectives: to study the process of restoration and development of the pharmacy network, changes in its material and technical base and personnel equipment; consider the main forms of drug provision for the population; to analyze the directions and ways of supplying the region with medicines and medical equipment, including through the manufacture of medicines at the local level; to study the impact of state policy in the field of healthcare on the development of drug provision and pharmacy network of the region. Methodology. The author of the article, when studying this topic, relies on the principles of historicism, con-sistency and scientific objectivity. All this implies a balanced, comprehensive study of the studied archival documents and published sources using problem-chronological and system-structural methods. In addition, fundamental analytical methods were used, including analysis, synthesis, and comparison. This made it possible to objectively assess the problems, main directions and results of the restoration and development of the drug supply and pharmacy network of the Kursk region in the first post-war twentieth anniversary. Results. On the basis of archival materials, which are being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time, the article reveals the problems faced by the provision of medicines and the development of the pharmacy network in the regions of our country in the first post-war twentieth anniversary, as important aspects of the development of healthcare in general. This made it possible to objectively assess the main directions of this development, including identifying its difficulties and shortcomings. Conclusion. The author concludes that the drug supply and pharmacy network of the Kursk region in the first post-war twentieth anniversary achieved tangible results. It was possible to restore not only what was destroyed during the war, but also to make a significant step forward in this direction. However, many problems in the development of the pharmacy chain still remained unresolved.</jats:p>"

The identified transporters Lsi1 and Lsi2 belong to low‐affinity systems; however, it is unknown whether a high‐affinity system responsible for silicon (Si) transport exists or how plants modulate Si uptake pathways. We aimed at developing isotope fractionation as a novel tool for nutrient uptake and cycling in plants. We grew the wild‐type rice ‘Oochikara’ and its mutant <jats:italic>lsi1</jats:italic> under low (Si‐L: 0.17 mM) and high (Si‐H: 1.70 mM) Si supply levels and evaluated Si isotope fractionation between different Si pools. The isotope fractionations between Oochikara and nutrient solution were –0.15 and –0.63‰ at Si‐L and Si‐H, respectively; between <jats:italic>lsi1</jats:italic> and nutrient solution they were –0.18 and –1.33‰ at Si‐L and Si‐H, respectively. The qualitative isotope fractionation caused by Lsi1 were –0.09 and –0.49‰ at Si‐L and Si‐H, respectively. We thus verified the hypothesis that Lsi1 preferred <jats:sup>28</jats:sup>Si transport over <jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si and that this preference was independent of Si supply levels. Changes in Δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si<jats:sub>plant‐solution</jats:sub> suggested that a high‐affinity system exists and that plants may regulate Si uptake strategy by changing the participation of low‐affinity and high‐affinity pathways. Another root–shoot translocation that favors <jats:sup>28</jats:sup>Si has been found in Si‐H‐<jats:italic>lsi1</jats:italic> that previously occurred in banana (<jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp.), which suggested that Si xylem loading is related to the different Si transport abilities of Lsi1 and Lsi2. Our results demonstrated that Si isotope fractionation can shed light on plants’ response to variable nutrient conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With improvements in consumers’ environmental awareness and the promulgation of environmental regulations, an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay attention to green product design, pricing, and purchasing strategies. However, due to demand fluctuations and cost changes brought about by green product design and manufacturing, understanding corporate behavior preferences and constructing non‐single‐period pricing and procurement strategies can profoundly affect long‐term cooperation among green supply chain members. This paper constructs six scenarios in which decision‐makers have altruistic preferences simultaneously or separately and whether the retailer adopts strategic inventory. In addition, the impact of altruistic preferences and strategic inventory on the decision‐making and profits of the two‐period supply chain for marginal cost‐intensive green products (MIGPs) are analyzed. The results show that altruistic preferences and purchasing strategies do not affect MIGPs’ greening levels. Besides, the retailer’s strategic inventory is still an effective bargaining tool but is not necessarily beneficial to profits. Noteworthy, when deciders exhibit altruism simultaneously or alone, the effects on certain decisions and strategic inventory range are significantly different. Finally, the retailer’s altruistic preference may not affect the green supply chain’s profits, but the manufacturer’s altruism improves total profits.</jats:p>",

As a key component of these platforms, the fleet management problem can be naturally modeled as a Markov Decision Process, which enables us to use the deep reinforcement learning. However, existing studies are proposed based on simplified problem settings that fail to model the complicated supply-dynamics and restrict the performance in the real traffic environment. In this article, we propose a supply-demand-aware deep reinforcement learning algorithm for taxi dispatching, where we use a deep Q-network with action sampling policy, called AS-DQN, to learn an optimal dispatching policy. Furthermore, we utilize a dueling network architecture, called AS-DDQN, to improve the performance of AS-DQN. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the performance of our model and show that it is capable of outperforming the baseline approaches.</jats:p>",

Intelligent manufacturing consists in using supply chain data that are integrated for smart decision making during the production life cycle. This research, in cooperation with a large electric power transformer manufacturer, provides an overview of critical intelligent manufacturing (IM) technologies. An ontology schema forms the terminology relationships needed to build two intelligent supply chain management (SCM) modules for the IM system demonstration. The two core modules proposed in this research are the intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module and the product quality prediction module. The intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module dispatches orders that match the best options of suppliers based on combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis and multiobjective integer optimization. In the case study, the intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module demonstrates several acceptable Pareto solutions based on strict constraints, which is a very challenging task for decision makers without assistance. The second module is the product quality prediction module which uses multivariate regression and ARIMA to predict the quality of the finished products. Results show that the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> square values are very close to 1. The module shortens the time for the company to accurately judge whether the two semifinished iron cores for the product meet the quality requirements. The component supplier selection module and the finished product quality prediction module developed in this research can be extended to other IM systems for general high‐end equipment manufacturers using mass customization.</jats:p>",

The influence of the main factors on the development of the logistics outsourcing market and the formation of its structure in the context of logistics operators is reflected. Most enterprises in their activities need to solve tasks that are unthinkable without logistics support. And, of course, any company is interested in getting the maximum profit. The maintenance of its own logistics structure is always associated with significant costs. The main reasons are the low efficiency of using the car fleet, the entire logistics chain is often not optimized, the staff is redundant, etc.  As the most appropriate solution to the tasks, the transfer of logistics processes to outsourcing is considered. For enterprises interested in increasing their competitiveness and investment attractiveness, reducing costs, freeing up internal resources and using them for further expansion in the market, logistics outsourcing opens up additional opportunities, being an excellent impetus for high-quality business development. It is shown that outsourcing logistics processes increases business efficiency, turning an entrepreneur or manager from a manufacturer of a product or service into a demanding buyer. To date, this is a generally recognized fact. The question of the demand of enterprises for the proposed set of services of logistics operators is raised. The answer for 3PL operators is already unambiguous today. Outsourcing the management of the entire supply chain is a much more difficult decision.</jats:p>"

For the optimal design of an oxygen supply mode and ventilation system, a multi-component fluid model of the diffused oxygen supply of a single-head tunnel was developed. This study reveals the variation law of the average oxygen mass fraction at different altitudes. The relationship between the distance from the heading face and the oxygen mass fraction at each altitude was fitted. The results show that the distribution of oxygen mass fraction in a single head tunnel at different altitudes presents a similar trend of increasing first and then decline. In addition, the change of the average oxygen mass fraction with the increase of altitude is not linear, and the dispersion loss is larger in high-altitude areas. The largest oxygen enrichment area is distributed at the altitudes of 4000–4500 m. This study provides theoretical support for improving the hypoxic environment of high-altitude metal mines excavation work. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the efficiency of petroleum supply chains is a key factor that significantly affects the economy. This research aimed to optimize the configuration of the uncertainty multimodal petroleum supply chain in terms of economy, energy and environment (3E assessment). This study proposes a novel integration methodology between a heuristic algorithm and exact solution optimization. In the first stage, this study determines the facilities’ potential geographical coordinates using heuristic algorithm. Then, the fuzzy min-max goal programming model (FMMGPM) was developed to find the multi-objective solutions. In particular, this model allows analysis of supply chain uncertainty through simultaneous factors such as demand, resource, cost and price. These uncertainty factors are expressed as triangular fuzzy parameters that can be analyzed in terms of both probability and magnitude. Moreover, the model is applied to the entire petroleum supply chain in Vietnam, including downstream and upstream activities. In addition, another novelty is that for the first time, pipeline systems in logistics activities are considered in Vietnam’s petroleum supply chain optimization study. The results also show the short-term and long-term benefits of developing a pipeline system for oil transportation in Vietnam’s petroleum supply chain. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty on design decisions, this study also performed a sensitivity analysis with scenarios constructed based on different magnitudes and probabilities of uncertainty.</jats:p>"

Therefore, collecting geologic information ahead of the excavation front is important to prevent geologic disasters and ensure excavation safety. To predict the geologic conditions ahead of the TBM-excavated tunnel in the water supply project at the Songhua River in China, the tunnel-seismic-while-drilling (TSWD) method was adjusted and then applied. First, common-source gather data were acquired to record TBM drilling noise (pilot signal and seismic waves); a processing approach (including normalization, crosscorrelation, wavefield separation, and migration) was used to image the major relevant geologic heterogeneities ahead of the excavation front. A synthetic study from a numerical model with a fault verified the feasibility of the modified TSWD method to identify and image geologic interfaces. Then, this method was applied to field data resulting from a TBM tunnel excavation project. The field test of the modified TSWD in the TBM tunnel revealed fractured zones, fault boundaries, and a preexcavated tunnel ahead, providing the required geologic information for TBM tunneling and preventing geologically-caused safety issues. </jats:p>",

Analyzing the spatiotemporal soil moisture dynamics in the area will be informative regarding agricultural drought along with flood disaster assessment and will provide early warning studies. Therefore, we evaluated the quality of European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (ESA CCI_SM) data in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. Furthermore, we utilized ensemble empirical modal decomposition, Mann-Kendall tests, and regression analysis to study the spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture for the past 29 years. The CCI _SM data displayed a high correlation with local soil measurements at nine sites. We next analyzed the CCI_SM data from three pumping stations (the Gaogang, Hongze, and Liushan stations) in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. These stations had similar periodic characteristics of soil moisture, with significant periodic fluctuations around 3.1 d. The overall soil moisture at the three typical pumping stations demonstrated an increasing trend. We further investigated whether abrupt soil moisture changes existed at each station or not. The spatial distribution of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA was characterized as “dry north and wet south”, with higher soil moisture in winter, followed by autumn, and low soil moisture in spring and summer. Although the linear trend of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA varied in significance, the overall soil moisture in the JWSA has increased over the past 29 years. The areas with significantly enhanced soil moisture are mostly distributed in the Yangzhou and Huai’an areas in the southeastern part of the study area. The areas with significantly decreased soil moisture are small in size and mostly located in northern Xuzhou.</jats:p>"

The main task of the organisations, operating water supply and distribution systems, involves a high-quality water supply to consumers. Regardless of the wear of water supply and distribution systems, as well as changes in their structural state, the water having suitable parameters must be supplied to the con-sumer in the required quantity. Given the variety of regimes, modelling the operation of water supply and distribution systems indicates a wide range of their possible behaviour, for example, poor quality of supply to consumers during trouble-free operation or no impact of shutdowns of some sections on the quality of supply. It is necessary to analyse the systems and model their operation regimes using a mathematical tool. Here, probabilistic nodal reliability indices of water supply to consumers were used in mathematical models. They include Kj and Pj, decomposed into components characterising the wear of elements (sections) in the system and the reliability of supply to consumers in each of its structural states. The need to adjust the system parameters to ensure the required level of reliability of its opera-tion was assessed, with various solutions being outlined. The technical and economical comparison of possible measures allows an optimum option to be determined, prioritising the replacement of outdated elements and the construction of additional elements (sections) of the system. All stages of the sug-gested method, which can be widely used by organisations, maintaining water supply and distribution systems, are shown in the example of a system.</jats:p>"

Radiation can cause mutations and thus supply genetic variation; it can also selectively remove individuals that are unable to cope with the physiological stresses associated with radiation exposure, or non‐selectively cull swathes of the population, reducing genetic variation. Since the nuclear power plant explosion in 1986, the Chernobyl area has experienced a spatially heterogeneous exposure to varying levels of ionizing radiation. We sampled <jats:italic>Daphnia pulex</jats:italic> (a freshwater crustacean) from lakes across the Chernobyl area, genotyped them at ten microsatellite loci and also calculated the current radiation dose rates. We then investigated whether the pattern of genetic diversity was positively associated with radiation dose rates, consistent with radiation‐mediated supply of <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> mutations, or negatively associated with radiation dose rates, as would be expected with strong radiation‐mediated selection. We found that measures of genetic diversity, including expected heterozygosity and mean allelic richness (an unbiased indicator of diversity), were significantly higher in lakes that experienced the highest radiation dose rates. This suggests that mutation outweighs selection as the key evolutionary force in populations exposed to high radiation dose rates. We also found significant but weak population structure, indicative of low genetic drift and clear evidence for isolation‐by‐distance between populations. This further suggests that gene flow between nearby populations is eroding population structure and that mutational input in high radiation lakes could, ultimately, supply genetic variation to lower radiation sites.</jats:p>",

Human breast milk taken during the lactation period was examined, before and after frozen storage, pasteurization and supplementation with a fortifier, with mineral content being determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Osmolality of preterm milk and infant formula was measured using an osmometer. During the lactation period of mothers of preterm born babies, the mineral content of the breast milk changed. The concentrations of all examined minerals differed in colostrum and in mature milk. However, there were no significant differences in mineral content in mature milk before and after pasteurization and storage. Supplementation of mature milk with a fortifier increased the concentration of minerals, the final osmolality and the potential renal solute load. The mineral content of mature milk was lower than necessary for the optimal growth of preterm infants, so adequate supplementation with a fortifier is needed to provide biologically important minerals. However, the osmolarity of supplemented milk should be monitored due to the potentially increased pressure on the kidneys of preterm infants.</jats:p>"

Depending on the placement of the magnets on the rotor and on the performance of the stator windings of the PMSM, the distortion of the EMF of the phases can be more or less significant. Phase current distortions depend on the EMF, as well as on the features of the VSI, on the drive control algorithm. According to the methodology of modeling systems for interconnected subsystems, a mathematical model of a multi-phase PMSM was built taking into account the non-sinusoidality of the EMF. Computer models of drives with multi-phase PMSM, several VSI and control systems (CS) are built. A comparison of vector control algorithms in the dq axes and in the phase axes in the drive with a multi-phase PMSM with non-sinusoidal EMF and several VSI is made. Vector control systems in the axes of the phases of the PMSM provide a better shape of the phase currents and less ripple of the electromagnetic torque of the PMSM.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses coordination mechanism of wholesale price contracts or option contracts between the supplier and the retailer and wholesale price contracts between the supplier and the producer. Based on this, we not only explore the conditions for supply chain full coordination and Pareto improvement but also analyze the effect of the retailer’s spot market volatility by comparing two scenarios of the retailer with or without a random spot market. Results show that the wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain regardless of whether the retailer has a random spot market or not. The supply chain can be simultaneously fully coordinated and achieve Pareto improvement by setting reasonable option contract parameters, but the conditions for coordination are rigorous. When the expected value of reduction from the retailer’s spot market in unit shortage loss cost is greater, the total profit of supply chain will increase. Numerical analysis shows that the option exercise price must be set higher when the retailer has a spot market to achieve Pareto improvement. The loss rate in distribution process and other volatility risks will also affect the coordination of the agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the study aimed to examine two‐product and two‐parallel SC systems that include two suppliers and two retailers. Assuming that the demand function is a linear relationship of price self‐sensitivity coefficient and price cross‐sensitivity coefficient, which is an AR(1) process, two retailers share the demand. After that, the quantitative equation of the CFBE was deduced from two‐product and two‐parallel SC systems. Finally, we get the condition that the competition effect and the market share increase or decrease the CFBE, which was in contrast to the situation without the competition effect and the market share. The paper suggested that the manager can cooperate with their partner if two products are substitutable. On the other hand, the firm should improve the forecasting accuracy of the customer’s demand and improve the service quality so that it can increase the market share and reduce the CFBE in two‐parallel SC systems.</jats:p>",

Because the industrial interconnection intelligent manufacturing supply and demand network is affected by certain factors, the network will be subject to fluctuations and the functions of the network will change. The smaller the function change, the higher the robustness of the model. The related topological structure statistics (such as clustering coefficient, average path length, and degree distribution) of the two models are analyzed, and the analysis results indicate that the network structure of the two models has changed. In addition, different attack algorithms are used to verify the robustness of the model. The experimental results show that under the four different attack algorithms, compared with the BA model, the two models proposed in this paper have stronger robustness.

From a review of associated studies, this study constructed an online supply chain financial credit risk evaluation index system that had eleven level 2 indicators and 28 level 3 indicators for the four dimensions of financing enterprise qualification, core enterprise qualification, supply chain operations, and the macroenvironment. To assess the viability of this indicator system, data on 368 SMEs in four industries, clothing, home appliances, pharmaceutical, and construction, were selected as research samples. An online supply chain financial credit risk evaluation model for the different industries was then constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression methods. It was concluded that when evaluating online supply chain financial credit risk, it is necessary to focus on the solvency, profitability, and asset structure efficiencies of the financing enterprises. Due to the different production and operating characteristics of industries, significant variations in the degree and direction of the credit risk factors between industries were found; therefore, evaluating credit risks by industry significantly improved the accuracy of the model’s credit risk predictions. For example, home appliance SMEs need to pay greater attention to their inventory turnover and construction industry SMEs should pay greater attention to their sales growth rate, return on common stockholders’ equity, and GDP growth rate. Based on these results, some suggestions for commercial banks, supply chain core enterprises, and SMEs are given to improve supply chain financing. The conclusion of this study enriches the related research on credit risk assessment of SMEs and also provides decision support for improving SMEs to prevent credit risk.</jats:p>",

The study found that manufacturers offering refund policies generate more sales in the direct online channel, while retailers choose to reduce the retail price of their products. It is important to note that price reductions by retailers have a very limited effect and do not lead to an increase in sales in the retail channel. Manufacturers offering refund policies will inevitably infringe on retailers’ profits, and the variability of manufacturers’ profits depends on the residual value of returned products. Manufacturers should decide whether to offer a refund policy in online direct sales channels based on the residual value of the returned product; otherwise, the action would be detrimental to themselves. The price of direct online sales is the same whether the manufacturer buys the return shipping insurance or the consumer buys the return shipping insurance, but when the return shipping insurance is bought by the consumer, sales are higher in the direct online channel and lower in the retail channel. When the return shipping cost reimbursement received after purchasing return shipping insurance is low, it should be purchased by the manufacturer, and when the return shipping cost reimbursement received after purchasing return shipping insurance is high, it will be better for the consumer to purchase return shipping insurance.</jats:p>",

The continuous development of big data technology provides infinite possibilities for the construction of food quality source tracing systems. Currently, there are many studies on the application of food quality source tracing systems; however, most of them are in the field of food quality databases, and few have concerned about its application in the field of big data. Therefore, to fill in this research gap, this paper aimed to study a dynamic source tracing method for food supply chain quality and safety based on big data. At first, this paper summarized the variables of food supply chain quality and safety, constructed a Petri net model and a Bayesian network model for food quality prediction and source tracing, and realized the prediction of food quality features. Then, this paper applied two data analysis and processing methods—the density‐based clustering algorithm and the cosine similarity algorithm—to preliminarily process the collected quality tracing information of each link in the food supply chain and analyzed the influencing factors of food quality. Finally, experimental results proved the effectiveness of the constructed model. Relying on the real‐timeliness and authenticity of big data, this paper guarantees the credibility of the traceable information in the tracking process and improves the accuracy through real‐time stream processing of the updated data, providing unlimited possibilities for the comprehensive tracking of food sources.</jats:p>",

Inadequate access to clean potable water and sewerage services and lack of good hygiene practices have a negative impact on health and nutrition, such as diarrheal disease which is one of the leading causes of mortality among children under the age of five in Ethiopia. The objective of the present study is to assess the water demand in Yergalem Tula Kebele, which will be used in the sustainable potable water supply design for the city. The water demand analysis is based on a geometric method of population forecasting with an annual growth rate of 3%. The total water demand (domestic and nondomestic water demands) projection has also been made and the per capita water demand of 25 liters for a distance of 0.5 km from the water distribution point for rural piped water supply system is adopted, as per GTP‐II minimum service level.

The theoretical results show that the e‐commerce platform is less profitable than the manufacturer because of its economies of scale.

Using population-based administrative data (1996–2019) from British Columbia, Canada, we developed a method based on statistical modeling (Random Effects Warfarin Days’ Supply (REWarDS)) that involves fitting a random-effects linear regression model to patients’ cumulative dosage over time for estimation of warfarin exposure. Model parameters included a minimal universally available set of variables from prescription records for estimation of patients’ individualized average daily doses of warfarin. REWarDS estimates were validated against a reference standard (manual calculation of the daily dose using the free-text administration instructions entered by the dispensing pharmacist) and compared with alternative methods (fixed window, fixed tablet, defined daily dose, and reverse wait time distribution) using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the root mean squared error. REWarDS-estimated days’ supply showed strong correlation and agreement with the reference standard (r = 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 0.90); intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.95); root mean squared error = 8.24 days) and performed better than all of the alternative methods. REWarDS-estimated days’ supply was valid and more accurate than estimates from all other available methods. REWarDS is expected to confer optimal precision in studies measuring warfarin exposure using administrative data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The traditional meat and poultry farms use a fixed quantity of supply, which creates an imbalance between demand and supply. Due to this imbalance, a huge amount is spent on balancing the requirements. There is an inequality among demand and supply since typical meat and poultry farms use a fixed amount of supply. A lot of money is spent trying to balance the requirements because of this mismatch. In addition, when connecting and building the meat and poultry farm system, the procedure ignores the impact on the environment. The owner’s primary goals are to retain massive profits and raise reliability. The classical method neglects the effect on the environment while linking and designing the meat and poultry farm system. The main aim of the owner is to increase the quality and maintain the maximum profit. This paper deals with the meat and poultry farms in two folds. In the first step, the IoT based system is implemented for the traceability and demand‐supply monitoring. The second steps include optimization of the supply network to reduce the carbon emission from the transportation. Both steps take data analytics as an input to process the final result for the farm to run and optimize. Effective inventory optimization algorithms have been shown to be able to evaluate a significant portion of previous sales data and anticipate inventory future demand by taking seasonality and lead times into account. Revenue, productivity, and customer satisfaction are just a few of the business variables that these strategies may affect. Finally, the comparison is done with the traditional farm and supply chain on the points of demand‐supply balance, cost, carbon emission, and wastage. It is found that the farms using data analytics to optimize the overall system perform better and with 37% more efficient than the traditional systems.</jats:p>",

We build on sanctions literature and contagion theory to develop a conceptual model that encapsulates the nexus between targeted sanctions, supply chains, and firm performance. Drawing on data from Zimbabwe, we find that nontargeted firms in the same supply chain as sanctioned firms perform poorly compared with other non‐sanctioned firms, signaling the effects of contagion. The mediation test indicates that economic sanctions reduce the performance of nontargeted supply chain member firms through reducing sales and increasing the cost of products, showing significant mediating effects. We also show that exports greatly affect nontargeted firms that depend heavily on targeted firms, whereas imports have a relatively low impact. The results of this study extend previous research on the adverse consequences of economic sanctions and supply chain networks and provide important guiding significance for firm managers, investors and policymakers on how to respond to smart sanctions.</jats:p>",

The cockle<jats:italic>Cerastoderma edule</jats:italic>population in the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA) in south Wales, UK, declined from 1997-2004 before an abrupt ‘crash’ in stocks between 2004 and 2010. While there has been some recovery since, stocks of larger cockles are still very low. Using survey data from the UK Wetland Bird Survey and analyses of apparent survival and biometrics from ringing, we investigated how the Burry Inlet SPA’s wintering Eurasian oystercatcher<jats:italic>Haematopus ostralegus</jats:italic>population responded to this crash. Our analysis showed that both body condition and apparent survival of wintering adult oystercatchers were reduced in the years following the cockle crash but both recovered. The number of birds using the Burry Inlet SPA decreased through the course of the cockle stock decline whilst numbers of birds in the adjacent Carmarthen Bay increased, indicating the importance of adjacent sites for buffering the effects of such changes, i.e. protected secondary habitats can be a vital component of a resilient site network. Our findings are useful in understanding how a predator copes with a serious decline in its preferred food stocks. This study has wide applicability in planning the management of coastal wetlands and shellfisheries as well as the design of resilient protected area networks in the light of environmental change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prefabricated construction has attracted worldwide concern and promotion due to its environmental friendliness, high quality, and high efficiency. In China, the application of prefabricated construction still lags due to its high cost. To improve prefabricated construction development, the Chinese government and provinces have launched subsidy policies for different objects that offer subsidies to the assembler, the manufacturer, or consumers. Subsidy policies for different subsidy objects have different impacts on the manufacturer wholesale price and assembler retail price and assembly rate and make their decisions more complicated. Therefore, this study uses game theory and builds three models to analyze the effects of government subsidies on manufacturer pricing, assembler pricing, assembly rate decisions, and profit. We find that government subsidy policies can bring more profit to prefabricated construction enterprises, reduce their costs, and benefit the promotion of prefabricated construction. Through comparison and numerical analysis, we also find that when the government subsidizes enterprises more, it is better to subsidize the assembler, because it is good for all three parties. First, consumers can obtain a lower retail price. Second, enterprises can obtain more profits. Finally, for the government, this approach can increase the demand for prefabricated construction and increase the assembly rate, which is conducive to the promotion of prefabricated construction. When the government subsidizes customers more, it is better for the assembler and the manufacturer to subsidize customers, because they can obtain more profits. It is better for the government and customers to subsidize the assembler or the manufacture, because consumers can get the lower retail price. Although the assembly rate and enterprises’ profits are not optimal, they have also been improved. In addition, when the government directly subsidizes enterprises, the enterprises will actively cooperate with the subsidy policy and are more willing to adopt prefabricated construction. This approach will benefit the promotion of prefabricated construction.</jats:p>"

The parameters of the operation of the furnace No.43 of the Aksu Ferroalloy Plant in connection with the change in the characteristics of the current lead during the modernization of the EPU are considered. According to the experimental results of calculations, the power Ru, the composition of the metal and slag from the production of ferrosilicochromium are have great importance, almost with a rare use of the electrical resistance of the solid charge and the electrical resistivity of the slag, regardless of the readings of the sensors and the electrical parameters of the current supply. When using computational computer-computer programs (CRP), eleven modes of network operation are used. In this paper, mode 10 is closest to the production mode. According to mode 10, the electrical parameters of the current supply have been improved. According to the conditions of experimental calculations, the power Ру, the compositions of the metal and slag of ferrosilicochromium production remain constant. Modernization of a short network and an increase in the deepening of electrodes into the charge led to a decrease in Rу to 0.945÷0.958 mΩ and secondary voltage Uл to 155 V, to a decrease in the SiC content in the slag to 15.1 and a decrease in flyoff SiО2 to 67.0÷68.6 kg/t. The deepening of the electrodes with their reduced fit increased the furnace productivity to 79.8 t, and the specific power consumption decreased by 870 kW/h·t.</jats:p>"

Proper optimization modelling is the core driving force towards the green and low-carbon operation of cold chain logistics, laying the necessary foundation for the development of a data-driven modelling system. Since efficient packaging is necessary for loss control in the cold chain, its final efficiency during circulation is important for realizing continuous loss prevention and efficient supply. Thus, it is urgent to determine how to utilize these continuously acquired data and how to formulate a more accurate packaging efficiency control methodology in the agri-products cold chain. Through continuous monitoring, we examined the feasibility of this topic by focusing on the concept of data-driven evaluation modelling and the dynamic formation mechanism of comprehensive packaging efficiency in cold chain logistics. The packaging efficiency in the table grape cold chain was used as an example to evaluate the comprehensive efficiency evaluation index system and data-driven evaluation framework proposed in this paper. Our results indicate that the established methodology can adapt to the continuity of comprehensive packaging efficiency, also reflecting the comprehensive efficiency evaluation of the packaging for different times and distances. Through the evaluation of our results, the differences and the dynamic processes between different final packaging efficiencies at different moments are effectively displayed. Thus, the continuous improvement of a low-carbon system in cold chain logistics could be realized.</jats:p>"

Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are responding to the pandemic in a variety of ways. Together, disruptions from and responses to COVID-19 illuminate existing vulnerabilities in the fish distribution paradigm and possible means of reducing system and actor sensitivity and exposure and increasing adaptive capacity. Integrating concepts from literature on supply chain disruptions, social-ecological systems, human wellbeing, vulnerability, and SSFs, we synthesize preliminary lessons from six case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, Canada, and the United States. The SSF supply chains examined employ different distribution strategies and operate in different geographic, political, social, economic, and cultural contexts. Specifically, we ask (a) how resilient have different SSF supply chains been to COVID-19 impacts; (b) what do these initial outcomes indicate about the role of distribution strategies in determining the vulnerability of SSF supply chains to macroeconomic shocks; and (c) what key factors have shaped this vulnerability? Based on our findings, systemic changes that may reduce SSF vulnerability to future macroeconomic shocks include: diversification of distribution strategies, livelihoods, and products; development of local and domestic markets and distribution channels; reduced reliance on international markets; establishment of effective communication channels; and preparation for providing aid to directly assist supply chains and support consumer purchasing power.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to assess the stream-flow of the data-scarce transboundary Chitral-Kabul River Basin (C-KRB) in Pakistan using a hydrologic modeling approach. The HEC-HMS model was applied for predicting peak-flow and simulating runoff of the C-KRB. The model was calibrated over the period 2010–2011 (66% of all data) and validated for 2012 (33% of all data). Our findings showed that the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and R2 were 0.70 and 0.89 respectively. The simulated peak-outflow was 850 m3/s on 1 August, which was quite close to the observed peak-flow of 861 m3/s on 3 August 2012. The difference in peak-flow (Dp) was −4.45% and the deviation of runoff volume (Dv) was −26.95%. It was concluded that HEC-HMS can be applied as a rapid tool in predicting future flow using the freely accessible rainfall and snow-cover data. Furthermore, this approach can be utilized for water users, developers and planners to provide first-hand information for formulating any bilateral agreement on shared water of the KRB between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide public health concern, which can be addressed with voluntary or mandatory food fortification. The aim of this study was to determine if branded food composition databases can be used to investigate voluntary fortification practices. A case study was conducted using two nationally representative cross-sectional datasets of branded foods in Slovenia, collected in 2017 and 2020, and yearly sales data. Using food labeling data we investigated prevalence of fortification and average vitamin D content, while nutrient profiling was used to investigate overall nutritional quality of the foods. In both datasets, the highest prevalence of vitamin D fortification was observed in meal replacements (78% in 2017; 100% in 2020) and in margarine, corresponding to high market share. Other food categories commonly fortified with vitamin D are breakfast cereals (5% in 2017; 6% in 2020), yogurts and their imitates (5% in 2017; 4% in 2020), and baby foods (18% in both years). The highest declared average content of vitamin D was observed in margarine and foods for specific dietary use (7–8 μg/100g), followed by breakfast cereals (4 μg/100g), while the average content in other foods was below 2 μg/100g. Only minor differences were observed between 2017 and 2020. Major food-category differences were also observed in comparison of the overall nutritional quality of the fortified foods; higher overall nutritional quality was only observed in fortified margarine. Our study showed that branded food composition databases are extremely useful resources for the investigation and monitoring of fortification practices, particularly if sales data can also be used. In the absence of mandatory or recommended fortification in Slovenia, very few manufacturers decide to add vitamin D, and even when this is the case, such products are commonly niche foods with lower market shares. We observed exceptions in imported foods, which can be subject to fortification policies introduced in other countries.</jats:p>"

The main types of buildings that can be located in residential areas are shown (high-rise residential buildings, dormitories, cottages, administrative buildings and offices, educational institutions, shopping centers, catering enterprises, etc.) and the peculiarities of their heat supply systems are characterized. Based on the presented methodology, the calculation of the daily and weekly schedule of heat consumption for two generalized types of buildings: residential (high-rise buildings, cottages, dormitories, etc.) and public (administrative buildings, educational institutions, offices, etc.) was carried out. Based on the calculations, a generalized heat load schedule for two types of buildings was drawn up, taking into account the mutual influence on the maximum power of the heat source. Based on the obtained results, calculations were made and daily schedules of generalized heat consumption by buildings of various types were made, taking into account modern energy efficiency requirements (two-period mode of heating and thermal modernization). The expediency of using heat accumulators in thermal points for smoothing the peaks of the total load and reducing the maximum power of the heat source is shown. A probable decrease in the maximum power of heat supply systems is shown, and recommendations are given regarding the calculations of heat supply systems during their reconstruction and modernization.</jats:p>"

The energy source for hydrogen production is proposed to be electricity generated at Mexican sugar factories. This study considers the utilization of existing infrastructure in strategic areas of the country, which brings several advantages in terms of possible solutions. This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of using biomass wastes for energy generation, and its integration to the national energy grid, where the problem is addressed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), adopting maximization of annual profit, and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions as optimization criteria. Input data is provided by sugar companies and the national transport and energy information platform, and were represented by probability distributions to consider variability in key parameters. Independent solutions show similarities in terms of resource utilization, while also significant differences regarding economic and environmental indicators. Multi-objective optimization was performed by a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal HSC network configuration is selected using a multi-criteria decision technique, i.e., TOPSIS. An uncertainty analysis is performed, and main economic indicators are estimated by investment assessment. Main results show the trade-off interactions between the HSC elements and optimization criteria. The average internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated to be 21.5% and average payback period is 5.02 years.</jats:p>"

The research object of this paper is the retailer’s two-echelon supply chain of fresh agricultural produce, and the aim is to achieve the optimal two-period coordination and ordering through options and wholesale contracts in the supply chain. In the case of two-period pricing, we find that the optimal wholesale order quantity increases with the decline of the price in the first period and tends to be stable with the decline of the price in the second period. In contrast, the price change in the first period has a greater impact on the retailer’s optimal order quantity. The profits of both the retailer and the supplier increase significantly with the increase of the price in the first period, while the impact of the change of the price in the second period is not obvious. Meanwhile, decentralized decision-making can only be coordinated in the supply chain through the original option contract at the first-period price. In the second period, the cost-sharing contract is introduced to coordinate the supply chain, increase orders, and increase the profits of both the retailer and the supplier. These findings are of great significance for both the retailer and the supplier in the multi-period dynamic pricing of fresh produce under the option contract.</jats:p>",

Water pumped from agricultural tile drain sumps to nearby ditches or channels could be cost-effectively diverted through a woodchip bioreactor to remove nitrate prior to discharge into local waterways. Sizing the bioreactor to achieve targeted outlet concentrations within a minimum footprint is important to minimizing cost. Determining the necessary bioreactor size should involve a hydrological component as well as reaction type and rates. We measured inflow and outflow nitrate concentrations in a pumped open-channel woodchip bioreactor over a 13-month period and used a tanks-in-series approach to model hydrology and estimate parameter values for reaction kinetics. Both zero-order and first-order reaction kinetics incorporating the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence were modeled. The zero-order model fit the data better. The rate coefficients (k = 17.5 g N m−3 day−1 and theta = 1.12 against Tref = 20 °C) can be used for estimating the size of a woodchip bioreactor to treat nitrate in agricultural runoff from farm blocks on California's central coast. We present an Excel model for our tanks-in-series hydrology to aid in estimating bioreactor size.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Driven by the pain points of the organic food supply chain, which has been plagued by counterfeiting and difficulties in pursuing accountability, this paper investigates a secondary organic food supply chain consisting of suppliers and retailers and establishes two supply chain models under the traditional model and in the blockchain traceability context. In order to effectively solve the problem of unrealized Pareto improvement in organic food supply chain after applying blockchain, a new hybrid contract based on benefit‐sharing and cost‐sharing is designed to coordinate the supply chain and realize Pareto improvement, and this solution is gradually applied to organic food enterprises. Based on the fact that blockchain can improve trust in the supply chain and eliminate counterfeiting of organic food, the relationship between the rate of genuine products and market demand and the cost of blockchain is established, and then the analysis is developed using the Stackelberg game. We compare the traditional model with the model in the blockchain context and analyze the optimal profit of each supply chain entity, comparing the change in optimal profit before and after the blockchain implementation, and clarifying the cost threshold of the blockchain technology input application. We find that: (i) The adoption of blockchain can not only improve the authenticity of products and combat counterfeit and shoddy organic food, but at the same time, the improvement of organic level in the context of blockchain will also attract some consumers to buy organic food, which will increase the main body of the supply chain and the overall profit. (ii) Blockchain‐adopted supply chains are consistently more profitable for all parties and overall than traditional supply chains. The main contribution of this study is that in the organic food supply chain under the application of blockchain technology model, by introducing revenue‐sharing and cost‐sharing contracts, the profit between each member of the organic food supply chain is further improved than the traditional model, and also, all of them are optimized, which further improves the stability of the supply chain and brings the supply chain to a coordinated state. Finally, in this context, the obtained results show the effectiveness and realistic operational efficiency of the proposed approach for companies compared to traditional single revenue‐sharing covenants. A combination of revenue‐sharing and cost‐sharing covenants is the best approach to solve such problems. In conclusion, it should be noted that the analysis presented in this study will help decision makers choose the most appropriate option among the possible solutions according to their criteria. This proposed framework can also be extended in various cases where profits are out of balance in the organic food supply chain, such as safety and value gain.</jats:p>",

Despite the tremendous effort made by the Liberia Government through the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation in providing efficient, safe and affordable water supply to the inhabitants of Monrovia and its environs, water supply coverage is still low to meet the demand of the growing population of its inhabitants most especially during the dry season every year. Before the Liberian Civil War in 1990, the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation supplied sufficient water for the inhabitants of Monrovia and its environs at that time the treatment Plant was in full operation and supplied 16 million gallons per day on the total population of 500, 000 people. After the 14-year Civil War the population of Monrovia and its surroundings has increased to 1,500,000 people thereby tripling the total population before the war and leading to water shortage in the city. There is no constant supply of water, operation and maintenance of the system as well as revenue generation from bills distributed to customers however, leakages within the networks are alarming because the pipes have over-lived its life span. This research scrutinizes reports, literature, studies and other important details regarding the Liberia’s Water Sector ensuring to outlines the primary causes of the challenges and constraints the management faces in delivering water to the people of Monrovia and its surroundings and also discusses the way forward ranges from technical, economic and social issues. The management has an opportunity of improving the current situation through adequate strategies for monitoring water services and water resources, making use of sustainable technologies and linking with target beneficiaries in the development of water supply systems within Monrovia and its environs and it can only be archived through proper planning and management system.</jats:p>"

The results show that given an increase in government subsidies, the profit of the dominant agent in the closed‐loop supply chain will be higher than that of the follower, and an increase in wholesale and recovery prices may lead to an increase in sales prices. In addition, the effect of government subsidies on battery recovery is better in cases of vehicle manufacturer dominance than in those of battery manufacturer dominance. Finally, when a battery manufacturer is in the dominant position, a revenue sharing contract can incentivize supply chain coordination; when a vehicle manufacturer is in the dominant position, a two‐part tariff contract can realize coordination in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

It is important to understand the interactions among plant, soil and microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry under different conditions of resource supply. We conducted a pot experiment on 1-year-old Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings for nearly 5 months under different water, nitrogen and phosphorus supplies, and we determined plant, soil and microbial biomass C, N and P stoichiometry. We found that plant, soil and microbial nutrients and stoichiometry exhibited a certain degree of plasticity in response to the changes in water and nutrient conditions in their environments. Variation partitioning analysis showed that root stoichiometry accounted for a large part of the variance in microbial stoichiometry. Structural equation modeling further revealed that root stoichiometry and leaf stoichiometry were two direct factors affecting microbial biomass C:N and C:P, and that root stoichiometry had the greatest direct effect. In addition, the degree of homeostasis for microbial biomass C and C:P was more sensitive to changes in soil nutrients than changes in other factors, and other elements and elemental ratios displayed strict homeostasis. These results highlight the importance of studying microbial stoichiometry in improving our understanding of nutrient cycling of the plant–soil system under different water and nutrient supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past ten years, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) attach great importance due to consumers, for-profit and profitless organizations, laws and regulations to the social and corporate responsibilities of consumers, so it has been recognized by practitioners and scholars. Supplier selection, environmental effect like a lockdown, and social cooperation and other SSCM programs can play an important part in realizing the triple bottom line (TBL) of economic, environmental, social assistances. In supply chain management (SCM), the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and firm performance plays an important role. Traditionally, when evaluating SSS performance, organizations will consider a new framework to obtain the overall criteria/sub-criteria of the sustainability index by encapsulating sustainability. In this paper 12 sub-criteria for 3 pillars of sustainability as economic, environment and social performance is collected. Although there are many articles on SSS and evaluation, so far, research on sustainability issues is very limited. This study endeavours to propose a fuzzy multi-criteria approach to discuss SSCM planning, and studies the issue of determining a current model for SSS in the supply chain during COVID-19 based on the TBL method. For express the linguistic value of the subjective preference of experts we use triangular fuzzy numbers. By using fuzzy numbers to find standard weights for qualitative performance evaluation, then fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is proposed to find the ranking of SSS. However, COVID-19 has a negative role in SSS and in firm performance. The situation of lockdown due to COVID-19 has a negative effect on the performance of the organizations. An example is given of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The oxidation of ascorbic acid by K3[Fe(CN)6] was studied in reverse micellar systems composed of CTAB (Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), and it was found  the observed first order  (k1(aq) = 5.2×10−5 s−1, k1(rev) = 61.4×10−4 s−1) rate constant in reverse micellar medium is around forty times higher compared to aqueous medium under identical conditions. The rate enhancement (k2(aq) = 0.9×10−5 mole−1.dm3.sec−1, k2(rev) = 1.75×10−3 mole−1.dm3.sec−1)  is attributed to the large concentration effect and lower dielectric constant in the reverse micelles. The rate of the reaction increases with increase in W = {[H2O]/[surfactant]} which is explained in terms of ionic strength of the water pool. The effect of surfactant concentration on rate was explained on the basis of Berezin pseudo phase model. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

The purpose is to identify and understand the role that IT plays in the two strategies depending on the way that it is conceptualized, and whether this is transferred to performance. The Systematic Literature Review is the methodology used to locate articles, select and analyze their content. In general terms, research to date shows a positive association between IT and these two supply chain strategies and that this association improves business results. However, the study shows that research into LSC and ASC has used different conceptualizations of IT and, in some cases, these conceptualizations can have different effects on the study’s outcomes.

For such decisions, multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are definitely appropriate. The implementation of the healthcare supply chain (HSC) is more complex to manage than any other supply chains, as it involves human life, causing conflicts of interest and hindering the final decision. Previous researchers suggested different SC models for healthcare products such as drugs, vaccines, and other medical equipment. This article provides an overview of published articles in the application of MCDM methods in HSCM at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. We studied and categorized 139 articles published in 2006–2021, providing academic researchers, practitioners, and governments with insights into the application of different MCDM methods. The review allows us to establish guidelines for the selection of appropriate methods for HSC management and provide support to the management of issues in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector.</jats:p>",

L’analyse économique et politique de        cinquante-huit entretiens avec des acteurs locaux participant à la régulation de quatre        filières en Nouvelle-Aquitaine nous permet de déterminer si (et si oui, comment) les acteurs        de filière se saisissent de la logique des CCP pour faire évoluer les pratiques et règles        existantes de circuits de distribution. Le résultat est double : (1) Les transformations        induites par les CCP se traduisent peu par une redéfinition institutionnalisée des règles et        normes des filières, qui restent dominées par une logique de circuit long. (2) À défaut de        restructurer ces filières, les CCP proposent plutôt de nouvelles formes organisationnelles        au sein des territoires qu’on ne peut qualifier de « filières » puisque ne s’appuyant pas        sur des institutions suffisamment fortes pour porter de nouvelles normes et de nouvelles        règles.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Biofouling of polyamide membranes is one of the main barriers faced by reverse osmosis (RO) technologies to supply fresh water. Currently, biofouling is addressed by feed water pretreatment using chlorine, followed by membrane cleaning. Chlorine damages polyamide membranes and also generates harmful disinfection byproducts. Thus, safer strategies are needed to prevent biofouling in polyamide membrane systems. This review investigates the applicability of the following non-oxidizing biocides in preventing and controlling biofouling in RO systems, including their antimicrobial efficiency, hazard levels, membrane compatibility, and applicability to drinking water treatment: (1) 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA); (2) 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT); (3) sodium bisulfite (SBS), (4) phenoxyethanol (PE), (5) sodium benzoate (SB). According to this review, MIT and DBNPA present most of the features attributed to an ideal anti-biofouling chemical but also are the most hazardous biocides. Due to safety and efficacy, none of the five chemicals were determined to be the final solution to address membrane biofouling. However, alternative RO biocide research is in early development and requires further investigation via biofouling prevention studies. Therefore, future research efforts on the investigation of economic, eco-friendly, and safe antifouling agents to prevent and treat biofouling in RO systems are paramount to promote sustainable water supply in water-stressed countries.</jats:p>",

Floods are natural phenomena that generally appear in multiple parts of the world. Flooding is one of the most destructive naturally occurring environmental hazards and can cause public, infrastructural, and environmental damage. The purpose of this study is to select alternative water resources for supplying Bandar Abbas in flood disasters by multicriteria decision‐making techniques. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. Information required includes possible water resources alternative for flood, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the water resources, climatic circumstances, and demographic information used in organizations data and previous studies. After selecting and proposing water resources alternative for Bandar Abbas in flood, the subcriteria were weighed applying DANP (DEMATEL‐ANP) techniques and water resources were prioritized with the VIKOR technique. According to the network structure and internal and external dependence of the criteria and subcriteria, the advantages of DANP in calculating weights have been used to adapt to more real‐world problems. The VIKOR technique was developed for multicriteria optimization of complex systems. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. After reviewing and extracting the criteria from various studies, 9 main criteria and 44 subcriteria were defined to select water resources in disasters and emergencies. According to field studies and related organizations’ information, the proposed water resources for Bandar Abbas to use in flood disasters include humidity, sea (Persian Gulf), Sarkhoon plain, and wastewater treatment plant of Bandar Abbas. <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. Results showed that the optimal water resources for Bandar Abbas in flood disasters are the sea and wastewater treatment plant effluent (after advanced treatment). The study proposed appropriate model to select optimal water resources for various natural disasters in different geographical areas. This model can help officials and decision‐makers to plan for drinking water supply from disaster‐prone areas before disasters occur.</jats:p>",

Since agriculture is directly affected by the climate conditions in Vietnam, several adaptation measures such as shifting transplanting dates and/or using different cultivars have been taken to mitigate the loss of rice production because of climate change. In this chapter, we introduce the econometric evaluation methods of the adaptation measures with the supply and demand models. The supply and demand models each consist of yield, planted area, exports, imports, stock changes, and food demand functions of rice. By measuring the yield and planted area functions with climate variables, the effect of climate change on future rice production and food demand can be estimated. By inserting a mathematical model of dissemination of new cultivars, the possible outlook of the adaptation measure can be assessed as scenarios. In the case of the Mekong Delta Region, farmers in the coastal to central areas have been shifting the aquaculture-based farming style. We also discuss these transitions of farming style.</jats:p>"

Based on the B2B e-commerce platform, it is used for online transactions and transactions between companies and companies. Information, integrating logistics, business flow, information flow, and capital flow for data analysis and processing. When people enjoy convenient and fast e-shopping, they must not only choose products carefully but also understand and be familiar with the relevant laws and regulations of shopping on the Internet. Avoiding potential legal risks is a key factor. The purpose of this article is to analyze the financial risks of the B2B e-commerce supply chain, according to the current Internet development trend, study the legal risks of the B2B e-commerce supply chain in the development, put forward corresponding recommendations, and build a relevant system to reduce risks. Combining some current legal issues faced by e-commerce, this article first analyzes the generation and operation mechanism of credit risk under the B2B platform online supply chain financial business model; then, based on the supply chain financial risk, a relevant system is constructed to reduce risks. This article first analyzes the generation and operation mechanism of credit risk under the online supply chain financial business model of the B2B platform; then, based on the supply chain financial risks, construct a system that can prevent and control the risks generated under this financial business model risk evaluation index system; finally, the KMV model and case are analyzed to verify whether this risk evaluation research is effective for supply chain financial risks. The experimental results show that through the KMV model, comparing the two sets of data, the default distance of most default groups is smaller than that of the normal group. It can be seen that the greater the default distance, the smaller the credit risk. When the default point coefficient is 0.85, use the KMV model which is most obvious when judging the company’s overall probability of default.</jats:p>",

However, scant attention has been paid to how the two actors interact in practice. Based on fieldwork in Cambodia, including in-depth interviews with garment sector stakeholders, this article examines the interaction between transnational CSOs and trade unions in improving working conditions in the garment industry. The data analysis shows that transnational CSOs and trade unions have distinct comparative advantages in improving working conditions. Rather than the conflicting relationship between CSOs and trade unions as suggested in the literature, this article demonstrates a complementary relationship between the two, indicating the significance of the cooperation between these actors in improving working conditions within global supply chains. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been proven that a model of the development of the meat product sub-complex is currently being implemented in Ukraine, which is based on vertically integrated industrial complexes with a full production cycle from feed mills to deep meat processing. Vertical integration is characteristic mainly for enterprises of poultry breeding, pig breeding and processing of their products, since in these industries there is a high level of concentration and mechanization, which contributes to the achievement of efficiency due to the scale of production in large business. It has been established that vertical integration of production makes it possible to ensure the raw material base of meat processing in the required volume and guaranteed quality; reduce transaction costs; minimize logistics costs through cluster development of the full production cycle in a certain territory; to optimize the tax burden due to the exclusion of taxes on intermediate products and the relocation of production to the territory with more favorable tax conditions; reduce business risks by distributing them to different market segments and controlling the entire production and sales chain; due to the provision of full control over the quality of raw materials and their complex processing, to expand the range, to respond to the changing demands of consumers, to increase the competitiveness of products, to reduce the cost price; improve information security of activities; to solve environmental problems with the help of waste-free technologies. Distribution relations in integrated formations of the meat product sub-complex can be built according to two models: price, which in practice can be applied in two variants: according to current market prices, or – according to estimated domestic prices; normative-distributive, which differs from the price model in that calculations are made not according to the intermediate, but according to the final result. We believe that now it is necessary to solve the problem of a balanced combination of a combination of large agro-industrial formations, medium-sized agricultural enterprises and personal peasant farms in the sub-complex, which allows to ensure the realization of the advantages of each form of management, economic growth in the industry and sustainable development of rural areas. The results of the conducted research provide grounds for determining the following areas of effective development of integration processes in the meat product subcomplex, on which it is proposed to focus the efforts of the state, business, industry associations and the scientific community: ensuring the effective entry of integrated structures into the global agro-food market; creation of a legal framework for property and distribution relations between participants of integrated structures, including the adoption of the Law of Ukraine on holding; development of scientific and methodological support in the field of organizational and economic mechanism of activity of integrated formations, taking into account the interests of all participants; concentration of investment activity of integrated formations on modernization of production and sales, development of breeding and genetic and fodder base.</jats:p>"

The advantages of the device of supply-and-exhaust units with a heat recovery in rooms with excess heat are considered. The design schemes of two variants of ventilation systems are given: autonomous and supply-and-exhaust. Aerodynamic calculations of ventilation systems were performed and presented in the form of tables. A technical and economic comparison of the version of the ventilation system with a plate heat recovery and the version without it was carried out. The ventilation equipment was selected. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that it is advisable to use the option of designing a supply-and-exhaust ventilation system with a plate heat recovery. Besides, the authors consider the methods of heat energy recovery in the supply-and-exhaust ventilation systems in particular office premises, which significantly reduce the consumption of thermal and electrical energy. Designs with a heat recovery eliminate unnecessary costs for heating the outside air. Due to the constant increase in tariffs for basic energy resources, air recovery becomes necessary and uses in the design of ventilation systems.</jats:p>"

The results show that product carbon emission degree and supply chain profit in a centralized supply chain are higher than those in a decentralized supply chain. With a risk-averse manufacturer, the product’s carbon emission degree and supply chain profit will further decrease. With increased risk aversion, the manufacturer's profit and total channel profit will decrease, but the retailer's profit will be affected by the carbon tax rate. Carbon reduction investment cost-sharing contracts can contribute to the implementation of increased demand for low-carbon products and decreased retail prices. Regardless of whether the manufacturer is risk-averse, a carbon reduction investment cost-sharing contract can increase the overall efficiency and profit of the supply chain. Finally, the results are verified by numerical examples.</jats:p>",

The study is aimed at justifying the adequacy of a previously developed mathematical model of water sampling and flow distribution to the probabilistic processes taking place in water supply and distribution systems (WSDS), as well as the validity of using the developed model for describing the WSDS operational process. At present, the design of such systems is subject to severe requirements, including the reliability of consumer supply and the cost efficiency of WSDS operation. WSDS meeting these requirements can be created based on the analysis of existing WSDS, considering the effect of various external factors. A key aspect in such an analysis is probabilistic water sampling as the process determining the operation of the entire system. According to water sampling combinations of various WSDS units, the procedure of flow distribution was carried out. Using the same WSDS, a sampling-based distribution of flows according to the presented method was performed. The probabilistic pa-rameters of WSDS operation for the considered options were obtained and compared with the results of hydraulic calculations. The obtained parameters showed good agreement. In comparison with other methods, the described probabilistic model of WSDS operation is characterized by operational simplici-ty and cost efficiency due to the small number of operations. The previously developed mathematical model of sampling and flow distribution according to the studied method can be used for describing WSDS operational processes and assessing the reliability of water supply to consumers.</jats:p>"

In this research, the defluoridation performances of aluminum hydroxides with different crystalline phases are compared and evaluated in terms of fluoride removal capacity, sensitivity to pH values and residual Al contents after defluoridation. It is found that the defluoridation performance of different aluminum hydroxides follows the order of boehmite &amp;gt; bayerite &amp;gt; gibbsite. The fluoride adsorption on aluminum hydroxides follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum defluoridation capacities of boehmite, bayerite and gibbsite are 42.08, 2.97 and 2.74 mg m−2, respectively. The pH values and FTIR analyses reveal that the ligand exchange between fluoride and surface hydroxyl groups is the fluoride removal mechanism. Different aluminum hydroxides have different surface hydroxyl group densities, which results in the different defluoridation capacities. This work provides a new idea to prepare aluminum hydroxide with outstanding defluoridation performance.</jats:p>",

However, <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> measurements of phytoplankton physiology and productivity are surprisingly sparse in comparison with the North Atlantic. In addition to the formation of the Equatorial cold tongue in the boreal summer, tropical instability waves (TIWs) and related short-term processes may locally cause episodic events of enhanced nutrient supply to the euphotic layer. Here, we assess changes in phytoplankton photophysiology in response to such episodic events as well as short-term nutrient addition experiments using a pair of custom-built fluorometers that measure chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (Chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) variable fluorescence and fluorescence lifetimes. The fluorometers were deployed during a transatlantic cruise along the Equator in the fall of 2019. We hypothesized that the Equatorial Atlantic is nitrogen-limited, with an increasing degree of limitation to the west where the cold tongue is not prominent, and that infrequent nitrate injection by TIW related processes are the primary source alleviating this limitation. We further hypothesized phytoplankton are well acclimated to the low levels of nitrogen, and once nitrogen is supplied, they can rapidly utilize it to stimulate growth and productivity. Across three TIW events encountered, we observed increased productivity and chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentration concurrent with a decreased photochemical conversion efficiency and overall photophysiological competency. Moreover, the observed decrease in photosynthetic turnover rates toward the western section suggested a 70% decrease in growth rates compared to their maximum values under nutrient-replete conditions. This decrease aligned with the increased growth rates observed following 24 h incubation with added nitrate in the western section. These results support our hypotheses that nitrogen is the limiting factor in the region and that phytoplankton are in a state of balanced growth, waiting to “body surf” waves of nutrients which fuel growth and productivity.</jats:p>"

Two differently directed processes of radiation power variation are observed during the irradiation of LED in active modes. It is supposed that the first process is caused by the power reduction of LED emission due to the injection of the corresponding radiation defects. The second process is caused by a partial recovery of the emission power due to radiation, radiation-thermal, and/or electrostimulated annealing of a portion of the defects created. The observed recovery of the radiation power in the active supply mode of the LEDs during irradiation significantly increases their resistance to gamma-quantum irradiation.</jats:p>"

Thus, to survive and maintain competitive advantages in the current business environment, managers are active in this background to implement the theoretical foundations of supply chain management. One of the influential areas in this category is integrated inventory management, inventory control, and vehicle routing. Therefore, this study mainly aims to analyze and define a routing problem, inventory in the drug supply chain with perishable products, and travel time dependence on multiple graphs with travel time dependence. The Box–Jenkins forecasting method has been utilized to meet the study’s aim and deal with demand uncertainty. This method can identify the best pattern governing the data. Finally, the mathematical model is validated, and managerial perspectives are provided. The study results demonstrated the possibility of achieving cost‐saving and reducing product spoilage. Applying the solutions of this model can provide some inherent social and environmental advantages, including reducing traffic load and emissions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern management during law enforcement actions is characterized by periodic changes in the conditions for obtaining information, short terms for its processing, and the vagueness of its formal description. The need to reduce the time cycle of management leads to the strengthening of the role of complex automation of receiving, processing and visualization of information flows. Thus, in the scientific work, the issue of the synthesis of the structures of combat systems is considered, but for a separate type of troops. The works are devoted to the consideration of the basic concepts of the construction of troops (forces) and the criteria for the creation of combat groups. However, these works practically do not contain sufficient theoretical justifications for the composition and structure of the information support system of the military command during law enforcement operations. The purpose of the article is to improve the model of information and analytical support of the functional structure of the military command management system during law enforcement actions, which ensures taking into account the conditions of receiving, processing and visualization of information flows during an emergency and significant factors that affect the achievement of the goal of law enforcement actions. The developed model of information and analytical provision of the structure of the military command management system for the performance of tasks in the emergency area allows to ensure the requirements regarding the capabilities of the military command management system and its effectiveness, which will contribute to the high-quality performance of the assigned tasks in the emergency area. In the article, an improved model of information and analytical support of the military command management system during actions to protect law and order in the area of a state of emergency is developed, which, unlike those known on the basis of the axiomatic foundations of the theory of complex systems, performs an analysis of the structural and functional components of the military command management system depending on the tasks and functions of law enforcement forces and allows taking into account the interrelationship of indicators and factors of emergency conditions when analyzing the state of information support of military command management processes. The directions of further scientific investigations will be aimed at researching the issue of substantiation of the system of information and analytical support of the security forces of the security and defense sector of Ukraine under the conditions of the legal regime of martial law.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a mechanism for decision making on green chain supplier problem. First, we define the Hamacher operational law for Pythagorean cubic fuzzy numbers (PCFNs) and study their fundamental properties. Based on the Hamacher operation law of PCFNs, we defined Pythagorean cubic fuzzy aggregation operators by using Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm. Further, we develop a series of Pythagorean cubic fuzzy Hamacher weighted averaging (PCFHWA), Pythagorean cubic fuzzy Hamacher order weighted averaging (PCFHOWA) Pythagorean Cubic fuzzy Hamacher hybrid averaging (PCFHHA), Pythagorean Cubic fuzzy Hamacher weighted Geometric (PCFHWG), Pythagorean Cubic fuzzy Hamacher order weighted Geometric (PCFHOWG), and Pythagorean Cubic fuzzy Hamacher hybrid geometric (PCFHHA) operators. Furthermore, we apply these aggregation operators of Pythagorean Cubic fuzzy numbers to the decision making problem for green supplier selection. We construct an algorithm for the group decision making by using aggregation operators and score function. The proposed decision making method applies to green chain supplier selection problem and find the best green supplier for green supply chain management. The proposed method compared with other group decision techniques under Pythagorean cubic fuzzy information. From the comparison and sensitivity analysis, we concluded that our proposed method is more generalized and effective method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

Foram utilizados os dados do Sistema Nacional de Informações sobre Saneamento (SNIS) e do Sistema de Informação de Vigilância da Qualidade da Água para Consumo Humano (Sisagua). Verificou-se que 82% da população foi atendida por serviços de água, sendo este percentual ainda menor considerando apenas a região Norte (58%) e Nordeste (74%). A maioria da população é atendida por Sistemas de Abastecimento de Água (SAA); entretanto, na região Norte, 6,6% da população é atendida por SAA e 7,2% por Solução Alternativa Coletiva (SAC) sem tratamentos. Para o parâmetro Coliformes totais, 21,9% das amostras de SAC da região Norte estavam fora do padrão de potabilidade, enquanto para o residual de agente desinfetante, 40,6% de SAA da região Nordeste encontravam-se fora do padrão, sendo que deste total 19% das amostras apresentavam concentração do agente desinfetante acima de 5,0 mg/L e 81% das amostras apresentavam concentrações menores que 0,2 mg/L. Conclui-se que parte da população pode estar vulnerável aos riscos relacionados à qualidade da água.</jats:p>"

Investment projects aimed at introducing renewable energy production technologies have been analyzed. The problem of the quality of wastewater treatment at treatment facilities in Ukraine is considered. The main directions of development and ways of improving the management of energy saving are determined on the example of the modernization of treatment facilities of water supply enterprises. Further directions for the implementation of the proposed projects have been identified, which will ensure efficient processing and disposal of sludge with the involvement of energy-efficient technologies for the production of biofuel. The problem of implementation of energy-saving measures is not new for the authorities, but the implementation of relevant technologies has not acquired a mass character in Ukraine. First of all, this is due to the fact that a few years ago the cost of energy resources was much lower than the market price, which did not create sufficient motivation for frugal energy consumption or investments in energy-saving equipment, technologies or energy-saving projects. In the process of developing a strategy, it is necessary to follow an approach that will contribute to ensuring systematicity in the process of developing the innovative model itself, will create conditions for solving the issues of managing innovations in the energy saving system, and will also make it possible to form a toolkit for its development and implementation. The development and implementation of a strategy for the innovative development of energy saving in housing and communal services should include goals, the choice of means to achieve these goals, and justification of the sources of attraction of the necessary resources. Summarizing what has been said, we note that each industry has its own characteristics that determine the content of innovative and energy policy in this area. For the effective implementation of innovative energysaving technologies in the sphere of housing and communal services of Ukraine, it is necessary to develop a scientifically based strategy for the innovative development of energy saving, which would form the basis for the creation of an integral legal framework for the regulation of the main parameters of the innovative process in the sphere of housing and communal services, the introduction of innovative energy-saving technologies and determine the arsenal of support tools, taking into account scale and social significance. This is an objective necessity of modern existence, since the process should not proceed spontaneously, it should be managed.</jats:p>"

Axial erupted in 1998, 2011, and 2015, and is monitored by a cabled network of instruments including bottom pressure recorders and seismometers. Since its last eruption, Axial has re‐inflated to 85%–90% of its pre‐eruption level. During that time, we have identified eight discrete, short‐term deflation events of 1–4 cm over 1–3 weeks that occurred quasi‐periodically, about every 4–6 months between August 2016 and May 2019. During each short‐term deflation event, the rate of earthquakes dropped abruptly to low levels, and then did not return to higher levels until reinflation had resumed and returned near its previous high. The long‐term geodetic monitoring record suggests that the rate of magma supply has varied by an order of magnitude over decadal time scales. There was a surge in magma supply between 2011 and 2015, causing those two eruptions to be closely spaced in time and the supply rate has been waning since then. This waning supply has implications for eruption forecasting and the next eruption at Axial still appears to be 4–9 years away. We also show that the number of earthquakes per unit of uplift has increased exponentially with total uplift since the 2015 eruption, a pattern consistent with a mechanical model of cumulative rock damage leading to bulk failure during magma accumulation between eruptions.</jats:p>",

This study determined the contents of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and As) from 39 soil samples surrounding a reservoir, and analyzed the corresponding source and enrichment using enrichment factors and partial least-squares regression. The concentration of Cr (54.06 mg/kg) was lower than the background value of the reservoir area, while the Cd concentration was higher (0.96 mg/kg). Moreover, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and As concentrations in the south exceeded those of the northeast in the Nanwan lake reservoir (NLR). Cd and As were the dominant contaminated elements in the NLR. The Cd enrichment factor value was 11.25, areas with moderate and higher levels of pollution of Cd occupied 89.0% of the total area, while As occupied 18.4%. The dominant sources of Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb and Cr were identified as natural inputs, those of As were agricultural production activities, and those of Cd were industrial production activities. This study provides insight into the heavy metal pollution and key factors of land-use types in watersheds with tea trees as the dominant vegetation cover, and aids in the planning of water pollution prevention and ecological protection.</jats:p>",

The adsorption conditions of norfloxacin by biochar were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). On the basis of single-factor experiment, the adsorption conditions of biochar dosage, solution pH and reaction temperature were optimized by Box-Behnken Design (BBD), and the quadratic polynomial regression model of response value Y1 (NOR removal efficiency) and Y2 (NOR adsorption capacity) were obtained respectively. The results show that the two models are reasonable and reliable. The influence of single factor was as follows: solution pH &amp;gt; biochar dosage &amp;gt; reaction temperature. The interaction between biochar dosage and solution pH was very significant. The optimal adsorption conditions after optimization were as follows: biochar dosage = 0.5 g/L, solution pH = 3, and reaction temperature = 45 °C. The Y1 and Y2 obtained in the verification experiment were 75.68% and 3.0272 mg/g, respectively, which were only 2.38% and 0.0242 mg/g different from the theoretical predicted values of the model. Therefore, the theoretical model constructed by response surface methodology can be used to optimize the adsorption conditions of norfloxacin in water.</jats:p>",

In this work, the energy dissipation caused by viscous stress during fluid volume compression–expansion (CE) was derived from the compressible Navier–Stokes equation. It is found that the energy dissipation term can be expressed by the product of the second-order partial derivative of velocity in space and the second viscosity coefficient. On this basis, a modified IAB-CE model was developed with the energy dissipation term and solved by the method of characteristic (MOC). The numerical results obtained from the modified model showed a good agreement with the four test cases, where the relative errors are improved by 0.26, 2.03, 9.56, and 36.67%, compared with the results from the original IAB model. The estimation for wave peak and valley is improved as well. Furthermore, the Bradley equation can be applied to establish the relationship between the dissipation coefficient and the Reynolds number. The modified model developed in this study takes into account the fluid CE effects and improves the prediction accuracy of wave amplitude of unsteady flow.</jats:p>",

It has been established that the assessment of land as a component of the country's national wealth is a comparable quantitative and economic calculation of its consumer properties and ecological and economic effects of use for different purposes of land plots as an object of assessment. Studies have shown that prices for agricultural land will be low. There is a threat of landlessness for peasants who want to work on the land, but do not have the funds, so it is necessary to establish a minimum price level for agricultural land, which, in our opinion, should be about 1,500-2,000 dollars. USA for 1 hectare, and this is provided that the land will not be sold to foreigners. When the market price is lower than this limit, the land offered for sale must be bought by the state and sold to the effective owner at a price not lower than the minimum or leased. It was established that the method of capitalization of land rent is carried out by converting monetary income into value using the capitalization coefficient, that is, the share of current income in the total value of the plot. This method can be applied to plots of land, because it is a functional object on which crops are grown annually, and therefore receive certain amounts of income and expenses that are well predicted. The value of a plot is determined mainly by its ability to generate income in the future. Thus, when dividing the net income by the capitalization ratio, the value of the land plot is obtained. It is proven that the weighted average value of the final value of the land plot is determined by weighing (assessing the advantages and disadvantages) of each method and the results obtained by it. The degree of confidence in the values of the value of the object of assessment within the framework of comparative and income approaches, their weighting value is determined based on considerations of the validity of these values and reality on the real estate market.</jats:p>"

Land use, seasons and climate changes affect spatial variations in NDVI values. This study focuses on the basins of the rivers Tinja and Kozlica, located on the Eastern parts of the Maljen Mountain, and characterized by the dominant presence of grassy vegetation. Spatial and temporal changes in plant water supply are monitored using 10-meter Sentinel-2 imagery, and further processed on a monthly basis in QGIS for 2020-2021. For better elaboration of NDVI values basins of these two rivers were delineated into 305 sub-basins, on which further analysis was performed. NDVI data during both years range from &lt; 0.1 - &gt; 0.6. NDVI values change during different seasons, which is consistent with the increase and decrease of water stress during the studied period, which refers to changes in weather conditions during the growing season. In the summer months, the highest values exceed 0.6, and in some cases even 0.8. NDVI values in October and November decrease to 0.3 and 0.5, while in winter months NDVI values are &lt;0.1. NDVI values are higher, and less variable, in sub-basins with woody, partially coniferous vegetation. This study contributes to increasing knowledge about the potential application of remote sensing as well as highresolution Sentinel-2 imagery for monitoring plant water supply because the assessment of drought impact on plant production requires the current monitoring of plant water regime. GIS tools enable the delineation of sub-catchments, which helps to better monitor the spatial variation of NDVI within natural landscape entities. NDVI and other indices are easy to calculate, and therefore, Sentinel-2 can play an important role in future drought early warning systemsand in determining conditions of the vegetation cover.</jats:p>"

When designing urban water supply and sewerage systems, the substantiation of pipeline diameters and velocities of the fresh and sewage water should be carried out. The existing approaches and regulatory requirements provided in SP 31.13330.2012 consider economic factors in terms of reduced costs for the construction and operation of water supply and sewerage systems. However, according to GOST R 587885-2019, the design option should be selected on the basis of its life cycle costs (LLC). In this regard, an LLC-based methodology for calculating the optimal values of pipeline diameters and velocities of the fresh and sewage water in pipelines is proposed. The study specifies the LLC of pipeline water supply and sewerage systems in the form of the flow rate and velocity functions of the transported fresh and sewage water. The first LLC derivative in terms of velocity is taken and set equal to zero. Further, the equation is solved relative to the velocity. As a result, formulas for calculating optimal pipeline velocity values for the fresh and sewage water relative to their LLC are obtained. The conducted numerical experiments demonstrate that the optimal values of fresh and sewage water velocities depend on the values of flow rate and electricity cost, as well as the number of years in the life cycle of water supply and sewerage systems. It is proposed to amend Appendix B of SP 31.13330.2012 by adding a substantiation of pipeline diameters based on the LLC of water supply and sewerage systems.</jats:p>"

For new development areas, including the Yamal Peninsula, there are various energy alternatives. Based on well-known basic approaches, the article presents a procedure for formalising the analysis of alternatives mostly using qualitative initial data. At the pre-project stage, only limited and fuzzy information (predominantly in the form of expert opinions) is accessible. To achieve the set goal, six criteria for export assessment were selected and further processed using fuzzy multicriteria decision-making models based on fuzzy multicriteria analysis of alternatives in order to formalise logical reasoning with vague or imprecise statements. Due to insufficient measurements for constructing fuzzy sets, linguistic estimates of intuitive or logical pairwise comparisons were formalised using the Bellman–Zadeh model, the Saaty scale and the construction of membership functions. The fuzzy set was obtained by finding the eigenvector and the largest eigenvalue for the pairwise comparison matrix. Implementation of the maximin criterion along with the concession matrix allowed us to distinguish between alternatives when obtaining the same or similar estimates. As a result, the study showed the priority of diversification of primary energy source to provide useful energy to consumers in Yamal. According to the model, the most preferable source is atomic energy. In second place are gas turbine technologies, which are significantly ahead of wind energy sources. Diesel generators are considered the least favourable. Thus, the results of fuzzy modelling correspond with the explanatory factors of choice. The fuzzy set method with the transformation of linguistic estimates into quantitative ones can also be included in the apparatus of multicriteria selection with respect to combined options. The research findings can be used to prepare comprehensive strategies and schemes for location of industries and the energy infrastructure in remote Arctic territories.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer wholesales new products through the traditional retail channel and distributes remanufactured products via 3P. We focus on establishing the dynamic Stackelberg game models for nondelayed and delayed cases, respectively. The existence and local stability of Nash equilibrium are examined as well as the complex dynamical behaviors of each model under various scenarios are investigated by numerical simulations, such as stability region, bifurcations, chaos, strange attractors, and so on. Moreover, the impacts of some key parameters on the performance of chain members are analyzed. In addition, the variable feedback control method is utilized to eliminate the system chaos. The results reveal that the high value of the consumer discount perception for remanufactured products and excessively fast price adjustment speed have a destabilization effect on the Nash equilibrium point. In addition, adopting delay decisions by manufacturer does not always make the system more stable because it can exert either positive or negative effect on the system’s stability, while an intermediate delay weight is conducive to the system have a higher chance to stay stable. Furthermore, the manufacturer’s profits will be declined significantly while the profits of retailer and 3P will be elevated to some extent when the system falls into periodic and chaotic motions, so chaos is not always necessarily detrimental to all the decision makers in the dual-channel CLSC. </jats:p>",

It is shown that safety and efficiency of power supply, as well as the hazard of electric shock in the electrical installations with a voltage of 6 kV, largely depends on the number of single-phase earth faults. It is established that high earth fault currents make it necessary to compensate for capacitive currents in 6 kV networks by installing compensating (arc-quenching) reactive coils. This will allow to reduce the ground fault currents to 3–5 A, increase the network insulation impedance by a factor of 4–6, reduce the over-voltages in the undamaged phases during ground faults, and improve conditions of ensuring electrical safety. It is substantiated that at the sections of the cable network leading to substations 25, 26, 28 and «Stvol», the resistance level is higher than the average for the high mountain mine, and in the sections of substations 31–35 and substation 33 it is slightly lower than the average. The worst state of insulation (maximum leaks) is observed at the sections of substations 31–106 and 31–34, where the insulation level is lower than the average by 16.6 and 3.56 times, respectively.  It is recommended to carry out a preventive check of not only the condition of the cable, but also cable couplings, equipment at substations 31, 34 and 106 at these sites. And in the future, to continue study on high earth fault currents in the absence of control over the continuity of the earth network. Recommendations are given to improve the operation of electrical networks, to make fuller use of existing networks, and to ensure safe conditions for the maintenance of electrical installations of the networks with a voltage of 6 kV of the high mountain mine.</jats:p>",

And if the design of the pump with high flow is solved by increasing its dimensions - is an engineering problem, then increase the flow while maintaining its dimensions, ie increase the specific flow and specific power of the pump is a rather difficult scientific problem.  Using the dimensionless GCUR - it is possible to estimate easily advantages of gearing of any two pairs of gear wheels on giving.From the dependences we see that the GCUR does not depend on the gearing module, which is an unexpected result, because it is known that the module plays a major role in increasing the supply of the pump. It is known that the gearing module plays the role of a scale factor, that is, with the growth of the module increases the RON, but the overall dimensions and weight of the pump increase. Therefore, increasing the RON by increasing the gearing module has its limitations, moreover, this method of increasing the feed is not able to increase the specific feed, and therefore does not increase the technical level of the pump on this parameter The results of the above studies, as well as production experience, show that the most significant effect on the volume utilization of the gear rings has the number of teeth of the pump gears. At the same time, reducing the number of teeth helps to increase the utilization rate of the gear rings. The minimum number of gear teeth z = 8 currently in use in the industry is teeth, which is the classic number of teeth of pump gears with an average value of working volume –q = 32…50 см3.</jats:p>",

Based on the manufacture directing Stackelberg game theory, this research looks into three different green advertising decisions (noncooperative, unilateral cooperative, and bilateral cooperative) under wholesale price contract, revenue‐sharing contract, and financial support contract in the O2O CLSC. The results show that the bilateral cooperative incentive strategy always makes both the manufacturer and the retailer invest more in green advertising efforts and increase profits. Without affecting sales, implementing the bilateral cooperative incentive mechanism under the financial support contract is the best strategy to mitigate channel conflict, promote Pareto improvement, and ultimately achieve sustainable development goals.</jats:p>",

However, there is a serious imbalance between the supply of UERSs and the demand of residents in many big, rapidly developing cities. Previous studies usually used indicators such as scale or quantity to measure the supply level of UERS enjoyed by residents, ignoring its own quality differences. Therefore, taking the urban development area of Wuhan as the research object, we measured the quality of UERS from four dimensions using the entropy method and designed a method to measure the supply service level under the hierarchical travel threshold to analyze the supply level of UERSs based on a community unit. Finally, combined with the demand characteristics of different groups, the matching relationship between supply and demand of UERSs in each community is quantitatively analyzed. The results show the following: (1) The quality of UERS in urban development area of Wuhan varies greatly and its distribution is extremely uneven. (2) The level of supply services and the demand level vary greatly, and the overall performance has a trend of decreasing from the city center to the periphery. (3) The overall matching relationship between supply and demand of UERS is not ideal, and more than half of the communities are in supply deficit or without services. Our study provides a novel perspective on quantifying the supply–demand relationship of UERS. It can more accurately guide decision-makers and planners in determining areas with mismatches between the supply and demand of UERSs and in making targeted layouts of UERSs and relevant policies.</jats:p>"

Laboratory analysis of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters of stored RWH samples (hand dug well and drinking vessels) were also carried out. Findings show that rural, poor and deprived women suffered consistent water stress and shortage in dry seasons and this accounts for 84% of them being dependent on stored rainwater harvesting. Findings show that RWH stored water is unfit for drinking and has health risks with high possibilities; it causes cholera and typhoid repeatedly in children.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the article, measures to increase the ecological safety of population drinking water supply due to the use of Buchak-Kaniv aquifer groundwater from urban water intakes in Eastern Ukraine have been developed.   The ecological consequences of man-made intervention in Buchak-Kaniv aquifer drinking groundwater at the research territory have been assessed. The main pollutant elements of these groundwater have been traced. Water intakes (Poltava, Karlivka, Krasnograd, Lubny, Khorol, Reshetylivka), where the ecological consequences of technogenic intervention in the underground hydrosphere are the greatest, since here the target groundwater is partially or completely unsuitable for drinking purposes, have been identified. The key role of technogenesis (intensification of groundwater withdrawal and expansion of water intakes network; as a result – changes in the hydrodynamic conditions of operational aquifers and formation of their regional depression funnels) in these processes has been established. It is emphasized that the increased content of investigated pollutant elements in systematically consumed drinking water has a colossal effect on the human body, which can be expressed in a number of serious diseases.   In the paper, measures have been developed to minimize the established ecological consequences of technogenesis of Buchak-Kaniv aquifer drinking groundwater to increase the ecological safety of population drinking water supply from the Poltava city agglomeration water intakes, which are strategically important for the studied region. The system of groundwater hydrogeochemical monitoring at the region water intakes has been improved for the conditions of filtration of pollutants from the surface or their migration from below in the zones affected by tectonic faults associated with salt diapirs. This significantly shortens the time and reduces the cost of works in comparison with a full complex of hydrogeochemical studies within the entire territory. The allocation of promising areas for the construction of new water intakes to solve the problem of drinking groundwater lack of acceptable quality within the research territory has been substantiated. Estimated resources of high-quality drinking groundwater in a radius of 40 km around the Poltava city, the involvement of which will allow providing high-quality drinking water to the population of this urban agglomeration. The optimal general water withdrawal at the Poltava water intakes to stabilize the content of polluting elements in the composition of Buchak-Kaniv aquifer groundwater within different parts of the city has been justified.</jats:p>"

Our findings showed variation in the characteristics of blood donation and supply among the centers surveyed, as some of these centers were adversely affected, while others showed an increase in the availability of blood products during the pandemic. For example, Jeddah’s center was significantly affected by COVID‐19 lockdown whereas Hail’s center showed a significant increase in the analyzed characteristics of blood donation services in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, there was no major difference among the surveyed centers between 2020 and 2019, and this might be due to the effective management of blood supply and transfusion. <jats:italic>Discussion</jats:italic>. Although blood supply and transfusion practice was slightly affected at various degree among the surveyed centers, the whole process did not show a significant effect on the overall outcome.

Simulation of soil water dynamics in field conditions becomes necessary to understand changes of soil water conditions to develop irrigation guidelines. In this study, three models including Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN), and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) were used to simulate the soil water content in the 0–14 cm and 14–33 cm soil layers across the Taihu Lake region of China. Rainfall, evaporation, temperature, humidity and wind speed that affect soil water content changes were considered in the BP-ANN and LS-SVM, but not in ARIMA. The results showed that the variability of soil water content in the 0–14 cm soil layer was greater than that in 14–33 cm. Correlation coefficients (r) of soil water content between simulations and observations were highest (0.9827) using LS-SVM in the 14–33 cm soil layer, while they were the lowest (0.7019) using ARIMA in the 0–14 cm soil layer; but no significant difference in r values was observed between the two soil layers with the BP-ANN model. Compared with the other two models, the LS-SVM model seems to be more accurate for forecasting the dynamics of soil moisture. The results suggested that agro-climatic data can be used to predict the severity of soil drought stress and provide guidance for irrigation to increase crop production in the Taihu Lake region of China.</jats:p>",

With the consideration of multiple objectives and constraints, this paper proposes a constrained large-scale multi-objective supply chain network (CLMSCN) optimization model. This model is to minimize the total operation cost (including the costs of production, transportation, and inventory) and to maximize the customer satisfaction under the capacity constraints. Besides, a coevolutionary algorithm based on the auxiliary population (CAAP) is proposed, which uses two populations to solve the CLMSCN problem. One population is to solve the original complex problem, and the other population is to solve the problem without any constraints. If the infeasible solutions are generated in the first population, a linear repair operator will be used to improve the feasibility of these solutions. To validate the effectivity of the CAAP algorithm, the experiment is conducted on the randomly generated instances with three different problem scales. The results show that the CAAP algorithm can outperform other compared algorithms, especially on the large-scale instances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

It contributes to constructing the Mars base which will support the deep space exploration. Conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; based on high voltage discharge has the advantages of environmental friendliness, high efficiency and long service life. It has application potential in the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; conversion and utilization of Martian CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resources. We simulate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere of Mars where the pressure is fixed at 1 kPa and the temperature is maintained at room temperature. A comparative study is carried out on the discharge characteristics of two typical electrode structures (with/without barrier dielectric) driven by 20 kHz AC voltage. Combined with numerical simulations, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discharge characteristics, products and their conversion pathways are analyzed. The results show that the discharge mode changes from single discharge during each half cycle into multi discharge pulses after adding the barrier dielectric. Each discharge pulse of the multi pulses corresponds to a random discharge channel, which is induced by the distorted electric field of accumulated charge on the dielectric surface and the space charge. The accumulated charge on the dielectric surface promotes the primary discharge and inhibits the secondary discharge. Space charge will be conducive to the occurrence of secondary discharge.

The proposed study focuses on identifying possible civil legal ways to protect the rights of participants in trade, violated due to the application of economic sanctions or counter-sanctions to one of the parties to the contract of international sale. The aim of the study is to identify mechanisms for protecting the rights of the Russian buyer under the contract for the supply of foreign goods, which are the recognition of the transaction as invalid and the termination of the contract. Within the framework of the aim, the following objectives are to be achieved: (1) to assess the legality and integrity of the conduct of the foreign supplier and the Russian buyer in the performance of contractual obligations; (2) to determine how to protect the rights of the buyer in case of delivery of goods prohibited for import into the territory of Russia, and, as a result, seized by customs authorities; (3) to identify the substantive grounds for claims that may be brought against a foreign supplier. The subject of the study is the scientific and practical substantiation of the requirements of the Russian buyer to a foreign supplier to declare the transaction concluded between them invalid, as well as to terminate the contract due to improper performance by the supplier of its obligations. On the basis of a synthesis of the latest jurisprudence, the author made recommendations on what way to protect the violated rights of the buyer should be chosen in a specific situation. So, according to the author, the buyer, to whom the goods of the country of origin prohibited for import into the territory of Russia are delivered, should, as a matter of priority, sue the supplier to invalidate the transaction as circumvented by the law due to the contradiction of its content to the super-imperial norms of Russian law. This will allow the buyer to recover in restitution all losses caused by such a delivery. In the absence of legal grounds for invalidating the transaction, the Russian buyer is further entitled to demand the termination of this contract, since the fact of the loss of the opportunity for the buyer to acquire ownership of goods delivered from abroad and seized by customs authorities indicates the supplier's improper performance of its contractual obligations.</jats:p>"

At thermal power more than 7 kW, there is a shortage of heat-radiating surfaces. The problem can be solved in three directions: increasing the temperature of the radiating surface; unfolding additional surfaces; utilization of thermal energy in the organic Rankine cycle. The key link in the implementation of the cycle is the modeling and design of a low-potential jet microturbine. When modeling the working process of such a turbine, a preliminary assessment of energy losses during the formation of a circumferential flow at the impeller inlet is necessary. One of the parameters determining part of the losses is the velocity coefficient φu . This work is devoted to the theoretical substantiation and method of experimental determination of the coefficient in the range of geometric and regime parameters of the tangential supply of a subsonic centripetal turbine.</jats:p>"

To explore the cross-layer transmission path and influencing factors of viral aerosol, we set up different scenarios to carry out simulation experiments. The results showed that the air in the polluted room can enter the corridor by opening the door to take food and move out the garbage, then mix with the fresh air taken from the outside as part of the air supply of the central air conditioning system and re-enter into different rooms on the same floor leading to the same-layer transmission. In addition, flushing the toilet after defecation and urination will produce viral aerosol that pollutes rooms on different floors through the exhaust system and the vertical drainage pipe in the bathroom, resulting in cross-layer vertical transmission, also aggravating the transmission in different rooms on the same floor after mixing with the air of the room and entering the corridor to become part of the air supply, and meanwhile, continuing to increase the cross-layer transmission through the vertical drainage pipe. Therefore, the air conditioning and ventilation system of the quarantine hotel should be operated in full fresh air mode and close the return air; the exhaust volume of the bathroom should be greater than the fresh air volume. The exhaust pipe of the bathroom should be independently set and cannot be interconnected or connected in series. The riser of the sewage and drainage pipeline of the bathroom should maintain vertical to exhaust independently and cannot be arbitrarily changed to horizontal pipe assembly.</jats:p>"

Firstly, this paper summarizes 12 risk factors of SCF business, establishes a Risk Assessment Index System (RAIS) with good consistency and stability; then, the principles of Backpropagation (BP) Neural Network (NN) is expounded together with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model. Consequently, a CRE model is implemented by the NN tools in MATLAB based on the collection of multiple groups of SCF-oriented risk assessment samples. Subsequently, the assessment samples are trained and tested. Finally, the SCF-oriented CRE model is proposed and verified. The results show that the BP-GA model has presented high prediction consistency with the actual classification. According to the comparison of classification results of SVM, BP model, and BP-GA model, the classification accuracy of test samples of the proposed Internet-based SCF-oriented CRE system using BP-GA model reaches 97.19%; the Type I and Type II error rate of the CRE system based on BP-GA model is 7.2% and 14.21%, respectively. Therefore, a suitable SCF-oriented CRE method is put forward for China’s commercial banks along with scientific and feasible suggestions to manage SCF-oriented credit risks more reasonably and effectively.</jats:p>"

In this study, from the point of view of economic costs and portability, we have employed atmospheric air as the working gas in order to investigate the effects of the rate of flow, applied voltage, frequency, and pulse width on the characteristics of discharge. The concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in a plasma-activated medium (PAM) were characterized in order to explore their chemical activity. In addition, the inactivating effect of tumor cells induced by an air plasma jet was investigated and the corresponding inactivation mechanism is also discussed. The results showed that the discharge intensity was positively correlated with frequency and voltage, and negatively correlated with pulse width. Regarding the gas flow rate, when the air flow rate was 1 standard liter per minute (SLM), the discharge intensity was strongest according to the length of the plume. By summarizing the discharge characteristics and emission spectra under different experimental parameters, the stable treatment conditions producing rich active substances were as follows: a frequency of 6 kHz, a voltage of 14 kV, a gas flow rate of 1 SLM, and a pulse width of 1 μs. Furthermore, under these stabilized conditions, the air plasma jet produced rich aqueous RONS in a PAM effectively, which killed cells in significant numbers and reduced the cell survival rate. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential application of an atmospheric PAM for the treatment of tumor cells and promotes a deeper understanding of plasma liquid chemistry.</jats:p>",

Os resultados demonstraram estagnação do gasto público em saúde, redução do gasto público per capita e do acesso aos serviços públicos de saúde. Contrariamente, em um contexto de queda da renda e do emprego, os planos de saúde mantiveram clientes, ampliaram as receitas, os lucros e a produção assistencial. O desempenho positivo das empresas, antes e a partir da crise, pode ser explicado pela tendência de manutenção de subsídios públicos para o setor privado e pelas estratégias empresariais financeirizadas. Conclui-se que a atuação do Estado brasileiro durante a crise aprofundou a restrição de recursos ao setor público e favoreceu a expansão dos serviços privados, o que contribuiu para aumentar a discrepância no acesso a serviços públicos e privados de saúde no país.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance Currently, frequency converters with diode rectifiers are very often used in conveyor drive systems. However, frequency converters generate current harmonics, adversely affecting the quality of the network and the durability of electrical equipment. In the electric drive system, the induction motor consumes the reactive power of the source, which causes losses in the network and reduces the power factor at the input of the converter. Therefore, for the electric drive system, it is necessary to analyze methods for improving the power factor and reducing harmonic distortion of the current in the network. The reactor frequency converter has a simple structure but does not have high efficiency. A frequency converter with a multi-pulse rectifier will use multiple rectifier circuits in combination with a transformer to eliminate high order harmonics. The reactor frequency converter has a simple structure but does not have high efficiency. A frequency converter with a multi-pulse rectifier will use multiple rectifier circuits in combination with a transformer to eliminate high order harmonics. The active filter method will produce current waves of the same amplitude but opposite phase angle to the harmonics generated by the load, which eliminates most high-order harmonics and can compensate for reactive power. Aim of research Improving the energy efficiency of the conveyor electric drive with minimizing its impact on the quality of the electric power of the quarry network through the use of active rectifiers with a direct power control system in multi-inverter frequency converters. Research methods In this study, the following methods were used: the study of scientific literature, computer simulation performed in the MatLab software package. Results The frequency converters use active rectifiers with direct control of active and reactive power, the power factor is close to unity, and the energy exchange occurs in two directions between the motor and the network. The article compares the effectiveness of methods when considering a system of the frequency-controlled electric drive of conveyors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers a retailer-manufacturer dual-channel supply chain (DCSC) consisting of a retail channel and a direct sale channel. Previous literature has shown that either asymmetric reference effect (ARE) or information sharing (IS) significantly impacts customers’ demand, then the channel members’ pricing decisions. As yet, no literature has examined the joint effect of both on the channel members’ pricing decisions, especially in a DCSC. To fill up the deficiency, we first explore and compare the pricing decisions in a centralized and a decentralized DCSC with ARE, respectively, with and without IS, using the Stackelberg game and two-stage optimization technique. Then we evaluate the values of ARE and IS by introducing model misspecification and numerical experiments. We find that substantial revenue will be lost if the retailer ignores ARE when information is shared than not shared, especially when the channel members are pessimistic about the market. A higher reference price or a weaker ARE induces the channel members to increase prices, and make IS more valuable to them. Besides, whether the information is shared or not, channel members generally underestimate revenues under a relatively high reference price, while overestimating the revenues under a relatively small reference price. Furthermore, the manufacturer conditionally accepts the IS while the retailer always accepts it.</jats:p>",

Trypanosomes were detected in all the infected pigs and the first detection was between 10 and 14 days post infection (dpi). TL results showed that infected pigs developed antibodies against the three VATs. The first antibody detections by TL occurred between 14 and 21 dpi for antibodies directed against LiTat 1.6, 21 and 168 dpi for antibodies directed against LiTat 1.5 and 70, and 182 dpi for antibodies directed against LiTat 1.3.

Although the concept of I4.0 was not popularised in the ratification of the 2030 Agenda, I4.0 is a watershed in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It can serve as a platform for the alignment of the SDGs with the ongoing digital transformation. However, the challenges to the integration of I4.0 and sustainability in OSCM, and the benefits of this integration, in line with the SDGs, remain unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of a standard structure that establishes links between these challenges and benefits to strategically guide organisations on the journey towards a sustainable OSCM 4.0 (S-OSCM4.0) aligned with the SDGs. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose an S-OSCM4.0 framework for organisations to attain sustainability and I4.0 in OSCM, in line with the 2030 Agenda. Based on a systematic literature review, 48 articles that complied with the selection criteria were analysed using content analysis. The research findings were synthesised into taxonomies of challenges and benefits, and these categories were linked into a step-by-step framework, following an inductive approach. The proposed framework represents a novel artefact that integrates taxonomies in order to holistically achieve sustainable digitalisation for people, prosperity and planet benefits, and sheds light on the potential contributions of S-OSCM4.0 to the SDGs.</jats:p>"

We instantiate this theory in four supply chain contexts to validate and revise the proposed design in two rounds. We identify six system components data collection, energy monitoring, supply chain coordination, ECMS workflow engine, reporting, and carbon footprint estimator that integrate and coordinate four types of information flows (transactional, contextual, energy, and product environmental), and formulate design principles. Our evaluation indicates that the ECMS design theory, if instantiated, supports energy and carbon measurement and environmentally aware decision-making and practice in supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With a Fourth Industrial Revolution making inroads, encompassing all sectors of the industry with numerous concepts of disruptive technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics and 3D Printing we have barely scratched the surface of its Scope, Implication, and Applications in various branches of the Construction Industry. This research aims to investigate the potential of Blockchain technology in the context of Smart Contracts and Supply chain management (SCM) applications in the construction sector. Most of the time, cost overruns have been attributed to the sluggish pace of contractual impediments or inefficacy of material and machinery procurement processes. The executive of material and data stream is a crucial need for development organizations. Effective execution in these regions can give significant benefits and permit more main incentives for customers. The industry is regularly censured for being delayed to grasp the change it needs and at the exact moment has been referred to as ready for the interruption because of the intricacy of work and a sheer number of guidelines and gauges, trust and check issues in regards to consistency to work principles still loom to a great extent. The momentum built by BIM infusion in the industry could be leveraged to bring Blockchain technology to the fore to mitigate Information Asymmetry by -distributing information to generate decentralized consensus building among various stakeholders involved.</jats:p>"

The following two outsourcing strategies that are currently implemented by OEM are considered: consignment and turnkey. Under the consignment strategy, the OEM procures the components from the supplier and then outsources the product manufacturing to the CM. Under the turnkey strategy, the OEM outsources the component procurement and product manufacturing to the CM and CM procures the components from the supplier. We compare the quality level and two outsourcing strategies under non-competitive scenario in which the CM does not have its own brand products and competitive scenario in which the CM sells its own brand production. It is shown that, in the non-competitive scenario, OEM prefers the turnkey strategy than the consignment strategy in the low-carbon supply chain. In the competitive scenario, the OEM’s outsourcing strategy depends on the CM’s quality investment cost coefficient.</jats:p>",

The contradictory forecast data and the reasons that cause them are determined. The necessity and possibility of carrying out forecast estimates of labor force supply and demand according to the scenarios of development of the national economy are substantiated. According to forecast estimates, changes in employment by certain types of economic activity in 2025-2030 according to the inertial and targeted scenarios are computed, the consequences of their implementation and the impact on the supply and demand of labor force are defined. The ratios of the demand and supply of labor force and the employed population in the labor market for 2025 and the excess number of employed population in different scenarios of economic development are determined. It is concluded that if the inertial scenario is implemented without accelerated digitalization, the supply of labor force will be 7% more than demand. With the implementation of modern digital and information-communication technologies, almost 29.1% of the potential supply of labor force may remain outside employment. Subject to significant economic growth, taking into account the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), without accelerated digitalization, the demand and supply of labor force will practically be balanced according to the results of computations. Taking into account the implementation of digital and information-communication technologies, the surplus of labor force among the employed can reach 20.9% of the total supply. It is noted that imbalance in the labor market, which arises under the conditions of the implementation of intensive digitalization processes, along with other social risks in the field of employment, will be accompanied by an increase in the volume of labor migration. Attention is focused on the assumption that without the introduction of modern information and digital technologies, Ukraine can remain on the sidelines of world economic and scientific-technological progress, while under such conditions the implementation of the target scenario will be practically impossible</jats:p>"

Based on the carbon tax policy, this study discusses a dual-channel supply chain consisting of one manufacturer, one online retailer, and one offline retailer. Considering retailers’ bidirectional fairness concerns, the optimal carbon emission reduction strategy and the optimal pricing strategy of centralized and decentralized decision-making are discussed under consumers’ channel preference, respectively. On this basis, a coordination contract is proposed to realize the Pareto improvement of the dual-channel supply chain. We find that dual-channel retailers’ profits and prices are negatively correlated with the horizontal fairness concern coefficient and positively correlated with the vertical fairness concern coefficient. The profit of the manufacturer, the carbon emission reduction, and the bargaining power of consumers are all positively correlated with the horizontal fairness concern coefficient and negatively correlated with the vertical fairness concern coefficient. Maintaining an appropriate service level can maximize the profits of enterprises and positively affect the development of enterprises. Through the coordination contract, the supply chain can be promoted to form a win-win mode of complementary advantages.</jats:p>",

Based on the method of structural characteristics, the component capacities of the national market of fish and fish products were calculated. A methodical approach was chosen for calculation based on the real and potential capacity of regional markets using the index of their purchasing power, the functioning of which is determined by the availability of infrastructure throughout the territory of Ukraine for the cultivation of a wide range of commercial aquaculture. This allows you to adjust the volume of product sales, assess the level of consumption of fishery products, build a marketing strategy, import substitution for manufacturers and importers, adjust the assortment, choose a price policy, determine the market share of any manufacturer and its competitive position. The dynamics of the catch of aquatic bioresources in the Ukrainian Black Sea region by fishing areas and regions are shown. The supply of commercial aquaculture and import-export trends in the fishing industry were evaluated. An assessment of the level of dependence on imports was carried out using data from European, state, industry and customs statistics, which made it possible to identify certain gaps in the statistical representation of the development of the industry. The option of reducing import dependence due to the development of the country's aquaculture activities is substantiated. The characteristics of the fishing industry of Ukraine according to the most imported types of fish products are given. Measures to intensify fishing activities to meet the needs of the population with fish and fish products and the development of an import substitution program are proposed, since the quality of products entering the national market does not meet the standards of safe consumption.</jats:p>"

A Water Safety Plan (WSP) ensures drinking water safety through this approach. In this study, risk factors are initially identified and evaluated. Then control and corrective measures are determined to reduce or eliminate health and environmental hazards of rural water supply systems in Khorramshahr City, Iran, according to the guidelines of the WSP provided by the World Health Organization. Methods: This research is a descriptive cross-sectional study in which rural water supply systems in Khorramshahr were studied using the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk systematic method. The Risk Priority Number (RPN) was calculated to determine the risk level after identifying 14 risk factors using experts’ opinions. Then, control and corrective measures were considered for medium, high, and very high-level risk factors. Results: The evaluation results of 14 risk factors identified in the distribution network and point of consumption indicated that 71.5% of them were at the medium risk level and 28.5% at the high (critical) risk level. After determining control and corrective measures, 92.9% of risk factors reached the medium (manageable) level and 7.1% the critical level. Conclusion: This result indicates that water safety guidelines can replace traditional methods of inspection and process control, and significant improvements can be achieved with the help of risk assessment by the FMEA method and step-by-step implementation of the WSP as an essential evolutionary solution for preventive measures and reducing the level of existing risks.</jats:p>"

In contrast to generic foods, branded foods are marked by rapid changes in the food supply because of reformulations, the introduction of new foods, and the removal of existing ones from the market. Also, different branded foods are available in different countries. This not only complicates the compilation of branded foods datasets but also causes such datasets to become out of date quickly. In this review, we present different approaches to the compilation of branded foods datasets, describe the history and progress of building and updating such datasets in Slovenia, and present data to support nutrition research and monitoring of the food supply. Manufacturers are key sources of information for the compilation of branded foods databases, most commonly through food labels. In Slovenia, the branded food dataset is compiled using standard food monitoring studies conducted at all major retailers. Cross-sectional studies are conducted every few years, in which the food labels of all available branded foods are photographed. Studies are conducted using the Composition and Labeling Information System (CLAS) infrastructure, composed of a smartphone application for data collection and online data extraction and management tool. We reviewed various uses of branded foods datasets. Datasets can be used to assess the nutritional composition of food in the food supply (i.e., salt, sugar content), the use of specific ingredients, for example, food additives, for nutrient profiling, and assessment of marketing techniques on food labels. Such datasets are also valuable for other studies, for example, assessing nutrient intakes in dietary surveys. Additional approaches are also being tested to keep datasets updated between food monitoring studies. A promising approach is the exploitation of crowdsourcing through the mobile application VešKajJeš, which was launched in Slovenia to support consumers in making healthier dietary choices.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the work was to analyze the dynamics of indicators of energy security and power supply capacity of agricultural organizations in the Republic of Belarus. A number of important points and indicators characterizing the current state and potential of Belarusian agricultural production has been considered in the article. It has been established that over the past decade in agricultural organizations of the Republic there has been a decrease in the indicator of energy security by 15 %, and the power supply capacity of labour has increased more than 1,4 times during this time. On the overall efficiency of agricultural and livestock production, on the level of labour productivity in agricultural organizations, indicators of power supply capacity have a very significant and very often decisive impact. Under the conditions of the steady decline in the number of people employed in the agro-industrial complex, the increase in the volume of cultivated areas and, in general, with the increase in the physical volumes of products produced in crop production and animal husbandry, the role of energy-saturated machines, machinery, equipment and their rational use is repeatedly increasing. The requirements for productivity, functionality, efficiency, reliability of agricultural machinery, machines and aggregates are seriously increasing. Only the comprehensive and systematic technical and technological re-equipment of agricultural production, its saturation with high-tech, high-performance agricultural machines, complexes and equipment will be able to ensure the significant increase in labour productivity, minimize the expenditures of all types of material, fuel and energy resources and, as the result, maximize the fulfillment of tasks to preserve the country’s food security.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing forms of clustering of production processes in the process of the formation of industrial ecosystems on an international scale, highlighting the role of global supply chains in the value chain in the context of the transformation of economic development models as a factor of reindustrialization, taking into account the latest imperatives of innovation, greening and constancy. It has been established that the ways of creating value do not just depend on the features of the technological process, but, more importantly, they are induced by the structure of the ecosystem in which they are built on the principles of interdependence. The geographic boundaries of an industrial ecosystem are defined by the interdependencies that link organizations within the ecosystem, and by the new bonds that are being strengthened outside of it. The article highlights the need to identify structural gaps in the ecosystem early in order to maximize the benefits of potential collaboration and encourage innovation. It is critically important for governments to define the real boundaries of industrial ecosystems in order to promote their transformation into closed loops of innovation. The definition of an industrial ecosystem is proposed as a multi-level production system, including heterogeneous agents involved in industry value chains and contributing to the realization of the potential of the ecosystem (and its participants) and the development of the country's productive capacity. The place of the supply chain in the value chain has been established, which made it possible to assert that the supply chain is increasingly associated with business functions and processes that go beyond logistics within and between companies. The concepts of clusters and industrial areas are analyzed, which made it possible to single out the role of industrial parks in the development of an industrial cluster. It has been proven that the development of industrial parks contributes to the creation of clusters of competitive industries and the expansion of production chains, which contributes to the balanced economic development of the regions through the mobilization of all available resources. Factors are identified, the combination of which allows the transformation of an industrial zone or a park into an eco-industrial park. The definition of an eco-industrial park is proposed and its alternative names are given, such as: permanent economic zone; low-carbon technological zone; green investment cluster; circular industrial park. The potential of eco-industrial parks in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals has been established. This led to the conclusion that regional systems are evolving from places where firms are located that do not know about each other and simply benefit from economies of scale, to systems that include dynamic training and coordination to enhance regional competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lower reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin (LADB) is one of the typical regions which is facing the problem of water shortage in Central Asia. During the past decades, water resources demand far exceeds that supplied by the mainstream of the Amu Darya River, and has resulted in a continuous decrease in the amount of water flowing into the Aral Sea. Clarifying the dynamic relationship between the water supply and demand is important for the optimal allocation and sustainable management of regional water resources. In this study, the relationship and its variations between the water supply and demand in the LADB from the 1970s to 2010s were analyzed by detailed calculation of multi-users water demand and multi-sources water supply, and the water scarcity indices were used for evaluating the status of water resources utilization. The results indicated that (1) during the past 50 years, the average total water supply (TWS) was 271.88 × 108 m3/y, and the average total water demand (TWD) was 467.85 × 108 m3/y; both the volume of water supply and demand was decreased in the LADB, with rates of −1.87 × 108 m3/y and −15.59 × 108 m3/y. (2) percentages of the rainfall in TWS were increased due to the decrease of inflow from the Amu Darya River; percentage of agriculture water demand was increased obviously, from 11.04% in the 1970s to 44.34% in 2010s, and the water demand from ecological sector reduced because of the Aral Sea shrinking. (3) the supply and demand of water resources of the LADB were generally in an unbalanced state, and water demand exceeded water supply except in the 2010s; the water scarcity index decreased from 2.69 to 0.94, indicating the status changed from awful to serious water scarcity. A vulnerable balanced state has been reached in the region, and that water shortages remain serious in the future, which requires special attention to the decision-makers of the authority.</jats:p>"

In areas with limited water sources, rainwater harvesting (RWH) can improve the availability of potable water. Due to RWH flexibility and applying different criteria, it can be used in various settings, making RWH a viable option for local communities. Within this study, suitable RWH sites were identified based on modern technological approaches (GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)) considering different biophysical criteria selected according to the requirements of the target area environment. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) Model and hydrology tools were used as MCDM and GIS-based decisions, respectively. The proposed methodology was implemented in the target area of 11,772 km2. The obtained land suitability map was divided into five (5) RWH zones: highly suitable (7.84% of the total area), suitable (21.85%), moderately suitable (31.15%), marginally suitable (27.85%), and not suitable (11.31%). The research results show that highly suitable and suitable sites (3,495.47 km2) are located in mountainous zones with good elevation potential, proper valley shapes, and large catchment areas. RWH practices in these areas can be considered as renewable and sustainable alternatives to water demand saturation. In addition to being a solution in terms of providing water to water-scarce areas, RWH installations represent a good climate change response and water resource management means.</jats:p>"

This study constructs an operational safety risk analysis model based on fuzzy VIKOR-FMEA. First, the expert team used linguistic variables to evaluate the severity of each failure mode (S), frequency of occurrence (O), and difficulty of detection (D) in the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). Then, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the maximal deviation approach were integrated to carry out risk factor weights. The risk factor weight analysis matrix integrates the subjective and objective weights to obtain the comprehensive weights of the risk factors. Secondly, VIKOR is introduced to improve the traditional FMEA model and is used to calculate the risk priority number. The case study shows that untimely flood protection, irregular maintenance, and untimely emergency response are in the top order. Finally, it is compared with the traditional FMEA method, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and provides a reference algorithm for risk analysis of operation management for the water diversion project.</jats:p>",

From these analyses we observed: (1) maternal obesity affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome distinctly; (2) female fetal heart lipidomes are more sensitive to maternal obesity than males; (3) changes in lipid supply might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts exposed to maternal obesity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid global rise of COVID-19 from late 2019 caught major manufacturers of RT-qPCR reagents by surprise and threw into sharp focus the heavy reliance of molecular diagnostic providers on a handful of reagent suppliers. In addition, lockdown and transport bans, necessarily imposed to contain disease spread, put pressure on global supply lines with freight volumes severely restricted. These issues were acutely felt in New Zealand, an island nation located at the end of most supply lines. This led New Zealand scientists to pose the hypothetical question: in a doomsday scenario where access to COVID-19 RT-qPCR reagents became unavailable, would New Zealand possess the expertise and infrastructure to make its own reagents onshore? In this work we describe a review of New Zealand's COVID-19 test requirements, bring together local experts and resources to make all reagents for the RT-qPCR process, and create a COVID-19 diagnostic assay referred to as HomeBrew (HB) RT-qPCR from onshore synthesized components. This one-step RT-qPCR assay was evaluated using clinical samples and shown to be comparable to a commercial COVID-19 assay. Through this work we show New Zealand has both the expertise and, with sufficient lead time and forward planning, infrastructure capacity to meet reagent supply challenges if they were ever to emerge.</jats:p>"

Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer were registered, and central laboratory testing was used to stratify their tumour into molecular subtypes. Following 16 weeks of first-line therapy, patients with stable or responding disease were eligible for randomisation into either a molecularly stratified sub-trial (FOCUS4-B, C or D) or non-stratified FOCUS4-N. The primary outcome for all studies was progression-free survival comparing the intervention with active monitoring/placebo.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance Space exploration with the help of automatic spacecraft — satellites for various purposes, deep space exploration devices, has been going on for decades. Despite this, even with the current level of reliability, spacecraft fail without having exhausted the entire period of active existence. The basic part, the so-called platform of the spacecraft, as a rule, consists of its life-supporting systems: a temperature control system, an orientation system, a propulsion system, an on-board computer control system. A failure in the operation of each of them leads to an emergency situation on board, but it is enough for any part of the power supply system to fail so that the device eventually turns out to be completely inoperable. In this regard, the power supply system of the spacecraft must be subjected to high-quality ground testing, undergo several stages of testing, from autonomous to complex as part of the spacecraft. In order to confirm the predicted reliability and operability of the spacecraft power supply system, the nominal and limit modes of its operation should be simulated in ground conditions. But, for obvious reasons, the use of on-board solar and battery batteries in ground conditions, as well as the entire complex of service and useful electrical loads, is difficult and ineffective. Therefore, in order to carry out a full-fledged ground experimental testing, a special class of control and verification equipment is used – hardware and software complexes that simulate the operating modes of the power supply system, consisting of simulators of solar, rechargeable batteries and onboard electrical load, automated connection control systems. Aim of research To bring the structure of the digital twin of the spacecraft power supply system and implement a computer model of the digital twin to automate the tasks of designing, developing and ground testing of the power supply system. Research methods The method of component circuits, methods of system analysis. Results The structure of the digital twin of the spacecraft power supply system is given. A computer model of a digital double has been implemented in the domestic environment of multilevel computer modeling of MARS.

Reducing energy consumption for housing, heat and water supply, and lighting services should be considered as reducing energy costs. The trouble-free operation of the equipment is of the utmost importance. Its resource on many utilities has a minimum margin of safety. Centralized analysis of the equipment control, accounting of motor resources and, accordingly, timely preventive work allow extending the service life of many components of engineering systems in the utility sector, transport, and industry. These problems are solved by distributed systems of automated control of engineering equipment, including control systems of the hot water supply scheme for modern new buildings. In modern new buildings, there is used a scheme of hot water supply (HWS) with two circulating pumps and the HWS regulator. The control cabinet, developed in the IMMSP of the NAS of Ukraine, is made on the basis of the MRTP-7 controller with the corresponding software consisting of gen-eral and special purpose programs. The article considers the principles of building a control sys-tem for hot water supply, considers the software functions of the system, presents a mathemati-cal model of the HWS system, describes a laboratory test site for testing algorithms for HWP control and modeling the HWS control process.

The improvement of soil structure and the optimization of soil nutrient levels provide a good environment for high yield and high efficiency of maize. Therefore, three field experiments were carried out over a three-year period (2018–2020) to study the effects of straw returning on photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield of maize 'Xianyu 335' under two different fertilization methods and four potassium application levels. The results showed that straw returning and potassium application had significant effects on the above indicators. The above indicators were significantly improved by deep tillage straw returning compared with no tillage straw returning. Increasing potassium supply can promote the effect of straw returning. The photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield parameters of maize treated with straw returning and deep tillage combined with 60 kg/hm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> potassium fertilizer (SFK60) reached the highest in the three harvest seasons.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The translational sprinkler irrigation machine is widely used because of its high degree of automation, less manual investment, and convenient movement. However, when using the sprinkler irrigation machine, the power supply is difficult to be guaranteed in some remote power shortage areas. Solar energy has become one of the best choices for the power source of sprinkler irrigation machines. An important issue is the optimal sizing of the stand-alone photovoltaic system for a solar-powered translational sprinkler irrigation machine. This work conducts the optimal sizing of the stand-alone photovoltaic system for a solar-powered translational sprinkler irrigation machine considering the loss of power supply probability. Firstly, the self-developed translational sprinkler irrigation machine is introduced. The load power, which includes the driving power of the translational sprinkler irrigation machine, water intake pressure driving power, and the loss power of the controller and sensors, is considered in the calculation process. Subsequently, the photovoltaic generator model and the battery storage model are established. Then, the stand-alone photovoltaic system is optimized considering the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the life cycle cost (LCC). After the solar irradiance and ambient temperature of a typical sunny day in the test area are given, the optimal combination of the PV module and battery is obtained. The optimal sizing result is verified using the PV power, state of charge (SOC), and load power. The presented optimal sizing method is also compared with an existing method. Besides, the operation test of the sprinkler irrigation machine is also carried out to verify the optimal sizing result. The optimal sizing result is proved to be effective and applicable.</jats:p>",

Using the mean variance (MV) method to characterize the risk aversion utility function of the manufacturer and the retailer, the following r are found. i) Consumers' preference for low-carbon products is conducive to raising the price of low-carbon products and the firms' profits. ii) The deepening of the retailer's risk aversion promotes the increase of the manufacturer's price, while the impact of the manufacturer's risk aversion has an opposite effects. Although the arbitrage behavior of the retailer can not be completely avoided in the risk aversion environment. However in a limited risk aversion environment, dual-channel development is conducive to increasing the profits of the manufacturer, but may harm the interests of the retailer. iii) Consumers' preference for online channel helps the manufacturer increase prices and profit. iv) The sharing of revenue by the manufacturer to the retailer is conducive to increasing the revenue of the retailer. Based on this, in order to improve corporate profits and promote long-term transactions, the manufacturer can carry out low-carbon promotion and implement a dual-channel strategy.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the outbreak of gastroenteritis in one of the villages of Kurdistan Province, Iran, from February 1 to 12, 2019. In this period, 149 people developed joint illness and symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, whose information was recorded. Data analysis was done with Stata7 software. Results: The attack rate of the total population in the village was 31.17% (26.5% in men and 36.24% in women). The median age of the patients was 26.5 years. The mean patients’ age on the first days of the outbreak was less than on the other days, and this relationship was statistically significant (P=0.003). The most common symptoms were non-bloody diarrhea (57.71%), vomiting (52.34%), abdominal cramps (26.17%), and nausea (24.83%). According to the shape of the epidemic curve, the outbreak was a community-wide outbreak caused by the norovirus. Conclusion: Based on clinical evidence, epidemiological examination, and human and water samples analyses, outbreaks occurred due to the consumption of drinking water contaminated with norovirus. To prevent similar outbreaks, it is recommended to fix the bugs observed in the water supply system and implement the water safety program.</jats:p>"
