However, little research has analyzed the role of capabilities to mitigate such barriers, a research gap we address in this study using an inductive research approach. Following a Straussian approach to grounded theory, the study analyzes data generated from ten Western green‐tech companies sourcing technically indispensable rare earth metals from Chinese suppliers. Our interpretive research findings show that these companies face two categories of salient, external barriers to<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content>–supply chain structure‐related and environmental standards‐related implementation barriers. To cope with these barriers, we argue that firms require three categories of dynamic capabilities: sensing capabilities, alignment capabilities, and resilience capabilities. By connecting our research findings with the dynamic capabilities literature, we derive theoretical propositions to guide further research on studying the role of dynamic capabilities in the implementation of<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSCM</jats:styled-content>.</jats:p>",

Those that do acknowledge the role of demand fall short of offering a holistic framework that acknowledges the role of both. This paper suggests that it is simply not enough to have flexible manufacturing, distribution and procurement systems to achieve SCA. Flexibility in managing demand is also needed. Furthermore, it is the premise of this paper that demand and supply integration (DSI) inside the firm is critical to achieving SCA. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This research is a systematic, integrative review of the existing literature on the concept of agility.

It illustrates how firms can create and sustain competitive advantages in turbulent environments. Managers can use the framework developed here to assess what structures and decision-making processes they can use to increase the firm’s SCA. Practitioners can use this model as a checklist to identify candidate areas for improving agility. The section illustrating the use of knowledge management to increase DSI should be of particular interest to managers, considering that a great deal of firms experience a disconnect between demand creation and supply fulfillment. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Through a systematic, comprehensive review of multi-disciplinary literature, the paper explores the role of demand management in achieving SCA.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The state of the art on humanitarian supply chain performance management with a focus on measurement frameworks and indicators and their applications in practice is classified in three categories.

Furthermore, the research indicates that performance measurement and management in humanitarian supply chains has to be developed in support of the supply chain strategy. Based on the findings of the literature review on performance measurement and management in the commercial and humanitarian field, a first classification of 94 performance measurement indicators in humanitarian supply chains is presented. Furthermore, the paper shows key problems why performance measurement and management systems have not been widely developed and systematically implemented in humanitarian supply chains and are not part of the supply chain strategy. The authors propose performance measurement guidelines that include input and output criteria. They develop a research agenda that focuses on four research questions for designing, deploying and disseminating performance measurement and management in humanitarian supply chains. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The result helps the humanitarian supply chain community to conduct further research in this area and to develop performance measurement frameworks and indicators that suit humanitarian supply chains. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – It is the first systematic approach to categorize research output regarding performance measurement and management in humanitarian supply chains.

More specifically, the authors aim to answer three questions: “Q1 – What are the factors (e.g. both driving and inhibiting) that influence SCI?”, “Q2 – What are the key developments (e.g. both in research and industry) in SCI area?” and “Q3 – What are the approaches employed/discussed to integrate supply chains?”. Over the past decade, SCI has gained increasing attention in the supply chain management (SCM) context, both from the practitioners’ perspective and as a research area. In realising the global transformations and competitive business environment, a number of organisations are collaborating with their supply chain (SC) partners, to conduct seamless SC operations. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A systematic and structured literature review is carried out to observe and understand the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the SCI research area, evaluate contributions and summarise knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential directions of further research. Thus, to trace the implementation of SCI practices, a profiling approach is used to analyse 293 articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2013) extracted from the Scopus database. The Systematic Review Approach proposed by Tranfield <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>. (2003) was followed to analyse and synthesise the extant literature on SCI area. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant SCI research studies that have contributed to the development and accumulation of intellectual wealth to the SCI and SCM area. Each of the 293 papers was examined for achieving the aim and objectives of the research, the method of data collection, the data analysis method and quality measures. While some of the papers provided information on all of these categories, most of them failed to provide all the information, especially for Q2 and Q3 that resulted in 23 and 21 papers, respectively. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study would have benefited from the analysis of further journals; however, the analysis of 293 articles from leading journals in the field of operations and SCM was deemed sufficient in scope. Moreover, this research has implications for researchers, journal editors, practitioners, universities and research institutions. It is likely to form the basis and motivation for profiling other database resources and specific operations and SCM-type journals in this area. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This systematic literature review highlights a taxonomy of contextual factors driving and inhibiting SCI for researchers and SC practitioners to refer to while researching or implementing SCI. It also exemplifies some areas for future research, along with the need for researchers to focus on developing more practical techniques for implementing SCI and improving organisational performance. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The prime value and uniqueness of this paper lies in analysing and compiling the existing published material in relation to Q1, Q2 and Q3, including examining other variables (such as yearly publications, geographic location of each publication, type of publication, type of research methods used), which lacks in the recent published five SCI literature review-based articles (by Kim, 2013; Leuschner <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., 2013; Alfalla-Luque <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., 2013; Parente <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., 2008; Fabbe-Costes and Jahre, 2007).

To effectively co‐create value, decision makers must manage the three rights of supply chain design: right players, right roles, and right relationships. Doing this well requires managers discern how the unwritten competitive rules are changing as well as determine firm readiness to compete. As part of this analysis, we briefly explore five emerging “game changers” that represent potential supply chain design inflection points: (1) Big Data and predictive analytics, (2) additive manufacturing, (3) autonomous vehicles, (4) materials science, and (5) borderless supply chains. We also consider four forces that impede transformation to higher levels of value co‐creation: (1) supply chain security, (2) failed change management, (3) lack of trust as a governance mechanism, and (4) poor understanding of the “luxury” nature of corporate social responsibility initiatives. How well managers address sociostructural and sociotechnical issues will determine firm survivability and success.</jats:p>",

When a fashion company aims to promote sustainability, the main linkage is to develop a sustainable supply chain. This paper contributes to current knowledge of sustainable supply chain in the textile and clothing industry. We first depict the structure of sustainable fashion supply chain including eco-material preparation, sustainable manufacturing, green distribution, green retailing, and ethical consumers based on the extant literature. We study the case of the Swedish fast fashion company, H&amp;M, which has constructed its sustainable supply chain in developing eco-materials, providing safety training, monitoring sustainable manufacturing, reducing carbon emission in distribution, and promoting eco-fashion. Moreover, based on the secondary data and analysis, we learn the lessons of H&amp;M’s sustainable fashion supply chain from the country perspective: (1) the H&amp;M’s sourcing managers may be more likely to select suppliers in the countries with lower degrees of human wellbeing; (2) the H&amp;M’s supply chain manager may set a higher level of inventory in a country with a higher human wellbeing; and (3) the H&amp;M CEO may consider the degrees of human wellbeing and economic wellbeing, instead of environmental wellbeing when launching the online shopping channel in a specific country.</jats:p>"

Through horizontal drilling and new completion techniques, gas trapped in low permeability tight shales is now accessible. Higher world gas prices have made gas liquefaction economic, facilitating transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to overseas markets. Technology, coupled with supply and demand, has initiated a new generation of mega-projects around the globe. These projects encompass the entire supply chain, from field development to pipelines feeding the LNG facilities, to shipping the product to market. As the global market for natural gas continues to grow, there is tremendous investment potential. However, due to complexities involved, accurate modeling is critical to understand the best investment strategy and to minimize risk.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will explore the intricacies involved in modeling upstream field development and the scenarios required to provide reasonable estimates of the upstream asset that will feed the rest of the LNG chain. We will look at the entire upstream asset from the investor's point of view, including investment required, growth potential, and long-term sustainability. We will compare how different decisions in field selection and development rate impact overall value. This paper will highlight the importance of using technical expertise, high quality data and specialized modeling software to produce a meaningful representation of an upstream development plan.</jats:p>",

These ten represent only a subset of the real possibilities, as felling method was held constant and only a single market (combustion of whole tree chips) was considered. Stages included  in-field, roadside landing, terminal, and conversion plant, and biomass states at each of these included loose whole trees, bundled whole trees or chipped material. Assumptions on prices, performances, and conversion rates were based on field trials and published literature in similar boreal forest conditions. The economic outcome was calculated on the basis of production, handling, treatment and storage costs and losses. Outcomes were tested for robustness on a range of object volumes (50–350 m3solid), extraction distances (50–550 m) and transport distances (10–70 km) using simulation across a set of discrete values. Transport was calculated for both a standard 19.5 m and an extended 24 m timber truck. Results showed that the most expensive chain (roadside bundling, roadside storage, terminal storage and delivery using a 19.5 m timber truck) at 158 € td−1 was 23% more costly than the cheapest chain (roadside chipping and direct transport to conversion plant with container truck), at 128 € td−1. Outcomes vary at specific object volumes and transport distances, highlighting the need to verify assumptions, although standard deviations around mean supply costs for each chain were small (6%–9%). Losses at all stages were modelled, with the largest losses (23 € td−1) occurring in the chains including bundles. The study makes all methods and assumptions explicit and can assist the procurement manager in understanding the mechanisms at work.     </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain network design is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has potential to affect supply chain performance. Increasing regulations for carbon and waste management are forcing firms to consider their supply chains from ecological and social objectives, but in reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them are disrupted from time to time, due to poor weather, natural or manmade disasters or a combination of any other factors. Supply chain systems drop their sustainability objectives while coping with these unexpected disruptions. Hence, the new challenges for supply chain managers are to design an efficient and effective supply chain network that will be resilient enough to bounce back from any disruption and that also should have sufficient vigilance to offer same sustainability under a disruption state. This paper focuses on ecological sustainability, because an environmental focus in a supply chain system is more important and also links with other pillars of sustainability, as the products need to be produced, packed and transported in an ethical way, which should not harm social balance and the environment. Owing to importance of the considered issue, this paper attempts to introduce a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by incorporating (1) sustainability via carbon emissions and embodied carbon footprints and  (2) resilience by incorporating location-specific risks. The proposed goal programming (GP) model optimizes the total cost, while considering the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain network.</jats:p>"

We show that vehicle purchases typically account for an outsized share of the contraction in economic activity during a recession, in part because a concurrent tightening in auto lending conditions makes car purchases less affordable for many households. We explore the link between lending conditions and vehicle purchases with a novel gauge of credit supply conditions—household perceptions of vehicle financing conditions as measured on the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers. In both a vector autoregression estimated on aggregate data and a logit regression estimated on household-level data, this measure indicates that credit conditions are a significant influence on auto sales, as large as factors such as unemployment and income. Estimates from the household-level model show that the new car purchases of households that are more likely to depend on credit are particularly sensitive to assessments of financing conditions, and that households are a bit more likely to purchase vehicles when they expect interest rates to rise in the next year. The results contribute to the literature validating the usefulness of survey measures of household perceptions for forecasting macroeconomic activity.</jats:p>"

We formulated variational inequality in terms of strategies and strategic flows as SCNE conditions.We employed an iterative algorithm of MSA to this variational inequality by solving a dynamic program.A numerical example proves the validity of our model and algorithm,and we show that our algorithm has faster convergence ability than existing algorithms.Moreover,results show that the amount of products and surpluses of SCN increase as traffic link capacity increases.We conclude that improvement of traffic network could enhance the efficiency of SCN.</jats:p>"

Water safety plans (WSPs) use an approach to manage water quality that has shown signs of success with public and communal water supplies, but relatively little research has been done to investigate the application of WSPs to self-supply systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the primary issues surrounding appropriate water quality management of domestic rainwater harvesting (DRWH) systems in Fiji and consider how the principles of WSPs can be applied in this context. A qualitative research design was followed, utilising semi-structured interviews with 34 rural households and six key informants, sanitary inspections of DRWH systems and thematic data analysis. A number of challenges, including limited government resources and the limited knowledge and casual attitudes of rural rainwater consumers, constrain the practicality of adopting conventional WSPs at the household level, but steps for improvement can be taken.</jats:p>",

The voltage waveform in power system is measured by microcontroller, and is compared with the standard sinusoidal voltage waveform and the error voltage is obtained which contains the information of harmonic current waveform. The error voltage is employed to control the input current of the rectifier, and the reverse components of harmonic current is involved in the power side current of the appliance, by this means to get rid of some of the harmonic currents in power grid. Harmonic current will produce a voltage drop on the resistance in power transmission line to make the voltage waveform distortion happen; and the reduction of the harmonic current will shrink the distortion of voltage waveform. Taking a capacitive soft switching flyback push-pull converter as an example, the experimental circuit and the testing system are designed; the software programming and circuit debugging are accomplished. The experimental results show that the smart control rectifier can absorb harmonic currents from the power grid when operating in rectification, and to get the input voltage waveform corrected.</jats:p>"

After determining optimum conditions for the coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation processes in terms of turbidity reduction, jar tests were performed using the same waters seeded with test viruses. For comparison, two other important health-related viruses, poliovirus 1 (PV1) and coliphage MS2, were included in this study. The removal of NV by coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation processes based on RT-PCR assay in this study was 1.5 log10, which was similar to that of PV1 and a little lower than that of coliphage MS2 (2 log10) based on the same RT-PCR assay. The removal of NV in this study (1.5 log10) is considerably higher than the one in a recent study using recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (∼0.7 log10). Overall, the results of this study suggest that human noroviruses can be appreciably reduced by a properly-operated coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation processes and the contamination of drinking water by noroviruses should be controlled by conventional water treatment processes with conventional physico-chemical processes and disinfection.</jats:p>",

This effect particularly occurs when commuting costs reduce labour supply. We examine the hypothesis that commuting costs reduce labour supply in the short-run. In particular, we estimate the effect of commuting time on labour supply in the UK. We account for endogeneity of commuting time by employing exogenous changes in commuting time resulting from firm relocations and changes in infrastructure. Our results cast doubt on the idea that increases in commuting cost reduce labour supply, at least in the short-run. More precisely, we find that females’ labour supply reacts positively to or is unaffected by increases in commuting time, whereas males’ labour supply is unaffected. </jats:p>",

For this purpose, at first all scenarios is discussed and the main constraints, i.e. available budget and time, is considered. In this study the drivers to improve the performance of ASC is select and distribute the best agricultural service packages in the target ASC. All discussed scenarios need a selection procedure. So a multilevel approach is developed to select the best service package for each scenario. All selection methods are based on performance measurement which had been selected in first level of the approach. Fuzzy decision making and Analytic Hierarchy Process have been used for the approach. A numerical example is solved at the end of the paper to show the capability of the approach and comparing the scenarios.</jats:p>",

Strategies included nutrient addition (nitrogen and phosphorus) to optimize metabolic degradation of organics, use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, peroxide) to improve filter run times, and the application of in-line aluminum sulphate (alum) for biopolymer removal. The impact of media type on performance was also examined (anthracite versus granular activated carbon (GAC)). Passive biofiltration (without enhancement) reduced dissolved organic carbon (∼5%), biopolymers (∼20%), and trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursors (∼20% and ∼12%, respectively) while mitigating UF irreversible fouling (∼60%). Nutrient addition was not observed to enhance biological performance. Addition of 0.5 mg/L hydrogen peroxide decreased head loss by up to 45% without affecting organic removal; however at a dosage of 1 mg/L, it negatively impacted both UF fouling and DBP precursor removal. In-line alum addition prior to biofiltration (&amp;lt;0.5 mg/L) improved UF fouling control by up to 40%, without sacrificing head loss. Overall, GAC provided superior performance when compared to anthracite.</jats:p>",

Increased monochloramine dosage and prolonged reaction time resulted in an increase in most DBPs. Furthermore, the concentrations of TCAN, DCAN and CH initially increased over time before reaching a plateau. This is because of the hydrolysis of functional groups and the function of NH2Cl. The concentrations of DCAA, TCAA and TCM decreased as pH was increased from 5 to 10, and TCAN, DCAN and CH were not detected when the pH exceeded 8. As for TCNM, their concentration increased as the pH increased from 5 to 7, following a subsequent decrease at higher pH values. High temperatures led to higher DCAN and TCAN concentrations, while low temperatures resulted in higher TCNM and DCAA concentrations. Both high and low temperatures reduced the concentrations of TCAN and CH. Finally, concentrations of the four predominant DBPs (TCM, DCAN of DCAA and TCAA) all decreased as Cl/N ratio declined.</jats:p>",

The goal of FMECA is to examine the volumetric severity of a component failure on the overall system function by modeling the system under alternative failure modes. Within FMECA, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is applied to compare the risk criticality between components' failures. To complete FMECA, the Tucson RWSS is represented in a network flow model that optimally allocates flows between sources and demand points to minimize operational costs. Potential failure mode consequences are evaluated from the flow model as the volume of water not delivered to users if the component is unavailable. The volumetric severity of the failure event is converted to an ordinal value using stakeholder judgment. Likelihood of each failure mode is similarly defined by stakeholders on a 1–10 scale. The RPN is then computed as the product of the severity and likelihood. RPN values for all failure modes are then ranked to assess the most critical elements. Alternative system configurations are examined to assess the value of redundancies on the Tucson RWSS resilience.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The manufacturing complexity of many high‐tech products results in a substantial variation in the quality of the units produced. After manufacturing, the units are classified into vertically differentiated products. These products are typically obtained in uncontrollable fractions, leading to mismatches between their demand and supply. We focus on product stockouts due to the supply–demand mismatches. Existing literature suggests that when faced with product stockouts, firms should satisfy all unmet demand of a low‐end product by downgrading excess units of a high‐end product (downward substitution). However, this policy may be suboptimal if it is likely that low‐end customers will substitute with a higher quality product and pay the higher price (upward substitution). In this study, we investigate whether and how much downward substitution firms should perform. We also investigate whether and how much low‐end inventory firms should withhold to strategically divert some low‐end demand to the high‐end product. We first establish the existence of regions of co‐production technology and willingness of customers to substitute upward where firms adopt different substitution/withholding strategies. Then, we develop a managerial framework to determine the optimal selling strategy during the life cycle of technology products as profit margins shrink, manufacturing technology improves, and more capacity becomes available. Consistent trends exist for exogenous and endogenous prices. </jats:p>",

The Global Moran's I of the latter decreased generally, and local spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the regional gap of rural water supply infrastructure is declining. The main factors affecting the spatial pattern of rural water supply were analyzed through the mean centre method.

The basic idea is to use only a few meters to provide inference on the total water consumption of a network or of a district metered area through the knowledge of some additional stratification variables, such as household typology, size and occupants number. Since any sampling procedure assumes that the variance of the variable at stake is known, either a suitable amount of past consumption data is necessary, or a specific preliminary survey must be carried out, in order to define the sampling plan. An application with real consumption data from a small municipality in Sicily (Italy) shows that number of occupants for each household is sufficient to design an effective sampling plan and that the methodology can be successfully applied in the technical practice, thus allowing a dramatic reduction of the number of customer meters to be read in order to quantify total water consumption compared to standard practice based on the reading of all meters.</jats:p>",

A reverse supply chain is configured by a sequence of elements forming a continuous process to treat return-products until they are properly recovered or disposed. The activities in a reverse supply chain include collection, cleaning, disassembly, test and sorting, storage, transport, and recovery operations. This paper presents a mathematical programming model with the objective of minimizing the total costs of reverse supply chain including transportation, fixed opening, operation, maintenance and remanufacturing costs of centers. The proposed model considers the design of a multi-layer, multi-product reverse supply chain that consists of returning, disassembly, processing, recycling, remanufacturing, materials and distribution centers. This integer linear programming model is solved by using Lingo 9 software and the results are reported. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is also presented.</jats:p>",

Anecdotal evidence suggests that limited supply, resulting primarily from long travel times to acquire condoms, is a major barrier to use. This study investigates the potential unmet demand for condoms in rural sub‐Saharan Africa. I provide empirical evidence of the importance of supply effects, based on an evaluation of a distribution program in which nine agents were enlisted to sell condoms across 92 rural villages in Zambia. I find that the number of individuals acquiring condoms tripled and the number of condoms distributed rose by more than 250 percent. The study demonstrates that individuals in poor rural areas are willing to pay for condoms and provides a model whereby public health goods can be acquired through market forces without the government incurring large costs and without detracting from public health services.</jats:p>",

Primary data were mainly used in the study. The data were collected using two sets of well-structured questionnaire containing items on the supply information for producer and demand information respectively on ogbono in the study area. A two-stage sampling technique was used to sample respondents in the area. A total of sixty (60) copies of the producer-set and one hundred and twenty (120) copies of the consumer-set of questionnaire respectively were valid for analysis for the study. Data collected were subjected to inferential statistics using multivariate analysis, involving correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PGA), and the standardized beta-weight multiple regression analysis. The results showed that, among the determinants of the supply of ogbono in the study area, the initial supply price, mid-season supply price and the end-season price were statistically significant at 5% level of significance. Among the determinants of irvingia kernel (ogbono) demand, the initial demand price, mid-season demand price, end-of-season demand price, price of substitute commodity were statistically significant. Therefore, institutional framework that will guarantee stable price of ogbono will ultimately translate to improved economic base and sustained livelihoods of the people of Aniocha in Delta State, Nigeria.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, electricity has become a modern tool to supply energy to households. This study investigates the supply and demand of household electricity and sustainability of distribution centres at Emfuleni Local Municipality (ELM). South Africa follows a vigorous programme of electrification, spearheaded by Eskom. Eskom is a South African state-owned power company which strives to meet the country’s increasing demand for energy. Resi-dential energy demand is growing as population levels rise and the number of households in ELM increases. Recently (2008–2010) in South Africa there have been unprecedented levels of load shedding nationally and there is a shortage of centres to purchase electricity. Furthermore, households do not receive uninterrupted electricity on a daily basis, largely because of stolen electrical cables and illegal connections. Low-income residents of Evaton, ELM, were interviewed. Empirical surveys were conducted and a theoretical exposition drawn up to meet the objectives of the study. It was found that electricity supply and demand in ELM is adequate but there is a shortage of selling points in Evaton and there are barriers towards the effectiveness of electricity consumption. In addition, public awareness programmes must continue to educate the communities to avoid stealing the electrical cables. Illegal connection must be reported to the local councillors for them to make sure that this activity is stopped in Evaton.</jats:p>"

Given the paucity of studies that have explored the coverage and integration of supply chain risk management (SCRM) within SCOR, the analysis and suggested improvements for SCRM are designed to enhance SCOR’s collaborative and coordinated management of supply chain (SC) risks. The paper aims to dicsuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Critical analysis was used to analyse the coverage and integration of SCRM within SCOR 10.0. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Discrepancies were identified in how SCRM has been incorporated into SCOR, including issues with the hierarchical representation of SCRM processes, metrics, best practices and skills. These may potentially propagate into difficulties in embedding risk management processes within other SC processes, visualizing risk metrics in a SC’s value hierarchy and reconciling SCOR’s SCRM with organizational enterprise risk management. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper is limited to theoretical analysis of the coverage and integration of risk in SCOR 10.0.

Scarcity of potable water results in the construction of dams and water treatment plants. Unfortunately, provision of potable water through improvement and treatment may prove to be difficult because of the socio-economic activities around a dam. This study is aimed at assessing the socio-economic activities around the Alau Dam Maiduguri, and how they affect the quality of raw water supply to Maiduguri Water Treatment Plant. The data was generated through the administration of questionnaires, and by interview and water quality analysis of dam and irrigation sites. The samples were subjected to physical, chemical and biological analysis to assess the impact of socio economic activities on the dam water, and its suitabilityfor drinking and agricultural uses. Findings reveal pollution with high concentration of nitrate (260–230 mg-NO3/l), phosphate (22–28 mg/l) and Escherichia coli (13–24 n/100 mg). This arose from improper sanitary management, inadequate public education on irrigation,indiscriminate waste disposaland some farming practices. Regular monitoring of socio-economic activities around the dam, and doing away with unhealthy waste disposal practices are recommended to safeguard the raw water supply to the treatment plant.</jats:p>",

So it was particular important to avoid defects and improve the grinding workpiece surface integrity effectively. This paper established an incompressible turbulent fluid spray model based on the study of the existing airflow and the grinding fluid distribution in the grinding zone. Then according to different grinding fluid supply parameters established the two-phase gas liquid spray flow model by using CFD(computational fluid dynamics), simulated and calculated the model, compared the mass flow rate of the grinding fluid flow field with different spray distances, heights, speeds and spray angles in the grinding zone and determined the most reasonable spraying jet position. At the last, through researching on the workpiece surface integrity experiment, it provided an experimental basis to determine the most suitable spray jet position and verify the rationality of supply parameters selection.</jats:p>"

In this paper, two after-sales service models were proposed with an OEM and a remanufacturer. The optimal remanufacturing technology transfer and the influence mechanism were analyzed. The results suggested that: in dual channel model, the rising proportion of technology transfer promoted the development of remanufacturing market. Technology transfer ratio of single channel model rising resulted in different development tendencies of the remanufacturing market. For dual channel model, the Chinese government should not only encourage manufacturers to transfer manufacturing technology, but also encourage OEM to shift profit model from traditional profit model of the new-part sales to technology development and services. However, in single channel model, the government should encourage OEM to transfer more manufacturing technology to promote the remanufacturing market prosperity.</jats:p>"

Particular attention is paid on fresh goods contamination since the increasing complexity of supply chains makes these events more likely to happen. To this end, a discrete event simulator (DES) underpinned by an analytical model has been developed as a support tool for prevention and mitigation. Indeed, the simulation model is able to recreate the disruption wave propagation along the supply chain due to a contamination event as well as the effects on the dynamic evolution of contaminated products demand taking into account complex phenomena like media campaigns. In addition, even the economic impacts in terms of costs (i.e. transportation costs, inventory costs, and lost sales) can be assessed. The potentials of the proposed simulation framework have been investigated in a real case study of a fresh food supply chain located in the north of Italy.</jats:p>",

As an alternative, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical treatment has a high disinfection potential in drinking water by using solid catalysts, such as titanium dioxide. Highly reactive hydroxyl radical generated during the process serves as the main oxidant, capable of inactivating a wide range of microorganisms. In this study, we proposed a novel comparison between Gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. An immobilized TiO2 film promoted higher efficiency in water disinfection processes. The treatment effectively inactivated Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial microorganisms in a shorter period than other alternative methods.</jats:p>",

Hence, understanding and controlling the incidence of N-nitrosamines represents a contemporary challenge to the water industry. Although many of these molecules potentially formed as DBPs are detected in chlorinated natural waters, few studies have focused on the formation, occurrence, and analysis of N-nitrosamines. Until now, nine N-nitrosamines have been detected in water samples; N-nitrosodimethylamine is the most frequently reported nitrosamine in drinking water. Although there are currently no federal regulations for these molecules in drinking water, this family of N-DBPs is one of three potential groups of contaminants highlighted for possible regulatory action in the near future. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge concerning the occurrence, precursors, and formation mechanisms of N-nitrosamines in water. In addition, the existing regulations are described and relevant analytical methods used for their quantification in water samples are also discussed.</jats:p>",

However, the theory has rarely been used to explain the interaction &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;between regions in city border area, especially in the cases in Indonesia. This article &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;discusses the case of cross-border service of water supply of the Local Water Company &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;(PDAM-Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum) of Surakarta City into the urban border area of &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;Sukoharjo Regency, based on collaborative planning theory. This article is written based on &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;results of the research on the case using case study research method. The discussion &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;concludes that the approach of collaborative planning theory used on the case is &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;cooperative-accommodation approach. It is because PDAM of Surakarta City accommodate &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;the cross-border region service as a reciprocal policy, as most of their water inputs come &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;from their neighboring regions. In general, such an approach is in accordance with the need &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;of the interacting regions, which one region needs supporting service to meet the need of&lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt; their communities in water service, and another can fulfill the need based on its capacity. In &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;this case, the concerned technical agencies, PDAM of every region interact each other &lt;span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;\"&gt;directly in providing the service.

We present a model in which the uptake, storage and assimilation of nitrogen and carbon are explicitly resolved in different-sized phytoplankton cells. In the model, metabolism and cellular C : N ratio are influenced by the accumulation of carbon polymers such as carbohydrate and lipid, which is greatest when cells are nutrient starved, or exposed to high light. Allometric relations and empirical data sets are used to constrain the range of possible C : N, and indicate that larger cells can accumulate significantly more carbon storage compounds than smaller cells. When forced with extended periods of darkness combined with brief exposure to saturating irradiance, the model predicts organisms large enough to accumulate significant carbon reserves may on average synthesize protein and other functional apparatus up to five times faster than smaller organisms. The advantage of storage in terms of average daily protein synthesis rate is greatest when modeled organisms were previously nutrient starved, and carbon storage reservoirs saturated. Small organisms may therefore be at a disadvantage in terms of average daily growth rate in environments that involve prolonged periods of darkness and intermittent nutrient limitation. We suggest this mechanism is a significant constraint on phytoplankton C : N variability and cell size distribution in different oceanic regimes.\n                    </jats:p>"

It's difficult to guarantee that the system runs in optimal state and it increases energy consumption in the system. In view of this situation this paper proposes a method to find the optimal positions of hydraulic intersections based on analyzing a real heating system with three heat sources in Jining. The optimization objective is to minimize the electric power consumption of circulating water pumps in district heating system. Finally, optimization programs are designed and the optimized results verify the feasibility and validity of the method compared with conventional experience values.</jats:p>"

Measurements were performed at atmospheric temperature and pressure in order to study the influence of the operating conditions, nozzle diameters and impingement angles on the efficiency of such an oil supply system. The flow phenomena of the jet–shaft interaction were visualized. A qualitative analysis of the jet–shaft interaction revealed massive droplet generation due to the jet break-up in the air crossflow and its impact on the shaft. The latter could be reduced with shallower impingement angles. Measurements showed that the oil inflow rate, the shaft speed, and the nozzle diameter have a strong influence on the collected oil quantity, which is expressed as catch efficiency, i.e., the ratio of collected and supplied oil. The impingement angle was also identified to have a strong influence on the catch efficiency. The ratio of the momentum fluxes of supplied oil and chamber air flow is proposed as a parameter to correlate the catch efficiency to the operating conditions.</jats:p>",

It has been stated that a combination of solar and diesel energy systems is considered to be an optimal solution under the weather conditions of Montenegro. The systems working together make it possible to reduce maintenance costs significantly and adjust capacity generation schedule with due account for energy consumption features to a maximum extent.

Reuse of greywater for non-potable end uses can be an effective alternative, but this resource has not yet received much attention in the UAE. Since the generation of greywater significantly differs from country to country – depending on age, gender, habits, lifestyle, living standards and the degree of water abundance – an attempt was made to estimate internal water consumption and greywater generation in the city of Al Ain, UAE. The frequency and water requirement for personal water uses (e.g. showers, ablutions, teeth brushing, hand washing, face washing and toilet flushing) and family water uses (e.g. laundry, dish washing and house cleaning) were estimated from about 100 villa-type detached homes randomly distributed across the city. A frequency analysis was carried out using normal, lognormal, gamma and logistic distribution. The estimated average generation rate of greywater was found to be 192 litres per capita per day, which is about 69% of the average internal water consumption. The generated greywater originates from showers (49%), ablutions (18%), laundry (10%) and washbasins (23%). Based on average quantities, it was shown that the generated greywater is sufficient to fulfil the non-potable water demand in houses, but further, more rigorous, investigation is required.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze the efficacy of different asset transfer mechanisms and provide policy recommendations for the design of humanitarian supply chains. As a part of their preparedness effort, humanitarian organizations often make decisions on resource investments ex ante because doing so allows for rapid response if an adverse event occurs. However, programs typically operate under funding constraints and donor earmarks with autonomous decision‐making authority resting with the local entities, which makes the design of efficient humanitarian supply chains a challenging problem. We formulate this problem in an agency setting with two independent aid programs, where different asset transfer mechanisms are considered and where investments in resources are of two types: primary resources that are needed for providing the aid and infrastructural investments that improve the operation of the aid program in using the primary resources. The primary resources are acquired from earmarked donations. We show that allowing aid programs the flexibility of transferring primary resources improves the efficiency of the system by yielding greater social welfare than when this flexibility does not exist. More importantly, we show that a central entity that can acquire primary resources from one program and sell them to the other program can further improve system efficiency by providing a mechanism that facilitates the transfer of primary resources and eliminates losses from gaming. This outcome is achieved without depriving the individual aid programs of their decision‐making autonomy while maintaining the constraints under which they operate. We find that outcomes with centralized resource transfer but decentralized infrastructural investments by the aid programs are the same as with a completely centralized system (where both resource transfer and infrastructural investments are centralized). </jats:p>",

Using the information collected from 676 respondents at selected villages in West Bengal from 2009 to 2010, the present paper examines the impact of health on labour supply behaviour and wages. Theoretically the study borrows the idea of nutrition-based efficiency wage hypothesis and builds a conceptual framework based on capability approach. The methodology follows a household production function model. Nutritional dimension of health as indicated by body mass index (BMI) has been found to have a positive and significant impact on labour supply for both the male and female respondents. Age is found to have significantly non-linear impact on labour supply. Hence, public policies to improve the sex and age composition of the households through appropriate channels, that is, health and fertility may be necessary. Finally, the results suggest a revision in the design of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) programme by integrating it with other developmental programmes on health, sanitation and skill development in order to ensure productivity of rural manual labourers. Experience of some other countries like South Africa and Brazil suggests the need to integrate public works programmes with programmes that target health and family welfare issues particularly in the context of rural livelihood. </jats:p>",

These data were used to forecast water quality and calculate the relative error when using a genetic algorithm optimized general regression neural network (GA-GRNN) model as well as conventional general regression neural network (GRNN) and genetic algorithm optimized back propagation (GA-BP) models. The GA-GRNN method requires few network parameters and has good network stability, a high learning speed and strong approximation ability. The overall forecasted result of GA-GRNN is the best of three models, of which the root mean square error (RMSE) of every index is nearly the least among three models.

Many studies suggest integrated assessment methods that combine building energy simulation and optimization methods. However, optimal solutions for case studies are based only on quantitative criteria (energy technical, environmental and economic). Therefore, such an approach is not sufficient to achieve the optimal building energy supply system in respect of the quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\n\nThe presented multicriteria assessment model for an energy supply system of a low energy house allows determining the optimal combination of technologies for a building energy supply system (BESS). Six variants of building constructions and fifteen combinations of BESS for each variant were analysed. Energy efficiency, environmental impact, economic rationality, comfort and system functionality were considered key criteria for optimal decision making. The results showed that the optimal solution for low energy and passive houses in Lithuania and other cold climate countries is the building envelope that corresponds to characteristics of energy efficiency class A+ and the BESS combination, consisting of a wood boiler and electricity from the national electricity grid.\nMažaenergio pastato efektyvaus aprūpinimo energija tyrimai yra svarbūs įgyvendinant pastatų energinio naudingumo tikslus, siekiant padidinti energijos vartojimo efektyvumą ir atsinaujinančiųjų išteklių energijos dalį bendrajame suvartojamos energijos balanse, taip pat sumažinti šiltnamio efektą sukeliančių dujų emisijas.

Many papers discuss profitability or cost reduction impacts of remanufacturing, but a very important point is almost missing. Indeed, there is no guarantee about the amounts of return products even if we know a lot about demands of first products. This uncertainty is due to reasons such as companies’ capabilities in collecting End-of-Life (EOL) products, customers’ interests in returning (and current incentives), and other independent collectors. The aim of this paper is to deal with the important gap of the uncertainties of return products. Therefore, we discuss the forecasting method of return products which have their own open-loop supply chain. We develop an integrated two-phase methodology to cope with the closed-loop supply chain design and planning problem. In the first phase, an Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is presented to handle the uncertainties of the amounts of return product and to determine the forecasted return rates. In the second phase, and based on the results of the first one, the proposed multi-echelon, multi-product, multi-period, closed-loop supply chain network is optimized. The second-phase optimization is undertaken based on using general exact solvers in order to achieve the global optimum. Finally, the performance of the proposed forecasting method is evaluated in 25 periods using a numerical example, which contains a pattern in the returning of products. The results reveal acceptable performance of the proposed two-phase optimization method. Based on them, such forecasting approaches can be applied to real-case CLSC problems in order to achieve more reliable design and planning of the network</jats:p>",

We show that using the data on IEDs detonated and found, we can mathematically estimate the behavior of the entire supply chain, thus providing estimates on previously unknown aspects of the IED supply chain. This provides useful information on the unobservable parts of the supply chain and offers better metrics for gauging the effectiveness of counter-IED efforts. </jats:p>",

The project used an open innovative approach by involving many actors from the different phases of the chain and included student and applied researchers. In a ‘design jeans for recycling’ students’ workshop, prototypes of jeans that are easier to recycle have been developed. Integrating the new generation from different disciplines in the project proved to be very successful. The results show that an open innovation process can lead to very creative ideas and that lessons learned from this project could be used to develop new chain projects for other products. An important condition is that key actors are willing to cooperate in an open innovation approach. </jats:p>",

It was made of steel Č 1204 as a single-part welded structure with a single wall. Cylindrical tank shell consists of 8 segments, while torispherical deep bottoms consist of 3 segments. The tank is in the horizontal position and it lays on 4 supports. There are five manometers installed at the tank for pressure control, as well as 5 spring-loaded safety valves. In this paper results of non-destructive tests performed on the tank are presented. Mechanical damages on parent material, up to 1.5 mm deep, were detected at the outer surface of the cylindrical section of the right bottom (as seen from the boiler) and on the inner surface of the shell, as well as sporadic pitting corrosion, up to 0.5 mm deep, and 2 mm misalignment of sheet metals in areas where shell segments are joined. Crack type linear indications were detected on the surface of welded joints through the use of magnetic particle testing. Through ultrasonic and radiographic testing it was determined that the homogeneity of welded joints is satisfactory. Hardness testing was performed on all segments of the tank, and obtained values were in the range between 118 and 130 HB. Metallographic examination, performed on specimens of all segments of the tank, showed that microstructure of material is either fine-grained or striped ferrite-pearlite. On the basis of test results the repair technology for shell and bottom segments was made, while on the basis of the analytical calculation of tank strength the integrity evaluation was carried out for the upcoming period of service, depending on the category of the vessel.</jats:p>"

This inability of the Government to meet this need has led to the proliferation of boreholes in the area. Out of 335 housing units in the estate, 199 have boreholes. About 20 houses were randomly selected for oral interview. Water analyses were also carried out from 5sampled boreholes. Result showed that the water in the area is slightly acidic.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The prevailing supply chain system for fruits and vegetables in India is long, fragmented and results in high wastages. The share of producers is low in the total price. Growing needs of consumers for affordable, quality, safe and hygienic fruits and vegetables cannot be fulfilled effectively in the present system. A competitive alternate marketing system, with special focus on supply chain, is required in order to reap the potential of the emerging consumer demand. A rationalised supply chain system has to provide a complete solution to meet key needs of the stakeholders. The system has to be reviewed mainly from investment, technology and management perspectives. The unorganised retailers who have huge share in the present market cannot meet this challenge on their own. Hence, an alternate system has to be evolved. Hence, this study covers the role of organised retailers in rationalising vegetables and fruits supply chain. The data required for the study is collected through field survey by administering the questionnaire to the respondents across Karnataka, one of the states in India. The study shows that the three key parameters of supply chain, that is, cost of distribution, wastage and price, are favouring organised retailers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            Soufrière Hills Volcano produced prodigious quantities of sulphur dioxide (SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            ) gas throughout 1995–2013. An unprecedented, detailed record of SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            flux shows that high SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            fluxes were sustained through eruptive pauses and for two years after the end of lava extrusion and are decoupled from lava extrusion rates. Lava extrusion rates have exhibited strong 1- to 2-year cyclicity. Wavelet analysis demonstrates periodicities of\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            5 months and\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            2 years within the SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            time series, as well as the shorter cycles identified previously. The latter period is similar to the wavelength of cycles in lava extrusion, albeit non-systematically offset. The periodicities are consistent with pressure changes accompanying deformation in a coupled magma reservoir system whereby double periodic behaviour may arise from limited connectivity between two reservoirs. During periods of lava extrusion SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            is released together with the lava (yielding the\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            2 year period), albeit with some offset. In contrast, when magma cannot flow because of its yield strength, SO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            is released independently from lava (yielding the\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            5 month period). Our results have implications for eruption forecasting. It seems likely that, when deep supply of magma ceases, gas fluxes will cease to be periodic.\n          </jats:p>",

Research on this intersection should draw attention to find antecedents, consequences and the process showing how those talented people grouped in dispersed teams can be a source of competitive advantage. Six different areas of research are proposed. It is proposed that future research should focus on the human capital (HC); meaning those key individuals of an organization that make things happen. In the near future, the global organization’s competitiveness will be shaped by how the organization manages its HC in SCML. Methodologies such as meta-analysis are suggested to summarize the extant literature on IHRM when applied to SCML in global organizations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The search was conducted in SSCI-ISIWoK and Scopus databases.

China and India alone account for ∼50% of the rice grown and consumed. Rice provides up to 50% of the dietary caloric supply for millions living in poverty in Asia and is, therefore, critical for food security. It is becoming an important food staple in both Latin America and Africa. Record increases in rice production have been observed since the start of the Green Revolution. However, rice remains one of the most protected food commodities in world trade. Rice is a poor source of vitamins and minerals, and losses occur during the milling process. Populations that subsist on rice are at high risk of vitamin and mineral deficiency. Improved technologies to fortify rice have the potential to address these deficiencies and their associated adverse health effects. With the rice industry consolidating in many countries, there are opportunities to fortify a significant share of rice for distribution or for use in government safety net programs that target those most in need, especially women and children. Multisectoral approaches are needed for the promotion and implementation of rice fortification in countries.</jats:p>",

We give the detailed design of the SG for electricity charging request and electricity allocation between plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and DRSM through the Android system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the impact of supply chain power structure on firms' profitability in an assembly system with one assembler and two suppliers. Two power regimes are investigated—in a Single Power Regime, a more powerful firm acts as the Stackelberg leader to decide the wholesale price but not the quantity whereas in a Dual Power Regime, both the price and quantity decisions are granted to the more powerful firm. Tallying the power positions of the three firms, for each power regime we study three power structures and investigate the system's as well as the firms' preference of power. We find that when the assembler is the most powerful firm among the three, the system‐wide profit is the highest and so is the assembler's profit. The more interesting finding is that, if the assembler is not the most powerful player in the system, more power does not necessarily guarantee her a higher profit. Similarly, a supplier's profit can also decrease with the power he has. These results contrast with the conclusion for serial systems, where a firm always prefers more power. We also find that when both suppliers are more (less) powerful than the assembler, it can be beneficial (indifferent) for everyone if the two suppliers merge into a mega supplier to make decisions jointly. When the assembler is more powerful than one supplier and less so than the other, it is always better for the system to have the two suppliers merge, and for each individual firm, merging is preferred if the firm becomes the more powerful party after merging. </jats:p>",

A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to collect data from 227 supply chain, logistics, or procurement/purchasing managers of leading manufacturing and retail organizations. Drawing on resources-based view of the firm, and through extending the concept of process integration in supply network, as well as broadening the scope of role of IS resources in relation to process integration and performance gain from the focal firm to the entire supply chain, we found that supply chain process integration is an important multidimensional intermediate organizational capability through which the value of IS resources for supply chain management can be materialized. This capability serves as a catalyst in transforming the value of technical aspects of IS resources into higher performance gain for a firm. Thus, the importance of formation of all dimensions of this capability across supply network should be realized. Moreover, the result suggests that the technical aspects of IS resources need to be jointly developed by supply partners to effectively form supply chain capabilities. </jats:p>",

During DNA replication, nucleosomes are disrupted and re-assembled with newly synthesized histones and DNA. Despite much progress, it is still unclear why higher eukaryotes contain multiple core histone genes, how chromatin assembly is controlled, and how these processes are coordinated with cell cycle progression. We used a histone null mutation of Drosophila melanogaster to show that histone supply levels, provided by a defined number of transgenic histone genes, regulate the length of S phase during the cell cycle. Lack of de novo histone supply not only extends S phase, but also causes a cell cycle arrest during G2 phase, and thus prevents cells from entering mitosis. Our results suggest a novel cell cycle surveillance mechanism that monitors nucleosome assembly without involving the DNA repair pathways and exerts its effect via suppression of CDC25 phosphatase String expression.</jats:p>"

An augmented state space model for the system is given, taking into account the delay from the digital implementation of the control signal, and resonant controllers that ensure asymptotic tracking of the reference and good rejection of load disturbances. It is shown a case where an ℋ<jats:sub>∞</jats:sub> optimal state feedback controller cannot provide good results because of the high control gains. To solve this problem, an ℋ<jats:sub>∞</jats:sub> suboptimal controller is proposed, taking into account a prescribed bound for the ℋ<jats:sub>∞</jats:sub> norm of the closed‐loop system and a parameter for limitation of the norm of the control gain vector. This suboptimal controller provides gains that lead to suitable results, complying with the constraints from the IEC 62040‐3 Standard. These results are compared with those from a widely used state feedback controller, providing superior performance, even with a much simpler design procedure. Simulation and experimental results have a good correspondence. Finally, the study illustrates that the ℋ<jats:sub>∞</jats:sub> norm of the closed‐loop system can be seen as the output impedance over the frequency. From this information, using the small gain theorem, one can get the admittance value of the linear loads that preserve stability when connected to the uninterruptible power supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Red blood cell (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RBC</jats:styled-content>) antibodies can persist for decades or decrease quickly to undetectable levels. Antibody persistence has not been systematically studied. Women whose children are treated with intrauterine transfusions (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IUT</jats:styled-content>) for haemolytic disease of the fetus (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HDFN</jats:styled-content>) often produce additional antibodies, which can be evoked by the intrauterine transfusion or by fetomaternal haemorrhage during the procedure. Factors associated with persistence of both the antibodies responsible for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HDFN</jats:styled-content> and additional antibodies were studied in 260 women whose children were treated with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IUT</jats:styled-content> between 1988 and 2008. They possessed 499 (205 anti‐D and 294 non‐D) antibodies after the last <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IUT</jats:styled-content>. After a median follow‐up of 8·7 years, all 260 antibodies primarily responsible for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HDFN</jats:styled-content> had persisted. Additional antibodies directed against antigens of the children persisted in 70·6%, and in 32·3% if they were not child‐specific (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001). Antibodies induced by irradiated <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IUT</jats:styled-content> persisted in only 7·1%. Multivariate analyses showed that non‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HDFN</jats:styled-content> antibody persistence was dependent on the antibody titre and specificity. In conclusion, persistence of antibodies mainly depends on antibody strength and specificity. Difference between fetal or non‐fetal immunogens suggests maintenance of antigenic stimulation possibly by long‐term fetomaternal chimerism.</jats:p>",
