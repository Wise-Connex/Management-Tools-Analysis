      "abstract": "<jats:p>Interlending in Canada is affected by geographic, political and cultural factors. The population distribution complicates the provision of material services and new methods of document delivery are constantly under review. The political complexities are such as to make effective networking voluntary, informal or non‐governmental. A complex cultural background affects library collections and services. Interlending in Canada is vital as individual library collections are not yet fully developed. There are no central lending collections as such and interlibrary lending is largely decentralized. Location tools and services have changed radically over the last decade with the advent of automation. The introduction of air and truck delivery systems has solved many document delivery problems and they are developing rapidly. Interlibrary loan policies are based on a code which, amongst other things, promotes access to information as being in the general interest. Charges for interlibrary loans were reluctantly introduced in 1975 and caused temporary chaos. The issue has raised the question of the need for a national lending centre and this in turn raises the problem of copyright. A nationwide study of interlending in Canada was undertaken and the report submitted at the end of 1982. Other studies are being carried out at the provincial level. Interlending in Canada is in a very dynamic period: technology is moving towards the interlinking of a wide variety of systems better suited to the Canadian situation. In future, library collections may become smaller, and users will borrow from a central clearing‐house, or full‐text database. New technology will affect the traditional role of the library which will then concentrate on more sophisticated help to the user.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article summarizes the findings of a study aimed at focusing attention on the whole range of costs associated with interlibrary lending. Comparative costs of the ways in which interlibrary loans may be obtained are presented. The results distinguish between the costs incurred by a particular library in a transaction, and the net effect of the transaction on the finances of all libraries involved. Three universities, one polytechnic, two public and one industrial library, a regional library bureau and the British Library Lending Division took part in the study. The simplest successful interlibrary loan transaction, involving the supply of an average length photocopy, costs around £2.00 and the minimum cost of a loan is in the region of £4.00, both at 1981 prices. The investigation illustrates that generally the over‐all cost to the library community of a transaction which results in the supply of an item from Lending Division stock, is likely to be less than that of an application involving a regional library bureau or one sent direct to another library. The use of the Lending Division loan/photocopy form for interlending is shown to provide an equitable means of sharing the costs of interlibrary loans.</jats:p>",

The adverse impacts were an increase of ammonia and manganese concentrations and, to a lesser degree, increased concentrations of phenol and specific conductance. At the worst point during the drought, the 12‐month moving average of monthly ammonia concentration in the Sangamon River was about 620 percent higher than the antecedent value. On the other hand, average concentrations of nitrites and nitrates, total iron, and the number of coliform bacteria significantly decreased. This positive response suggests that streams which are considered unsuitable for municipal supply due to high levels of these quality indicators may be used as emergency sources during droughts.</jats:p>",
