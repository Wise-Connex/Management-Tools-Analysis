My topic is \"Surplus and Shortages in the Service and Supply Industry\" --and, in a broader sense, the outlook for the industry,</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Let me say at the outset that the outlook is better now than it has been. But before anyone gets too excited, we must remember that from our industry's viewpoint it would be difficult for the situation to get cny worse than it was. Nor can we be certain that \"better\" will be enough to eliminate our problems in the short term. For the longer term, though, I believe there are brighter times ahead.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>What is really brought home in analyzing where we were, where we are, and where we are going is the clear message that the old, predictable economic rules of supply and demand are functioning freely in our market place, And I don't believe we can escape them, Certainly, we in the service and supply industry enjoy it a lot more when demand is rising and our main problem is how to increase supply. However, it is also apparent that the pendulum sometimes swings too far before the corrective mechanism begins to work, Then the adjustment is painful and costly, That has been our experience in recent times.</jats:p>",

Despite many econometric studies on supply elasticities in Finland, so far no coherent analysis covering all products has been made. This shortcoming is the background for this study. Ordinary least squares were first used to estimate the elasticities, but since the residuals were in many cases autocorrelated, autoregressive models were also applied. The fit of the models did not improve much, but the autocorrelation disappeared, particularly when second order models were estimated. The long term supply elasticities seem to be small in general, a fact which also corresponds to expectations and earlier studies. The estimation of cross elasticities was not very successful and only one or two variables in addition to the producer price of the product concerned, could be included in the models. The estimation of supply elasticities proved to be sensitive to the inclusion of a new variable or a new observation. This may be due to the small number of observations or due to the rapid change in supply conditions which may be difficult to explain by econometric methods.</jats:p>"

In this paper the procedures used in these cost-effectiveness calculations are examined and found to be wanting. The calculations are misleading since gross rather than net costs have been used, and the health impact of these programs underestimated. It is also shown that the methodology used is biased against water supply and sanitation and other programs with multiple outputs. The time constraints facing mothers in implementing PHC programs, as well as the contribution of improved water supplies in alleviating these constraints are outlined. Data are presented to show that, if poor women in developing countries were to choose the mix of activities to be included in PHC programs, improved water supplies would frequently constitute part of that mix. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although attempts have been made recently to include supply considerations in urban spatial interaction models, these efforts have not been comprehensive. In this paper, demand-type models are first examined. Then it is demonstrated how spatial consumption patterns can be determined when potential supply exceeds actual demand or vice versa. In addition, supply and demand imbalances are treated simultaneously. Last, a model for handling steady state supply–demand equilibrium is developed, which includes the effects of delays between customers entering the housing or land markets and finally making a choice. The case of uniform steady state supply is distinguished from that where new supply occurs at discrete intervals. </jats:p>",

Survey data on expectations of the money supply and consumer and producer price indexes are used to distinguish anticipated and unanticipated components of the announcements. This distinction is used to test for the efficiency of the financial market response to the announcements of new information. The results indicate that the unanticipated components of the announced changes in the Producers Price Index and in the money supply have an immediate positive effect on short‐term interest rates. The Consumer Price Index announcement has no apparent effect. There is no evidence of a delayed announcement effect. However, there is some indication of a liquidity effect of the money supply change on interest rates. This takes place when reserves are changing and several weeks prior to the information announcement.</jats:p>",

Neoplastic lesions were synchronously induced by injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by feeding of 2‐acetylaminofluorene (2‐AAF) plus partial hepatectomy, then periodically killed for examination. At 6 weeks after DENA injection sinusoids of hyperplastic foci (HF) were filled with blue resin similar to surrounding tissue, then at 8 weeks some HF and hyperplastic nodules (HN) took up red resin leaving surrounding sinusoids blue. At 12 to 18 weeks, red HN became more discrete with obvious compression of surroundings but decreased their number whereas blue HN were not. Red HN had incomplete anastomosing sinusoids giving a coral‐like appearance. Spongy or cystic areas contained little or no resin, suggesting ischemic condition. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) at 40 weeks took exclusively arterial red resin forming irregularly shaped anastomosing sinusoids. These findings indicate that acquisition of arterial blood supply by HF may relate to their further development to persistent HN and HCC.</jats:p>",

To examine possible regulatory roles of liver and kidney in cobalamin metabolism, specific activities of the two cobalamin-dependent enzymes, uptake in vivo of cyano[57Co]cobalamin ([57Co]CNCbl) and the binding of [57Co]Cbl to intracellular proteins were measured in normal, cobalamin-loaded and cobalamin-deficient rats. Cobalamin deficiency and cobalamin loading produced greater changes in cobalamin concentration in the kidney than in the liver.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Although cobalamin deficiency resulted in a decrease in total methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) in both organs, cobalamin loading had no effect. Neither deficiency nor loading altered total methyltransferase activity. The holoenzyme activities of both enzymes correlated with changes in tissue cobalamin levels.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3. Uptake of [57Co]Cbl indicated that the kidney, in contrast to the liver, increased its uptake during loading and reduced it during deficiency, suggesting a possible regulatory role for this organ.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>4. In the normal rat, 24 h after injection of [57Co]CNCbl, 0.3% of the administered [57Co]Cbl was present in the liver as free cobalamin. By contrast, in the kidney, over 13% of the [57Co]Cbl was present in the free form. During deficiency free renal [57Co]Cbl was reduced to 0.6% of the administered [57Co]Cbl whereas in cobalamin-loaded rats it was increased to more than 27%.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>5.
