In\n      the recent past, a number of studies have confirmed that Pakistani\n      farmers respond to changes in output prices.! The prime objective of\n      these studies was to estimate price, acreage or yield elasticities based\n      on the Nerlovian Adjustment Model under alternative expectation schemes.\n      Naqvi and Burney (1992) estimated output supply and input demand\n      functions based on the profit function approach.2 Surprisingly, the\n      single-equation supply model has been used extensively for policy\n      analysis without noticing the fact that such a model does not guarantee\n      that the harvested share of each crop will always be non-negative and\n      the sum of shares of all crops will be unity. Similarly, models which\n      are based on applied duality theory do not take into account the actual\n      decision-making at the farm level. The sequence of events is such that\n      farmer first allocates area across crops and then chooses the input\n      levels conditioned on the allocation of area across crops. Mundlak\n      (1988) has shown that the optimisation model in this case will have to\n      be modified to provide for sequential solution for area allocation and\n      input use. This model clearly distinguishes the changes in optimal input\n      and output combinations for each crop from changes in the quasi-fixed\n      inputs across crops.</jats:p>"

The rank order of maximum growth rate of these species is: Carex diandra @&lt; Carex rostrata &lt; Carex acutiformis. We distinguished two components of NUE: the mean residence time of nitrogen (MRT) in the plant and the nitrogen productivity (A). In this concept, NUE equals the product of MRT and A, and thus equals total productivity divided by the total N loss in litter. The N productivity (A) of C. diandra was significantly higher than that of C. rostrata and C. acutiformis. In each species A decreased strongly at enhanced N supply. The MRT of N differed substantially between species, but was not significantly affected by N supply. Contrary to what is generally found, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the highest N turnover rate (lowest MRT), while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the lowest N turnover rate (highest MRT). In all species, the NUE decreased with increasing N supply. As a result of the observed patterns in N productivity and mean residence time, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the lowest nitrogen use efficiency, while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the highest NUE. These results are not in agreement with the generally observed patterns in NUE along gradients of primary productivity. Comparisons of the results of this study with those of other studies show that generalizations of patterns of NUE along gradients of primary productivity should explicitly take into account which growth forms are compared (evergreen species vs. deciduous species, or [congeneric] species with the same growth form). Moreover, this study shows that factoring NUE into its components is a useful tool in the analysis of the adaptive significance of the N economy of plants.</jats:p>",

Mean body-weight loss of sows was 0·67 kg/day and was lower only in parity 2 on lactation treatment H compared with lactation treatment C. N retention was less negative on lactation treatment H than on lactation treatment C (significant in parity 1) and N retention was less negative on pregnancy treatment L than on pregnancy treatment C (significant in parity 3). Fat mobilization on lactation treatment H was higher than on lactation treatment C (significant in parities 2 and 3). The proportion of energy mobilized as protein to the total energy mobilization was significantly lower on lactation treatment H compared with lactation treatment C. Estimated daily N, lysine and Heal digestible lysine requirements for first parity lactating sows were 162 g, 48 g and 37 g respectively. For second parity sows 179 g, 54 g and 42 g and for third parity sows 185 g, 56 g and 43 g. N excretion during lactation was proportionately about 0·6 of ingested N. This resulted in an N excretion of about 2·3 kg N during a 25-day lactation period. After correction for differences in litter size, body weight of sows, daily litter gain and N mobilization increased with parity number.</jats:p>",

A graphical flowsheet editor enables an easy and flexible composition or change of plant configurations and their relevant data by using fundamental data registered in a database. Plant data composed by the editor are arranged automatically to carry out an optimization calculation, in which the operational strategy is determined so as to minimize an objective function, such as operational cost subject to energy demand requirements and other operational restraints. An application example shows that the system is a useful tool for the operational planning of energy supply plants from the viewpoints, not only of rationality, but also of task and time reduction.</jats:p>",

In experiment 1, all cows were managed for 3 months before calving to achieve condition scores at calving 2·1 (low) and 3·1 (moderate). Subsequently, these animals were placed on a fixed level of energy intake (80 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per day) for 16 weeks. Post-partum diets contained differing amounts of digestible undegradable protein (DUP), but similar amounts of effective rumen degradable protein (ERDP). In experiment 2, single- and twin-suckling cows were fed to achieve a condition score at calving of around 2·75. These animals were subsequently placed on two levels of energy intake (80 MJ and 130 MJ ME per day) during the first 16 weeks of lactation. The diets providing these energy intakes also contained differing amounts of DUP. Neither the level of DUP in the diet nor the level of feeding significantly altered the digestibility of the dry matter or organic matter in the dry matter of the experimental diets.</jats:p><jats:p>Body condition at calving had little effect on daily milk yield (9·5 kg) and composition (33·5 g/kg fat; 30-0 g/kg protein) in experiment 1. Cows with higher body condition scores at calving lost 13·5 kg more live weight and 0·26 units more body condition (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) during the 1st month post partum but remained in better condition throughout the trial period than cows with lower body condition scores. Cows on 130 MJ ME per day produced higher (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001) daily yields of milk, milk fat and protein (+2·0 kg; +151 g; +85 g) and lost 57 kg less live weight and 0·52 units less body condition (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001) than cows on 80 MJ ME per day. Elevated dietary levels of DUP promoted (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) daily milk yields (by 1·25 kg) and reduced live-weight and body condition-score loss during the 1st month post partum in both experiments. Twin-suckling cows produced the highest average daily yields of milk throughout the 16-week trial period in both experiments but yields were not significantly higher after early lactation in experiment 1. Cow body condition score at calving and the level of DUP in the post-partum diet of cows had no effect on the post-partum performance of calves. Twin calves had slower growth rates (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001) than single calves (0·65 and 1·07 kg/day respectively) in experiment 1. However, twin calves sucking cows on 130 MJ ME per day in experiment 2 grew similarly to single sucking calves from week 8 of lactation (0·8 kg/day).</jats:p>",

These animals were subsequently placed on two levels of energy intake (80 MJ and 130 MJ ME per day) for 16 weeks. The diets providing these levels of energy intake also contained differing amounts of DUP.

Cows on 130 MJ ME per day had lower serum NEFA concentrations than cows on 80 MJ ME per day. Cows given higher DUP diets had higher (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt;0 ·05) serum NEFA concentrations when in negative energy balance and lower serum NEFA concentrations when close to energy equilibrium than cows given lower DUP diets. Twin-suckling cows had higher (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) serum NEFA concentrations than single-suckling cows, but only during the first 3 weeks post partum. Plasma glucose concentrations were below 3 mmol/lfor twin-suckling cows until week 7 post partum when they became similar to the values for single-suckling cows. Serum D-3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations mirrored those of plasma glucose. Serum urea-nitrogen concentrations were high for twin-suckling cows on 80 MJ ME per day and single-suckling cows on 130 MJ ME per day.</jats:p><jats:p>Neither body condition at calving nor post-partum energy intake significantly influenced the time taken for cows to overcome anovulation nor did they significantly influence the proportion of cows which eventually resumed normal oestrous cyclicity. DUP concentration in the post-partum diet had no overall effect on the various measures of fertility assessed but thin cows at calving subsequently placed on the high DUP diet took longer to ovulate (55 days; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) and had the lowest pregnancy rate (0·30). The post-partum anovulatory period was longer (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·01) by 27 days in experiment 1 and 12 days in experiment 2 for hvin-suckling cows compared with singlesuckling cows. A lower proportion (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·001) of twin-suckling cows regained oestrous cyclicity and became pregnant in experiment 1. Fertility traits were improved when twin-suckling cows were in moderate body condition at calving and/or offered 130 MJ ME per day during the post-partum period.</jats:p>",
