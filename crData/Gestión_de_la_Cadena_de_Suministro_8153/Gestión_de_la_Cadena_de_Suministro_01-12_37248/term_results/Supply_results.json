By following this framework, a firm can identify areas of opportunity for improvement in its internal supply chain. Further, the framework can help to identify specific reasons behind the performance levels in the internal supply chain and stimulate performance improvement. To illustrate the framework, it is applied to the paint industry. The framework provides meaningful results for the firms in the industry.</jats:p>",

This study estimates the degree of linkages between automotive parts suppliers and automobile manufacturers. Significant linkages are demonstrated by the high correlation coefficients of the P/E ratio of auto parts suppliers and auto manufacturers and by the results of regression analysis. Demand uncertainty in the automobile manufacturing industry, resulting from business cycles and unexpected labor disputes, is one of the major risks facing auto parts suppliers. Risk assessment, utilizing information on linkages, is important for demand management and developing profit‐maximizing strategies.</jats:p>",

Results from a sample of 209 plant managers indicate that firms use taper integration and long‐term supplier relationships more frequently than vertical integration and competitive spot bidding.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Experts predict that the Internet will become the primary low‐cost network for business‐to‐business commerce transactions. Both buying and selling firms can benefit from the cost savings and productivity improvements associated with online purchasing. Although more organizational buyers are turning to the Internet for purchasing activities, challenges exist as some buying firms harbor concerns. To assist suppliers in the development of effective strategies aimed at increasing online purchasing among professional buyers, a study was designed to investigate the impact of supplier support on buyers' adoption of the Internet for corporate‐related purchasing activities. Path analysis was used to examine the relationships among four variables: supplier support, communication convenience, buyer adoption behavior, and Internet usage intent. The results suggest that suppliers play a critical role in the adoption of this new innovation. By offering encouragement, guidance (e.g., training), and incentives (e.g., price discounts) and by stressing convenience of use, suppliers can increase the likelihood that buyers will adopt and use this new method for purchasing.</jats:p>",

A case study from the precision mechanical engineering sector is employed to illustrate the effect of rapid response manufacturing and supply chain integration. Analysis of six years of time‐series data indicates bullwhip reduction of up to 58 per cent. These results serve to validate the four material flow principles of selecting  appropriate control systems, time‐compression, information transparency, and echelon elimination. They also raise interesting questions concerning the relationship between manufacturing agility and lean supply. For, by attenuating bullwhip the studied company was able to reduce their global inventory by 45 per cent. Thus, by viewing manufacturing in the context of the supply chain as a whole, it is possible to see how agile manufacturing can eliminate sources of variability induced waste; particularly inventory. In this way it is argued that agile manufacturing can subsume the paradigm of lean production.</jats:p>",

The need for a suitable management and communication framework is thus becoming evident. We already have some examples showing that information sharing is a key-point at certain levels of a supply chain network. As there are several analogies between a company in a business network and an agent, the Multi-Agent System paradigm can be a valid approach for modelling supply chain networks. We consider commitment as a concept that underlies the whole multi-agent environment, that is, an interagent state, reflecting a business relation between two companies that make themselves represented by software agents. We present a data structure for commitments that can be used in the agent-based communication framework for the management of a supply chain. Business partnership between companies leads to the creation of a \"channel\" through which we can identify three different kinds of flow (products, money and information). We show how commitments that deal with these flows are related to one another and how they can affect the supply chain.</jats:p>",

There has not been any well‐developed theory that can explain this slow uptake. Argues that the inherent characteristics of ECR have actually created barriers to its own adoption. As an inter‐organisational system (IOS), ECR adoption requires co‐operation and trust between trading partners, which are unlikely to happen unless costs, benefits and risks of ECR implementation can be mutually shared. Shows, using a case study conducted within one supply chain, that an unequal distribution of costs, benefits and risks among manufacturer, distributor and retailer is inherent in the implementation of cross‐docking, which typifies the overall ECR program. The findings of this study lead to a new direction in understanding the barriers to adoption of ECR and IOS in general.</jats:p>",

Companies have adopted a variety of strategies to strengthen and monitor compliance by their suppliers, including codes of conduct, direct monitoring by their own personnel, more stringent contract conditions, and reduction in the number of contractors. Increasingly, companies are turning to what are termed here “monitoring coalitions”, membership organisations that undertake to organise the monitoring of labour or other standards in overseas factories. To be effective, these emerging systems must address a range of issues, including how to manage the monitoring process, what standard to set, how to finance monitoring, how to disseminate the information collected, and, most difficult, how to accomplish costeffective monitoring in tens of thousands of production facilities in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa.</jats:p>",

Studies have been developed in order to verify during one year the drinking quality of the water for the following parameters: turbidity, color, pH, dissolved oxygen, total of dissolved solids, COD, chloride, among others, according to the Ministry of Health's Regulation 36. This system of water supply projected to treat 15 L s-1 has been in continuous operation for 2 years, it was implemented with support of the National Environment Fund (FNMA), administered by the Center of Environmental Studies (CEA-UNESP), while the technical supervision and design were performed by the Institute of Applied Ecology. The actual research project is being supported by FAPESP.</jats:p>",

A stochastic cost model is developed to evaluate the total supply chain cost with integrated purchasing and scheduling policies. The model minimizes the costs associated with assembly rate adjustment, safety stock, and schedule changes for all supply chain members. Through experimentation, the paper examines the impact of several environmental factors on the value of schedule integration. This study finds that schedule integration can lead to overall cost savings in a supply chain, but some firms may have to absorb costs in excess of those they would incur with independent scheduling. Environments with high inventory holding costs and long supplier lead times may not find it beneficial to adopt an integrated schedule. Forecast effectiveness plays a critical role in realizing the benefits of schedule integration. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.</jats:p>",

These were compared with the original using a timed look-up task and in-depth interviews with a panel of 24 regular users of the directory. Results showed that all three new versions were used almost twice as fast as the original, and were preferred. An A4 layout with two sequences of entries per page was selected for further development, and alternative treatments of typographic detail were assessed by a further 12 users. The improved usability of the final result was accompanied by a reduction of around 45 per cent in the number of pages in the directory, representing considerable savings in paper and distribution costs. The development and testing of alternative prototypes with a panel \n\t\tof users led to a design solution that could not have been arrived at simply by analysis of problems with the original version.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using data from the U.S. bicycle industry, we examine the relation among product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance. Variety imposes two types of costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product mark-down costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, and the costs of lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact of variety on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some types of variety incur high production costs and some types of variety incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i.e., high-volume firms) will offer types of variety associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer types of variety associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the type of product variety they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.</jats:p>",

The discussion details the transformational nature of change agent empowerment, stakeholder engagement, team-working and the dynamics of intra-firm and customer-supplier collaboration between a first tier company and its sub-suppliers. It shows that improvement programmes have a crucial function in helping customer and suppliers to closer collaboration through enabling them to work towards common objectives, to understand each other's positions, and to build on a platform of mutual trust as they strive to improve their individual and collective competitiveness and establish mechanisms to ensure that improvements are sustainable. The study has further value in illuminating the adaptation of a lean production model akin to the Toyota Production System to a specific case supported by the Accelerate Initiative and facilitated by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' Industry Forum. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Progress in reforestation is reviewed and the results of a 1999 survey of seed collection and utilization are presented. The review includes forest depletion, regeneration and seed supply for Canada for the 1960–99 period. Depletion of stocked, timber-productive land has increased from less than 2 million ha annually to just under 2.5 million ha, primarily due to an increase in harvesting from about 800 000 ha to slightly over 1 million ha in recent years, and also due to larger fires during the last decade. The depleted area amounts to 1% of the total commercial forest. Natural regeneration consistently covered more than 60% of the depleted area. Artificial regeneration (seeding and planting) has increased dramatically from 86 000 ha per year in 1965 to 513 000 ha in 1990, and has since levelled off at about 460 000 ha. The seed supply situation has also improved greatly, primarily due to tree improvement that resulted in the establishment of seed orchards, which were expanded from 364 ha in 1981 to 3008 ha in 1995. New analytical biochemical methods suggest that in orchard seed, genetic variation and diversity are maintained.The seed survey, including 36 conifer and 29 broadleaf species, indicated that 2.5 billion seeds were collected in 1999 (which was not a good seed year) and 3.9 billion seeds were sown. These 3.9 billion seeds appear to be sufficient to again restock approximately 460 000 ha per year, i.e., the same area as regenerated annually in the 1995–99 period. Improved seed treatment and sowing methods appear to have made seedling production substantially more efficient during the last 20 years. The major species sown in 1999 were: Picea mariana (35%), Picea glauca (22%), Pinus contorta (13%), and Pinus banksiana (12%). For Canada as a whole, 25% of the seed came from seed orchards, but for the Maritime Provinces, Québec, and Manitoba this percentage ranged from 60 to 90%. Orchard production is still growing: British Columbia and Québec will produce 80% of their planting stock from it during the next decade, and New Brunswick and British Columbia are already harvesting seed from second-generation orchards. It is expected that the high quality of seed obtained from seed orchards will contribute significantly to the efficiency of the reforestation program and increase the value of future forests. Key words: forest depletion, reforestation, seed orchards, seed supply </jats:p>",

The estimates were based on official national reports of the number of donors, blood screening coverage, and prevalence of serologic markers for infectious diseases. Coverage of screening in 1997 was 100% in 12 and 11 countries for HIV and HBV respectively. Complete screening for HCV was reported by only one country in 1994 and by six in 1997. For T. cruzi, the number of countries with 100% screening coverage increased from two in 1994 to four in 1997. In 1994, three countries showed risk of transfusion-transmitted infections for HIV, seven for HBV, eight for HCV, and seven for T. cruzi. The risk of receiving an infected blood unit and acquiring a transfusion-transmitted infection has been reduced with time in 10 of the 12 countries due to improvements in screening coverage. In Uruguay, the risk was theoretically nil from 1994-1997 because at the beginning of the study period they already had 100% blood donor screening for all infectious diseases transmitted by blood. In 1994, Colombia and Venezuela had the highest health risk associated with blood transfusion (spreading index of 101 and 62, respectively); during the period 1996-1997, Costa Rica presented the highest figures (spreading index of 53 and 83, respectively). The analysis of the potential risk associated with transfusion of tainted blood highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the safety of blood supply.</jats:p>",

An inconstant intrathoracic ramus which joined the 2nd intercostal nerve to the ventral ramus of the 1st thoracic nerve, proximal to the point where the latter gave a large branch to the brachial plexus, has become known as the ‘nerve of Kuntz’ (Kuntz, 1927). Subsequently a variety of sympathetic interneuronal connections down to the 5th intercostal space were reported and also described as the nerve of Kuntz. The aim of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence, location and course of the nerve of Kuntz; (2) the relationship of the nerve of Kuntz to the 2nd thoracic ganglion; (3) the variations of the nerve of Kuntz in the absence of a stellate ganglion; (4) to compare the original intrathoracic ramus with sympathetic variations at other intercostal levels; and (5) to devise an appropriate anatomical classification of the nerves of Kuntz.</jats:p><jats:p>Bilateral microdissection of the sympathetic chain and somatic nerves of the upper 5 intercostal spaces was undertaken in 32 fetuses (gestational age, 18 wk to full term) and 18 adult cadavers. The total sample size comprised 99 sides.</jats:p><jats:p>Sympathetic contributions to the first thoracic nerve were found in 60 of 99 sides (left 32, right 28). Of these, 46 were confined to the 1st intercostal space only. The nerve of Kuntz (the original intrathoracic ramus) of the 1st intercostal space had a demonstrable sympathetic connection in 34 cases, and an absence of macroscopic sympathetic connections in 12. In the remaining intercostal spaces, intrathoracic rami uniting intercostal nerves were not observed. Additional sympathetic contributions (exclusive of rami communicantes) were noted between ganglia, interganglionic segments and intercostal nerves as additional rami communicantes. The eponym nerve of Kuntz should be restricted to descriptions of the intrathoracic ramus of the 1st intercostal space. Any of these variant sympathetic pathways may be responsible for the recurrence of symptoms after sympathectomy surgery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rivers can be affected by multiple natural and human‐induced changes to sediment supply and to sediment transport capacity. Assessment of the relative importance of these changes enables appropriate river management. Here assessments are made of the relative changes in sediment supply and sediment transport capacity of an 83 km section of the bedrock‐controlled Coxs River, New South Wales, Australia. These relative changes are estimated, in turn, for land degradation, historical climate variations, and dam closure. Measurements of gully erosion extent from aerial photographs indicate that since European settlement the average annual sediment supply to the river has increased by a factor of ∼20. Rainfall records and flow‐gauging records show a climate shift in the mid‐1940s. On the basis of hydrologic modeling the increased streamflow in the period since the mid‐1940s is estimated to have increased sediment transport capacity by a factor of almost 3. Closure of Lyell Dam in 1982 stopped sediment supply from the upper catchment. On the basis of hydrologic modeling the flow regulation and abstraction at the dam is estimated to have reduced the long‐term average sediment transport capacity downstream by 15%. The current sediment transport capacity after the climate shift and dam closure is 2.6 times higher that in the first half of this century. In spite of this net increase in sediment transport capacity the huge volume of sediment delivered to the channel from gully erosion has led to widespread sand deposition along much of the river. Much of the river bed that was previously dominated by bedrock is now alluvial in character. Only the steepest reaches remain bedrock‐dominated.</jats:p>",

In this paper we describe a scheduling application in a water supply network to demonstrate the benefits of parallel processing. The procedure we propose combines dynamic programming with genetic algorithms and time series prediction in order to solve problems in which decisions are made in stages, and the states and control belong to a continuous space. Taking into account the computational complexity of these applications and the time constraints that are usually imposed, the procedure has been implemented by a parallel program in a cluster of computers, an inexpensive and widely extended platform that can make parallelism a practical means of tackling complex problems in many different environments.

Irradiance by altering algal Fe quotas is a key determinant of algal growth rate at 54°S (when silicic acid levels are nonlimiting); however, because of the integral nature of Fe/light colimitation and the restricted nature of the current data set, it was not possible to ascertain the relative contributions of Fe and irradiance to the control of phytoplankton growth. On the basis of a climatology of summer mean MLD for subantarctic (SA) waters south of Australia the 47° and 54°S sites appear to represent minimum and maximum MLDs, where Fe and Fe/irradiance, respectively, may limit/colimit algal growth. The implications for changes in the factors limiting algal growth with season in SA waters are discussed.</jats:p>",
