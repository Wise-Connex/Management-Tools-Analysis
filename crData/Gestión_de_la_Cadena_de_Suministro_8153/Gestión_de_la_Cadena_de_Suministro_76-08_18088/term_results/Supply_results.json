The model developed and presented here reverses the cost minimizing sequence of the Chern and Polopolus formulation, a model designed to include a discontinuous long-run plant cost function.

The analysis, verified by experimentation, shows that the bearing can be regarded as two independent second-order systems acting perpendicular to each other. The variable coefficients of the equations of motion cause the bearing to behave as an underdamped system for low values of static eccentricity ratio ε0, and as an overdamped system for intermediate values of ε0. The bearing tends to be unstable above a particular ε0. Further analysis is needed to determine the effects resulting from changing the oil inlet pressure.</jats:p>",

The case studied was confined to a two‐period analysis involving (1) a crop planting period and (2) a growing and harvesting period. The model is developed in terms of Bayesian analysis and demonstrates how linear programing can be applied to rather complex decision making problems involving uncertainty. Testing of the model involved the use of an IBM computer program available at the University of Michigan. For various assumptions as to supplemental water supply the model showed a net benefit to irrigators of about $6/acre for a reduction in uncertainty of 33% resulting from the introduction and improvement of water supply forecasts.</jats:p>",

Children in families also showed significantly elevated urinary F excretion with two F‐salted meals a day but not with one a day. After taking 0.5 mg F in the form of NaF tablets a group of children without previous F supply attained within 1 d a 24‐h urinary F concentration which was about the same as that in children who had been taking caries‐preventive tablet doses for years. The percentage of a single F dose excreted in the urine within 4 h after the ingestion of F tablets or an F‐salted standard meal was about the same in preschool children and middle‐aged adults. F quantities of the order 1.5–2 mg could be ingested by a child eating a meal comprising strongly F‐salted dishes, and the urine could reach concentrations around 3 parts/10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> F during the following 2–4 h. The results obtained support the concept that domestic salt containing about 500 parts/10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> F is suitable for clinical testing on a larger scale under Swedish conditions.
