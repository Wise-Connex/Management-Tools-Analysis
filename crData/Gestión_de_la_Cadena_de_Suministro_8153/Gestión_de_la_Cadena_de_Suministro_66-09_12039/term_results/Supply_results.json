Both exogenous TSH and experimentally increased endogenous TSH (secondary to the partial inhibition of thyroid function by sodiumperchlorate) caused a change in the T<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> ratio in favour of T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. This response of thyroid hormone production (in rats) and secretion (in rabbits) was found at different times after the use of <jats:sup>131</jats:sup>I. It depended on the intensity of the direct or indirect thyrotrophic stimulation. From this observation it is suggested that the synthesis and the secretion of the biologically more effective T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is more markedly increased during stimulation than is T<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> probably in order to compensate more successfully for deficiencies in the peripheral thyroid hormone supply.</jats:p>",
