For mineral deposits of each type in each geologic and political environment, the lowest cost metal will tend to be produced first because: (1) the largest deposits tend to be found first, (2) the few largest deposits should reap the benefits of economies of scale and will tend to account for the lion’s share of total metal, (3) higher grade deposits that require substantially less energy per ton of metal than do lower grade deposits will be mined first, and (4) deposits that have the mineralogy and grain sizes that are relatively cheap to process will be produced first. Shallow deposits that are relatively cheap to find and mine and deposits near existing infrastructure will also be produced first. Because stages in the supply process are sequential, problems at any stage caused by the physical factors are reflected in subsequent stages and adversely affect production costs. In the long term, effects of such problems will be not physical shortages of metals but a rapid or persistent increase in real prices of metals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a simplified method for the preparation of stability information for offshore supply vessels. The paper reviews the current methods used by the Eighth Coast Guard District Merchant Marine Technical Office for preparation of stability information and compares these with the proposed \"simplified\" method. The simplified stability letter incorporates a loading diagram which will make it easier for the vessel operator to use. The recommended letter will allow designers to obtain a higher maximum amount of deck cargo, provide more flexibility in the manner in which cargoes are carried, allow operators to exchange consumables for additional below-deck cargo, and simplify the calculations necessary for preparation of the stability information. It should be cautioned that the method presented is only the opinion of the authors. Approval should be obtained from the cognizant Coast Guard technical office before employing this or any other proposed method. It should also be noted that the stability criteria presented in Appendix I are not yet included in regulations and are subject to change.</jats:p>",

After 10 weeks, the rate of nitrogen fixation was estimated by the acetylene reduction (AR) technique on the intact plants in soil, after which the plants were harvested, both shoots and roots. The yield of medic, in both monoculture and mixture, increased with increasing rate of phosphate application to an optimum at a level of 160 ppm phosphorus and then decreased again at higher phosphate levels. AR activity was similarly dependent on phosphate application and was optimal at the same phosphate level as was yield. AR activity was extremely low in the ryegrass monocultures, the yield of which was optimized at only 10 ppm phosphorus. The community x phosphate interaction on AR activity per plant of medic was not statistically significant, there being considerable variability in this measurement; the suppression of nitrogen fixation by competition from ryegrass near its own phosphate optimum was not therefore established in this study, but remains a possibility. Ryegrass plants benefited individually from growing in mixed culture with the legume, producing as much shoot dry matter from three plants in mixture as from six in monoculture. The advantage in mixture was due either to reduced competition offered by medic or to transfer of fixed nitrogen from legume to grass. Higher concentrations and contents of nitrogen per plant in mixture provided circumstantial evidence for the latter. However, on a pot basis, nitrogen content of ryegrass was similar in pure culture and in mixture. The relevance of the data to the results of a survey of farmers' fields is discussed.</jats:p>"

Removal of flower buds and high nitrogen supply stimulated elongation of the main stem and the number of fruiting positions per plant. Nitrogen supply increased both main stem node number and mean internode length whereas flower bud removal increased only the number of nodes on the main stem.     Flower bud removal did not reduce total dry matter yields, number of flowers produced or number of bolls. Vegetative organs provided efficient storage for excess assimilates resulting from the complete suppression of fruiting activity. Plants subjected to nitrogen stress had lower dry matter yield, number of flowers and number of bolls. Compensation following flower bud removal was greater at higher than at lower nitrogen supply. Relative fruitfulness, the partition of biomass between vegetative and reproductive organs, was not affected by either flower bud removal or nitrogen supply.</jats:p>"

Copper deficiency markedly depressed top and root growth without producing any distinctive symptoms. It retarded phasic development by delaying development of leaves and lateral branches, senescence of plant parts, and flowering: it also depressed the proportion of stem plus petiole in plant tops and decreased internode elongation, pollen fertility and the number of burrs and seeds formed. As a result of its effect in delaying flowering, copper deficiency would depress seed production particularly strongly when low soil water supply shortens the growing season. The need for suitable procedures for diagnosing copper deficiency is emphasized by the lack of specific plant symptoms in this species.</jats:p>"

This study has investigated the effects of growth stages, leaf position, transpiration rate, and N supply in relation to rate of this loss on rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.).</jats:p><jats:p>A pyro‐chemiluminescent method was used to quantify the volatile N loss along with the transpirational water vapors from rice leaves. Calculations, based on collected data, estimate N loss of 14.1 (‘Bonnet 73’) to 15.2 (‘Starbonnet’) kg/ha from plant leaves over a l00day period. Rate of N loss decreased during the period between tillering and 1 to 3 weeks beyond panicle initiation after which it increased as plants progressed to the heading stage. The most recently matured leaf lost N at a higher rate than older leaves. The N concentration in nutrient solution did not affect rate of volatile N loss per unit of leaf area of the most recently matured leaf; however, older leaves supplied with high rates of N lost N at a higher rate than those grown in low‐N medium. Volatile N lost per plant increased with N supply mainly due to higher leaf area and higher N loss rate from older leaves. Quantifying the physiological influences on volatile N loss can help to determine the time for application and the amounts of N fertilizers needed for optimum rice production. Additional</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effects of phosphorus supply on the relationship of copper supply with copper concentrations in various plant parts and yield of Seaton Park subterranean clover were examined. Plants were grown in a glasshouse for 40 and 74 days in pots with four levels of potassium phosphate (0, 13, 39, 65 mg phosphorus/pot) and six levels of copper sulfate (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 pg copper/pot) added, in factorial combination, to a sand deficient in both phosphorus and copper. By increasing the phosphorus levels copper deficiency was induced partly by promoting growth and diluting copper concentrations in plants; and also by depressing copper absorption. Increasing phosphorus changed the distribution of copper in plant tops and the shape of curves relating copper concentration in whole plant tops to yield. At 39 mg phosphorus/pot, the relationship at Day 74 had a marked 'Piper-Steenbjerg' curvature, largely as a result of unusually high copper concentrations in the stems plus petioles of severely copper-deficient plants. At 65 mg phosphorus/pot, the relationship had no 'Piper-Steenbjerg' curvature for whole tops and only a relatively small curvature for stems plus petioles. The data suggests that 'Piper-Steenbjerg' curves in subterranean clover result primarily from high concentrations of copper in the stems plus petioles of severely deficient plants. At both harvests, young leaf blades had critical copper concentrations of around 3 �g copper/g at both 39 and 65 mg phosphorus/pot. However, copper-deficient plants with severe phosphorus deficiency did not respond to copper, and generally had copper concentrations below this critical level in all plant parts. The results confirm the value of copper analysis of young leaf blades for diagnosing copper deficiency in subterranean clover with moderately deficient to luxury supplies of phosphorus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of copper supply upon the distribution of copper within Seaton Park subterranean clover was examined from early vegetative growth to plant maturity in one glasshouse experiment, and in a second experiment was assessed at early flowering. The copper content of old leaf blades of copper-adequate plants decreased progressively with senescence of the blades. Copper deficiency delayed senescence and export of copper from the older blades so that both the relative and net changes were substantially smaller than for blades of copper-adequate plants. However, copper concentrations in senesced old leaf blades still reflected copper supply. At full senescence these blades contained appreciable quantities and concentrations of copper which contrasted with the low levels found in senesced leaves of wheat and peanuts in previous studies. Copper concentration in whole plant tops was not satisfactory for diagnosing copper deficiency, since the critical concentration decreased with plant age and during late vegetative development 'Piper-Steenbjerg' curvature developed in the relationship between copper concentration and yield. It is possible that the curvature resulted partly from unusually high concentrations of copper in the old petioles of severely deficient plants. Analysis of copper in young leaf blades provided a sensitive means of diagnosing copper deficiency in subterranean clover. The estimated critical concentration for these blades (3 �g/g for maximum growth) did not change with plant age, at least until early flowering. In early growth, the copper concentration of young leaf blades may be used to forecast impending copper deficiency.</jats:p>"
