Based on a survey among manufacturers in three countries, it was found that a reconfiguration is needed for the creation of a customized supply chain. In this reconfiguration process, transportation considerations are extremely important, resulting in supply chains and distribution channels that are globalized and reliant on international transport. Postponement is increasingly applied in both manufacturing and distribution. Thus, through the facilitation of postponement and customization activities in the distribution channel, much business is to be gained for transportation and logistics companies.</jats:p>"

The process usually includes planning, procurement, storage, call off and onshore preparation of completion components and assemblies. At current daily costs for rigs and fixed platforms, the consequences of late supply or failure of just one item can be significant and may exceed the original purchase cost of the entire completion.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Major completion components include subsurface safety valves, landing nipples, circulating devices, expansion joints, production packers, and seal assemblies. Hundreds of components may be handled due to variations in well type, well conditions, casing size, tubing thread, and individual well engineers' preferences. Accessory items such as pup joints, flow couplings, blast joints, and crossovers must also be coordinated. Involvement of several different suppliers can further complicate the process.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Two operating units of a major North Sea Operator have joined forces to implement a new approach to improve efficiency and reduce the overall cost of downhole completion equipment by issuing a joint, pan-European tender. European Community regulations were adhered to in generation of a \"functional requirements\" tender, as opposed to a full specification tender. This enabled potential suppliers to propose \"fit for purpose\" equipment which already has a proven track record rather than new designs, which would require testing to prove compliance with a client specific specification. Following the \"functional requirements\" tender, a commercial tender was completed. The commercial tender included options for the level of materials management covered by the service companies who satisfied the functional requirements.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Details of operating value drivers used to direct focus on potential cost savings are described as well as how total cost of ownership has been reduced to the benefit of both the end users and the lead suppliers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Performance measures developed for the agreement are discussed, as well as how these measures reflect progress towards stated goals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors feel that the processes and procedures presented in this paper have considerable potential benefit to other oil and gas operating companies.</jats:p>",

Examination of the academic literature found little work linking TQM and the industry. The study confirms the applicability of TQM in the food supply and distribution industry. The list of TQM characteristics identified are not dissimilar to those in other industries. However, as part of the service sectors, there is a requirement of organisationds in this business sector to be highly focused on customer needs and changes in market trends.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Quantity Flexibility (QF) contract is a method for coordinating materials and information flows in supply chains operating under rolling-horizon planning. It stipulates a maximum percentage revision each element of the period-by-period replenishment schedule is allowed per planning iteration. The supplier is obligated to cover any requests that remain within the upside limits. The bounds on reductions are a form of minimum purchase commitment which discourages the customer from overstating its needs. While QF contracts are being implemented in industrial practice, the academic literature has thus far had little guidance to offer a firm interested in structuring its supply relationships in this way. This paper seeks to address this need, by developing rigorous conclusions about the behavioral consequences of QF contracts, and hence about the implications for the performance and design of supply chains with linkages possessing this structure. Issues explored include the impact of system flexibility on inventory characteristics and the patterns by which forecast and order variability propagate along the supply chain. The ultimate goal is to provide insights as to where to position flexibility for the greatest benefit, and how much to pay for it. </jats:p>",

In these instances, it is often the mismatch between expectations and the company’s activities undertaken to achieve the desired performance gain that fuels their dissatisfaction with EDI. This same mismatch often causes academic research into EDI and supply chain management to lose focus. This article presents a framework of EDI benefits in a supply chain management context that can be used to match a company’s EDI efforts with its desired outcomes from EDI use. The framework states that two critical factors to understanding EDI’s impact on supply chain management are the span of management control of the business process in question and whether EDI directly or indirectly influences that same business process. The proposed framework is then used to develop a research agenda for EDI and supply chain management. We suggest possible directions for research methods, measure development and hypothesis generation that can be used in future research studies.</jats:p>",

Within and close to the tongue, the nerve is supplied by branches from the lingual artery. Damage to the vessels supplying the nerve may account for some cases of hypoglossal palsy after carotid endarterectomy.

The data obtained have been compared to those of the ecological estimation, performed by the same team in the period 1992-1993. We have attempted to make an ecological classification of the dam water and to qualify it in compliance with the norms effective in Bulgaria. In accordance with the ecological classification, the water meets the requirements for a 1st category water basin, with a fully preserved self-purifying capacity, providing the possibility for its use, after compulsory sanitary processing, as a possible alternative water supply for Varna city.</jats:p>",

Redefinition of the firm as a service provider instead of a product manufacturer means that function, not form, is the source of added value delivered to the customer. To realize the dematerialization benefits of such a transformation requires a fundamental realignment of the supplier‐customer relationship. Instead of the traditional incentives to maximize the volume of physical product sold, servicizing requires a partnership wherein the financial rewards of reduced material consumption are shared between supplier and customer. We illustrate this partnership concept with the example of chemical management services (CMS), an approach that is gaining momentum in the automobile and electronics sector. Compensation and gain‐sharing based on chemical efficiency and chemical use reduction, often tied to fixed price mechanisms, lie at the core of the CMS model. Diffusion of the servicizing model holds much promise for driving dematerialization while reducing the environmental burden of product manufacturers.</jats:p>",

That potential, however, is currently being denied full realization by a chronic and severe shortage of cadaveric organs that are made available for this use. In recent years, medical practitioners, social scientists, and others have debated the virtues of allowing markets for cadaveric organs to form as a way to end the current shortage. In this debate, market opponents have argued,</jats:italic> inter alia, <jats:italic>that (1) organ collections may fall with payment of positive prices and (2) the price required to equilibrate organ supply and demand would be high. On the other hand, proponents of organ markets have argued that financial inducements could save many lives and that the equilibrium price is likely to be low. While dozens of papers have been published debating this issue, to date no one has provided any empirical evidence to resolve these important questions of supply. This paper provides preliminary evidence suggesting that potential donors would be relatively responsive to financial inducements and, accordingly, that the price required to eliminate the current shortage of organs is surprisingly low.

Paper, composed principally of wood fiber, is an essential commodity in promoting literacy, communication, documentation, and packaging. However, there is much concern about the world's forests being over-utilized. This has led to serious repercussions, not only to humanity, but also to the earth's biodiversity as a whole. It is now time that forests be used in a more responsible and ethical manner. Because of reduced forest area, increasing pulpwood costs, and an increasing demand for pulp and paper products, it might be expected that the focus would shift to high yield pulping processes or to the use of cellulosic non-wood raw materials. Non-woods are available in good supply all over the world, but are currently under-utilized. It is estimated that replacing 5–10% of wood pulp with non-wood pulp would have an important impact on the conservation of forests and the environment. This replacement of wood pulp by non-wood pulp could be environmentally and economically acceptable even in developed countries. By doing so, pulp and paper mills would have a lead role in reducing their dependency on forests for fiber. This determination and commitment would enhance the long-term sustainability of forests and the pulp and paper industry. Above all, it would be a sustainable step towards \"our common future.\" Key words: forest, sustainable development, fiber supply, pulp and paper, non-woods </jats:p>",
