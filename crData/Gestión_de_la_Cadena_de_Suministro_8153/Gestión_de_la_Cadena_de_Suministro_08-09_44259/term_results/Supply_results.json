      "abstract": "<jats:p>The potable water supply concept reflects relationships between distribution of available water resources that determine hydrogeological attributes of the region, and distribution of water service areas. The distribution of the water resources is often uneven, which is one of reasons of development of extensive long distance water supply systems. The long distance water supply systems connect deficit areas with surplus water resources areas. For example, the yield of large capacity wells in Danube region near Bratislava is several times higher than the real demand in this region. In this case, water from the wells is transferred by multiple pumping over a long distance (tens or hundreds of kilometres) to the areas with shortage of sources. The Little Carpathians foothills, where local water sources (springs) do not give a sufficient yield all year long. Most of these springs offer high-quality water, but fluctuating yields of the sources and do not guarantee continuous water supply. The sources are important for its quality and yield as well as for their elevation. The elevation potential allows gravity water supply without a need for pumping. However, the water supply systems do not even use average yields of the springs. The balance capacity of the springs is technically designed for minimum yields. Therefore, several reasonable questions arise: Is it efficient to pump and transport water over a long distance even in the time of maximum yields of the gravity springs? How can we determine efficiency rate of use of such yield in its extreme status? The answers can be found in the analysis of the necessary technical measures and investments, and calculation of operating costs of a system dependent on variable yield of gravity springs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purchasing and supply management (PSM) has become a discipline of major strategic importance for effectively competing in today's global marketplace. Literature recognizes that the full value‐creation potential of the purchasing function can only be realized if its decisions and activities are aligned with the organization's overall strategic orientation. Despite general agreement on this matter, research and practice lacks knowledge on how exactly such an alignment can be achieved and what performance implications it has. Therefore, this article empirically investigates the alignment–performance link in PSM in a comprehensive manner. Drawing on the theory of production competence, we suggest that the relative fit between business strategy and purchasing strategy, labeled as strategic alignment, and between purchasing strategy and purchasing practices, referred to as purchasing efficacy, is key to achieving superior financial performance. Results from profile deviation analysis on data collected globally from 141 strategic business units (SBUs) with revenues greater than US$S3 billion support our hypotheses. Findings provide clear guidance to managers on how to design their purchasing strategies and practices to achieve maximum alignment and thus to effectively contribute to the SBU's financial success.</jats:p>",

Manufacturing capabilities are enhanced by supplier innovativeness directly, because of the embedded nature of the supplied component, and indirectly, as the manufacturer learns from its suppliers. We use organizational learning theory to develop a conceptual model of learning factors that act as contingencies and magnify the effect of supplier innovativeness. First, we argue that a manufacturer's absorptive capacity, its ability to learn and use external knowledge, positively moderates the impact of supplier innovativeness on the manufacturer's performance. Second, we examine how different combinations of manufacturer–supplier learning styles lead to relatively more or less interorganizational learning, contingent upon whether the outsourcing is design versus manufacturing oriented. Our model can help managers consider knowledge transfer as part of their supplier selection criteria.</jats:p>",

Nine academic journals were investigated and a subject categorization is developed for SCM research. A content analysis was then conducted on 405 articles, focusing on the categories covered within the SCM literature, various levels of the chain examined and sample populations and industries studied, as well as the research methods employed. Finally, a conceptual framework of the most highly researched categories in SCM indicates that there is a need for more research that seeks to understand the nature of multiple links in SCM chains and networks, as opposed to focusing on dyadic and inter‐firm relationships.</jats:p>",

However, many supplier relationships are characterized by differing levels of dependence between the parties, which has the potential to influence the outcomes achieved. We build and test an empirical model to examine how buyer firms respond to dependency on a supplier by undertaking either socialization processes or closer integration in order to achieve relational capital. Using empirical data collected from 111 UK purchasing executives, a structural equation model is used to test the theoretical framework. The results provide support for four of the five hypotheses developed. Buyer firms facing high supplier dependency are found to undertake socialization processes to mitigate the dependency and generate relational capital. However, buyer dependency did not, in isolation, lead to increased levels of supplier integration. The study extends our understanding of how firms deal with asymmetric power within their supplier relationships and suggests important implications for both research and practice.</jats:p>",

Disruptions to the supply chain can have a profound effect on the firm ranging from loss of revenue to increased costs when operations don’t proceed as planned.

In addition, batch experiments were performed in order to analyze the influence of pH value, organic precursor concentration and temperature on the inactivation efficiency of Chironomid larvae with ozone. Based on it, removal effect of different pre-oxidation combined with coagulation process on Chironomid larvae in raw water was evaluated. The results showed that ozone possessed better inactivation performance than chlorine, and complete inactivation of Chironomid larvae in raw water was obtained at ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L after 25 minutes of contact time. The inactivation rate of Chironomid larvae at pH 6.0 was higher than those found at pH 8.0 in same contact time. Meanwhile, the organic precursor had negative effects on inactivation, indicated by the decreasing inactivation rate from 100% at TOC concentration of 0 mg/L to 20.0% at 8 mg/L after 30 min of contact time. With regard to the temperature, the inactivation efficiency of Chironomid larvae improved with the temperature increasing within the range investigated of 10–25°C. The inactivation rate was reduced by 73.3% when temperature reduced from 25°C to10°C. The coagulation jar test showed that Chironomid larvae in the raw water could be completely removed by ozone pre-oxidation combined with the coagulation process at ozone dosage of 1.2 mg/L.</jats:p>",

Changing the behaviours of less responsive water users requires a better understanding of what shapes water conservation behaviours. Programs and conservation behaviour models need to take account of both ‘internal’ influences, such as attitudes and habits, and ‘external’ influences, such as the water delivery environment, pricing and social norms for water use.</jats:p>",

While models such as EPANET are powerful tools in hydraulic simulations, they have limited use in simulating water quality, containing only a basic chlorine decay subroutine. This paper presents a study on the use of a link that was developed to couple the external water quality models and the hydraulic model of EPANET 2.The coupled model has been applied to a hypothetical distribution system under steady and non steady conditions. Simulations have taken the form of sensitivity analyses to probe operational strategies such as modified treatment as well as optimized secondary disinfection in order to maintain sufficient chlorine residual at critical points within the distribution system. Simulations have also been performed to compare the relative rates of formation of THMs vs HAAs as well as individual species. Of particular interest is optimization of chlorine dose to minimize residual chlorine under non-steady-state conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Performance assessment (PA) of urban infrastructure services, mainly in the case of water systems, is becoming a major issue worldwide. Therefore, in the last decade, the need for a clear definition of management objectives of water services and the subsequent need to monitor goals achievement have led to the development of some initiatives to tackle the evaluation of the efficiency of those services, their main aim being the definition of systems of performance indicators. However, these PA systems are strongly oriented by a management/economic perspective and technical aspects have often been ignored. In addition, none of them has specifically addressed the drinking water treatment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents a proposal for a PI system that applies to drinking water treatment facilities as a part of a standardised methodology for performance assessment. In total, ca. 80 PI have been defined and classified according to seven evaluation domains, namely: treated water quality; plant reliability; use of natural resources and raw materials; by-products management; safety; human resources; and, economical and financial resources.</jats:p>",

The author seeks to explain how this enviable supply of cadavers was achieved, why it provoked so little opposition at a time when Britain and the United States saw widespread protests against dissection, and how it was threatened from mid-century onward. To understand permissive Viennese attitudes, we need to place them in a longue durée history of death and dissection and to pay close attention to the city’s political geography as it was transformed into a major imperial capital. The tolerant stance of the Roman Catholic Church, strong links to Southern Europe, and the weak position of individuals in the absolutist state all contributed to an idiosyncratic anatomical culture. But as the fame of the Vienna medical school peaked in the later 1800s, the increased demand created by rising numbers of students combined with intensified interdisciplinary competition to produce a shortfall that professors found increasingly difficult to meet. Around 1900, new religious groups and mass political parties challenged long-standing anatomical practice by refusing to supply cadavers and making dissection into an instrument of political struggle. This study of the material preconditions for anatomy at one of Europe’s most influential medical schools provides a contrast to the dominant Anglo-American histories of death and dissection.\n\t</jats:p>",

An Arabian tribe, the Nabataeans, monopolized this trade nearly two thousand years ago. Their supply chain, with a hub-and-spoke structure, partnerships, value-added services, innovative packaging, and early adoption of technology, bears striking resemblance to those of today. It differed though, in its elaborate and painstaking security precautions. This tight security was mandated by the lawlessness of the era and the high value of the merchandise. The Nabataean supply chain maintained its competitive advantage for more than five centuries. This article compares it with those of today and examines the Nabataeans, a nomadic tribe that shaped the basic concepts of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

In this article a methodology is introduced to first identify vulnerable sites of a water supply system (WSS) and second to estimate the potential effect of alpine natural hazards on this system. The approach serves for the definition of zones with low, medium and high potential risk by combining vulnerability and hazard maps. This approach enables the possibility to accomplish prevention measures on risky sites considering the available budget. A management support tool (VulNetWS - Vulnerability of Water Supply Networks) is developed which quantifies vulnerability based on hydraulic and quality simulations assuming component failure of each single WSS component. Hazards of flooding, landslide, debris flow and avalanches are calculated and categorized in potential low, medium and high hazard zones. For this analysis different GIS data sets (e.g. Austrian hazard zone maps, HORA “Flood Risk Zoning”) are used. The methodology is presented by applying it upon an alpine region encompassing the municipality of Kitzbühel (Tyrol - Austria) and 4 neighbouring municipalities. The combination of vulnerability and hazard is summarized using a risk matrix that highlights a zone of 0.42 square kilometres within the study area as being potentially risky.</jats:p>",

We start with evaluating each “supplier‐supply item” combination and compute gross averages for each of the SQDC areas and finally arrive at an “Overall Performance Index” for each supplier‐supply item combination. These indices form a “Vendor Performance Dashboard” for decision making. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The case study shows that the proposed method is quick and easy to adopt, and provides a logical framework for vendor selection and management, based on performance in the four critical (SQDC) areas. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Research limitations/implications</jats:bold></jats:bold> – A lot of monotonous computations are required for the proposed vendor evaluation process.

Moreover, the current context, in which almost 70% of funds for the sector are channelled through national governments, emphasises the importance of a monitoring system for national water sectors in developing countries. From this, an improvement in investment efficiency is expected. The water point mapping methodology, promoted and widely developed by the international organization WaterAid, is presented as an alternative way of defining water access indicators. The present paper describes its potential for defining new indicators and making improvements. Our research is based on the results of a pilot study carried out by Ingeniería Sin Fronteras (Engineering without Borders, Spain) in the Same district, Tanzania. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges posed by the implementation of this methodology and proposes further steps for improvement.</jats:p>",

Preozonation reduced dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and TOCl formation but increasing ozone (O3) dosages did not necessarily reduce the formation of THM, 1,1-dichloro-2-propanone (1,1-DCP) and total organic bromine (TOBr). Increasing coagulant doses reduced the formation of most DBPs and TOCl.

Multivariate analyses such as hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were performed to investigate the relationships between the quality of source water used for water supply and various factors that affect the purification process. Based on these results, water sources throughout Japan were clearly categorised into four groups, and suitable water purification systems were identified for the different water quality groups. The results can serve as an important reference for water utilities during future facility renewal projects.</jats:p>",

The average daily water demand of the area amounts to about 50,000 m3. Approximately 30 % of the total demand is covered by the bulk water supply from the Zentral Wasser Versorgung Hochschwab Süd. The waterworks Friesach and Andritz, which cover the additional 70 % of the water demand, operate by means of artificial groundwater recharge plants where horizontal filter wells serve as drawing shafts. The groundwater recharge systems serve to increase the productivity of the aquifer and to reduce the share of the infiltration from the Mur River. Protection areas have been identified to ensure that the water quality of the aquifer stay at optimal levels. The protection areas are divided into zones indicating various restrictions for usage and planning. Two respective streams serve as the source for the water recharge plants. Different infiltration systems are utilised. Each of the various artificial groundwater recharge systems displays specific advantages and disadvantages in terms of operation as well as maintenance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to secure a sustainable drinking water supply the recharge capacity will be increased.

In future experiments the performance of alternative grain size distributions as well as planting the top soil will be tested. Additionally, in order to optimize the additional groundwater recharge structures the composition of the subsurface water regarding its origin is statistically analyzed.</jats:p>",

Its application is demonstrated in this study to assess the impacts of climate change on the reservoir water quality and water treatment plant (WTP) operations at Myponga, South Australia. The primary aim is to provide water treatment plant operators with knowledge of the potential impacts and associated probabilities of occurrence of climate change, enabling them to make informed, risk-based adaptation and planning decisions. It was found that climate change alone poses little risk to WTP operations, with the WTP able to operate as normal under all future climate scenarios. This finding not only reflects the specific catchment characteristics of Myponga, but also the assumptions made in this study. When interpreting these findings to develop comprehensive adaptation plans, operators must also take into account potential non-climate changes such as land use and demand.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the paper is divided into two logical parts. The first part represents earlier researches about risk recognition within the sphere of supply chains. The distinction between terms “uncertainty” and “risk” is discussed. Based on the predefined supply chain functions, additional risks connected with supply chain reliability are recognized. Then, a conception of simulation‐based risk evaluation approach is discussed. Within the second part of the paper, a numerical example is provided, within which a simplified supply chain system is defined and corresponding risk evaluation is performed.\n\n\nSantrauka\n\n\nŠiame straipsnyje nagrinėjamos problemos, susijusios su tiekimo grandinės rizikos identifikavimu ir modeliavimu pagrįstu rizikos įvertinimu.

An aid decision tool was developed for the calculation of the risk of bromate formation using water quality data and plant operational conditions which helped to develop operational recommendation guide for ozonation process on the basis of different treatment scenario simulations. The model was adapted, tested and validated on six full scale plants located near Paris area, and can be easily used by the operators in their everyday work. The tool has shown to be efficient in prediction of the bromate risk in treated water for different water qualities and operating conditions and allowed to establish the levels of risk (low, medium and high). It can be used successfully as support to establish guidelines for risk management focusing on optimization of disinfection and oxidation processes involving ozone.</jats:p>",

In this phase many operational parameters, raw water quality as well as the second oxidant dose applied, sodium hypochlorite, importantly influence the chlorite and chlorate formation. The operational parameters and the raw water quality correlated with chlorite and chlorate formation were: contact time, chemical doses, temperature, turbidity, organic substances (non-purgeable organic carbon and UV254nm absorbance), pH, iron and ammonium concentration. Given the high numbers of variables two models have been developed. The first one (complex) includes all the studied parameters; the other model (simplified) takes into account only the parameters that gave a significant correlation (&amp;gt;0.55) with the dependent variable. Nearly 60% of the predictions for chlorite formation were observed to be within ±40% of the measured levels and the found key parameters were the water organic content and the physico-chemical characteristics (pH and temperature). Nearly 85% of the predictions for chlorate formation were observed to be within ±40% of the measured levels and the found key parameters were again the chemical physical water characteristics (pH and temperature) and the applied chemicals doses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The commercial transportation of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline is receiving increased attention in South Africa. Transnet Pipeline Transport has recently obtained permission from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to construct and operate a new petroleum products pipeline of 60 cm diameter from Durban to Gauteng. At an operating speed of 10 km/h the proposed 60 cm Transnet pipeline would be able to deliver 3,54 million litres of petroleum product per hour. This is equivalent to 89 deliveries per hour using road tank vehicles with an average carrying capacity of 40 000 litres of fuel per vehicle. This pipeline throughput is also equivalent to two trains departing per hour, each consisting of 42 petroleum tank wagons with an average carrying capacity of 42 500 litres of fuel per wagon. Considering that such road trucks and rail wagons return empty to the upstream refineries in Durban, it is clear that there is no tenable long-term alternative to pipeline transport:pipeline transport is substantially cheaper than road and rail transport;pipeline transport is much safer than rail and especially road transport; andpipeline transport frees up alternative road and rail transport capacity.Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport for the carriage of suitable liquids (for example, petroleum commodities, which include crude oil, refined fuel products and liquid petro-chemicals), gas, slurrified coal and certain water-suspended ores and minerals. InSouth Africa, petroleum products account for the majority of commercial pipeline traffic, followed by crude oil and natural gas. There are three basic types of petroleum pipeline transport systems:Gathering pipeline systemsCrude oil trunk pipeline systemsRefined products pipeline systems Collectively, these systems provide a continuous link between extraction, processing, distribution, and wholesalers’ depots in areas of consumption. The following activities are involved in the flow of goods between place of origin and place of consumption or application:Demand forecasting, Facility site selection, Procurement,Materials handling, Packaging, Warehouse management, Inventory management,Order processing, Logistics communications, Transport, Reverse logistics. Because cost is incurred without adding value each time goods are handled (activity 4) at a terminal or storage facility, a primary logistics objective is to eliminate handling wherever possible. With the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline this objective is fully met. Commodity intake, haulage, and discharge are combined in one process, usually a remote-controlled operation. Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport thereby obviating the need for packaging (activity 5) and returning empty containers. Pipelines provide a direct and long-term link between these origins and destinations. If necessary a continuous service can be provided with no need for a return trip or a reverse pumping process (activity 11).The elimination of handling, packaging and reverse logistics activities contribute substantially to the high measure of economies of scale that pipeline transport enjoys. The article provides adscription of each of the eleven logistics activities in the context of pipeline transport. Effective logistics service is a prerequisite to help ensure that customers receive the required products at the desired quality and quantity, where and when needed. The most pertinent determinants of logistics service performance aresuitability, accessibility, goods security, transit time, reliability and flexibility. The article offers a discussion of the extent to which pipeline transport conforms to each of these measures of effectiveness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Setting appropriate prices, as one of the most versatile tools of demand management, is increasingly being promoted to send out the proper signal that water is a valuable resource and should be used accordingly, especially where resources are limited. Setting prices is also critical to assure affordable access by lower-income households. The price-setting process, within the government's existing legal framework, given the challenge of growing water scarcity and skewed income distribution in Windhoek (capital of Namibia), is explored in this paper. Based on fieldwork undertaken in Namibia, the paper considers policies relevant to the price-setting process; the cost of service provision; affordability of services and perceptions about the benefits of a future economic regulatory system. The researchers found that the price-setting process, although successful relative to many lower-income countries, could be improved with respect to transparency of decision-making and clarity regarding the incorporation of the interests and needs of various stakeholders. Respondents saw the need for a more autonomous level of economic regulation in order to ensure sustainability of improved urban water and sanitation services for all in Namibia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article assesses the regulatory model for urban water supply services in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Water supply services have been privately operated there since February 1998 after two companies—Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), operating in Eastern Jakarta, and PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA), operating in Western Jakarta—signed 25‐years concession contracts with the state‐owned Jakarta City Water Company (PAM Jaya). An independent regulatory body, the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) was established in 2001. The article compares the regulatory system in Jakarta with the French and English approaches to water regulation. It then assesses this regulatory system from the perspective of customers in order to assess how well customer protection, a central purpose of regulation, is being performed. The article concludes that although the essential regulatory mechanisms and activities are operating in Jakarta, the key regulatory role of customer protection is not being performed because customers do not perceive that they receive an acceptable level of water supply services.

Empirical data were obtained from 270 farmers who used credit. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and statistical models. Analysis revealed that farmers who used credit were younger (average: 47 years old), and that cultivated farm sizes (average: 3.8 ha) were larger than the national average. The statistical models showed that the interest rate, farm expenditure, the amount borrowed from alternative sources, farm size and savings were the main determinants of credit demand, while interest rates charged, the level of savings of respondents, the amount of loan demanded and the proportion of previous loans repaid were the major determinants of credit supply. In order to improve the agricultural sector, formal lending institutions should target younger farmers, including women, use group and social assets as collateral rather than physical assets, charge commercial interest rates, mobilize savings through their rural outposts and give medium-term rather than short-term loans. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate a supply chain system with a common supplier selling to downstream retailers who are engaged in both price and inventory competition. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the pure‐strategy Nash equilibrium for the retailer game and study how a supplier can coordinate the system to achieve the best performance. Our main conclusions are as follows: First, a buyback contract can be used to coordinate retailers competing on both price and inventory in a sense that optimal retail prices and inventory levels arise as the Pareto‐dominant equilibrium. With symmetric retailers, the system optimum arises as the unique symmetric equilibrium. Second, the particular type of competition experienced by retailers (price versus inventory competition) affects the characteristics of the contract. Specifically, strong price competition leads to a coordination mechanism with a positive buyback rate, where the supplier subsidizes retailers for leftover inventories; however, strong inventory competition leads to a negative buyback rate, where retailers are punished for overstocking. Using a linear expected demand function, we further explore the impact of system parameters on the coordination contract and the competitive equilibrium. We also find that the performance of the supplier's optimal contract is asymptotic to the system optimal coordination contract as competition becomes fierce. </jats:p>",

Daily variability in larval supply at two mussel‐dominated hydrothermal vents, East Wall and Choo Choo, near 9º50’N, East Pacific Rise, was quantified concurrently with hydrodynamic observations to investigate local dispersal processes. The magnitude and temporal variation in supply differed between the two vent sites despite their close proximity, 1.6 km. Larval supply was relatively high and uninterrupted at East Wall compared to low and episodic at Choo Choo. Observed variation in larval supply was compared to predictions based on advective transport from larval sources at neighboring vents. Variation in larval supply at Choo Choo correlated with along‐axis southward currents, consistent with larval transport from a northern larval source. Larval supply to East Wall appeared to be independent of current velocities, suggesting that larvae came from multiple sources north of and south of and possibly including East Wall. Transport of larvae from discrete local sources can explain differences in larval supply to vent communities, even on spatial scales of kilometers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water is an essential requirement in everyday life and global demand for clean usable\nwater is increasing year by year. Therefore, developing and implementing effective water resource\nmanagement and conservation strategies is vital. Generally speaking, most individuals (particularly\nsenior citizens) prefer to use warm water when washing their hands or taking a bath. When hot water\nis left standing in the hot water pipe (i.e. the faucet is turned off), it will gradually cool. Consequently,\nwhen the faucet is first turned on, the water is generally allowed to run until it becomes sufficiently\nhot. Meanwhile, the original cooler water is simply drained away. Clearly, this approach is wasteful\nof both time and water. Therefore, this paper develops a green storage tank to perform a\nthermo-controlled water supply function. The tank is positioned between the hot water supply and the\nfaucet and its operation is controlled by an electro-thermal thin-film heater and a thermo-controlled\nvalve. When the faucet is turned on, the cooler water in the hot water pipe is directed into the tank.\nOnce this water enters the tank, it is mixed with hot water stored inside until it acquires the desired\ntemperature. The warmed water is then supplied to the faucet. When the water flowing through the\nhot pipe to the tank is already sufficiently warm for use, the thermo-controlled water supply function\nis automatically overridden, and the warm water is delivered directly to the faucet. The proposed\ngreen storage tank not only provides effective water and energy resource savings, but also provides a\nmore convenient operation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Poultry production is an important and growing livestock industry in Iowa and use of poultry manure as a crop N resource is increasing. Aerobic incubation studies were used to examine potentially available nitrogen (PAN) from poultry manure using two contrasting Iowa agricultural soils, a Clarion loam (fine‐loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) and Canisteo clay loam (fine‐loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquolls). Two consecutive incubation experiments were conducted, each using the same soils and treatments. Incubation 1 used an approximate rate of 86 mg total N kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> incubated for 112 d, and Incubation 2 used an approximate rate of 200 mg total N kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> incubated for 84 d. Incubation 2 included more frequent initial sampling. Nitrogen sources included urea, uric acid, and two sources of poultry manure, chicken (<jats:italic>Gallus domesticus</jats:italic>) and turkey (<jats:italic>Melleagris gallopavo</jats:italic>) obtained from local production facilities. Soil samples were collected at multiple times during incubation and inorganic NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>–N and NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N concentrations measured. The accumulation of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N was used to estimate PAN. The poultry manure sources provided high levels of PAN, 66% of total manure N for chicken and 55% for turkey. These values were lower than those found for urea and uric acid. The majority of the NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N accumulation occurred within 7 d of incubation, with no increase after 14 d. This indicates that considerable NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>–N used to estimate PAN originated from the combined NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>–N and uric acid–N components of the poultry manures. However, water soluble nitrogen (WSN) represented approximately 66 and 58% of total N for the chicken and turkey manure, respectively, which are higher than the NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>–N plus uric acid–N fractions. These WSN levels are close to the estimated PAN values for each manure source. This indicates that poultry manure analysis for WSN could improve the estimation of crop available–N compared to NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>–N or a fraction of total N.</jats:p>",

Risks related to transaction costs and strategic resources were both significant. Of the three main risks identified, asset risk and competence risk are more serious concerns than relationship risk. The values of information risk and loss of control account for the bulk of asset risk, while those of poor competence leverage and poor competence in supporting customer service comprise competence risk.

Additionally, we investigate how the level of information availability moderates problem solving approach on supply chain performance. We draw on construal level theory from the experimental psychology literature to explain how the problem solving approaches (abstract problem solving approach vs. concrete problem solving approach) contribute to supply chain performance. From this foundation, we run a series of behavioral experiments to test our hypotheses that problem solving approaches and information availability impact supply chain performance as presented in the beer distribution game. A key finding of this study is that individuals who take an abstract problem solving approach are able to perform better than individuals who take a concrete problem solving approach in the context of limited information availability. However, in the context of complete information availability, the impact of both types of problem solving approaches on performance becomes negligible.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) seek to halve human poverty by 2015 and how organizations respond to this constitutes a formidable demand on Organizational Psychology. A key <jats:italic>process</jats:italic> for delivering more effective aid is the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which seeks collaborative contributions from a plethora of Organizations, including business organizations and professions like ours. We argue that a thoughtful articulation of what Organizational Psychology uniquely stands for, and can offer, is therefore needed. It is proposed that a key <jats:italic>mechanism</jats:italic> for addressing this challenge is a Task Force, whose functions will include the coordination of institutions within psychology, and linking them to those in development. We describe such a task force and outline its core mission (Reichman, Frese, Schein, Carr, MacLachlan, &amp; Landy, <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib29\">2008</jats:ext-link>). Organizational Psychology's response to poverty reduction should meet Lefkowitz's criteria for developing a more humanist model of science and practice as the MDGs are inherently humanist and values‐based.

To achieve corporate sustainability within any organisation, it is essential that sustainability issues are addressed throughout the organisation's whole supply chain, a process referred to as sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). The implementation of SCM and sustainability is, however, an extremely complex undertaking. Through an extensive literature review and detailed interviews, this research has identified the conditions and strategies for achieving SSCM within construction organisations. The research also investigated the meaning, barriers and enablers, issues, tools and techniques for achieving successful SCM and SSCM. The study was based on the perspectives of senior managers of exemplar organisations with a proven track record in sustainability and SCM. It has been possible to identify best practice from which other organisations can learn, thus supporting the industry in the move towards more sustainable construction practices. </jats:p>",

The results are based on a sample of 307 supply chain disruptions announced by publicly traded firms during 1987–1998. Our analysis shows that firms with more slack in their supply chain experience less negative stock market reaction. The extent of business diversification has no significant effect on the stock market reaction. Firms that are more geographically diversified experience a more negative stock market reaction. We find that firms with a high degree of vertical relatedness experience a less negative stock market reaction. These results have important implications on how firms design and operate their supply chains to mitigate the negative effect of supply chain disruptions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Both grouping estimators indicate that the labour supply of Canadian wives responded strongly to changes in husbands' wages during the 1980s. For the 1990s, our estimates of wives' cross‐wage elasticity display greater dispersion.</jats:p>",

Using improvement of water quality as objective for optimization can lead to new views on operation, design and concept of drinking water treatment plants. This is illustrated for ozonation in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration at drinking water treatment plant Weesperkarspel of Waternet, the water cycle company for Amsterdam and surrounding areas. The water quality parameters that are taken into account are assimilable organic carbon (AOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pathogens. The operational parameters that are taken into account are the ozone dosage and the regeneration frequency of the BAC filters. It is concluded that ozone dosage and regeneration frequency should be reduced in combination with application of newly developed insights in design of ozone installations. It is also concluded that a new concept for Weesperkarspel with an additional ion exchange (IEX) step for natural organic matter (NOM) removal will contribute to the improvement of the disinfection capacity of ozonation and the biological stability of the produced drinking water.</jats:p>",

Zn and iron (in plasma and testicular tissue), plasma antioxidant vitamins (A, E, and C), as well as testicular superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation indexes (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipoprotein oxidation susceptibility (LOS)), and inflammatory markers (plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and testicular tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) were determined. Serum testosterone and histological examination of the testis were performed also. We found a severe decrease in antioxidant vitamins and Zn, with concomitant iron accumulation. Zinc deficiency correlated positively with SOD, GSH, anti-oxidant vitamins and testosterone, and negatively with TBARS, LOS, CRP and TNF-α, demonstrating a state of oxidative stress and inflammation. We concluded that micronutrient deficiency, especially Zn, enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation in testicular tissue leading to under-development of testis and decreased testosterone levels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Galápagos Spreading Center (GSC) at 89°–95°W exhibits large gradients in magma supply at a relatively constant intermediate spreading rate, making this area an ideal natural laboratory to study the effects of magma supply on volcanism at seafloor spreading ridges. Prior work shows that the GSC develops from axial valley to shallow axial rise and a shallow magma sill, much like a typical fast spreading ridge, as the contribution of the hot spot increases. The volcanic morphology varies with magma supply in a predictable manner that we divide into three terrains based on the characteristic style of volcanic emplacement and edifice construction within each terrain. The volcanic cone terrain comprises most of the GSC and is characterized by prominent volcanic cones within a &gt;1 km wide and &gt;100 m deep axial graben. Approaching the area of maximum mantle plume influence at 91°W, the GSC axis lies along an elevated axial rise split by a &lt;1 km wide and &lt;100 m deep axial graben, and the style of volcanism shifts to axial volcanic ridge terrain characterized by axis‐elongate, low‐relief ridges of pillow lava. The lava channel terrain comprises only one segment on either side of the maximum magma supply at 91°W, where sheet lava flows and lava channels are relatively widespread. A general lengthening of seafloor fissures with increasing magma supply suggests a greater tendency toward linear source eruptions, in agreement with the volcanic observations. These results suggest that magma supply rather than magma chamber depth or rate of tectonic extension is the primary influence on lava morphology, hence eruptive processes, at seafloor spreading ridges in general. In both the axial volcanic ridge and lava channel terrains, a single prominent volcanic cone exists within each volcanic segment, suggesting a segment‐centered magma focusing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, a new genotype of oat has been developed specifically for feed purposes by the Crop Development Centre called CDC SO-I (“SuperOat”) containing a low-lignin hull and a high-fat groat. However, no quantitative evaluation of protein supply from CDC SO-I to dairy cow has been done in terms of potential protein degradation balance (PDB) and total metabolizable protein (MP) supply. These data are crucial in order to develop more efficient, competitive and optimal feeding the new genotype of oat (CDC SO-I) for livestock. Unlike DVE/OEB, PBI, ARC and NKJ-NJF models, NRC-2001 is a total digestible nutrient (TDN-) based model which is more popular in North America. The objectives of this study were to use the NRC model with inputs based on laboratory and in situ techniques to predict the potential nutrient supply to dairy cows from CDC SO-I in comparison with two conventional oat varieties, CDC Dancer and Derby, in western Canada. The quantitative predictions were made in terms of: (1) Rumen-synthesized microbial protein truly absorbed in the small intestine (AMCP); (2) Rumen undegraded feed protein truly absorbed in the small intestine (ARUP); (3) Endogenous protein in the digestive tract (AECP); (4) Total metabolizable protein supply in the small intestine (MP), and (5) Protein degraded balance (PDB). The results show that using the NRC model, the predicted PDB and total MP supplies to dairy cattle were significantly increased from the newly developed genotype of oat (CDC SO-I). Compared with the normal oat, CDC Dancer, CDC SO-I significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) ARUP, by 24%, and total MP supply by 9%, but did not change (P &gt; 0.05) AMCP, AECP and PDB, with averages of 55.7, 4.5 and -11.96 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> dry matter (DM), respectively. Compared with the normal variety, Derby, CDC SO-I significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) AMCP, by 19%, total MP supply by 13% and increased PDB by 114%, but did not change (P &gt; 0.05) ARUP and AECP values with averages of 19.2 and 4.5 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DM, respectively. In conclusion, CDC SO-I oat increased total absorbed metabolizable protein supply to dairy cattle by 9–13% in comparison with the two conventional oat varieties used in western Canada. However, although CDC SO-I improved protein degraded balance, it still had a negative value (-10.6 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DM), indicating the potential imbalance between microbial protein synthesis from available rumen-degradable crude protein (CP) and potential energy from fermentation in the rumen.

Decision makers need a certain level of information to make effective decisions; however, too much information can be overwhelming or even detrimental. The present study uses a modified supply chain simulation to examine the impact of information availability on overall team performance and communication. Information view and communication were manipulated to constrain information availability.

We recently showed that the seed‐specific overexpression of amino acid permease VfAAP1 increases amino acid supply, and the levels of N and protein in the seeds. Two consecutive field trials using<jats:italic>Pisum sativum</jats:italic>AAP1 lines confirmed increases in the levels of N and globulin in seed; however, compensatory changes of sucrose/starch and individual seed weight were also observed. We present a comprehensive analysis of AAP1 seeds using combinatorial transcript and metabolite profiling to monitor the effects of nitrogen supply on seed metabolism. AAP1 seeds have increased amino acids and stimulated gene expression associated with storage protein synthesis, maturation, deposition and vesicle trafficking. Transcript/metabolite changes reveal the channelling of surplus N into the transient storage pools asparagine and arginine, indicating that asparagine synthase is transcriptionally activated by high N levels and/or C limitation. Increased C‐acceptor demand for amino acid synthesis, resulting from elevated levels of N in seeds, initiates sucrose mobilization and sucrose‐dependent pathways via sucrose synthase, glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The AAP1 seeds display a limitation in C, which leads to the catabolism of arginine, glutamic acid and methionine to putrescine, β‐alanine and succinate. Mitochondria are involved in the coordination of C/N metabolism, with branched‐chain amino acid catabolism and a γ‐amino‐butyric acid shunt. AAP1 seeds contain higher levels of ABA, which is possibly involved in storage‐associated gene expression and the N‐dependent stimulation of sucrose mobilization, indicating that a signalling network of C, N and ABA is operating during seed maturation. These results demonstrate that legume seeds have a high capacity to regulate N:C ratios, and highlight the importance of mitochondria in the control of N–C balance and amino acid homeostasis.</jats:p>",
