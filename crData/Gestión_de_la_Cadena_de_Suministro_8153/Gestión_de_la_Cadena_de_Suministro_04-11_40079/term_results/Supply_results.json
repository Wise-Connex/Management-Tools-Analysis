A critical review is undertaken of current claims and assumptions concerning the importance of FM, particularly in relation to its scope and strategic impact. The paper finds that there is an urgent need to reposition and rebrand FM as an integral part of infrastructure and services management, within the business resource management process alongside finance, HR, IT and Intangibles. Only a summary account is included, but full references to some 30 sources are given. The paper provides the basis for a consolidated and coherent alignment of property and facility management to business strategy and operations. This paper will be of interest to academics, consultants and those in advanced FM practice who recognise the need for a secure theoretical base from which to market FM to business.</jats:p>",

It argues that since the 1980s, states have created new exchanges not as vehicles to raise capital, but to reserve a role for local capital as it disengages from active management of the firm. Thus the state and the market do not act in opposition to each other; rather, the state creates a local market to allow its citizens access to ownership of local firms despite the fact that control of many of these firms lies overseas. The operative goal of the sale is thus corporate control, combined with revenue, and not just revenue alone. Structures respond to a myriad of domestic political concerns.</jats:p>",

We find that 73.2 percent of the decline in the number of accounting baccalaureate degrees since 1990 can be explained by such factors as the decline in the relative salaries of entry-level accountants, the decline in academic preparedness of incoming freshmen, implementation of the 150-hour requirement, and increases in freshmen enrollments. Furthermore, we explain 60.1 percent of the observed increase in master's level accounting degrees. This increase can be attributed to a rise in the salary premium associated with earning a master ‘s degree and implementation of the 150-hour requirement.</jats:p>",

The ideal biosolids application rate should result in high crop yields and nutrient uptake, and leave low concentrations of nutrients in soils to avoid environmental problems. The objective of this study was to estimate the capacity of five biosolids to supply N and P to ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after a single application of either fertilizers or biosolids to a Spodosol and an Oxisol. Results showed that 6% - 36% of N and 3% - 7% of P applied as biosolids were recovered in plants grown on the Spodosol, while the range on the Oxisol was 26%-75% for N and 1.2%-3.7% for phosphorus. Biosolids' efficiency on supplying N and P to plants was similar to fertilizer on the Spodosol, but on the Oxisol it refrained to 65%-67% fertilizer's efficiency. After a single application of biosolids followed by six consecutive harvests, 25%-94% of the N and 93%-99% of the P were not used by plants and remain in the soils.</jats:p>",

For example, is the optimal extent of public goods provision smaller than indicated by the Samuelson rule because finance is distortionary? Or should environmental regulations fail to internalize externalities fully if the incidence of the regulations is regressive? It is suggested that these questions are best addressed by considering distribution-neutral implementation, in which budget balance is achieved by choosing an adjustment to the income tax that offsets the distributive impact of the policy in question. In basic cases, both distribution and labor supply distortion are moot because the target policy and the tax adjustment produce offsetting effects on each. Thus, traditional first-best principles provide good benchmarks for policy analysis after all. Moreover, even when actual implementation will not be distribution neutral in aggregate, distribution-neutral policy analysis has many conceptual and practical virtues that render it quite useful to investigators.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose a typology of supply chain configurations that contributes to tie together terms that have been used disjointedly for describing various forms of supply chain. It also enables researchers to develop theories related to the identified typology, rather than continue expanding efforts on separate, unconnected studies. The typology is configurational, consistent, and based on the correspondence (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib97\">Sheppard and Sherman, 1998</jats:ext-link>) between Fiske's theory of relational forms (1990) and the concept of interdependence, analyzed in the context of supply chain management. Our framework encompasses four main configurations – the communicative, coordinated, collaborative, and co‐opetitive – and we refer to these as the 4 C's in supply chain management. We discuss the benefits of the proposed typology from managerial and research perspectives, and suggest some research extensions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

To successfully colonize newly formed or distant hydrothermal vents, which are discontinuous and ephemeral habitats, larvae of vent invertebrates must possess long‐range dispersal abilities. However, a significant proportion of locally produced larvae must remain within the adult habitat to maintain the observed dense assemblages of invertebrates. I compared spatial and temporal patterns in larval availability (flux and abundance) at hydrothermal vents within and between ridge segments in the northeast Pacific ocean at Axial Seamount and Endeavour Segment on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and at Magic Mountain on Explorer Ridge. Near‐bottom (within 50 cm) larval supply (individuals m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) at five vents on Axial Seamount, measured with passively collecting traps in 2000 and 2001, varied temporally by an order of magnitude, but not spatially at scales of tens of meters to kilometers. The most abundant larval taxa were gastropods (particularly the limpet <jats:italic>Lepetodrilus fucensis</jats:italic>) and polychaetes. Larval abundance in the water column within the axial valley was measured with net tows by the remotely operated vehicle ROPOS at the three ridge segments: Axial Seamount (2000, 2001); Endeavour Segment (2001, 2002); Magic Mountain (2002). Abundance was greater by an order of magnitude at the Endeavour Segment than at Axial Seamount and Magic Mountain, and it did not differ between on‐vent (within tens of meters) and off‐vent (up to 5 km from the venting source) locations within the axial valley. The uniformly high abundance of larvae within axial valleys suggests that larval supply within a ridge segment is most likely localized, implying significant larval retention on the scale of vent fields and possibly ridge segments.</jats:p>",

One purpose of the research described in this paper is to empirically test the influences of supply chain power on supplier satisfaction. Exploration of the effects of power on factors of supplier satisfaction will provide the key to understanding the power‐satisfaction link in supply chain relationships. This paper shows how the buyer–seller relationship affects supplier satisfaction. In doing so, previous satisfaction and power literature is pulled together to demonstrate that the power‐satisfaction variable must be included in any examination of supply chain partnerships. The three primary objectives of this research are to establish how the different “bases of power” affect the satisfaction of selling firms, investigate how power driven relationships affect supplier satisfaction, and measure the effect of power influences on supplier satisfaction in the automobile industry. Each of these research objectives was achieved. This study establishes the first empirical evidence for the measurement of power‐driven supplier satisfaction. In each of the nine models studied, the power‐affected buyer–supplier relationship was found to have a significant positive effect on both performance and satisfaction. The paths between performance and satisfaction, however, were consistently found to be non‐significant.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We consider a sample of Italian workers of which we can observe proxies of motivations and volunteering choices in three different sectors: social services, political activism and union activism. We make due allowance for the endogeneity of motivations and show that both types of motivations have an effect on volunteering. Consistently with theoretical models, we find extrinsic motivations to lower voluntary labour supply, whereas the opposite holds for intrinsic motivations</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

The Ford (FO) alluvium (&lt;600 <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C yr B.P.) forms the modern T0 floodplain entrenched into T1. Conditioned by cooler and wetter climates, Cowhouse Creek was characterized by relatively high base flow and low sediment supply during deposition of the JA and GT alluvium. Appreciable upland soil erosion ensued during the middle Holocene in response to warmer climate conditions, resulting in widespread valley filling by the FH alluvium. Deposition of the late Holocene WR and F0 alluvium was characterized by diminished sediment storage during relatively stable climate conditions. The temporal alluvial stratigraphic framework of the bedrock-confined Cowhouse Creek valley is out of phase with the alluvial sequence in the larger Brazos River valley.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Management concern surrounding the supply of goods and services from business to business, and the related attempts to understand the phenomena observed therein, appears to rest upon a broad range of incompatible perspectives, from political science (often limited to considerations of power) to the logistical (akin to manipulation of a great, benign but dynamic jigsaw puzzle). It appears that all perspectives abrade against the difficulties of exchanging information, knowledge and innovation within the relationships between buying and selling organizations and the apparent chronic systemic inefficiency that transactions often represent in this context. This article addresses these concerns, exploring the concept of <jats:italic>transparency</jats:italic> and the developments necessary for it to be useful in exchanging sensitive information and tacit knowledge in supply relationships. Our central concern is how the understanding of transparency and its commercial importance may change when it is expressed as a manageable element of the relationship between two organizations rather than as a general property of a broader system (e.g. a supply network, industrial sub‐sector, geographical cluster) and what utility this differentiation might hold for managers. The conclusion to the article, and the implication for managers, is that transparency might indeed be created and usefully managed within supply relationships but that it would differ fundamentally in meaning from previously posited concepts, with the same name, in different contexts.</jats:p>",

This difficulty is compounded when the need to model the effects of product and process design changes are also considered. Yet there could be considerable benefits in designing supply chains taking into account the operation of the supply chain as well as the design of the product and the design of the manufacturing processes used in the supply chain. This paper aims to address the central research issue of developing a methodology that can assist a manager in making decisions by modeling both the operation of a supply chain design and the effects of product and process design decisions. The proposed methodology, called Product Chain Decision Model (PCDM), is presented in this paper. This uses an abstracted network to model supply chain systems. Finally, an industry example of joint supply chain and product design is described to illustrate the application of PCDM.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Diverse quality sources can be used to supply consumers with differing quality requirements, such as irrigation of agricultural crops with differing water quality tolerance levels, domestic requirements at drinking water standards, and industrial and municipal uses. Models for optimal operations of such systems are difficult to develop due to the complexity of formulating dilution conditions at junctions as functions, for which the derivative can be calculated (because the flow directions at incident pipes change as the solution procedure progresses); strong scaling effects due to the treatment plants; and the presence of several water quality parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>The model presented here solves the operation problem for a single period under steady state conditions. The formulation is simplified by representing the hydraulics by a conveyance cost in each pipe with bounds on the maximum allowed discharges (the authors have also developed a model that includes the hydraulics explicitly). The model is therefore suited both to canal and pipe systems for supply of irrigation and drinking water. Improvement of water quality by treatment plants located at the supply system is also considered here. This improvement has been achieved by lowering the concentration of conservative substances (those whose concentration remain time invariant) in the water only such as in the reverse osmosis process. The applicability of the model to practical situations is demonstrated by a case study of a regional rural water supply system with 39 pipes and 37 nodes (of which 11 are source nodes with different qualities, 10 are agricultural consumers with different quality requirements, and 4 are domestic consumers requiring high quality drinking water). The model determines the optimal discharges in all pipes, values of quality parameters at consumer nodes, and removal ratios of the treatment plants. Three cases were studied: (1) a single water quality parameter (salinity) without treatment plants; (2) three quality parameters (salinity, sulphur, and magnesium) without treatment plants; and (3) three quality parameters and eight treatment plants, each located at a different source node. Water quality requirements are represented by constraints on the maximum allowable concentrations at consumer nodes, and, for the case of irrigation, a crop yield function that relates yield loss to salinity. The value of the objective function for Case 3 was 10% lower than for the other cases due to savings in yield loss at the agricultural consumers that were obtained by improvement of the quality of the irrigation water.

Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three‐dimensional concurrent engineering (3D‐CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed—Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D‐CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi‐dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product–operation strategy combinations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Local market data provide evidence of a direct link between fish supply and subsequent bushmeat demand in villages and show bushmeat's role as a dietary staple in the region.

In addition to changes in the demand for trials, some commentary suggests that a shortage in judicial resources and the press of the criminal docket have led to problems of supply, inducing litigants to turn to alternative dispute resolution or other means of resolving their cases. The increased number of federal magistrate judges provides a counterweight to many of these claims about judicial shortages. Nonetheless, we show that a puzzle remains. Federal districts vary in their trial rates, and the rate of trial is negatively correlated with the number of civil cases filed per judge, regardless of whether magistrate judges are included in the total. Moreover, that relationship persists even after controlling for the rate of criminal cases filed in the district. Thus, unless other differences across districts explain the persistent negative correlation, the supply of judicial resources remains a potential contributor to the low rate of trial in the federal system, reducing the willingness of litigants to persevere until trial in districts with heavy caseloads. Prospective studies of the perceptions of litigants are needed to understand how the users of the civil justice system interpret trial signals and decide whether to resolve their dispute at trial.</jats:p>",

The two barleys were processed by coarse (roller miller, 0.533 mm gap) and fine (hammer mill, 2 mm screen) processing. The field tick beans and white albus lupins were dry roasted at various conditions at the University of Melbourne. The soybeans and horse beans were pressure‐toasted at 100, 118 and 136 °C for 3, 7, 15 and 30 min at Wageningen Feed Processing Centre. Comparisons were made in terms of (1) ruminally synthesized microbial protein, (2) truly absorbed protein in the small intestine and (3) degraded protein balance, based on 46 samples. The results showed that the predicted values from the DVE/OEB system and the NRC‐2001 model had significant correlations. However, using the DVE/OEB system, the overall average microbial protein supply based on available energy was 10% lower and the truly absorbed protein in the small intestine was 8% lower than that predicted by the NRC‐2001 model. A difference was also found in the prediction of the degraded protein balances, which was 16% higher than that estimated from the NRC‐2001 model. These differences are due to factors used in calculations in the two models, although both are based on similar principles. This indicates that further refinement is needed for a modern protein evaluation and prediction system. Copyright © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

These four papers seek to provide answers to the following two questions: “What mechanisms allow product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design decisions to be coordinated?” and “Why should decisions with respect to product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design be coordinated?” Each of the four papers compiled in Part B provides, foremost, an approach to coordinate decisions across the domains of product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design. The proposed coordinating mechanisms range from a network‐based modeling approach to an assessment procedure for evaluating product architectures to the integration of relevant suppliers into the new product development (NPD) process to a goal programming modeling approach. The fourth paper in Part B, in fact, deploys the proposed goal programming modeling approach to identify and formalize the potential tradeoffs among decisions across the three domains. Part B completes the special issue by identifying future research opportunities, beyond those highlighted within the seven papers that form Part A and Part B of this special issue on <jats:italic>Coordinating product design, process design, and supply chain design decisions</jats:italic>.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The nitrate : phosphate ratio marking the transition between N and P limitation increased from between 15‐30 mol N:mol P at the high PFD to 45 mol N: mol P at the low PFD. The particulate ratio marking this transition increased from 16‐23 mol N:mol P at low PFD to 35 mol N:mol P at high PFD. Cell phosphorus and RNA contents decreased with increasing N:P ratio up to the critical N:P ratio for each PFD, above which they remained stable. In contrast, cell dry weight, chlorophyll a, C, N, and protein were not influenced by nitrate : phosphate in the inflow medium, although they were influenced by PFD. Total protein per RNA increased with increasing N:P ratio at the low light conditions, suggesting increased ratio of protein synthesis per RNA. Our results showed the effect of PFD, growth rate, or both on the critical N:P ratio. Agreement was found in the assessment of the transition between N and P limitation on the basis of nutrient enrichment bioassays, cellular elemental (N and P) quotas, and cell RNA content. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions of higher N requirements under low light conditions due to the coupling of the photosynthetic mechanism with N uptake. In contrast, P‐rich cellular components, such as RNA, were dependent on P availability rather than light.</jats:p>",

Boiling heat transfer reduces the size and weight of cold plates. The transportation of latent heat reduces the mass flow rate of working fluid and pump power. To develop compact heat exchangers for the removal of waste heat from electronic devices with high heat generation density, experiments on a method to increase the critical heat flux for a narrow heated channel between parallel heated and unheated plates were conducted. Fine grooves are machined on the heating surface in a transverse direction to the flow and liquid is supplied underneath flattened bubbles by the capillary pressure difference from auxiliary liquid channels separated by porous metal plates from the main heated channel. The critical heat flux values for the present heated channel structure are more than twice those for a flat surface at gap sizes 2 mm and 0.7 mm. The validity of the present structure with auxiliary liquid channels is confirmed by experiments in which the liquid supply to the grooves is interrupted. The increment in the critical heat flux compared to those for a flat surface takes a maximum value at a certain flow rate of liquid supply to the heated channel. The increment is expected to become larger when the length of the heated channel is increased and/or the gravity level is reduced.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"urn:x-wiley:00778923:media:NYAS217:NYAS_217_mu1\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic>\n</jats:disp-formula>\n</jats:p>",

In the proposed sequence of analyses, the electric circuit analysis for estimating power loss in power semiconductor devices was integrated with the thermal analysis. The method was applied to the thermal design of a new switch mode power supply (SMPS). The analysis was carried out using a commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. In reducing actual structural organizations of the printed circuit board (PCB) and the power semiconductor devices to simpler models, the method of experimental design (MED) was employed. Following the prescription of MED, the PCB was treated as a simple plate having the same thermal conductivity as epoxy resin, and the power semiconductor devices were modeled by hexahedral resistance network. The heat sources were a field effect transistor (FET) and a diode. Computation of power loss from the FET and the diodes is described and the accuracy of different estimation methods is discussed. The difference between measured and calculated temperature rises of the power semiconductor devices was found to be within approximately 10 K. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Maintaining the oxygen partial pressure in the cathode is necessary to prevent short circuit and membrane damage. The results obtained indicate that the oxygen level in the cathode can be successfully maintained through feedforward control of the air compressor motor voltage. However, the net power provided by the fuel cell system is compromised during the transients following abrupt changes in the stack current, suggesting a need for power management via the use of a secondary power source such as a battery. </jats:p>",

Therefore, a typing strategy based on stepwise combination of MIRU-ETR and IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP is proposed to achieve maximal discrimination for unrelated TbD1<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>strains. This typing strategy may be useful in areas where TbD1<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>ancestral strains are prevalent.</jats:p>",
