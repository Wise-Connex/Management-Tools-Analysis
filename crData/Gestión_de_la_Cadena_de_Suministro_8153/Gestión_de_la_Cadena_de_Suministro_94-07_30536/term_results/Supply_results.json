Another criterion is the potential impact that re‐engineering the process might have on business results. It is suggested that on both of these counts “Supply Chain Redesign” should rank near the top of most enterprises' list of re‐engineering initiatives. The concepts of process efficiency and process effectiveness are investigated by reference to the supply chain redesign experiences of a number of major corporations. The conclusion is drawn that process‐oriented supply chain redesign can lead to levels of intra‐enterprise and inter‐enterprise operational efficiency and effectiveness which have previously been unobtainable even in leading edge companies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimization theory of leaf nitrogen distribution in canopies with respect to photosynthetic carbon gain predicts that vertical leaf nitrogen gradients are steeper in dense canopies than in more open canopies. We tested this prediction at the intraspecific and the interspecific level by studying the effects of two levels of nitrogen supply on canopy structure and vertical leaf nitrogen distribution in experimental populations of three Carex species that dominate in low—productivity fens (Carex diandra and Carex rostrata) and in high—productivity fens (Carex acutiformis), respectively. The high—productivity species had a significantly higher amount of leaf area per unit ground area, a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy, proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions, and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy than the low—productivity species. Similarly, increased nitrogen supply resulted for each species in a higher amount of leaf area per unit ground area and a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy. However, only in C. acutiformis did an enhanced N supply led to proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and to steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy. It is suggested that the observed patterns in Carex acutiformis (a very high canopy with a large amount of leaf area) are not directed towards maximization of photosynthetic carbon gain, but are also directed towards suppression of other species in the competition for light. The interspecific differences in canopy structure and leaf nitrogen distribution are in agreement with the optimization theory. However, at the phenotypic level the low—productivity species did not show proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy upon enhanced N supply, despite a strong increase in the total amount of leaf area. This suggests that low—productivity species have a lower phenotypic plasticity with regards to their vertical leaf distribution pattern and their vertical leaf nitrogen distribution than high—productivity species.</jats:p>",

Assuming stability of forest practice regulations extant in early 1992 and in past trends in private management, future nonfederal softwood harvest could change little from the average levels of the 1980s. A 70% reduction in national forest harvests could reduce total western Washington cut by less than 10%. Our analysis demonstrates the impacts of uncertainties in this projection, including the basic inventory data, rates of land loss, rates of private management intensification, and future forest practice regulations. A key feature in all scenarios is the limited volume of older timber from which to draw near-term harvest on private lands. Thus, conditions or regulations affecting the availability of older timber or the minimum age of harvest have large near-term harvest impacts. West. J. Appl. For. 9(3):81-87.</jats:p>",

Global sources of industrial timber continue to be affected by emerging world trade patterns. The U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) has been a major supplier to global markets. The region is also subject to numerous expense-generating environmental constraints. This article estimates the effects on international timber supply of applying Washington State Forest Practice Act (WSFPA) regulations to the entire PNW using the Timber Supply Model. Results indicate that in the absence of similar constraints in other regions, the added cost of WSFPA compliance reduces average annual harvest in the PNW by 19.3% over a 50-yr horizon. Production is shifted to other regions, including Western Canada, which increases average annual harvests by 7.6% over this simulation period. West. J. Appl. For 9(3): 77-80.</jats:p>",

In this context, the underlying theory is extended to include decision making where both joint production and import controls are in place. Also the supply management system is discussed within a rent‐seeking framework. This provides both a method by which to analyze the various forces that will either keep the supply management system in operation or lead to its demise, as well as a means by which supply management can be improved. Concerning the former, it appears, for example, that the tariffs under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are sufficiently high that producers are better off with supply management than with a system with no production controls. If this system falls apart, it will largely be due to internal fighting among provinces and/or producers over expanded market share.</jats:p>",

Nutrients in the cytoplasm have a metabolic role either as substrates (e.g. nitrate, phosphate) or as activators and cofactors for enzymes (e.g. potassium, magnesium). In contrast, nutrients in the vacuole have no known biochemical functions but are accumulated to contribute to sap osmotic potential, for storage, or both. Transport of ions between cytoplasm and vacuole is also important in regulating the composition of the cytoplasm, including control of cytoplasmic pH (Pelle and Bertl 1986), Ca2+ (Blackford et al. 1990), inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Lee and Ratcliffe 1983), and K+ (Leigh and Wyn Jones 1984).</jats:p>",

We examined whether or not the LT was related to an insufficient oxygen supply in patients with CHF. Sixty‐nine patients were divided by NYHA classification. All underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The rate of increase in oxygen delivery (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>D) versus VO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (ΔO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>D/ ΔVO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) was significantly lowered when work rate exceeded LT, that is, 1.32 ± 0.35 to 1.05 ± 0.37 (p &lt; 0.01), 1.22 ± 0.40 to 0.98 ± 0.40 (p &lt; 0.05), and 1.04 ± 0.26 to 0.78 ± 0.39 (p &lt; 0.05) in NYHA classes I, II, and III, respectively.

Leg venous PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was significantly different among three groups, that is, 23.7 ± 3.4 mmHg, 23.2 ± 2.8 mmHg, and 20.1 ± 2.3 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Thus, the oxygen supply to the working muscle did not become insufficient when work rate exceeded LT, and the LT occurred at different levels of leg PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.

Money neutrality is rejected for all of the periods in both countries. However, some of the required conditions for money neutrality held temporarily in the U. S. This could be attributed to differences in policy‐induced market signal distortions. In both countries, demand‐pull forces have grown stronger, and the cost‐push forces have grown weaker. In Canada, this is consistent with a growing and more concentrated retail sector exercising price leadership on farm input and farm output prices.</jats:p>",

An old hybrid (Pride 5) and a new hybrid (Pioneer 3902) were grown at three N levels (15, 2.5, and 0.5 mM N), and development and dry matter accumulation were measured at the 4-, 8-, and 12-leaf stage. Leaf chlorophyll was monitored from the 8- to 12-leaf stage, and leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence were measured at the 12-leaf stage. Rate of dry matter accumulation decreased with declining N supply. In contrast, decreasing N supply progressively increased the duration of the 4- to 8-leaf phase and the 8- to 12-leaf phase. As a consequence, total dry matter at the 12-leaf stage did not differ among N levels. The rate of leaf appearance of the old hybrid (Pride 5) was proportionately more reduced under low N than that of the new hybrid (Pioneer 3902). Similarly, the reduction in crop growth rate during the 8- to 12-leaf stage at the lowest N level was 46% for Pride 5 and 24% for Pioneer 3902. Leaf chlorophyll content was higher for Pride 5 than for Pioneer 3902 at high N levels, but leaf chlorophyll content declined significantly more rapidly in Pride 5 than in Pioneer 3902 when N stress increased. Leaf carbon assimilation rates were 4–27% higher for the new hybrid, with the largest differences occurring at low N levels. Collectively, results of this study show that the old hybrid (Pride 5) was more sensitive to N stress during early development than the new hybrid (Pioneer 3902).

Some of the deleterious effects on ischemic muscles of strenuous activity (reduced blood flow during contractions, less resistance to fatigue) were remedied by torbafylline treatment, and values normalized. Most notably, torbafylline significantly reduced the degree of capillary endothelial cell swelling. In addition, the degree of atrophy was reduced and fatigue resistance improved in muscles contralateral to ischemic, which had been impaired with the strenuous regime. Torbafylline treatment had little further effect on ischemic muscles subjected to mild stimulation, which on its own improved functional hyperemia, resistance to fatigue, and the capillaries per fibre ratio in tibialis anterior, although it did significantly increase the capillary per fibre ratio in extensor digitorum longus. These data indicate a possible role for torbafylline as an adjunct to exercise therapy for chronic muscle ischemia.Key words: ischemia, muscle stimulation, methylxanthine, blood flow, fatiguability, capillarity. </jats:p>",
