      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Pervasive and ubiquitous oscillations, mapping the repetitive variation in time of a specific state, are well known as abundant phenomena in research and practice. Motivated by the success of oscillators in the modelling, analysis and control of dynamical systems, we developed a related approach for the dynamic description of supply chains. This paper aims to introduce a generic oscillator model for supply chains by the original application of oscillator equations. Therefore an established oscillator model for deductive modelling of supply chain echelons is used. With the help of coupled van der Pol oscillators, the dynamical interaction of an inventory system is described and applied to a real-life supply process in automotive industry. According to its reductionist approach only two differential equations are used to analyse a Just-in-Sequence supply process in car industry. Based on the fact that any oscillatory state can be reduced to the phase of the oscillation (phase reduction), a phase space map is generated. This compact visual reference of the supply process can act as the quantitative basis for an adaptive control mechanism during its operation. By delaying or accelerating the inventory oscillations of the supplier stock a detuned coupled supply process can be re-synchronised without changing the amplitude. An additional analysis of Hilbert transform is applied to determine the boundaries of phase-locking between the inventory oscillation phases, where the instantaneous phases are bounded. Furthermore parameters of the synchronisation threshold and the transient phases between synchronous and non-synchronous regimes have been investigated, supported by an Arnold tongue representation. The investigations show that with the help of a generic oscillatory model it is possible to measure and quantify phenomena of inventory dynamics in supply chains. Especially the analysis of synchronisation phenomena with the help of phase space and Arnold tongue representations foster developments of performance measurement in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain management has been an important research issue for the last two decades due to climate change. From a global perspective, the United Nations have introduced sustainable development goals, which point towards sustainability. Manufacturing supply chains are among those that produce harmful effluents into the environment in addition to social issues that impact societies and economies where they operate. New developments in information and communication technologies, especially big data analytics (BDA), can help create new insights that can detect parts and members of a supply chain whose activities are unsustainable and take corrective action. While many studies have addressed sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), studies on the effect of BDA on SSCM in the context of manufacturing supply chains are limited. This conceptual paper applies Toulmin’s argumentation model to review relevant literature and draw conclusions. The study identifies the elements of big data analytics as data processing, analytics, reporting, integration, security and economic. The aspects of sustainable SCM are transparency, sustainability culture, corporate goals and risk management. It is established that BDA enhances SSCM of manufacturing supply chains. Cyberattacks and information technology skills gap are some of the challenges impeding BDA implementation. The paper makes a conceptual and methodological contribution to supply chain management literature by linking big data analytics and SSCM in manufacturing supply chains by using the rarely used Toulmin’s argumentation model in management studies.</jats:p>"

While previous research indicates that supply chain complexity plays an important role in explaining performance outcomes, the accumulating evidence is ambiguous. Thus, a finer‐grained analysis is required. By meta‐analyzing 27,668 observations across 102 independent samples from 123 empirical studies, we examine the link between supply chain complexity and firm performance. While the preponderance of evidence from previous studies identifies supply chain complexity as detrimental to firm performance, our results illustrate that although supply chain complexity has a negative effect on operational performance, it has a positive effect on innovation performance and financial performance. Furthermore, we also distinguish among different levels of supply chain (i.e., upstream, downstream, and internal) and observe nuanced findings. Finally, our findings also reveal moderating effects of construct operationalization and study design characteristics. We discuss implications for theory and practice and provide avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

Hatakka shows that maintenance problems were one of the root causes for the catastrophe. The war was declared without proper preparations, and the decision makers in Stockholm realised only too late that Finland lacked grain storages, mills and bakeries. The crown’s hastily attempts to improve the situation by building new infrastructure and outsourcing bread-making to civilians were of little avail, thanks to scarce population, limited resources, and transportation difficulties. Thus, the Swedish army had to use the critical first months of the war for solving maintenance problems instead of fighting, a fact that contributed heavily to its loss.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to establish the effect of lean supply chain management (LSCM) approach on performance improvement among firms through the influence of supply chain collaboration (SCC).Design/Approach/Methodology - This conceptual paper recommends an inclusive model that incorporate LSCM and SCC dimensions as well as organizational performance, underpinned by theories such as the Dynamic Capabilities (DCT) and Relational View (RV). The proposed model is to establish the direct and indirect effects of LSCM approach on firms’ performance through the influence of SCC (intra and inter firm) dimensions in the manufacturing context, as the main goal of LSCM implementation which will subsequently lead to improvements in organizational performance.Originality: The study effectively combines the DCT and RV to develop a comprehensive model involving the three broad operations and supply chain management concepts. Though there may be similar studies on LSCM practices among manufacturing firms, limited studies have explored similar model or work has limited discussion especially on exploring the mediating roles of individual dimensions of SCC in the LSCM practices – organizational performance among manufacturing firms. This is a novelty as it provides deeper insights on the mediating effects of each dimension of SCC in the relationship between LSCM practices and organizational performance. The proposed theoretical model will serve as a potential blueprint for the successful implementation of LSCM practices.</jats:p>"

It further examines the extent of supply chain design dimensions impacting the variance on resilience in this industry. The study surveyed managers and supervisors of major Vietnam supermarkets within the CPG industry and employed univariate and multivariate methods to analyze the data collected. The paper established that technology advancement, economic inﬂuence, environmental changes, desired supply chain outcomes, and transport networks are the supply chain design dimensions with the most impact on the capability of the retail industry to perform efﬁciently and effectively with resilience. Furthermore, the paper revealed that transport networks, as an integral part of retail industry, impact the most on the variance of resilience for product availability. The ﬁndings imply that, despite the susceptibility to external and internal disruptions, performance and operations with resilience resonate with proper investments in technology, the available capacity under turbulent economic behavior, and a transport network for better customer experience. The paper further acknowledges the disruptive environmental changes, desired supply chain outcomes, and the need for a supply chain design for resilience in the retail industry. </jats:p>"

A broad spectrum of new supply chain strategy solutions was identified and, based on simulations of selected products, conclusions were drawn and the advantages and disadvantages of theoretical solutions were presented for individual cases. A critical analysis of the literature and simulation methods were used to illustrate the problem presented in this paper, to identify the factors causing greenhouse gas emissions and to draw conclusions in the form of proposals to redesign existing strategies, considering the factors determining the increase in pollution caused by the performed logistics processes. The results of the simulations and the literature analysis indicate that solutions related to the redesign of strategies must consider the specificity of the product and the nature of the chain. Not all proposed strategies are applicable to all chains, and each new strategy must be carefully considered and consider many factors. An important element to reduce the negative environmental impact of chains is a well-thought-out relationship with suppliers, a well-chosen and adapted logistics infrastructure, including means of transport. The presented solutions clearly indicate that the environmental aspect plays an increasingly important role in chain management and influences the applied chain strategies. However, reducing the environmental impact of a chain is not a revolutionary approach and an easy-to-implement strategy change, but a well-thought-out, long-term process that considers the specifics of the products, the possibilities of alternative sourcing and distribution modes, and the need to invest in logistics infrastructure to make it as environmentally neutral as possible.</jats:p>"

National governments are increasingly mandating businesses through legislation to report on what they do. More recently, governments have begun imposing a legal duty of care on parent companies which means they can be held responsible for what their subsidiaries do. Key findings are: There is no consistency in how international companies currently implement the due diligence guidelines; The design of national disclosure legislation is generally judged to be flawed. There is medium compliance in terms of quantity of company reports and low compliance in terms of quality; The design of national disclosure legislation is generally judged to be flawed. There is medium compliance in terms of quantity of company reports and low compliance in terms of quality. Overall, the evidence on forced labour and modern slavery is recognised as being “dangerously thin and riddled with bias” (LeBaron, 2018, p.1). It is difficult to research directly because of its illegality, the involvement of powerful interests, and the potential to further endanger highly vulnerable workers. Nevertheless, there is a very large number of articles and reports written on the issue, particularly from the last five years.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study was to establish the influence of electronic supplier management practices on supply chain performance of sugar processing firms. The target population is 7,584 employees of sugar processing firms in Kenya and Yamane Taro’s formula was applied to come up with a sample size of 379 respondents. Data was gathered by a questionnaire, interviews and observation. Correlation was used to determine the relationship between E-supplier management practices and Supply chain performance while regression analysis tested the hypothesis. The study established that E-supplier management practices enhances supply chain performance. Two kinds of supply chain are proposed; Managerial and demand. Managerial supply chain where as a result of electronic supplier management practice, flow of goods and services from the suppliers are properly managed through information sharing between the buyer-seller thus improved deliveries. Demand supply chain where as a result of electronic supplier management practice, buyers and suppliers tend to develop a single shared forecast of demand and a plan of supply in the sense that buyers issue order for only needed materials from the suppliers and that suppliers fulfills the orders as requested by the buyers. To ensure that the proposed supply chain under e-supplier management,it is recommended that Sugar processing firms’ management should ensure working Websites, working internal and external mail and also provide their suppliers with access credentials to company electronic procurement portal to increase buyer and supplier access to information to enhance E-supplier management practices.</jats:p>",

The halal industry gave birth to Halal supply chain management. So far, there has not been an application of an environmentally friendly concept in the halal industrial area that applies the concept of Halal supply chain management. The concept of Halal supply chain management should complement the existing concepts. This is what the researchers then found a middle way to do by continuing to carry out Halal Supply Chain Management which is also environmentally friendly. This research is a literature study by examining the quality of the study, the process of collecting and sorting data according to the intended object, data analysis, interpretation of the results, and recommendations of the research results. The results of the analysis show that Halal is reflected in Halal Supply Chain Management, while Green Supply Chain Management reflects “thoyyībān” (good) in the environment. The two concepts basically become one unit in \"hālalān thoyyībān\". So that the results of research with the implementation of environmentally friendly concepts in the supply chain of the halal industry have an additional positive impact in three aspects, namely.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">For those unaware of the process of creative destruction and the waves of technological change powered by it, this is a confusing and disorientating time. Unlike the downswing period from the late 1980s until the crash of 2008, the past can no longer be confidently used as an indicator of the future, which creates havoc for those tasked with developing plans and forecasts. In this world of uncertainty and unpredictability, resilience and agility have replaced cost-cutting and offshoring as supply chain leaders’ primary objective. The COVID-19 pandemic that swept across the globe in 2020 rapidly changed consumer behaviours and forced businesses to close, sending the world into government-mandated lockdown. Businesses were presented with a choice: adapt, rely on government-sponsored life support — or die. Yet, some companies have seen opportunity in the uncertainty, embracing the theory that the best way to predict the future in these uncertain times is to create it. They are experimenting with the revolutionary new technologies that have emerged during this wave, creating new business models that transform the supply chain but also exponentially increase its complexity. But to take advantage of these new machines requires a new mindset and a willingness to embrace new methods and management processes, which is where many companies are struggling. This paper aims to explain why this period of rapid, transformative change is happening, what changes we can expect throughout the decade, and how supply chain and business leaders need to adapt to not just survive through the period — but thrive.</jats:p>"

In the production of gaseous fuel in special plants - bioreactors, agricultural waste is formed not only as a source of energy - biogas, but also as excellent fertilizers.  In this article, studies have shown that the amount of biogas produced depends on the type of biomass and fermentation time. The largest amount of biogas is produced within 10 days from the date of loading of organic biomass. It was found that the highest daily biogas production is formed from grass and grain silage, the maximum value of which is 1.76 m3. The smallest - from rapeseed silage – 0.33 m3.</jats:p>",

The Batur sub-district has potential for potato cultivation and business. However,  most farmers in this area still follow the wholesaler's price. According to farmers, they must obey the policies of wholesalers after they get credit from wholesalers through collectors. Moreover, farmers can also not know the potato market with certainty due to the limited mastery of market information, especially prices and added value to various actors in the potato supply chain. This study aims to: (i) describe how the potatoes supply chain in Batur, Banjarnegara; furthermore, the comparison of potato prices and value-added by distribution channel, (ii) discuss and analyze the causes of differences in potato market prices and value-added in distribution channels, (iii) recommend the appropriate potato distribution strategy. The data required include secondary and primary data. Secondary data were obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics, Department of Agriculture. Meanwhile, primary data was obtained through a questionnaire from 20 potato farmers and traders from Wonoyoso, Sumberejo, Batur, and Grogol villages. Interviews were conducted with six potato farmer groups. The results showed that potato farmers were weak compared to other potato supply chain actors such as wholesalers, collectors, wholesale market traders in other provinces, retailers, MSMEs, factories, and exporters. The dependence of farmers on local wholesalers is quite substantial because wholesalers control potatoes' marketing network from upstream to downstream. The study recommendations are restructuring and improving cooperation performance and providing business loans with lower interest rates and fast processing. The Agro Cooperative will shorten the potato distribution channels and provides potato farmers with important information such as market information and business conditions.</jats:p>"

Robusta coffee marketing in Rejang Regency is generally interesting because most of the sales objectives of robusta coffee from farmers are to coffee processing companies, both inside and outside the province. It’s suspected that there are variations in the production of robusta coffee in Rejang Lebong Regency, so that robusta coffee business actors have different marketing channels according to the limited supply they have. Based on the results of the research on 37 people who were selected by purposive sampling and through the Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN) approach, the robusta coffee supply chain conditions were running smoothly. This can be seen from the integration or cooperation between supply chain actors that have been established, especially with the coffee processing industry. There are 3 marketing channels for Robusta coffee in Rejang Lebong Regency and can assess the performance of its supply chain. Through the analysis of the marketing margin and the farmer's share shows that the Robusta coffee supply chain on channel 3 is more efficient than channel 1 and channel 2 because it has the lowest margin and the highest share of farmers.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The Army of the Potomac was suffering from severe supply deficiencies; over half of the men were without shoes, none had been fed, and the horses and mules lacked shoes and forage. No tents were brought to the front. All those necessities, including the cattle herds, were with the wagon trains sent to Westminster and Union Bridge. Meade arrived at Gettysburg by way of the Taneytown Road in the wee hours of July 2. After examining the defense lines, Meade was not convinced that they could be held, but all his army corps were marching to Gettysburg. He was also concerned that the Baltimore Pike, the only route from Gettysburg to Westminster and Union Bridge, was too close to enemy concentrations below Culp’s Hill and Cemetery Hill.</p>",

Many of these modifications are non‐contractible in that firms cannot devise and enforce contracts on these behaviors. In this research, we extend property rights theory of the firm (PRTF) by suggesting that small entrepreneurs’ ownership of assets used to perform delegated tasks does not always incentivize small entrepreneurs to undertake non‐contractible actions (NCAs) as assumed by canonical PRTF. We argue that the ability of asset ownership to incentivize small entrepreneurs to undertake NCAs will be muted when undertaking NCAs reduces small entrepreneurs’ productivity. We test our hypotheses by examining how trucking companies’ use of independent contractors affected the rate at which they improved compliance with different types of safety rules following a major regulatory change. Consistent with our arguments, we find that the use of independent contractors slowed carriers’ rate of firm‐wide improvement on compliance with hours‐of‐service and vehicle maintenance rules relative to driving safety rules. These results, which remain after extensive robustness testing, have important implications for theory and practice.</jats:p>",

To sustain their new military machines, the European rulers turned increasingly to their civilian subjects, making all levels of civil society serve the needs of the military.  This volume examines civil-military interaction in the multinational Swedish Realm in 1550–1800, with a focus on its eastern part, present-day Finland, which was an important supply region and battlefield bordered by Russia. Sweden was one of the frontrunners of the Military Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries. The crown was eager to adapt European models, but its attempts to outsource military supply to civilians in a realm lacking people, capital, and resources were not always successful.  This book aims at explaining how the army utilized civilians – burghers, peasants, entrepreneurs – to provision itself, and how the civil population managed to benefit from the cooperation. The chapters of the book illustrate the different ways in which Finnish civilians took part in supplying war efforts, e.g. how the army made deals with businessmen to finance its military campaigns and how town and country people were obliged to lodge and feed soldiers.  The European armies’ dependence on civilian maintenance has received growing scholarly attention in recent years, and Civilians and Military Supply in Early Modern Finland brings a Nordic perspective to the debate.</jats:p>",

In response to tariffs on Chinese imports, companies had been diversifying their supply base away from China, but doing so by developing alternative, global sources. Additionally, companies are using alternative risk management techniques, such as supplier collaboration, in the short to medium term. Reshoring decision-making is indeed found to be complex and requires a longer-term time horizon for decision-making and implementation. Logistical challenges and growth in demand do drive a willingness of consumers to pay a premium for locally sourced products.

Motivated by the success of oscillators in the modelling, analysis and control of dynamical systems, we developed a related approach for the dynamic description of supply chains. This paper aims to introduce a generic oscillator model for supply chains by the original application of oscillator equations. Therefore an established oscillator model for deductive modelling of supply chain echelons is used. With the help of coupled van der Pol oscillators, the dynamical interaction of an inventory system is described and applied to a real-life supply process in automotive industry. According to its reductionist approach only two differential equations are used to analyse a Just-in-Sequence supply process in car industry. Based on the fact that any oscillatory state can be reduced to the phase of the oscillation (phase reduction), a phase space map is generated. This compact visual reference of the supply process can act as the quantitative basis for an adaptive control mechanism during its operation. By delaying or accelerating the inventory oscillations of the supplier stock a detuned coupled supply process can be re-synchronised without changing the amplitude. An additional analysis of Hilbert transform is applied to determine the boundaries of phase-locking between the inventory oscillation phases, where the instantaneous phases are bounded. Furthermore parameters of the synchronisation threshold and the transient phases between synchronous and non-synchronous regimes have been investigated, supported by an Arnold tongue representation. The investigations show that with the help of a generic oscillatory model it is possible to measure and quantify phenomena of inventory dynamics in supply chains. Especially the analysis of synchronisation phenomena with the help of phase space and Arnold tongue representations foster developments of performance measurement in supply chain management.</jats:p>",

For instance, there was evidence of outstanding contributions to the local community. Suppliers initially developed their sustainability initiatives during the outbreak without any support from global buyers, certification bodies or government. In spite of this, stronger relationships with buyers ultimately emerged facilitating greater SC sustainability. Consequently, by using both exploitation and exploration learning capabilities, multiple levels of learning were observed (i.e. individual, organisational and SC) as related to planning, new procedures and social awareness.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A greater awareness of supplier learning processes will aid buyers in developing recovery plans that are appropriate for their global SC partners.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper provides an understanding of how emerging economy suppliers of global SCs are coping with this unprecedented outbreak in regard to sustainability management.

Often DRS management is initiated and supported by the government, yet the related cost issues have not been fully emphasized. In the face of highly uncertain disaster locations and timing, these supplies are usually prepositioned without proper consumption, which causes enormous waste in practice both economically and environmentally. This chapter highlights the potential to bring the reverse logistics strategies in conventional business practice into DRS management. Incorporating the reverse flow of removed relief items with DRS supply chain management not only benefits in cost reduction and environmental protection, but also enhance the daily management and quality control of DRS. Relying on social trust and efficient marketing network provided by government coordination and international cooperation, the stable quality level and relatively integrated inventories of the removed DRS can achieve economies of scale in the reverse supply chain operations. This chapter aims to develop an understanding of DRS reverse logistics, which energizes the responsible management of DRS for economic, social, and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

Specific soil bacteria can mobilise sulfonates but very little is known about these bacteria in the hyphosphere.

Such systems are based on modern electrical equipment, including electrical machines and controlled power converters (active rectifiers and regenerative units (AC/DC), direct voltage converters (DC/DC), inverters (DC/AC)), conventional and non-traditional electric power based on renewable energy sources (RES).The Program of basic research in the Russian Federation on a long-term period (2021-2030 years) comprises the actual problems of development of energy supply, energy efficiency, renewable and alternative sources in industry and agriculture, including the issues of production technology, of conversion and storage of electric power.Electric power from the renewable energy sources requires its continuous correction, equalization and buffering i.e. a control system for the system operating modes.The paper presents a project of the power unit that provides both autonomous and traditional operation of a power plant having the possibility of recuperating electrical energy into the network. The structure and the composition of such a power unit is proposed, basic control strategies for an autonomous power generating plant having a capacity of up to 15 kW, operating from the variable low speed engine, also having the other sources of alternative energy with the possibility of power accumulation are considered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes remain the most devastating diseases of cerebrovascular system. They may cause disorders of speech, memory, mental health or movement. However, stroke can be prevented. Knowledge of the vascularization of the cerebellum and its variations is important for choosing a strategy of prevention and effective treatment of stroke. This review will discuss the variant anatomy of three pairs of cerebellar arteries: superior cerebellar artery (SCA), anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). In most cases SCA and AICA arise from basilar artery, PICA arises from vertebral artery. SCA supplies tentorial cerebellar surface and dentate nucleus, AICA – petrosal surface of the cerebellum, flocculus, tegmentum, pons and middle cerebellar peduncles, PICA – suboccipital surface of the cerebellum, tonsil, inferior vermis, fastigial nucleus, choroid plexus and medulla. We conclude that SCA is the most constant artery and PICA is the most variable one. SCA can originate from the junction of the first segment of posterior cerebral artery and basilar artery or directly from the first segment of posterior cerebral artery. AICA can arise from vertebral artery or from common trunk with PICA. Rarely AICA arise from PICA. PICA can originate from basilar artery, extradural part of vertebral artery (C1-C2 or even C2-C3), ascending pharyngeal artery, proatlantal artery, ascending cervical artery or rarely from internal carotid artery. Many analyzed studies showed that PICA can be absent more often than AICA; SCA is almost always present. SCA is also duplicated more than other cerebellar arteries (mostly on the left). Significant difference was found in different studies about frequency of duplication of the AICA. PICA is rarely duplicated. Territories of cerebellar arteries change depending on their origin, course and also on the absence or duplication of the other ones. Many studies showed that SCA, AICA or PICA can dominate and send their branches to the territories of the other arteries which are absent or hypoplastic. The present study also describes classifications of segments of the cerebellar arteries, types of cerebellar vascular supply and superficial vascular network.\n\nKeywords: human, cerebellum, superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery.</jats:p>"

The analysis of the world achievements in this field of energy has been carried out. A number of advantages make it very promising for developing energy sources capable of complex production of electrical and thermal energy with a greater efficiency than that of present day thermal power plants. The proposed scheme of a thermal power plant is based on the principle of a Stirling engine, but it uses the most efficient and promising thermoacoustic converter of heat into mechanical vibrations, which are then converted into electric current. The article contains a mathematical apparatus that explains the basic principles of the developed thermoacoustic engine. To determine the main parameters of the thermoacoustic engine, the methods of computer modeling in the DeltaEC environment have been used. A layout diagram of the laboratory sample of a thermal power plant has been proposed and the description of its design has been given. It has been proposed to use dry saturated steam as the working fluid, which makes it possible to increase the generated power of the thermoacoustic engine.</jats:p>",

To understand household perception of regulation, interviews were conducted, with questions put to water users in households. A qualitative research approach was adopted, using interviews, and focus group discussion with water users in households.FindingsThe findings indicate that households hold varied perceptions on regulation across the components of the water supply system. Specifically, regulatory compliance by households was influenced by crucial elements such as preferential compliance to regulation within specific aspects of the water supply system. Limitations and implicationsThe inference from this research is based on households from one state in Nigeria. Further exploration of this research in multiple cities and states would widen the applicability of the findings in different contexts.Originality/valueThe study examines regulation and regulatory compliance from the perspective of households who predominantly use Non-Utility Water Supply System (NUWSS) in sub-Saharan Africa.</jats:p>"

Based on a three-echelon supply chain composed of an upstream manufacturer, a processing plant with limited processing capacity, and a downstream manufacturer, this study derives the production quantity and waste disposal decisions of the upstream and downstream manufacturers as well as the optimal transfer price decision of the processing plant. Moreover, we assess the environmental performance of BPS. Analytical results suggest that the upstream manufacturer’s production quantity and waste disposal decisions and the processing plant’s transfer price decision are threshold dependent on the processing plant’s capacity, whereas the downstream manufacturer's production quantity decision is threshold dependent on the processing plant’s capacity and price of raw materials. BPS is beneficial for all members of the supply chain to increase profit. The production promotion and cost-saving effects ensure that the supply chain members maximize their profit. However, BPS does not always have a positive effect on the environment; when the processing plant’s capacity and price of raw materials are below the threshold, implementing BPS results in a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

Despite a great deal of attention to the news sphere itself, little is known about the subtle interplay between the offer and the demand for information. Still, a broader perspective on the news ecosystem, including both the producers and the consumers of information, is needed to build new tools to assess the health of the infosphere. Here, we combine in the same framework news supply, as mirrored by a fairly complete Italian news database - partially annotated for fake news, and news demand, as captured through the Google Trends data for Italy. Our investigation focuses on the temporal and semantic interplay of news, fake news, and searches in several domains, including the virus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Two main results emerge. First, disinformation is extremely reactive to people’s interests and tends to thrive, especially when there is a mismatch between what people are interested in and what news outlets provide. Second, a suitably defined index can assess the level of disinformation only based on the available volumes of news and searches. Although our results mainly concern the Coronavirus subject, we provide hints that the same findings can have more general applications. We contend these results can be a powerful asset in informing campaigns against disinformation and providing news outlets and institutions with potentially relevant strategies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Disaster relief is a key aspect of humanism and humanitarian actions. The delivery of adequate supplies at the right time and right place is critical for survival and recovery of the affected people, animals, plants and other entities. Since every dollar counts towards saving a life, the traceability of the shipments must be ensured, and the organisations involved in the process need to be aware of the delivered items to avoid duplication of relief efforts. Responsive, efficient and transparent supply chains have been difficult to build and execute as many disasters occur in underdeveloped or developing countries with poor infrastructure, corruption and other challenges. This paper explores the application of blockchain technologies to create a database ledger that can assure traceability and reliability and also avoid duplication. The use of ‘smart contracts’, which can be automatically executed in a blockchain, to promote transparency in contracts and performance and the movement of money across all parties is also studied. Large organisations such as the United Nations (UN) or the World Health Organization (WHO), which often take the lead in organising the relief efforts, can initiate the development of blockchains for humanitarian logistics and draw manufacturers, transportation carriers, other logistics providers, banks and other partners into the blockchain network. Assuring both the aid donors and the recipients that the funds have been used wisely and transparently will expand future aid contributions and enable more effective relief to disaster areas. This is especially critical now as climate changes on our planet are expected to result in more disasters with extremely dire consequences, especially in poorer regions of the world.</jats:p>"

The early modern Swedish crown was a major landowner, as, under Swedish law, all farms deserted or unable to pay their taxes three years in a row became crown property. The article shows how the selling of these farms to private buyers became an important source of revenue in the 18th century, first to finance the Great Northern War and later to cover the massive public debt created by the war. By purchasing crown farms, private Swedish and Finnish individuals became indirectly important financers of war.</jats:p>",

Currently, the lifespan of several DWSSs worldwide has been exceeded, exasperating these issues. The monitoring activity and the transparency of information on water availability and quality are becoming increasingly important in accordance with the national regulations and standards, and with guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). These activities can be considered as support and guidance tools for identifying health-related risks, for building a safe management of drinking water supply systems, and for improved user confidence in the consumption of tap water. In this context, in the present work an analysis of the quality monitoring data of DWSSs was carried out using multivariate techniques. The analysis considered several chemical–physical parameters collected in the period 2013–2020 for some DWSSs in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) methods were used to process and reduce the dimensionality of the data, to highlight the parameters that have the greatest influence on the qualitative state of the supplied water and to identify clusters.</jats:p>"

With the aim of overcoming these shortcomings, this paper proposes a framework for sustainable supply chain management composed of six dimensions: methodology, organization, stakeholders, maturity model, human resources, and technology. The main innovations of the framework are that (1) it includes a methodology that acts as a guide to sustainability management and improvement in a holistic way by using a balanced scorecard for any type of supply chain and covering the whole project life cycle; (2) it combines quantitative and qualitative methods for sustainability assessment; (3) it describes the techniques and technology to be used in each task of the methodology; and (4) it identifies the past impact of SC sustainability, as well as predicting its future impact, using Big Data analytics. The practical utility, completeness, and level of detail of the framework were validated through questionnaires answered by both five academics and three professionals. In addition, the framework was applied to a case study to (1) validate its usefulness and (2) to improve it with the feedback obtained.</jats:p>"

The protection of internal and external supply chains is therefore important. In order to be better prepared for the future, it is therefore necessary to strengthen the resilience of the military supply network. To this end, risk management must be implemented at the appropriate military command levels in order to be able to take the right measures. Starting with the military strategic level and continuing to the operational and tactical level, a consistent, plausible and functioning instrument dealing with risk management planning, risk identification, risk analysis and evaluation, risk treatment, and risk monitoring must be introduced.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is necessary to scientifically evaluate and give countermeasures in advance. Based on the data sequence of Location, Yellow River and South-to-North Water Transfer in Zhengzhou from 1989 to 2018, the joint probability distribution model is constructed by using the optimized marginal distribution function and Copula function. The encounter probability is calculated, and the risk analysis is carried out according to the water shortage of each user under different encounters. The results show:①The probability of asynchronous is 85.96%, it is 71.92% higher than the probability of synchronous, which indicates that the three water sources complement each other well; ②Local water supply has the greatest impact on the risk of water shortage in Zhengzhou. Local water should be used reasonably and efficiently, and the external water source should be used as a supplement; ③The maximum encounter probability is 13.58%, all users except domestic water are in a water shortage state, the most serious water shortage in the industry is (-2.049, -1.089) billion m³. The minimum encounter probability is 1.14%, all users have different degrees of water shortage, the shortage of domestic water is (-3.037, 0.779) billion m³second only to industrial water shortage, the reservoir should be jointly dispatched and the groundwater exploitation should be increased to maintain the security of the urban water supply system and ensure the normal water use of social life.</jats:p>"

Then, the result of NDVI calculation was classified as small vegetation and high vegetation with over all accuracy of 87.29% and kappa value of 0.808. According to the result, there are 15.85% and 1.55% supply of urban green space for small and high vegetation respectively. In addition, the UGS supply in inner and outer part of the town for each land use was quantified. The result showed that in the inner part of the town, service, green area, and vacant land uses have 30.12%, 30.06%, and 13.32% of UGS supply respectively. Conversely, recreation, commercial, and administration land uses are least supplied with 0.11%, 0.26%, and 0.40% share of UGS. Furthermore, the UGS supply was evaluated against the new urban planning strategy of Ethiopia (30% coverage) and World Health Organization standard (9m<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>per person). The coverage of small vegetation and high vegetation was 15.85% and 1.55% respectively.

In particular, the amount of leakage increases in aging networks due to pressure effects, resulting in severe water losses. In this study, various artificial neural network (ANN) models are considered for determining monthly leakage rates and the variables that affect leakage. The monthly data, which are standardized by Z-score for the years 2016–2019, are used in these models by selecting four independent variables that affect the leakage rate regarding district metered areas and pressure metered areas in WDSs. The pressure effects are taken into consideration directly as input. The model accuracy is determined by comparing the predicted and measured data. Furthermore, the leakage rates are estimated by directly modelling the actual data with ANNs. Consequently, it is found that the model results after data standardization are somewhat better than the original nonstandardized data model results when 30 neurons are used in a single hidden layer. The reason for the higher accuracy in the standardized case compared with previous modelling studies is that the pressure effect is taken into consideration. The suggested models improve the model accuracy, and hence, the methodology of this paper supports an improved pressure management system and leakage reduction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In last two decades, India has seen high economic growth. Concomitantly, there has been increase in availability and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, ICT penetration in India is much less when compared to global averages. There exists a substantive level of inequality in ICT access and use. Empirical studies on extent and nature of digital divide in India are few, especially those with explicit theoretical demand-supply framework, using consistent and reliable pan India data. This paper is an attempt to address these research gaps. It examines the digital divide in India across socio-economic classes and different political-geographic regions. The reduced form demand equations for two ICT instruments – Internet and mobile phone - are estimated separately for households aggregated at subnational level. A multi-variate econometric model identifies both demand and supply side factors shaping differential access by households. Findings indicate digital divide is a reflection of existing socio-economic divide. On the demand side, socio-economic inequality as manifest in the economic conditions of households, social category, occupational profile, age and education status are key determinants of district level digital divide. Further, supply side factors like availability of electricity, mobile network and extent of urbanization also play an important role.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn), an important sub-tropical evergreen fruit crop belonging to family Sapindaceae, is believed to have originated in China, where it has been grown in Southern Guangdong state for thousands of years. It is highly specific to climatic requirements and probably due to this reason its cultivation is restricted to few countries in the world. In India, litchi was introduced in the 18th century through Burma, and from there, it spread to many countries. India and China account for 91 percent of the world litchi production. Litchi is one of the important fruit crop commercially grown in Assam. Due to its perishable nature and having very short shelf life, Supply Chain Management (SCM) plays a vital role. Though India is an agrarian economy the business faces various challenges in terms of infrastructure facilities. The present article is an attempt to explain the production, distribution and Supply chain management of Litchi in Sonitpur District of Assam. Most of the litchi growers belong to marginal and small category. Hence, the involvement of marginal farmers is more in Litchi plantation as compared to other category of farmers. Major share of produce traded through market intermediaries. The linear trend model was used to check the dynamicity of the area and production data of Litchi in India. Due to perishable in nature, the litchi farmers are suffering severely due to wastage of litchi throughout the intermittent steps in existing supply chain of litchi.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic created temporary shortages of medical equipment like ventilators throughout the world. Recent medical research also indicates a gentle ventilation may be more appropriate for many patients. This article details the design of an open source gentle ventilator (gentle-vent) framework that can be used in periods of scarcity when no other options are available. The system utilizes a wide range of commonly available components that are combined using basic electronics skills to achieve the desired end product. The firmware is programed in the Arduino IDE using any Arduino compatible microcontroller. The main function of the gentle-vent is to generate a calibrated pressure wave at the pump to provide support to the patient’s breathing. Each gentle-vent permutation was tested using a DIY manometer as it could be done in the field in low-resource settings. These measurements were also verified with an open source VentMon. All permutations were able to accurately hold a desired setpoint for at least 2 hours. The most rudimentary implementation using found mechanical components and perf-board costs less than $20.  The results indicate that an open source approach can be used to make breathing support accessible in most contexts.</p>"

Some interesting and new insights obtained from comparison analysis and numerical experiments are as follows: (1) The leading manufacturer ought to add e-commerce channel, and customers’ e-commerce preference can increase the market demand, collecting rate, and manufacturer’s profit. (2) With the e-commerce channel and the retail channel, dual-collecting channel is the best for the manufacturer and system while the manufacturer collecting channel becomes the best when the collecting competition is relatively large. When the collecting competition exists, retailer collecting channel is the best for the retailer.

The collection, monitoring, and predictions of data on variables that are used in the NRWR calculations are not practical and required significant time besides financial resources. In this study, the NRWR predictions have been made through the suggested method over three parameters. The model prediction accuracies, in the literature obtained by using the Triple Diagram Model (TDM) over two parameters, have been increased through the Serial Triple Diagram Model (STDM) suggested in this study. This method shows that better predictions are possible in the NRWR modeling. Thanks to the model applications developed in this study, water administrations can make predictions with the least error (less than 10% relative error) and certain variables, according to the characteristics of each water distribution network.</jats:p>",

The fortress needed massive amounts of construction materials, as well as food, drink and accommodation for its many thousands of soldiers and workers. The article traces the evolution of the Helsinki burgher community during the fortress construction years, arguing that the close and long-lasting interaction between the town and the fortress gave birth to a special ‘military town bourgeoisie’.

To adapt to this dynamic environment, supply chains have become increasingly reliant on collaboration, integration, flexibility, and trust between stakeholders. Therefore, the importance of new technological applications in supply chains has grown even more. To improve supply chain flow control, modern specialized applications must be implemented. Blockchain technology has established itself as a necessary component of today’s competitive environment. Companies should invest in blockchain technology to respond quickly to changing market conditions and demands in today’s dynamic business environment. In this regard, this study investigates the effect of blockchain technology utilization on supply chain transparency, supply chain flexibility, and trust in suppliers. For this purpose, first, data were collected from the first 1000 exporting firms declared in 2019 by the Turkey Exporters Assembly using a survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the dataset obtained from 84 companies. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that blockchain technology utilization increases transparency, flexibility, and trust in supply chains. According to these results, it is suggested that companies should invest in blockchain technology to make their supply chain more transparent, flexible, and secure. Moreover, blockchain plays a crucial role in building mutual trust with supply chain stakeholders. Finally, the research includes some considerations on the positive implications and potential of blockchain in collaboration and integration.</jats:p>"

In this study we explore the relationship of supply chain risk management, reaction time, resilience with the performance of organization and investigates in detail how a better strategy of supply chain risk management can lead to better performances and firms becoming resilient to disruptions and risks. This study is based on the automobile sector of Pakistan and the data was recorded from all the leading automobile industries of Pakistan. The research follows a quantitative model. 100 questionnaires were filled out by people employed in automotive firms and the data was analyzed using SPSS. Correlation analyses were performed to see how performance and supply chain risk management along with other variables – resilience and reactive supply chain, were related to each other. Furthermore, regression test was applied to understand the impact of meeting a structured supply chain risk management on firm’s performance and the results reveal that supply chain risk management does take a significant influence on the performance of a firm. Future work can be done in this same area by exploring more industries and firms, taking a bigger sample size and exploring more categories of risks that influence the firms’ operations in their own ways.</jats:p>"

With widening supply and demand gap, power management has become one of the most critical areas of concern all over the world. India’s energy consumption is increasing at one of the fastest rates in the world. Hence, we require Substation Automation Systems in the present day substations to efficiently control and deliver power.  The main objective is to create a SCADA system for the desired substation. Power automation serving electric supply locations often require special protection against the effects of fault-produced. Protection relays need to function immediately when a faulty condition occurs. This is why Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED’s) are brought in for safe operation of switchyard devices, which can prevent disasters to energy supply and help in human safety. With the introduction of IEC 61850, utility communication will be used for substation automation and also for protection purposes within a substation and between substations.  A Substation Automation System (SAS) provides facility to control and monitor all the equipment in the substation locally as well as remotely. A Supervisory Control &amp; Data Acquisition (SCADA) system provides users with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) which can be used for controlling, monitoring and protection of devices. This saves us cost and time.Substations are key components of the power grid, facilitating the efficient transmission and distribution of electricity Substation automation systems make their control and monitoring possible in real time and help maximize availability, efficiency, reliability, safety and data integration.</jats:p>"

This case study considers a regional port located in the Baltic sea and relates to port users, i.e., shipping operators and shippers. The effects were identified for maritime transport by comparing transport performance in two scenarios: with-the-investment and without-the-investment. Incremental calculus addresses freights (containers, dry bulk, and cereals) traded to and from the given port, changes in size of vessels, and the shipping route alternatives vis-a-vis adjacent ports in the range. Sustainable impact concerns generalized maritime transport cost, i.e., shipping operating costs and port-to-port transit time, as well as energy consumption and external costs of maritime shipping. To capture effects, daily and unit dry bulk, as well as container shipping cost, values of time, and marginal external costs were revealed in freight sea transport. As investigated, shipping operators and shippers will benefit from the reduction in ships’ operating (including ships’ fuel cost savings) and time cost, while the community will enjoy the reduction in externalities. However, the main economic effect is the reduction in shipping operating cost resulting from the increased vessel size (economies of scale).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Money laundering, in its almost 90-year-long history, has attracted the attention of the scientific, professional, but also the general public. Throughout the entire period, the manifestations of this criminal phenomenon, its typology, etiological factors, etc., have changed, but the essence has remained the same: the transformation of illegally acquired money into legal financial flows. Emerging markets are particularly burdened, which is the subject of this paper: identifying, monitoring and proving the process of money laundering with the aim to reduce it in developing countries. In addition, what can be observed in these markets is that money laundering operations are mainly related to those activities where most of the payments are made in cash. Their specificity, that is, the basic motive for execution, is not just a profit, but the aspiration to introduce “dirty” money into legal flows. The aim of this paper is to use the method of description to explain and describe scientifically the money laundering process and to combat this phenomenon with a focus on the characteristics of the money laundering process. In addition, the paper describes the models and weaknesses of this process, while at the same time it respects the standards and specifics of business operations in emerging markets. The result of the paper is that it provides an overview of money laundering in the 21st century in small and open economies, including proposals to prevent and combat this negative phenomenon.</jats:p>"

The working system for firms and employees has been restricted worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including working on-sites, different areas, and working hours. Therefore, the system changed into a network economy to reduce unemployment and increase the work opportunities for workers. As a result, businesses are now attempting to improve the system for sustainable supply chains. The Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) approach is used in this research to classify dynamic aspects for improving the survival of sustainable supply chains in an epidemic condition. The results reveal that the viability of the supply chain network is the essential criteria for managing the relationships of suppliers and buyers and maximizing sustainable supply chain survivability during and after COVID-19. This research will help businesses, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to concentrate on the described factors to achieve a brighter environment.</jats:p>"

Due to globalization, companies are operating internationally, and so their operations have incorporated a plethora of areas. With great expansion comes great risks as well; therefore, today's supply chain faces great risks when operating on a global scale, and these risks hinder their performance. In this study, we explore the relationship of supply chain risk management, reaction time, and resilience with the performance of the organization and investigate in detail how a better strategy of supply chain risk management can lead to better performances and firms becoming resilient to disruptions and risks. This study is based on Pakistan's automobile sector, and the data was recorded from all the leading automobile industries in Pakistan. The research follows a quantitative model. One hundred questionnaires were filled out by people employed in automotive firms, and the data was analyzed using SPSS. Correlation analyses were performed to see how performance and supply chain risk management, along with other variables – resilience and reactive supply chain- were related to each other. Furthermore, a regression test was applied to understand the impact of structured supply chain risk management on a firm’s performance, and the results reveal that supply chain risk management does have a significant influence on the performance of a firm. Future work can be done in this same area by exploring more industries and firms, taking a bigger sample size, and exploring more categories of risks that influence the firms’ operations in their ways.</jats:p>"

However, schedule deviation risks in the logistics process of modular construction can derail its benefits and thus interfere with its widespread application. To address this issue, we aim to develop a digital twin framework for real-time logistics simulation, which can predict potential logistics risks and accurate module arrival time. The digital twin, a virtual replica of the physical module, updates its virtual asset based on building information modeling (BIM) in near real-time using internet of thing (IoT) sensors. Then, the virtual asset is transferred and exploited for logistics simulation in a geographic information system (GIS)-based routing application. We tested this framework in a case project where modules are manufactured at a factory, delivered to the site via a truck, and assembled onsite. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin framework. This paper’s primary contribution is the development of a framework that mediates IoT, BIM, and GIS for reliable simulation which predicts potential logistics risks and accurate module delivery time. Such reliable risk prediction enables effective supply chain coordination, which can improve project performance and the widespread application of modular construction.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is very important for fresh product supply chain systems to have multi-echelon inventory control. However, in past studies, few control models of the multi-echelon inventory considered the deterioration rate of perishable products as the variable factor. In this paper, on the basis of considering the perishable characteristics of fresh products, combining the deterioration rate with the inventory control model, a multi-echelon inventory control model for fresh products is designed and optimized, and the optimal solution from the whole supply chain is obtained through the optimal fitness function by genetic algorithm. Finally, Flexsim is used to simulate the two inventory strategies before and after optimization. After simulation comparison and analysis, it is verified that the optimized inventory control strategy has lower costs. The research results can help supply chain managers of fresh products to make inventory management decisions and save costs, which is of practical significance.</jats:p>"

Surprisingly, however, limited studies have provided a synthesis and overview of existing research exploring important links between the entrepreneurship and supply chain management (SCM) fields. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by developing a systematic review of research exploring the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and SCM, while synthesizing the most relevant findings in this intersection. We also aim to promote the development of this topic by providing relevant future research directions. To do so, we conducted a systematic review on the topic of EO published in SCM journals from 1989 to April 2020. We summarize 14 relevant articles on EO in SCM and conclude that research joining these fields is surprisingly scant despite the development of both EO and SCM literature over extended periods of time. We find that although existing research recognizes that entrepreneurial behavior is key for a successful supply chain orientation and to develop more efficient and value-creating supply chains, theoretical development and empirical examination in specific supply chains and multiple industries is required. We uncover and propose specific opportunities to advance this research effort.</jats:p>"

This rich literature synthesis forms the basis of a novel theoretical framework that provides guidance and insight for blockchain adopters and vendors as well as delineate palpable benefits of this novel technology. An interpretivist philosophical design and inductive reasoning are adopted to conduct the systematic review of literature. A total of 867 papers were retrieved from Scopus database between the years of 2016 and 2020 and subsequently analysed via abductive reasoning, grounded theory and a thematic meta-analysis; where the latter was achieved using a scientometric approach and software tools such as VOS viewer and NVivo. Scientometric analysis revealed the most prolific countries, sources, publications and authors who reside at the vanguard of blockchain developments and adoption. Subsequent grounded theory analysis identified six main clusters of research endeavour viz: “case study”, “challenges and opportunity”, “traceability”, “smart contract” “blockchain and IoT” and “data security”. From 28 SCR metrics identified within literature, five were found to have been positively impacted by blockchain technology solutions, namely: “visibility”, “collaboration”, “integration”, “risk management” and “information sharing.” Prominent applications of blockchain technology in practice were “traceability systems” and “smart contracts” which are often implemented separately or in combination and primarily in food supply chains. This research constitutes the first study to critically synthesise extant literature for evaluation of blockchain solutions’ implication on SCR metrics. New perspectives obtained provided a basis for the novel theoretical framework for implementation that will be valued by software developers and adopting organizations, whilst creating new direction for researchers interested in blockchain technology.</jats:p>"

The pricing decision problem raises from the manufacturer’s direct sales and the retailer’s retailing including recycling. Managers need to focus on intelligible management considering consumer channel preferences, cross-channel recovery and pricing strategies. According to game theory, centralized and decentralized CLSC decision models are used to provide an efficient solution to managers for the pricing problem. The centralized model consists of differential and uniform pricing strategy and the decentralized model consists of manufacturer-led Stackelberg, retailer-led Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium game, respectively. The impact of cross-channel recycling rate and channel preference on pricing and profitability in a two-stage CLSC system is explained elaborately in this study. The results show that cross-channel recovery rates and consumer channel preferences have a direct significant impact on pricing strategies including profit allocation decisions in CLSC. It demonstrated that different channel preferences leading to different pricing strategies and decision for manufacturers and retailers choices. Manufacturer’s pricing decreases when channel preferences are constant and cross-channel recovery rates increase. Retailer’s pricing remains stable as the cross-channel recovery rate has less affected on it. Furthermore, if the cross-channel recovery rates increase, then the manufacturers pricing decreases and retailers pricing increases. This information will be a helpful guideline for the manager to select suitable pricing strategies based on the company scenario.</jats:p>"

The hot water supply system uses a significant part of thermal energy and requires no less attention than the heating or ventilation system. The amount of heat loss from hot water distribution systems is of great importance for the energy consumption of buildings. In winter, part of this heat is used for space heating, in summer they are unused and is considered as lost heat.   For this reason, this paper considers the influence of water velocity in the pipe, pipe size, and water temperature on the total heat losses in the insulated hot-water distribution system.   The data are presented in tabular and graphical form. A graph of the dependence of the amount of heat loss on the temperature and velocity of hot water is obtained.</jats:p>",

However, the standard process of measuring BOD5 is time consuming and could delay crucial mitigation works in the event of pollution. To solve this problem, this study employed multiple machine learning (ML) methods such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to train a best model that can accurately predict the BOD5 values in water samples based on other physical and chemical properties of the water. The training parameters were optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and feature selection was made using the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. The proposed machine learning framework was first tested on a public dataset (Waterbase). The MLP method produced the best model, with an R2 score of 0.7672791942775417, relative mean squared error (MSE) and relative mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 15%. Feature importance calculations indicated that chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), ammonium and nitrate are features that highly correlate to BOD5. In the field study with a small private dataset consisting of water samples collected from two different lakes in Jiangsu Province of China, the trained model was found to have a similar range of prediction error (around 15%), a similar relative MAE (around 14%) and achieved about 6% better relative RMSE.</jats:p>",

The technical performance of this network was assessed using global performance index methods after modifying the performance levels as per local guidelines. A total of 37 operational performance indicators for the network were selected to carry out assessment. Overall operational performance showed high scores whereas some indicators showed unacceptable performance values. The network showed very high technical performance considering nodal pressures. The lower performance for pipe velocity may be attributed to the fact that the network is currently being utilized by 70% of the population for which it was designed. The residual chlorine levels were within the acceptable range of the Public Authority for Water (PAW), showing a very good performance by virtue of water quality. This study will be useful for decision makers to assess the operational, technical and water quality performance of urban networks and take actions for improvements.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the two most important challenges in CSSC, digitalization and decarbonization, are explained and discussed in detail. We raise awareness of the extreme fragmentation of CSSC that causes inefficient operations. A pathway to digitalize container shipping is proposed that requires the applications of digital technologies in various business processes across five logistics segments, and change in behaviors and relationships of stakeholders in the supply chain. We recognize that shipping decarbonization is likely to take diverse pathways with different fuel/energy systems for ships and ports. This gives rise to more research and application opportunities in the highly uncertain and complex CSSC environment.</jats:p>"

Based on today’s competitive market, considering the needs and desires of the customer is very important. Thus, designing the supply chain network to minimize the costs and improve the system efficiency, the service facility, and attention to the timely service delivery to the customer should be considered. Also, deployment costs to determine the number and position of facilities are regarded as another strategic issue. Therefore, to become closer to the real-world application, by considering the Jackson network model (queuing theory), the present study aims to design a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network to reduce the waiting time in the queue. Two objectives, namely minimizing the cost and waiting time incurred in queues formed in producers and distributors, are investigated. Queuing mathematical expressions are used both in dealing with objectives and constraints. To develop a model, which is close to real by considering uncertainty, the parameters, including demand rate and shipping cost of products, were considered as a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Also, we crisp this fuzzy uncertainty using both Jimenez and chance-constrained programming approaches. Due to the suggested model’s complexity and nonlinearity, we linearized the mathematical model as much as possible, then two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), are used to solve the model. First, the structural parameters of these algorithms are tuned by the Taguchi method. Then, numerous numerical test problems ranging from small to large scales are used to compare these algorithms considering Pareto front measuring indexes and various hypothesis tests.</jats:p>"

The 3D instantaneous velocity of water is measured by acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV) at the test section, which will provide an important data related to the flow turbulence. The parameters of turbulence measured that the vertical profiles of longitudinal velocity in flows with a sand bed channel at the vicinity of the bed surface are higher by 2–6% than flow subjected to gravel bed channel, while away from the boundary surface, it decreases by 5–10%. The variations of Reynolds shear stress increase by 35–50% with gravel bed channel, indicating higher exchange of flow energy towards the boundary and vice versa. The higher value is obtained for shear velocities by 58.5% and the von Karman's constant with gravel bed channel. The gravel bed channel influenced the turbulence intensities with higher magnitude in the streamwise and vertical direction. The present study also analysed the flow anisotropy, correlations coefficient and turbulence diffusivity and compared the results. The outcomes of the current work are beneficial for civil and hydraulic engineers, since the data of turbulence will advance the management of bed materials present in the river.</jats:p>",

I focus on Rules of Origin (RoO), which limit expenses on nonmember country's intermediate inputs. In a three‐country FTA formation game, I introduce international trade in intermediate inputs and RoO restrictions. In the case of symmetric countries, I show that as countries become more involved in global supply chains, measured by their input shares in foreign final goods production, global free trade is less likely to be a stable equilibrium outcome. Free riding is the main problem preventing countries from liberalising trade. Countries are better off being nonmembers of FTAs between the other two countries relative to global free trade. Rules of Origin can solve this problem by limiting the benefits countries get from other countries' free trade agreements. In the case of asymmetric countries, an additional incentive exists for the smaller country not to join: such a country gives up more than it gains from joining an FTA for a sufficiently high degree of asymmetry in country sizes. I show that global free trade is a stable Nash equilibrium under a larger region of asymmetric country parameter space in the case of RoO than without it. Therefore, it is shown that RoO is essential in order to attain global free trade.</jats:p>",

Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are responding to the pandemic in a variety of ways. Together, disruptions from and responses to COVID-19 illuminate existing vulnerabilities in the fish distribution paradigm and possible means of reducing system and actor sensitivity and exposure and increasing adaptive capacity. Integrating concepts from literature on supply chain disruptions, social-ecological systems, human wellbeing, vulnerability, and SSFs, we synthesize preliminary lessons from six case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, Canada, and the United States. The SSF supply chains examined employ different distribution strategies and operate in different geographic, political, social, economic, and cultural contexts. Specifically, we ask: a) how resilient have different SSF supply chains been to COVID-19 impacts; b) what do these initial outcomes indicate about the role of distribution strategies in determining the vulnerability of SSF supply chains to macroeconomic shocks; and c) what key factors have shaped this vulnerability? Based on our findings, systemic changes that may reduce SSF vulnerability to future macroeconomic shocks include diversification of distribution strategies, livelihoods, and products, development of local and domestic markets and distribution channels, reduced reliance on international markets, establishment of effective communication channels, and preparation for providing aid to directly assist supply chains and support consumer purchasing power.</p>"

As MDA campaigns involve treating hundreds of thousands to millions of patients in endemic regions within entire countries over the course of days or weeks, close coordination and timing of medicine delivery is critical. Inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems and limited transparency on supply chain performance further challenges the ability to identify shipment issues and explore the root cause of the issues. Prior to 2016, delivery was performing below standards, lagging as much as 40% below the WHO target of 80% on-time delivery. These delays result in wasted medicine donations, increased program costs, delayed MDAs, or sometimes even completely missed MDAs. In September 2016, an online supply chain performance measurement system, “NTDeliver,” was launched by the NTD Supply Chain Forum (a public-private partnership focused on managing and improving the PC donation supply chain) to enhance supply chain performance and information transparency. Our findings suggest that information sharing through NTDeliver is positively associated with performance at several key stages in NTD supply chain and that information sharing has more substantial positive impact on performance when the information is made publicly accessible, focused towards country program managers. The study findings support investment in supply chain systems and commitment to data transparency, in the context of a growing focus on supply chain investment in NTD programs.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

In this regard, a mixed procedure was implemented in order to explore and analyze the relevant publications, and to answer the research questions. First, the databases and journals working on forest biomass and bioenergy supply chains (SCs) were identified based on the indices of the review process and the indices of the barriers and enablers. Next, data refinement was employed to filter the publications into four levels and determine the semifinal cases. Moreover, the references of the semifinal publications were tracked in order to achieve the final cases. Consequently, 88 papers were determined as the final cases through which the barriers and enablers were explored and analyzed. Furthermore, in order to meet the research gap in this area and prove the connections of those barriers and enablers with the resilience capability, their relationships with the main resilience factors were investigated. According to the assessment, the findings of this research on the definition, barriers and enablers of forest biomass and bioenergy SCR can be applied as a basis for the comprehension and optimization of the structure of SCs in the forest biomass and bioenergy industries.</jats:p>"

A ceramic slurry with high solid loading is usually used in SL to fabricate the desired shape, which is further sintered to produce the final part. The traditional SL system utilizes a tank filled with printable material, known as a vat, which for ceramic slurry contributes several limitations and operational difficulties, and further renders it non-recyclable mainly due to its high viscosity and the fragility of the green state. In this study, we utilized a continuous film supply (CFS) printer integrated with a tape casting system using in-house-designed ceramic slurry to print standard prototype specimens. Various printing parameters, including viscosity, layer thickness control, and slurry recycling efficiency, were studied. In addition, post-processing optimizations of the prototype, characterizations, and the microhardness of sintered samples were studied to determine their properties and compare them with traditional methods. The effectiveness of slurry reusability was demonstrated by printing with original and recycled slurry to produce consistent densification of final parts. Post-processing was optimized to achieve a relative sinter density of 99.02% and microhardness of 12.59 GPa. This method provides new opportunities to realize dense complex ceramic features with final properties comparable to those produced by subtractive machining and traditional SL. Furthermore, slurry recycling helps to reduce the overall cost and material consumption.</jats:p>"

In order to recover value from returned items, it is necessary to undertake additional activities, from inspections through to preparation for re-sale. This case study looks at a UK-based 3PL and the value-adding activities that it has implemented to improve the efficiency and minimise costs of managing returns with four of its clients. Over an 18-month period the authors worked with Prolog Fulfilment Ltd to identify financial efficiencies, sustainability improvements and general changes to working practices. A reverse logistics toolkit was applied across the four clients to help determine new and innovative ways of processing returns. The paper applies a returned items classification continuum to demonstrate how improving processes can move products up the continuum and hence recover more value. The case study illustrates how returns management services can both add value for retailers and improve the reusability and recyclability of returned products and their component parts, thus reducing the amount of product going to landfill.</jats:p>"

Many corporates decided to transit into hybrid working, allowing their staff to work remotely at least part of the week, which is likely to lead to lower demand for office space even in the mid and long term. This situation is exacerbated for office building landlords by the explosion in subleasing activity and is even tougher for retail space landlords, leading to a parallel increase in supply of office space. Adding to that the growing demand for higher flexibility from tenants and likely decrease in length of an average office lease, we see a perfect storm requiring office building landlords to take serious actions to remain relevant and succeed in the new market reality. Improving the safety of their buildings and perception of safety via better direct communication with building’s end users, providing more robust services and utilising technology to streamline operations and to enable more flexibility will be vital to landlords’ and asset managers’ success in the coming years. The likely increase in vacancy rates will not hit all office buildings equally; there will be winners and losers in the new reality. This situation can also become a catalyst for the whole industry to move from being a cost centre and become a value provider for tenants, enabling them to drive talent attraction and retention while keeping their workforce safe and informed.</jats:p>"

If the tail-water depth is greater than the secondary depth of the hydraulic jump, the jump will be submerged (SHJ). In these conditions, the momentum equations will not have an analytical solution and a new solution is required. In this study, after dimensional analysis, an experimental study was conducted in a rectangular flume with a length of 9 m, a width of 0.5 m and a depth of 0.45 m in a wide range of Froude numbers (Fr = 3.5 to 11.5) and submergence ratios (Sr = 0.1 to 4). The data were then normalized and divided into two parts of training and testing. A new technique, DGMDH, was used to predict the submerged hydraulic jump characteristics. The results were then compared with the GMDH model. The results showed that the DGMDH model estimated the relative submergence depth, jump length, and relative energy loss with accuracy of R2 = 0.9944 and MAPE = 0.038, R2 = 0.9779 and MAPE = 0.0387, and R2 = 0.9932 and MAPE = 0.0192, respectively. While the accuracy of the GMDH model for relative submergence depth, jump length, and relative energy loss was respectively R2 = 0.9923 and MAPE = 0.043, R2 = 0.9671 and MAPE = 0.0527, and R2 = 0.9932 and MAPE = 0.0192. Due to superiority of the DGMDH model over the GMDH model, it is recommended to use this model to estimate the submerged hydraulic jump characteristics.</jats:p>",

Although, the primary motive of using a blockchain for supply chain management is to reduce the overall production cost while providing the comprehensive security to the system. However, current blockchain-based supply-chain management (BC-SCM) systems still hold the possibility of cyber attacks. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate practical threats and vulnerabilities in the design of BC-SCM systems. As a starting point, we first establish key requirements for the reliability and security of supply chain management systems, i.e., transparency, privacy and traceability, and then discern a threat model that includes two distinctive but practical threats including computational (i.e., the ones that threaten the functionality of the application) and communication (i.e., the ones that threaten information exchange among interconnected services of the application). For investigation, we follow a unique approach based on the hypothesis that reliability is pre-requisite of security and identify the threats considering (i) design of smart contracts and associated supply chain management applications, (ii) underlying blockchain execution environment and (iii) trust between all interconnected supply management services. Moreover, we consider both academic and industry solutions to identify the threats. We identify several challenges that hinder to establish reliability and security of the BC-SCM systems. Importantly, we also highlight research gaps that can help to establish desired security of the BC-SCM. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first effort that identifies practical threats to blockchain-based supply chain management systems and provides their counter measures. Finally, this work establishes foundation for future investigation towards practical security of BC-SCM system.</jats:p>"

Low carbon and resilient climate development in Pakistan can help to ensure climate action and reduce the chronic energy deficit ailing the country’s economy, society, and environment. This study focuses on developing and applying an integrated energy supply-demand modeling framework based on a combination of microeconomics and system integration theories, which can be used to address policies that could dramatically change the future course of Pakistan toward a low emission energy system. The methodology involves medium-term forecasting of energy demand using an integration of top-down and bottom-up modeling approaches. The demand-side model is interlinked with a bottom-up technology assessment supply model. The objective of the supply-side model is to identify the optimal combination of resources and technologies, subject to satisfying technical, institutional, environmental, and economic constraints, using the cost minimization approach. The proposed integrated model is applied to enable a complete perspective to achieve overall reductions in energy consumption and generation and better analyze the effects of different scenarios on both energy demand and supply sides in Pakistan. The results revealed that, in the baseline case, the energy demand is expected to increase from 8.70 Mtoe [106.7 TWh] to 24.19 Mtoe [297.2 TWh] with an annual average growth rate of 6.60%. Increasing the share of renewable energy power generation by 2030 can help to reduce emissions by 24%, which is accompanied by a 13% increase in the total cost of power generation.</jats:p>"

First, we present the implication of blockchain technology for the pharmaceutical industry value chain. Then, we discuss the specific features of both projects from multiple angles, including ecosystem, governance, and opportunities and risks. Finally, we provide the lessons learned and the implications for the case studies under investigation. Ultimately, identification of the right use case, co-creation, acceptance among stakeholders and data privacy and security seem to be the most critical success factors for the implementation of an effective blockchain operating in the pharmaceutical industry. The paper constitutes a bridge for both practitioners and researchers between the theory behind blockchain networks and its empirical applications within the pharmaceutical industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>This paper presents a mixed model for studying the amount of time of care available from family members of elderly people with disabilities, mainly of irreversible type, like Alzheimer or other neurological diseases. This model starts with data obtained from a classical microsimulation model of kinship which provides descending genealogies of elderly persons, based on demographic parameters specifics to the population studied. These genealogies are then fed to an Agent-Based model which follow these elderly persons and their kin for age 50 until their death in order to study the balance between the demand for care of disabled persons and the supply of care by their kin. This supply depends on the situation of these kin, typically of their labour status as well as the eventual needs for care of their own families. The paper reviews the methodology for the construction of microsimulation models of kinship and presents our own implementation. It also details the specifications of the Agent-based part of the overall model. Finally, we present some results using Spanish data.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Logistics is an important part of the Supply Chain. The management of logistics and supply chain is a complex process of planning and management of services, goods from the origin to the point of consumption. Logistics is defined as the process of managing movement of goods in and out of an organization. Supply Chain is defined as the process of managing movement and coordination of goods in between multiple organizations. Together Logistics and Supply Chain includes planning the transport, warehousing, inventory and sales an example of logistics could be the military stockpiling ammo whereas an example of Supply Chain management is making sure the right amount of goods reaches the destination, supplying more could lead to increased storage costs and supplying less could lead to inefficiencies. So, the main objective of Logistics is customer satisfaction and the main objective of Supply Chain is to have a competitive advantage by being more efficient. This project aims to have both customer satisfaction and efficiency and will achieved by implementing Internet of Things and Machine Learning to Logistics and Supply Chain. Large Corporations invest a lot of money to improve supply chains. This paper aims to help small businesses and rural businesses to improve their Supply Chain. This project aims at providing customer satisfaction and efficiency. Implementation using IoT and machine learning provides better efficiency.

The data were collected by distributing 30 questionnaires to manufacturing companies that achieved ISO 14001 in Malaysia. The reliability test revealed that all variables ranged from 0.806 to 0.920, and the item measures have sufficient level of reliability. The descriptive analysis revealed that environmental risk is the most frequent supply chain risks in ISO 14001 certified manufacturing company in Malaysia. Another finding showed that both economic and environmental performances, on average, were highly moderated compared to the past two years of performance. Based on the findings, the researchers and practitioners are raising knowledge about the overall ranking of each dimension in supply chain risks. The findings of this study can be beneficial for top-level management specifically for the top management in ISO 14001 certified manufacturing companies in Malaysia. They will be aware of how to mitigate the supply chain risks and how to protect the supply chain management. Future study can include the strategy or practices that can improve both economic and environmental performance by reducing the supply chain risks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In most organizations, financial results have been the key metric of progress. On a weekly, quarterly, and annual basis, the companies have created reporting structures and financial statements to measure their “supply chain” success. Companies, on the other hand, have struggled to establish successful real-time “supply chain” output analysis and processes. Companies today are working in an ever-changing and volatile world while still competing against global competition. As a result, the principle of “supply chain” management (SCM) has assumed strategic significance. So far, research has shown that many modern businesses have struggled to maximize their “supply chain’s capacity because they have often failed to develop the success metrics required to properly leverage their “supply chain”. Manufacturing companies in India are no exception. The authors of this paper want to suggest whether or not a specific solution is appropriate in the case of Indian manufacturing companies. All required factors influencing a company's “supply chain” success have been incorporated, and the suitability of “supply chain” measurement methods, especially for manufacturing organisations, has been suggested. A scale for “supply chain” efficiency methods was established using data obtained from 100 manufacturing organizations throughout India. The research findings are supposed to have important consequences for Indian manufacturing companies in terms of understanding the factors that contribute to effective SCM operations.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a scenario-based approach for performance assessment of intervention strategies in water resources and supply systems (WRSS). A system dynamics (SD) approach is used for modelling the key WRSS components and their complex interactions with natural and human systems and is combined with a multi-criteria decision analysis for sustainability performance assessment of strategies in each scenario. The scenarios combine population growth rates with groundwater extraction limits and three intervention strategies. The methodology was demonstrated on a real-world case study in Iran. Results show scenario-based analysis can provide suitable strategies leading to long-term sustainability of water resources for each scenario imposed on the water systems. For scenarios with either no threshold or one threshold of groundwater extraction limit, the only effective strategies for sustainable groundwater preservation are those involving agricultural water demand decrease with an average recovery rate of 130% for groundwater resources while other strategies of agricultural groundwater abstraction (constant/increase rates) fail to sustainably recover groundwater resources. However, all analysed strategies can provide sustainability of water resources with an average recovery rate of 33% for groundwater resources only when scenarios with two threshold limits are in place. The impact of scenarios on groundwater conservation is quite minor for population growth rates with an average recovery rate of 11% compared to groundwater extraction limits with an average recovery rate of 79% between no threshold and two threshold limits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The consumption pattern of Indian consumers is fast diversifying due to rapid internationalization of dietary patterns, rising double income families and ever-increasing health consciousness. As a result, consumers have shifted significantly from consuming merely food grains to vegetables and fruits. This change has accelerated the demand for more and more horticultural produce, both raw and processed. Tomato is one of the major horticulture crops consumed world widely. The consumption of tomato products increased over the past few years. According to the report of WPTC the increase in the consumption of processed tomato indicates a slow shift of consumers away from fresh products towards processed products. The demand for tomato is high in Europe, North America, Italy, U.S.A, Russia and Germany. The demand of the processed tomato is more most of the tomato is consumed as sauce for pizza and pasta. Tomato is one of the most widely grown vegetable crops in Uttarakhand and Tarai region of North India. In Uttarakhand 119742 metric tons of tomato is cultivated in an area of 9360.75 hectares (NHB, 2019). The farmers of Uttarakhand prefer tomato cultivation as the agro-climate condition is favourable. Moreover, wide spread use of tomatoes for different food preparations such as soups, salads, pickles, chutney, paste, puree, ketchups, junk and ready to eat food has increased demand for tomatoes. In Uttarakhand, the generated produce is not efficiently supported by the existing market infrastructure. The entire supply chain of tomato is laden with inefficiencies: poor transportation facilities, lack of cold chain facilities, lack of processing units, poor connectivity from farm to market, huge post-harvest losses and large no. intermediaries. The grower’s still practice traditional cultivation methods remain unaware of consumer needs, preferences and prevailing market prices. This causes large fluctuation in consumer prices and low quality of non-standardized produce. This is a double whammy as farmers realize poor prices on the one hand whereas consumers pay exorbitant prices on the other hand. Horticulture crops being high value crops are important in enhancing income for the farmers besides creating on farm and off farm employment. It is important for India to leverage its diverse agro-climates and distinct seasons, which makes it possible for farmers to grow a wide variety of horticulture crops. The objective of this paper is to design an efficient supply chain model which can better price realization of farmers and also ensures timely, adequate, quality supplies to consumers at the right prices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent times, the supply chain has developed into a large ecosystem. Various products moving from party to party require cooperation between stakeholders in managing the data generated. The problem is that every company has its own transaction records that can be inconsistent and their storage is centralized and not integrated between companies. This makes transaction records easy to falsify. Efficient data management is needed from the producer to the store so that consumers can trust the product. Therefore, the authors designed a product tracking system using blockchain by implementing proof of work (PoW) as the consensus algorithm, SHA-3 256 as data security, Mongo database as cloud-based data storage and QR Code as the output. As a result, transaction data from producers, distributors to retail stores are stored completely in MongoDB which is a cloud-based database, then the resulting QR Code can be used to view details of producers, distributors to retail stores that sell them. The simulation and trial results show the product tracing system design is successful as expected.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

It seeks to establish whether the energy supply has been securitized within the European integration process and if so when it happened. The literature review does not give a definitive and comprehensive answer to this question which is essential for all the history of the EEC and the EU. The authors of this study use an extensive documentary database available on the EU websites. They established that for the EEC/EU the energy policy securitization is a long-lasting ongoing process that came into being in 1973. Within the European integration, the securitization is justified by the dependency of the member states on the imported energy resources, which is regarded through the prism of securing reliable, affordable, and (since 2000s) environmentally sustainable supply. The authors identified two waves of energy supply securitization in the EEC/EU. The first wave was triggered by the oil embargo of the OPEC Arab countries and, generally, the world oil crisis of 1973-1974. The second wave of the 2000s and 2010s was triggered by the Russian-Ukrainian gas conflicts of 2006 and 2009 and the sharp deterioration of Russian-Ukrainian relations in 2014. For both waves, the Commission was the main ‘securitizing actor’. However, during the second wave, the European Parliament, some EU countries, and even the United States made their own ‘securitizing moves’. The ‘audience’ (EEC/EU countries) expressed its opinion towards the ‘securitizing moves’ through the European Council and the Council decisions. The research conclusions can be useful for a profound scientific explanation of the EU energy policy as well as for the operationalization of the securitization concept.</jats:p>"

These methods have been widely applied in the area of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) because of their computational capabilities. This paper conducts a systematic literature review on MCDM methods applied in different areas of SSCM. From the literature search, a total of 106 published journal articles have been selected and analyzed. Both individual and integrated MCDM methods applied in SSCM are reviewed and summarized. In addition, contributions, methodological focuses, and findings of the reviewed articles are discussed. It is observed that MCDM methods are widely used for analyzing barriers, challenges, drivers, enablers, criteria, performances, and practices of SSCM. In recent years, studies have focused on integrating more than one MCDM method to highlight methodological contributions in SSCM; however, in the literature, limited research papers integrate multiple MCDM methods in the area of SSCM. Most of the published articles integrate only two MCDM methods, and integration with other methods, such as optimization and simulation techniques, is missing in the literature. This review paper contributes to the literature by analyzing existing research, identifying research gaps, and proposing new future research opportunities in the area of sustainable supply chain management applying MCDM methods.</jats:p>"

Notable Progress Includes Donor Agencies Interventions Contributing Considerably To Capacity Building Of Government Personnel And Adequate Capacity At The National Level 396 (100.0), The Institutionalization Of Capacity Development At All Levels Through National Product Supply Chain Management Programme, Procurement And Supply Management Technical Working Groups, And Logistics Management Coordinating Unit 292 (73.7) And Demonstrable Capacity In Key Supply Chain Functions 259 (65.4). The Study Revealed Substantial Progress In Capacity Building Of The HIV/AIDS Supply Chain Workforce, Evident With The Institutionalization Of Capacity Building And Demonstrable Capacity In The Key Supply Chain Functions. More So, Master Trainers From The Government Are Not Always Part Of The Facilitators And Involved In Capacity Building, Needs Assessment Does Not Always Precede Capacity Building, The Inadequate Pool Of Master Trainers, Fellowship Training Program Is Not Recognized, And Pre-Service Training Has Not Been Institutionalized. Chi-Square Statistics Revealed That The Extent Of Progress In Capacity Building Is A Significant Factor Of HIV/AIDS Supply Chain Workforce Capacity (P&lt;0.05). There Is A Need To Develop Manuals, Policies, And Procedures To Ensure Sustained Progress In Capacity Building, Needs Assessment Precedes Capacity Building, More Training Conducted To Ensure An Adequate Pool Of Master Trainers In The Public Sector And Their Participation In Future Capacity Building Interventions.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we build a closed-loop supply chain model and focus on the recycling behaviors of the members in this supply chain, which contains two manufacturers, the retailer and the consumer. In the reverse chain, we set up dual channels and design two recycling methods: sell-back method and trade-in method. We use classical backward induction to run the model. And then we analyze the stability of the system and the impacts of some essential parameters by numerical simulation. The speed of the manufacture’s decision adjustment has a significant effect on the stability of the model. When the decision variables of manufacturers go into instability, the profits of both manufacturers and the retailer have a profit loss in multiple cycles on average. The lower production cost of manufacturer 1 will increase the retailer's profit and self-profit, while manufacturer 2's profit will decrease. And the smaller price coefficient of the retailer can bring higher profits but aggravate the chaotic condition, and the stability of the whole system will decrease. In the end, we adopt the parameter control method and the decision-making method to control chaos, and they both have a good control effect.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work joins a series that methodically tests the predictions of the Selfish-Brain theory. The theory postulates a vital ability of the mammalian brain, namely to give priority to its own energy metabolism. The brain behaves “selfishly” in this respect. For the cerebral artery occlusion studied here, the theory predicts an increase in blood glucose concentration, what becomes the hypothesis to be tested. We conducted a systematic review of cerebral-artery-occlusion papers to test whether or not the included studies could confirm this hypothesis. We identified 239 records, screened 231 works by title or abstract, and analyzed 89 by full text. According to strict selection criteria (set out in our PROSPERO preregistration, complying with PRISMA guidelines), 7 papers provided enough information to decide on the hypothesis. Our hypothesis could be fully confirmed for the 3 to 24 h after the onset of a transient 2 h or permanent occlusion. As for the mechanism, the theory predicts that the energy-deprived brain suppresses insulin secretion via the sympathoadrenal system, thereby preventing insulin-mediated glucose uptake into muscle and fat and, as a result, enhancing insulin-independent glucose uptake via the blood-brain barrier. Evidence from our included studies actually demonstrated cerebral insulin suppression. In all, the current work confirms the second major prediction of the Selfish-Brain theory that relates to a proximal bottleneck of the cerebral supply chain, cerebral artery occlusion. Its first major prediction relates to a distal supply bottleneck, caloric restriction, and is fulfilled as shown by our previous work, whereas the prediction of the long held gluco-lipostatic theory, which sees the brain as only passively supplied, is violated (Sprengell et al., <jats:xref>2021</jats:xref>). The crucial point was that caloric restriction elicits smaller changes in mass (energy) in the brain than in the body. Taken together, the evidence from the current and previous work clearly shows that the most accurate predictions are possible with a theory that views the brain as an independently self-regulating energy compartment occupying a primary position in energy metabolism.</jats:p>"

The operation of the buck– boost converter in discontinuous conduction mode ensures inherent PFC operation and reduces complexity in control. Hence there is a need to reduce the line current harmonics so as to improve the power factor of the system. This has led to designing of Power Factor Correction circuits. This concept presents a power factor corrected (PFC) Buck–Boost converter-fed SMPS. This project deals with the design, analysis, simulation, and development of a power-factor-correction (PFC) multiple output switched-mode power supply (SMPS) using a Buck–Boost converter at the front end. Single-phase ac supply is fed to a pair of back-to-back connected buck–boost converters to eliminate the diode bridge rectifier, which results in reduction of conduction losses and power quality improvement at the front end. To observe the performance of this converter, a model based on the Buck Boost topology has been designed and developed software and implemented with Proportional-Integral (PI) and Fuzzy logic controller. The simulations are demonstrated in order to validate the effectiveness of the controllers in power factor improvement. By using MATLAB.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are breakthrough financial technologies that promise to revolutionize the digital economy. Unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction. To date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements. Our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the Bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues. Our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve. Regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of Bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct. This result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon Bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs. We also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees. Regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand. This finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the Bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner. Our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets.</jats:p>"

We analyze the career path of 1081 international graduates from a higher degree program in Supply Chain Management from 2000 to 2017 to assess the impact of gender and expatriation choice on hierarchical progression. We explore two variables that may affect graduates’ career paths, namely, their gender and their expatriation choices, and compare their relative importance. Our analysis shows that there were, on average, 33.5% women recruited in the MSc and that this has not significantly changed over the years. It also shows that gender significantly influences the number of years spent at each level in the career hierarchy and the level reached. Regarding expatriation choice, this variable has some significant impacts on career progression. Finally, statistics indicate that gender has a far greater influence on career progression than expatriation choice. Overall, this study proves the difficulties for women in enjoying the same career progression as men in the field of Supply Chain Management.</jats:p>"

Due to the asymmetry of information among enterprises, it is difficult for them to maximize efficiency and profits. To maximize the efficiency and profit of the CLSC, this study establishes five cooperation models of CLSC under the government‘s reward–penalty mechanism. We make decisions on wholesale prices, retail prices, transfer payment prices, and recovery rates relying on the Stackelberg game method and compare the optimal decisions. This paper analyzes the impact of the government reward-penalty mechanism on optimal decisions and how members in CLSC choose partners. We find that the government’s reward-penalty mechanism can effectively increase the recycling rate of used products and the total profit of the closed-loop supply chain. According to the calculation results of the models, under the government’s reward-penalty mechanism, the cooperation can improve the CLSC’s used products recycling capacity and profitability. In a supply chain, the more members participate in the cooperation, the higher profit the CLSC obtain. However, the cooperation mode of all members may lead to monopoly, which is not approved by government and customers.</jats:p>"

For many supply chain organisations, solutions for the omnichannel shift were implemented in existing warehouse space. By taking to the oars, the marketplace has been able to meet their customers’ omnichannel demand, but for how long? In many cases, operations have been retrofit beyond reasonable efficiency and without room for scale. Under Armour’s Baltimore distribution house experienced the same. The strategy for a distribution house start-up, designed with omnichannel in mind, became the clear path forward. Much like the omnichannel shift, facility start-ups have many unique challenges. As Under Armour prepared to open the doors of the omnichannel distribution house (ODH), a broader start-up strategy emerged. The distribution team elected to implement a holistic performance management programme, including leadership training, process improvements, engineered labour standards and labour management software tools. Performance management, while not commonly implemented at the beginning of a facility life cycle, would create a continuous improvement culture for the ODH team, establishing resilience to change and motivation to overcome obstacles common with warehouse start-ups. In this paper, we will share how Under Armour utilised this performance management strategy to overcome human and operational start-up challenges and accelerate success in their ODH.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is vital to accurately conduct sedimentary assessment. In this paper, the analytic hierarchy process was used to determine subjective weights, gray correlation analysis and entropy weight method were used to determine objective weights. The combination weights obtained using optimized combination weighting method based on genetic algorithm were more suitable for the comprehensive analysis of the impact of reservoir sedimentation. This was then used to constructed a multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on improved cloud model. A reservoir was selected as the study object, and its sedimentation impact level was evaluated: the numerical characteristics of the stratus cloud of the comment on the impact of the reservoir sedimentation were (0.6372, 0.0664, 0.0795). The results showed that the reservoir sedimentation is considered as severe influence, and the sedimentation has become a major problem that needed to be solved urgently. The results of this paper could provide insight for reservoir research domestically and abroad. Furthermore, it could also enable managers to more accurately grasp the severity of reservoir sedimentation.</jats:p>",

After that, this paper makes an empirical study of the productive and green system efficiency of the green supply chain of companies. Since TIANNENG is the largest electric bicycle company in China, we take it as an example here. The results show that the overall green output of Chinese industrial companies in the field of electric bicycle batteries is strong, but with obvious fluctuations. The internal green output is reasonably constant, and change requires new power; the external green performance fluctuates heavily. The findings also show that industrial battery companies can increase the level of collection and recycling of waste, improve the efficiency of recovery and reuse of residual heat, and improve the organization of the green supply chain.</jats:p>"

Sediments, recording the steady process of microplastics accumulation during a long period of time, can act as an important sink for microplastics. In this study, we investigated the distribution, characteristics and ecological risks of microplastic contaminants in sediments of a water supply reservoir of Hefei City (the Dafangying Reservoir). Meanwhile, the differences of microplastic concentrations in sediments between the rural and urban areas were also compared. The average microplastics abundance of sediments in rural areas was 83.20 ± 32.99 n/100g dry weight (dw), and 182.67 ± 72.21 n/100g (dw) in urban areas. The total microplastic concentrations were significantly higher in sediments of urban sites than that in rural sites (p &lt; 0.01), which can be ascribed to more complex and diverse microplastic sources triggered by intensive anthropogenic activity in cities. Specifically, we also demonstrated significantly higher microbead abundance (p &lt; 0.01) in urban sites, which may result from the widespread use of microbead in personal care products. Our results detected five shapes (fibers, debris, films, foams and microbeads) and seven colors (white, black, transparency, red, blue, green and brown) of microplastics in sediments of the Dafangying Reservoir, with fibers and transparency accounting for the dominant shape and color, respectively. Given the complexity and diversity of microplastics in urban areas, we exhibited a relatively higher abundance of microplastics in the Dafangying Reservoir than that in other rural larger reservoirs. According to the index of geoaccumulation, the sedimentary microplastics were assessed as moderately polluted. Our study provides valuable references for microplastic contaminants in urban water supply reservoir, and highlights the importance of microplastics assessment in aquatic ecosystems.</jats:p>"

Drinking water samples from 60 water dispensers of different type-brands were collected and tested for physicochemical and microbiological parameters by following WHO Drinking Water Quality guidelines. Also evaluated by questionnaires were hygienic standards and maintenance of water dispensers. The physicochemical analysis of all water samples did not exceed the reference values of the drinking water standard; the hardness value in only 13.3% of samples was slightly higher than the reference limit. The microbiological results indicated that total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria were found in 16.67% and 8.33% of total samples, respectively. Escherichia coli was not detected in any of the water samples. The assessment of factors influencing drinking water quality, location and pathogen source around water dispensers, hygienic environment, and maintenance of water dispensers had a significant effect on drinking water quality.</jats:p>",

It investigates categories of performance metrics in terms of time, cost, and quality. Likewise, it discovers the characteristics of performance metrics through measuring working capital in the supply chain. In addition, it defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and its core calculations for the end-to-end supply chain to measure the practicality of operations' efficiency. The supply chain operations with respect to critical KPIs are determined as plan, source, make, delivery, and return. The proposed performance metrics- KPIs presented as the milestones of dynamic supply chain models.

The heart of the modelling inference is Bayesian statistics with Gibbs sampling, which can provide flexible parametric distributions for capturing abnormal distributional observations. Yearly panel data between 2008 and 2018 regarding tourism supplies such as numbers of hotels, service rooms, and labour forces in ASEAN-5 countries (Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysian, Singapore, and Thailand) is observed. The empirical results are divided into two major parts. The first section is the understanding of spatial effects which causally relate to the way for expanding tourism supplies is explained by the model validation using deviance information criterion (DIC). The panel spatial-error stochastic frontier (random-effect model) contains the minimum DIC which implies the parameters of locational effects is the minor, but it should be still considered for stimulating tourism supply sides in these five countries. The second section is the estimation of random parameters are processed to monitor technical efficiencies. Spatial effects are a specific impact on the group of connected borderline countries. On the other hand, this impact is dependently reduced when a country contains a remote area condition. Ultimately, this paper is the alternative to better analyse supply-chain management in the tourism sector without the restrictions of P-value, asymptotic struggling, and multicollinear problems. For further researches, subjective statistics (Bayesian) is the main issue that applies for modern econometrics.</jats:p>",

Food waste has negative impacts on different dimensions of sustainability: social (hunger), economic (resource costs), and environmental (resource consumption and waste generation). This paper focuses on waste reduction through improving the inventory management system in the dairy distribution chain by the application of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). The approach is tested and verified in a case study by application of simulation modelling. Two inventory management models are created, and their impact on waste in the distribution part of the supply chain is examined. Model 1 represents the current dairy inventory management system in the supply of retail stores. Model 2 is based on a higher level of information connectivity between participants (RFID product labelling and the appropriate level of information technology), enabling automatic product ordering and changes in inventory management policy. The obtained results confirm that coordinated inventory management, supported by the application of modern ICT, can significantly contribute to the improvement of the sustainability of the food supply chain, and provide an exact quantification of the given contribution in the case of the dairy industry.</jats:p>"

The network structures of these far‐reaching supply chains are believed to influence both firm‐level and supply chain‐level behavior. However, researchers and managers are challenged to manage extended supply chain networks because firms typically do not actively oversee their entire supply chain network. The extant research on the underlying network topologies is limited and relies on untested structural assumptions. This study addresses the latter issue by examining structural topologies in supply chain networks. We draw from the network and supply chain literature and empirically investigate the presence of topologies found in complex networks. In particular, we look for: small‐world, scale‐free, community, and hierarchical network structures. We study 21 extended (five‐tier) supply chain networks of firms representing various industries. Our analysis provides evidence for community, scale‐free, and hierarchical structures within the observed supply chain networks. The identification of network topologies is relevant to understand how to study supply chain networks and provide insights into network behavior and performance.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the GFDLCM2, MPI and IPSL models were more accurate in terms of precipitation and the GISS E2 and GFDLCM2 models were the suitable option for predicting the maximum and minimum temperatures and evapotranspiration. Considering the evaluated parameters, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and evapotranspiration had approximately constant trends and were accompanied by a slight increase and decrease for the next two decades, but for the precipitation, large fluctuations were predicted for the next period.

As a result of the high variability of wind power, and thus the generated power, these sources should be classified as unstable sources. In this paper, the authors attempted to determine the impact of wind turbine operation on the parameters of electricity supplied to farms located near the source. As a result of the conducted field tests, variability courses of the basic parameters describing the supply voltage were obtained. The influence of power plant variability on the values of voltage, frequency, and voltage distortion factor was determined. To estimate the capacity of the transmission lines, the reactive power produced in the power plant and its effect on the value of the power factor were determined. The conducted research and analysis showed that the wind power plant significantly influences voltage fluctuations in its immediate vicinity (the maximum value registered was close to 2%, while the value required by law was 2.5%). Although all the recorded values are within limits specified by the current regulations (e.g., the THD value is four times lower than the required value), wind turbines may cause incorrect operation of loads connected nearby. This applies mainly to cases where consumers sensitive to voltage fluctuations are installed in the direct vicinity of the power plant.</jats:p>"

The study included 23 children with chronic gastroduodenitis: 13 girls (56 %) and 10 boys (43.5 %) aged 8 to 18 years. The control group consisted of 11 children matched in age and sex. All patients underwent endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract. H. pylori infection was tested with a rapid urease breathing test «Helik‑test». All children underwent determination of iodine level in single portions of urine using the cerium‑arsenite method Sandell‑Koltoff modified by Dunn, with the following calculation of the median.\r\nResults. The frequency of iodine deficiency in children with chronic gastroduodenitis was 60.9 ± 10.2 %, which significantly exceeded this parameter in the control group (8.7 ± 8.6 %; p &lt; 0.01). A mild degree of iodine deficiency was noted in 43.5 ± 10.3 % of patients, which was also significantly higher than in the control group (9.09 ± 8.6 %; p &lt; 0.05). Moderate iodine deficiency was observed only in children of the main group (21.7 ± 8.5 %). Severe iodine deficiency in the study was not found among all children. The median ioduria in patients was 81.9 mg/l, which was significantly lower than in children in control group (183.7 mg/l; p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of ioduria level, taking into consideration the endoscopic picture of gastrointestinal tract lesions, showed that both in frequency (p &lt; 0.05) and median (p &lt; 0.05), children with a more severe inflammation of the gastric mucosa and duodenum had the worst indices of iodine supply. In children infected with H. pylori iodine deficiency was observed significantly more often (p &lt; 0.05), the median ioduria was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than in uninfected children.\r\nConclusions. In children with chronic gastroduodenal pathology, a significant frequency of iodine deficiency is revealed, which increases with the severity of inflammatory changes in the mucous membrane and the presence of H. pylori infection. Determination of the state of iodine supply in children with digestive tract pathology is advisable to prevent the development of concomitant diseases, primarily thyroid dysfunction.\r\n </jats:p>"

Legedadi Water Supply Scheme is found in Addis Ababa and is fed by gravity. This research assesses the hydropower potential of the existing large water transmission pipelines in line with their financial viability. The research required the collection of data from pipe flow (for 29 years from the system record) and pipe layout drawings believed to be useful for estimating the power. The available pipe layout drawing was processed to prepare a profile view with the help of AutoCAD CIVIL 3D. From the profile view, the gross heads and length of the pipelines were obtained. The exploitable power and financial viability of the projects were estimated by RET Screen software. The raw water main (DN1200) was discovered to have a head of 12.46 m and to convey up to 1.47 m3/s at 90% exceedance over a length of 550 m. The two treated water mains have a head of 19.15 m with a flow of 1.14 m3/s at 90 % exceedance via DN1200 and 0.29 m3/s at 90% exceedance via DN900 over a length of 18.4 km. The most suitable sites for the installation of turbines were at the inlet of the treatment plant and the Kotebe Terminal Reservoir. The Toshiba Hydro-eKIDS turbine was selected since it might work efficiently with large flow variation.The annual energy output from the raw water main to be obtained was 1,208 Mwh,with an estimated cost of $461,000 and an annual savings or revenue of $75,946. For the treated water mains, 1,193 Mwh (DN1200) and 344 Mwh (DN900) could be extracted with an estimated cost of 414,500$ (DN1200) and 135,900$ (DN900). The annual revenue for treated water mains is 75,068$ (DN1200) and that for DN900 is 18,842$.</jats:p>"

There are several cases where people have been forced to buy at almost double the price (&gt; Rp. 30,000). One of the main causes of this spike is the unavailability. To ensure the availability of these goods, it is deemed necessary to establish a goods management policy (logistics system) which includes decisions on the allocation of goods distribution, inventory policies of all entities in the system being observed, and their delivery routes. With the formulation of an optimal goods management policy, it is considered to ensure the availability of goods which will lead to an appropriate selling price and, no less important, to reduce the management cost which has the effect of reducing the need for subsidies that must be issued by the government. The model used as a problem solving tool for the integration model of determining the location, inventory policy, and allocation delivery routes is classified as a Location-Inventory-Routing Problem (LIRP). The LIRP model is then performed optimization to determine which agents should operate, inventory policies at agents and bases, and delivery routes. From the model developed, it was concluded that only one operating agent was needed to supply 3 kg LPG gas, which served all bases operating in six villages in Muara Dua District, Lhokseumawe City.</jats:p>",

Methane fuel types and the methods of their use in internal combustion engines were systematized. The knowledge regarding the environmental impact of using methane fuels for supplying internal combustion engines was analyzed. The authors studied the properties of various internal combustion engines used for different applications (specialized engines of power generators—Liebherr G9512 and MAN E3262 LE212, powered by biogas, engine for road and off-road vehicles—Cummins 6C8.3, in self-ignition, original version powered by diesel fuel, and its modified version—a spark-ignition engine powered by methane fuel) under various operating conditions in approval tests. The sensitivity of the engine properties, especially pollutant emissions, to its operating states were studied. In the case of a Cummins 6C8.3 modified engine, a significant reduction in the pollutant emission owing to the use of methane fuel, relative to the original self-ignition engine, was found. The emission of carbon oxide decreased by approximately 30%, hydrocarbons by approximately 70% and nitrogen oxide by approximately 50%, as well as a particulate matter emission was also eliminated. Specific brake emission of carbon oxide is the most sensitive to the operating states of the engine: 0.324 for a self-ignition engine and 0.264 for a spark-ignition engine, with the least sensitive being specific brake emission of nitrogen oxide: 0.121 for a self-ignition engine and 0.097 for a spark-ignition engine. The specific brake emission of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons for stationary engines was higher in comparison with both versions of Cummins 6C8.3 engine. However, the emission of nitrogen oxide for stationary engines was lower than for Cummins engines.</jats:p>"

A 6-year-old girl underwent a free vascularised fibula flap for reconstruction of her right humerous following osteosarcoma resection. While identifying and dissecting the recurrent epiphysial branch, a large branch from the peroneal artery was identified which directly entered the head of the fibula. No dominant supply from the anterior tibial (AT) vessels to the head of the fibula was seen. This led to the need for a bipedicled flap with diaphyseal supply from the AT vessels and the epiphysial transfer based on the peroneal artery. The patient made an uneventful recovery from the procedure. The same technique may be used by surgeons that may encounter this unique variant in clinical practice.</jats:p>",

Finally, we estimate the impacts of ESQ improvement on reducing the economic inequality. The main results show that: (1) Substantial differences exist among the regional ESQ, and the national GDP-based ESQ Gini index was 0.720 in 2018. (2) A GDP-based Lorenz curve has a higher Gini coefficient than the population-based one does, while inequalities in cites are greater than those in rural areas. (3) The ESQ has significant impacts on the regional economic output, and a 1% reduction in the ESQ will, on average, reduce the city-level output by 0.142%. (4) ESQ improvement can significantly narrow the economic gap by up to 24.9%, that is, the ESQ Gini index of GDP distribution will decrease from 0.329 to 0.247 according to our scenario designs.</jats:p>"

Its efficient functioning depends on the implementation of SDG activities and the development of industry (first-fourth/fifth industrial revolution). Due to the likelihood of different priorities in the implementation of the sustainable development goals, it is important to build such relationships, e.g. in the supply chain, so that their implementation could take place under similar conditions. Digitization, or the circular economy concept (CE), create an opportunity for the SME sector to build relationships as part of industry networks, for instance, where the managed supply chain would have a common and realistic goal to achieve. This goal will be a priority in business models based on sustainable development. The article presents the results of research regarding the furniture industry in Poland (key industry, referred to as smart specialization). The results of the analysis show that the industry has a large production potential, and the natural resources used in it are constantly increasing. However, there are doubts raised by the lack of stability in the dynamics of the sold production in the industry. Ultimately, the business model of the industry supply chain should focus on the environmental aspect (sustainable management of the raw material supply chain) and on eco-friendly consumption (sustainable management of the product supply chain), so that it can be managed in a sustainable way.</jats:p>",

There was carried out the content analysis of the official sources of 24 countries concerning the drugs that had been registered at these countries and recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and put into circulation from 2000 to 2020: linezolid, bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine (as of 07.2020). The data were compared with the characteristics of the epidemiological situation in the country. Results. There was developed a six-digit classification by the following criteria: the presence of international nonproprietary names for drugs; the availability and range of dosage forms; the number of drugs subject to all dosage forms, dosages, pharmaceutical forms and units of packaging; the presence in the domestic market of the original product; the time of registration of drugs in the specified territory; the level of multi-drug resistance of the pathogen in the country per 100,000 population. Among the countries with the highest market coverage with a low (up to 0.5 per 100 thousand) level of multidrug resistance, a large share falls on European countries. As for a number of African States, there may be a threat of spreading the disease taking into account the epidemiological situation for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and with only linezolid registered. The list of countries with a level of the same indicator above 15 per 100,000 population includes Russia and Namibia with radically different market characteristics. If Russia possesses the entire available range of medicines with the number of nomenclature items above 200, then Namibia has no more than 10 linezolid preparations registered only in tablet form. The main supplier of innovative products in the field of tuberculosis control is the Asia-Pacific region. Сonclusion. It is defined that the characteristics of the drug market differ significantly depending on the economic development of states and are determined by the indicator of the disease burden. Success in the tuberculosis control is impossible without the active development of the pharmaceutical industry and the replenishment of the market with innovative products.</jats:p>",

Emerging adults, ages 18-25, may be even more vulnerable to rationing as they grapple with financial instability during this developmental period of increasing independence coupled with the rising cost of healthcare. The purpose of this study was to explore factors related to insulin and diabetes supply rationing in a sample of emerging adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Content analysis was used to examine a single open-ended response to the question, “Please tell me about your experiences rationing insulin or diabetes supplies,” in a parent cross-sectional study. The parent study explored financial stress factors, psychological factors, and self-management outcomes in 413 emerging adults from the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry. Chi-square tests were utilized to understand if rationing (yes or no) differed based on gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, type of health insurance, insulin pump usage, CGM usage, and A1c level (&amp;lt;8.9% or &amp;gt;9.0%). Alpha was set at .05. A total of 268 participants responded to the open-ended question about rationing. Over one-third of respondents (N=99, 36.9%) reported rationing insulin or diabetes supplies. Lack of private health insurance X2(3, N=224)=8.38, p&amp;lt;.05, racial/ethnic diversity (non-white, Hispanic) race/ethnicity X2(6, N=224)=13.54, p&amp;lt;.05 and no CGM usage X2(1, N=224)=9.75, p&amp;lt;.01 had significant relationships with rationing. Gender, employment status, A1C level, and insulin pump usage were not associated with rationing. A considerable number of emerging adults with T1D have experience rationing. Diabetes providers should routinely assess for insulin and diabetes supply rationing in this population. Attention should be paid to emerging adults who are racially/ethnically diverse, lack private insurance, and do not use CGM. Policy changes are necessary in order to improve access to affordable diabetes management tools in this vulnerable population.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosure</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>J.

To describe the changes, we adopted the supply chain management perspective, which allowed for a global view of the changes taking place. We discuss the basic characteristics, such as the size and structure of the industry, innovation, production value, and the use of information and communications technology (ICT). In the research, we used the databases of the Central Statistical Office (GUS) on the sold production of the T&amp;A industry, as well as imports and exports. Our research shows that, at the level of basic characteristics, the industry is close to the European model. However, it is characterized by a smaller share of small companies in the structure of enterprises. The research showed an upward trend in the production of sold textiles and, to a lesser extent, apparel. At the same time, the operation of the Polish T&amp;A industry is influenced by the import of finished products and raw materials from China, Germany, Bangladesh, and Turkey. The export is directed to the German, Czech, Romanian, and Ukrainian markets. The article provides an overview of the development trends in the Polish T&amp;A industry in the broad context of international conditions.</jats:p>",

Thus, in water resources management plans, storage reservoirs play a vital role in safeguarding drinking, irrigation, hydropower and livestock water supply. In the last decades, the dams’ negative effects, such as fragmentation of water flow and sediment transport, are considered in decision-making, for achieving an optimal balance between human needs and healthy riverine and coastal ecosystems. Currently, operation of existing reservoirs is challenged by increasing water demand, climate change effects and active storage reduction due to sediment deposition, jeopardizing their supply capacity. This paper proposes a methodological framework to reassess supply capacity and management resilience for an existing reservoir under these challenges. Future projections are derived by plausible climate scenarios and global climate models and by stochastic simulation of historic data. An alternative basic reservoir management scenario with a very low exceedance probability is derived. Excess water volumes are investigated under a probabilistic prism for enabling multiple-purpose water demands. Finally, this method is showcased to the Ladhon Reservoir (Greece). The probable total benefit from water allocated to the various water uses is estimated to assist decision makers in examining the tradeoffs between the probable additional benefit and risk of exceedance.</jats:p>"

The equilibrium decision-making is obtained by using the variational inequality method. Furthermore, the criteria for manufacturers to choose between the two remanufacturing policies based on different factors such as recovery rates of the used products, remanufacturing costs, and environmental impact parameters, are given. Numerical examples show the following results: (1) When compared with self-remanufacturing policy, outsourcing remanufacturing policy can save resources, increase the sales of products, and have a smaller environmental impact. (2) When the recycling rate of used products is low, choosing an outsourcing remanufacturing policy can increase the sales of products.

The analysis of the sanitary and epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation indicates problems in the field of drinking water safety, caused, among other things, by chemical contamination. Due to the wide variety of pollutants, it is necessary to determine the procedure for identifying priority chemical pollutions from the water from centralized supply systems, using health risk criteria. Materials and methods. The analysis of relevant scientific literature and regulatory and methodological documents formed the basis for developing criteria for determining priority chemical pollutants contained in the water from centralized supply systems. A sampling of drinking water was carried out at the start point (water intake) and the endpoint of the distribution network (water tap). The selected water samples were examined using the chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Results. An algorithm for determining the priority chemicals in the water of centralized water supply systems according to the potential hazard and health risk criteria has been developed. Approaches to the identification of possible sources of chemical water pollutants from centralized supply systems were established. According to the results of testing, it was found that three of the 16 chemical water components are potentially dangerous: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, pentadecane, and lilial. The presence of pentadecane comes from a water source. Still, it should have eliminated water treatment. The presence of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and lilial is most likely due to water treatment and water transportation processes through the water supply systems. Conclusion. There are six criteria for determining priority chemical pollutions from the water from centralized supply systems based on hygiene standards compliance, an impact of the chemicals on the environment and the human health, the presence of harmful effects for humans and/or animals, implementation of possible mechanisms for the development of human health disorders and the acceptability of the risk level were proposed. There were identified three priority pollutants in the water from centralized supply systems that can be recommended for further monitoring.</jats:p>",

This channel has a rectangular cross section. It is 1 m in width and 0.7 m in height. The upstream and downstream paths are respectively 6.5 and 5 m long. The ratio of the bend's central curvature radius to the channel width is 2; hence, it qualifies as a sharp bend. Experiments were carried out under clear water approach flow conditions. The results showed that the presence of collars around an oblong pier creates vortices in the opposite direction of the longitudinal flow, causes the distortion and disturbance of the streamlines toward the pier downstream, and decreases downflow strength in front of the pier nose. Furthermore, doubling the collar width results in 0.93 and 0.68 times the vorticity and the power of the secondary flow on the pier upstream, respectively. It also reduced the maximum values of the Reynolds stresses perpendicular to the y-plane in x direction and perpendicular to the z-plane in y direction by respectively 45 and 60%, and increased the Reynolds stress perpendicular to the z-plane in x direction by 25%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background: </jats:bold>With the rapidly aging of Chinese society and the change of Chinese residents’ disease spectrum, the older adults utilization of the healthcare services surges as well. Studies on factors that potentially influence the utilization of healthcare services for the older adults becomes increasing important, which could benefit improving the service effect and the quality of life of the older adults in later life. This article compares and analyzes the differences in the using of healthcare services by the older adults in urban and rural areas based on the supply and demand of healthcare services for the older adults and analyzes the reasons for potential differences. <jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold>Using data from a survey conducted in three cities in Shaanxi Province in 2019. All authors participated in the questionnaire survey. We obtained a total of 948 questionnaires. Multivariate regression model and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model are used to analyze the difference between the supply and demand of medical services for the older adults in urban and rural areas.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>The results find that age, household register, living activities of daily living (ADL), (P&lt;0.01) and healthcare treatment insurance significantly impact the older adults use of healthcare services. Meanwhile, factors from the supply and demand factors have a significant correlation with the utilization of services for the older adults, including the healthcare service quality(P&lt;0.01), the diversity of service content(P&lt;0.01), the rationality of service charge(P&lt;0.01), service satisfaction(P&lt;0.01), family support (P&lt;0.1) level and the main illness(P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the results show a significant difference in the use of healthcare services for the older adults between urban and rural areas. Specifically, in urban areas, the influences of service quality, the diversity of service content and the rationality of service from the supply have a significant correlation with the utilization of services for the older adults. The service satisfaction, service demand and family support in the demand factors have a significant correlation with the utilization of services for the older adults. In comparisons, for the older adults in rural areas, the diversity of service content from the supply factors as well as economic level and main illness from the demand factors have a significant correlation with the utilization of services for the older adults.<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: From the perspective of supply and demand, this paper constructs an analytical framework of the determinants of healthcare services for the older adults from a new perspective. Based on the analysis framework and from the perspective of supply and demand of healthcare services utilization, the differences between urban and rural areas in the utilization of medical care for the older adults and the influencing factors are studied. It provides a new research perspective to explore the influencing factors of healthcare services utilization for the older adults. Supply factors and demand factors have a significant correlation with the utilization of healthcare services for the older adults. There are also significant differences in the factors influencing the utilization of health services by urban and rural older adults. When strengthening and improving the supply of healthcare services for the older adults, the previous thinking of “top-down” and “service-centered” should be changed, and gradually transformed into “bottom-up” and “demand-centered”.</jats:p>"

Based on a comprehensive literature review on both theoretical and practical roles of these disruptive technologies in SSCM, we conduct a cross-case study to analyze the impacts of disruptive technologies on sustainability performance. From 100 application cases of 41 companies in key supply chain management and sustainability journals, we develop a classification scheme based on implementation complexity and sustainability performance of disruptive technologies. The implementation complexity and sustainability performance matrix show that all the cases examined have a positive overall sustainability performance score which indicates that investment in disruptive technologies improves the sustainability performance of firms. However, the impact of each disruptive technology on sustainability performance varies with the types of technology and sustainability dimensions. We also utilize the cases to illustrate how disruptive technologies are applied to key areas of SSCM and identify opportunities for future research. </jats:p>"

Usage per capita in urban areas transcends 160 liters per day. Climate change is projected to increase water demand even more. Sources of surface water from stormwater runoff can be used to fulfill this requirement. The main objective of this work is to assess the water supply and demand in the dry conditions of the Coimbatore region, Tamil Nadu, India, and to use the water evaluation and planning method to create a model for supply and demand in the future. There are more than three dozen surface water bodies in and around the metropolitan center. Most sources are heavily encroached upon. By linking stormwater runoff from its respective elevation to the accessible surface water bodies, an additional water supply source can be obtained. By using the water evaluation and planning framework as a guide, models were developed to determine potential needs, and to compare demand and supply, water usage, lack of water use, and population coverage. The enhanced stormwater drainage system for Coimbatore city was designed in such a way that the various roads were connected to the major water bodies. The domestic water demand in the future is predicted to be around 27 million cubic feet (MCFT). Meanwhile, the possible amount of stormwater collected in the selected water bodies is predicted to be 50 million cubic meter (MCM) to 320 MCM. This study concluded that 100% of urban domestic water demand can be met if the urban stormwater is utilized by harvesting and storing in surface water bodies.</jats:p>",

Fish resources become one of the leading commodities, therefore we need a supply chain optimization model. Optimization is one of the technologies widely used in supply chain network management. Fish resource supply chain becomes very important because it is caused by several factors, including the diversity of types of products from fish resources and their short expiry. The steps used in this research is literature review, determine parameters and decision variables, formulate the objective function and constraint function, modeling and model implementation. The purpose of this research is to get an optimization model in planning and managing the fish resource supply chain by using mixed integer linear programming, so that the resulting model can solve problems in the limitations of fish resources in certain areas, can distribute all consumer demand quickly. This new model can minimize transportation costs to suppliers, minimize transportation costs from suppliers to distribution centers and minimize transportation costs from distribution centers to consumers, and minimize product inventory costs to suppliers and to distribution centers.</jats:p>",

In total, the current daily operation of the short-term low-volume (STLV) seawater desalination plants produces 36,000 m3 and, on the large-scale perspective, the seawater desalination capacity is planned to increase from 150,000 to 300,000 m3 per day by the years 2025 and 2035, respectively. The wastewater treatment and reuse activities are processed through three wastewater treatment plants with a total daily capacity of 130,000 m3 which is proposed to be increased to a capacity of 235,000 m3 by the beginning of 2025. Stormwater collecting and harvesting supply the water sector by about 550–820 cubic meters per day. The proposed stochastic and artificial intelligence model that was developed in this study to simulate the interactive conditions between the groundwater and the water intervention plan showed proper performance in terms of (r) = 0.95–0.99 and the root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09–0.21. The model outputs reveal that the annual groundwater abstractions will reach 192 million cubic meters by 2040 with an annual increasing rate of +3%. By applying the model, the optimum utilization of the unconventional water resources contributes positively to the recovery of the GCA, which is experiencing a decline hot spot in the water level that reaches to −19 m below mean sea level (MSL) and is expected to drop to −28 m MSL by 2040. The impact of unconventional water resources interventions was investigated by simulating the water table trend using stochastic models and artificial neural networks (ANNs) through three scenarios. The first scenario, which addresses the non-intervention status, indicates that the groundwater table will decline by −1.5% in the northern governorates and by −51% in the southern governorates of the Gaza Strip within 2020–2040. The second scenario demonstrates the impact of the existing water interventions that revealed an interim recovery in the groundwater balance until 2025 in which the water consumption tended to increase rapidly. The third scenario illustrates the impact of applying the full water management intervention plan in which the depression cone in the groundwater level will be restored by about +10 m.</jats:p>",

In addition to DHA, importance of ARA has been much discussed in recent years for fetal and postnatal brain development and the maternal supply of ARA and DHA. These fatty acids are also involved in various brain developmental processes; however, their mechanistic cross talks are not clearly known yet.

However, the effectiveness of these subsidies under different power structures has rarely been examined. In this paper, we investigate a two-echelon green supply chain with a manufacturer who obtains government subsidies to develop and produce green products and a retailer who sells to consumers. We examine the impact of government subsidies on green product innovation, supply chain profits, and social welfare by focusing on five power structure models: centralized decision (C), manufacturer-Stackelberg (MS), retailer-Stackelberg (RS), vertical Nash (NL), and vertical Nash with bargaining mechanism (NB) models. The results show that government subsidies have a positive impact on the energy-saving level of green products, firms’ financial performance, and supply chain profits. We also find that the NB model is the optimal power structure of decentralized decision scenarios in terms of green product innovation, supply chain profits, and social welfare. Our findings indicate that if supply chain members have equal power and bargaining mechanisms the effectiveness of government subsidies will be enhanced. This study provides new theoretical insights for green supply chain research by revealing the interplay between the power structure of the green supply chain and government subsidies.</jats:p>",

After treatment with a local conventional stabilization pond, parameters such as BOD, COD, Zn, and Pb dropped to 35.63, 9.95, 0.011, and 0.001 mg/L, respectively. Total coliform and fecal coliform decreased to 23,417 and 5,666 MPN/100 mL, respectively. These results showed almost all detected contaminants in treated greywater were minimized and did not exceed Thailand's standard and World Health Organization guidelines. After that, treated greywater was reused for irrigation. There were three vegetable plots: treated greywater, tap water with fertilizer, and tap water. There were seven edible plants, four leafy and three fruiting vegetables, cultivated in each plot. Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Hg were detected depending on the kind of plant; for example, the maximum concentration was found in leafy vegetables. However, the concentrations of contaminants did not exceed the Codex standard for contaminants and toxins in foods and Thailand's standard. Risk characterization showed no risk with a hazard quotient far less than 1. Therefore, treated greywater reuse could be considered to promote sustainable water management in the community.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have investigated the barriers to CE in circular food supply chains. Accordingly, this paper presents a systematic literature review of 136 papers from 2010 to 2020 from WOS and Scopus databases regarding these barriers to understand CE implementation in food supply chains. The barriers are classified under seven categories: “cultural”, “business and business finance”, “regulatory and governmental”, “technological”, “managerial”, “supply-chain management”, “knowledge and skills”. The findings show the need to identify barriers preventing the transition to CE. The findings also indicate that these challenges to CE can be overcome through Industry 4.0, which includes a variety of technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technologies, machine learning, and blockchain. Specifically, machine learning can offer support by making workflows more efficient through the forecasting and analytical capabilities of food supply chains. Blockchain and big data analytics can provide the necessary support to establish legal systems and improve environmental regulations since transparency is a crucial issue for taxation and incentives systems. Thus, CE can be promoted via adequate laws, policies, and innovative technologies.</jats:p>"

Different Procedures in\npharmaceutical QMS like deviation control, change control, investigation, customer complaints handling, validation &amp; qualification, product release, etc. consider the principles of risk assessment at all steps. Extensive research in this area shows that there is scarcity of research on quality risk management during early stages of medicinal products manufacturing including (1) procurement/supply chain, (2) logistics/warehousing and (3) raw materials dispensing. To cover the gap in the literature, three practical case studies has been studied by selecting one major step from each manufacturing stage and applied risk assessment following the procedure described in ICHQ9 and using Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) as risk assessment quality tool. As a result of this review, QRM during early stages of medicinal products manufacturing may be useful to avoid unnecessary complaints or delay during subsequent drug processing in the manufacturing site. Being proactive and taking all necessary measures to avoid any possible defects or mishandling is one of the major objectives of QRM and ultimately patient protection.

In this paper, we design a reward and punishment mechanism to constrain customers’ dishonest behaviors and propose a novel pricing algorithm based on the reward and punishment mechanism to relax the assumption, which guarantees the total electricity demands of all customers are within a secure range and obtain the maximum profit of the supplier. Meanwhile, we obtain the optimal demand and provide a upper and lower bound of the proposed price for the electricity market. In addition to a single type of customer, we also consider multiple types of customers, each of whom has different characteristics to prices. Extensive simulation results are constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other pricing algorithms. It also shows that the average electricity consumption of a whole community is mostly affected by the residents’ electricity consumption and the balance of the supply and all types of customers is achieved under the proposed pricing algorithm.</jats:p>"

By regulating the amount, the timing, and the location of\nmeltwater supply to the glacier bed, supraglacial hydrology potentially\nexerts a major control on the evolution of the subglacial drainage system,\nwhich in turn modulates ice velocity. Yet the configuration of the\nsupraglacial hydrological system has received only little attention in\nnumerical models of subglacial hydrology so far. Here we apply the\ntwo-dimensional subglacial hydrology model GlaDS (Glacier Drainage System model) to a Svalbard glacier basin\nwith the aim of investigating how the spatial distribution of meltwater\nrecharge affects the characteristics of the basal drainage system. We design\nfour experiments with various degrees of complexity in the way that\nmeltwater is delivered to the subglacial drainage model. Our results show\nsignificant differences between experiments in the early summer transition\nfrom distributed to channelized drainage, with discrete recharge at moulins\nfavouring channelization at higher elevations and driving overall lower\nwater pressures. Otherwise, we find that water input configuration only\npoorly influences subglacial hydrology, which instead is controlled\nprimarily by subglacial topography. All experiments fail to develop channels\nof sufficient efficiency to substantially reduce summertime water pressures,\nwhich we attribute to small surface gradients and short melt seasons. The\nfindings of our study are potentially applicable to most Svalbard tidewater\nglaciers with similar topography and low meltwater recharge. The absence of\nefficient channelization implies that the dynamics of tidewater glaciers in\nthe Svalbard archipelago may be sensitive to future long-term trends in\nmeltwater supply.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main objectives of the EU transport policy belongs the limitation of the negative environmental impact from ports. Similarly, companies are adopting sustainable supply chain management practices to response the policy makers’ and consumers’ demands for sustainable operations. This paper aims to discover how the largest European container ports communicate about their efforts to improve the sustainability of their operations to find out how the ports themselves see their position as a part of transition towards more sustainable supply chain operations. Based on the study, different large European container ports consider environmental issues variously. The risk is that some ports may get competitive advantages by slipping in the environmental questions. Alternatively, if the port does not take sustainability questions seriously and it gets a bad reputation, the risk is that the customers and consumers do not accept the behavior of the port and shipping companies start to avoid that port. Doi: 10.28991/HIJ-2021-02-02-06 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

The growing population of Limbe Municipality faces increasing challenges of potable water supply with lots of implications. And the Cameroon Water Utilities Corporation (CAMWATER) with the local communities involved in potable water management is unable to meet up with this increasing demand.  This has led to the challenges of potable water supply in Limbe municipality which is very frustrating to water consumers. This present study sought to examine the challenges of potable water supply and its implications in Limbe. A combination of research methods (desk review, interviews and reconnaissance field appraisal) have been used in this study. Our findings revealed that increasing population and poor management of potable water supply were the major problems. In the methods utilized, a community based cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to December 2020 using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Wealth Health Organization checklist was used for observation around catchments, then the assessment of water supply challenges was done with a semi quantitative approach. And 200 questionnaires were administered where qualitative data was collected through Focus Group Discussions and in-depth interviews. The results obtained from the 7 water catchments assessed indicated that 50% of the water supply challenges were as a result of the increasing population in Limbe municipality. Meanwhile 30% stated that poor management of potable water supply by the authorities concern is another reason of persistent challenges of potable water supply in Limbe. While 20% were of the opinion that the challenges of potable water supply is as a result of anthropogenic activities near water catchments leading to a progressive reduction in water volume. An integrated potable water management team is needed and a periodic monitoring of these catchment in order to reduce this persistent challenges.</jats:p>"

Prosperity of each nation depends on availability of constant power supply and the quality of supply of power is very important to the required developments in world in the past, the present and the future. Constant power supply is a major challenge in Africa particularly in Nigeria where the generated power is less than thirty percent of the required power. The metrics of power quality are voltage sag, flickers, spikes, harmonics, notching, transients and interruptions. This paper reviewed power quality issues and the interruptions as they affect the development of the State. The level of interruptions in Ekiti State was thoroughly examined and the causes of power interruption in the State were investigated. The method used was the collection of data in respect of power interruptions on Ekiti feeders from the Benin distribution company, assessment of the collected data through simple programming as a command for plotting the graphs through the use of MATLAB 2015 depicting the behavioural pattern of the interruption for a period of six months in 2016. The result shows that the interrelationship between the interruptions and development particularly as it affects domestic consumers, small and medium scale enterprise adversely. Recommendations were suggested with the objective of solving the problems being set up by interruptions in the State and these include installation of reactors, automatic voltage regulators and effective tap changing system on the lines, busses and transformer substation respectively.</jats:p>"

A noise reduction filter was employed to improve the results from the computational intelligence methods, and SUFI-2 algorithm was used to analyze the uncertainty of the SWAT model. Finally, in order to evaluate the models developed and the SWAT model, three statistics (RMSE), (R²), and (NS) coefficient were used. The results indicated that the SWAT model and the machine learning models were generally appropriate tools for daily flow modeling, but the LSSVR model showed less errors in both learning and testing, with the coefficients NS = 0.997 and R² = 0.997 in the calibration stage and NS = 0.994 and R² = 0.994 in the validation stage, which prove their better performance compared to the other methods and the SWAT model.</jats:p>",

A water quantity and quality joint optimization model is built based on multiple control objectives, which include water demand, observed flow rate, and observed pollutant concentration. A coupled water quantity and water quality model was developed for Nanning, China. The natural water cycle and social water cycle in Nanning City and the associated pollutant transport transformation process are simulated. The results indicate that simulation error of water resources allocation is below 5%, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of the three hydrological stations are 0.85, 0.88, and 0.85 respectively, and the relative errors of the simulated results of three water quality monitoring stations are all within 1.83%, all of which indicates that the model performs well and the simulation results can reproduce the water use process and pollutant transport transformation process of Nanning in time and space. This study can provide effective support for water resources management in Nanning City.</jats:p>",

Thus, the cost of fresh pineapple which is the main raw material in canned pineapple is inexpensive during its season. The color of the pineapple also determines the price of the canned pineapple. However, the availability of different colors (called “choice” and “standard”) is dependent. Specifically, if the ratio of the choice color is more, the ratio of the other color is less. There are several costs involve such as fresh pineapple cost, can cost, sugar cost, water cost, labor cost, energy cost, and inventory cost. The problem is formulated as a mathematical model to maximize the total profit over four-months planning horizon. Two supply uncertainty cases are tested which are low and high ratios of the choice color. The results show that the profit depends on available color ratios of the pineapple. The production planning is best if it matches with the availability of the color ratios. In certain months, some fresh pineapple purchased exceed the need of the production because of the dependency of the two colors. The inventory holding cost also influences the production decision—whether to produce the canned pineapple in earlier months or it is better to produce only the canned pineapple when it is needed to serve the customer orders.</jats:p>",

With supply chains (SCs) gaining rapid complexity, having high supply chain visibility (SCV) would help companies ease the processes and reduce complexity by improving inaccuracies. Extant literature has given attention to the organisation’s capability to collect and evaluate information to balance between strategy and goals. The majority of studies focus on investigating IoT’s impact on different areas such as sustainability, organisational structure, lean manufacturing, product development, and strategic management. However, research investigating the relationships and impact of IoT on SCV is minimal. This study closes this gap using a structured literature review to critically analyse existing literature to synthesise the use of IoT applications in SCs to gain visibility, and the SC. We found key IoT technologies that help SCs gain visibility, and seven benefits and three key challenges of these technologies. We also found the concept of Supply 4.0 that grasps the element of Industry 4.0 within the SC context. This paper contributes by combining IoT application synthesis, enablers, and challenges in SCV by highlighting key IoT technologies used in the SCs to gain visibility.

Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on the analysis of changes in the logistics real estate market in Poland. The analysis period covers the years 2004–2020. The data used here comes from reports from real estate advisory companies and Statistics Poland. Findings: The last dozen or so years has been aperiod of dynamic development in the Polish market of logistic space and facilities. The year 2019 turned out to be arecord year in the history of the market in terms of the increase in warehouse space and Poland has become the sixth biggest warehouse market in Europe. The year 2020 and SARS-CoV-2 has brought a lot of uncertainty about the future, and the recession has become afact. Practical implications: More than half a year after the outbreak of the pandemic, several emerging trends of changes related to the situation of uncertainty and increased risk in supply chains, as well as approaches to limit the negative effects of the epidemic on the logistics industry, can be observed. These include: an increase in e-commerce preferences in relation to traditional trade; increase in stock levels; relocation of production sites. Originality  and  value: The observed phenomena indicate moderate optimism and the resilience of the logistics industry in the medium term. In turn, in the long run, production can be expected to be relocated to closer areas (domestic or European) in order to shorten the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management is a required course for students enrolled in a Business Administration program with a concentration in management. It delivers a broad overview of the supply chain management discipline, using a simulation game by Responsive Learning Technologies to provide students with hands‐on experience designing and managing a supply chain. In this teaching brief, I give an overview of the game and present the formulation of an accompanying mixed‐integer linear programming model to design an optimal supply chain that meets customers, demand while maximizing company profit. Students use a spreadsheet template to develop their own implementation of the model and then apply the optimal solution during the simulation. Consequently, they gain an understanding of the role of network optimization in supply chain management. I conclude with recommendations for management of game activities using this model and a brief discussion of some of the issues to be monitored as the game is played.</jats:p>",

The reaction is induced by UV photolysis of sulphite (preferably using a medium pressure (MP) UV lamp). Although in general it is assumed that the UV/SO32− process is an advanced reduction process, our results show degradation of OMP under both anoxic and oxic conditions. Several recalcitrant OMP even show higher degradation rates under oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions. This conversion is affected by the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), HCO3− and NO3−, and thus was more effective in drinking water than in Milli-Q water. The reaction rate constants of the oxic UV/SO32− process in general are lower than those of a UV/H2O2 process, but in cases where the use of H2O2 is not preferred, the UV/SO32− process may be an interesting alternative.</jats:p>",

The use of supercapacitors can make the vehicle move more powerful at the beginning of the movement because of its very fast energy release. This paper presents a supercapacitor modeling to support battery performance in an energy storage system. This research is focused on modeling the supercapacitor connected to the drive converter circuit by looking for a mathematical model in the form of a state-space equation, the results of which are simulated using the C Mex S function in Matlab / Simulink. From the modeling carried out, it is obtained a system that has a system response that is built and shows the system is working properly, the output voltage can follow the reference results.</jats:p>",

Based on the survey data of agricultural product suppliers, this paper uses the structural equation model method for empirical analysis. The analysis results show that fairness perception and trust perception have a significant positive impact on the quality of agricultural supply chain relationships, among which trust perception has a positive direct impact on the quality of agricultural supply chain relationships, while fairness perception has indirect influence on the quality of agricultural supply chain relationships through trust. In addition, information sharing, price satisfaction, income level and environmental certainty have a significant positive impact on suppliers’ fairness perception. Therefore, sellers comprehensively consider the fairness perception and trust perception of suppliers, which will help improve the relationship quality of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Credit guarantee is regarded as a constraint of financial institutions’ credit decisions. Using probability density and logistic tools, we construct a profit maximization model for financial institutions and solve their optimal credit decision for a specific interest rate. Through numerical experiments, we verify the validity of the model and conclude that increasing the business volume between financing enterprises and core enterprises or reducing the probability of default can effectively improve financial institutions’ credit line.</jats:p>",

The FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil could extract DNA effectively from microbes in river and stream waters without heavy rain. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was used prior to DNA extraction and was a useful tool for reducing PCR inhibitors in influent and stream samples. H. pylori in various waters could be quantified directly by real-time PCR while minimizing the effect of PCR inhibitors by an appropriate method through the evaluation of DNA extraction methods considering the characteristics of the matrix water. The findings of the present study suggest that the types or characteristics of water sample by source and precipitation are an important factor in detecting H. pylori and they can be applied when detecting and monitoring of other pathogens in water.</jats:p>",

This challenge resulted in load-shedding, which is not desirable to mining companies that require constant and reliable power for their operations. In that regard, a techno-economic analysis was carried out to assess the potential of integrating concentrated solar power (+thermal storage) and photovoltaics (+battery storage) to supply power at a typical mine in Zimbabwe. Two scenarios were simulated—a base case with no exports to the grid and another case where exports were allowed. The models were evaluated based on the generated renewable energy offsetting the demand from the mine, the energy exported, the grid contribution, the levelised cost of electricity and the net present value. The results show that the addition of a battery storage system to PV improves the percentage of the load offset by the renewable system and the generated energy by the renewable system by almost double. However, the installation cost, required land, LCOE, and simple pay-back also increased by approximately a factor of 2. The addition of a thermal storage system to CSP increased the generated energy, the capacity factor, and the renewable energy contribution by approximately a factor of 2. However, the land required for development and the installation costs also nearly doubled.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to study the attitude of citizens to the existing system, as well as to identify the strengths and weaknesses of preferential security. The main research methods were: the method of studying and generalizing experience; comparative analysis; sociological survey; statistical. According to the presented data, the distribution of answers to questions is determined in % depending on the total number of respondents, including in the dynamics for the analyzed period (2019-2021). This study served as a tool for studying the key problems in obtaining preferential medicines (waiting times for a doctor to issue a prescription, the absence of a prescription in a pharmacy, the refusal of a doctor to issue medicines, etc.). Thus, the results of the conducted sociological survey showed that the LAW system plays a significant role in the structure of healthcare. At the same time, first of all, it is necessary to carry out additional work with various age groups of the popu- lation in the framework of providing information about the possibilities of the additional preferential security system.</jats:p>",

In the structure of the total morbidity of the Russian Federation population in 2018, skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue diseases made about 3,5 of the total number of cases, which amounted to 8330 thousand registered cases of diseases. The purpose of the research was to analyze the expenditure of material resources allocated for drug provision of the State Budgetary Institution of Healthcare of the Republic of Crimea “Clinical Dermatovenerologic Dispensary” (SBIH RC “CDVD”) for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Materials and Methods. Based on the data obtained from the Statistical Department of SBIH RC “CDVD” on the financial means expenditures on the purchase of drugs, an assessment of the budgetary funds expenditures was carried out by means of ABC/VEN analysis. Results and discussion. According to the data received, for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, 3 156 patients were admitted to inpatient departments. 9, 072, 064, 00 rubles were spent on the treatment of patients’ nosologies, while the list of all drugs used included 98 names. The ABC analysis showed the feasibility of spending monetary resources, which confirms the lack of “N”- category (minor) drugs among “A” – category drugs (80% of the budget). The results of VEN-analysis indicated that 50% of the drugs used are referred to “V” category, which indicates that the Healthcare Institution predominantly purchased vital drugs. Conclusion. Active implementation of the methodology of management of medical care with help of modern technologies of ABC- and VEN- analyses allows timely implementation of measures to rationalize drug procurement in inpatient and outpatient healthcare institutions, as well as the choice of drugs for inclusion into the formulary and treatment standards.</jats:p>",

The number of reported shortages increased across all generic market types over time, with the rate of shortage increases especially pronounced in markets for injectable products. The number of product recalls also rose over our study period. Although we did not estimate causal effects, we did find several changes in the market environment for generic drugs that may contribute to these phenomena. The demand side for generics has become more concentrated. Supply chains rely more on producers outside the United States (particularly from China and India).

Recent changes in demand‐side market structure imply more downward pressure on prices stemming from buy‐side concentration. The FDA's greater regulatory oversight puts upward pressure on costs, and the lengthening of the supply chain increases production uncertainty for producers. Demand and supply‐side changes point to further market instabilities across all generic markets due to producers’ changing economic position.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The purpose of this study was to examine the flow patterns of the local rice supply chain during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data analysis using supply chain analysis of Supply Chain management (SCM). The results of the analysis show that at the farmer / producer level it does not significantly affect farming activities, only 29.77 percent of farmers stated that there was an influence on farming activities. The impact of Covid-19 mainly affects the level of intermediary institutions in the rice distribution process. Long product (material) flow patterns by business actors need to be shortened by a short distribution route. Another effect is the inaccuracy of product arrival time due to delays in the inspection process for products brought to the research location. The impact of Covid-19 is mainly felt by distributors / wholesalers who flow products to other areas, mainly due to the increase in additional costs related to Covid-19 requirements. The solution to integrate all SCM elements through an information system can facilitate the flow pattern of local rice in Kapuas District, by intensifying the management of information related to production at the producer level, as well as controlling rice supplies at the level of intermediary institutions.</jats:p>",

Electricity supply is one of the important conditions restricting the development of remote areas. In order to solve the power supply problem in these remote areas, this paper proposes a convenient power supply scheme. It adopts modular, flexibly configurable independent power supply based on renewable energy power generation technology, and is equipped with a backup power generation device based on human or animal power to ensure a certain degree of power supply reliability. Use easy-to-implement power supply equipment configuration and installation methods to achieve convenient layout of the power supply system. The above power supply scheme was evaluated in terms of technical feasibility, economy and social significance. Introduction</jats:p>",

In order to obtain a stable output voltage and a rapid response of the protection in the high-voltage power supply system, the measurement of the voltage signal needs to meet three requirements: response in real-time, accurate, and high isolation. Using the voltage-to-frequency (V/F) converter AD650 to transmit the analog signals as frequency form through the digital optical fiber is the best mode to measuring the signals with high precision, real-time, long-distance, and high isolation. The composition and principle of the real-time voltage measuring device are described in this paper. The design of the hardware and the parameters are analyzed and discussed in detail. The experimental results show that the circuit structure based on the AD650 chip is simple. The optical fiber transmission can achieve high isolation and high accuracy (better than 0.1%). The low response time (under 30us) can meet the requirements of the real-time voltage signal measurement system. The signal will not be affected by the high electromagnetic field in the transmission process. The measurement system has been applied in the high voltage power supply with excellent linearity and high isolation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The profound impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global tourism activity and the hospitality industry has rendered statistical approaches on tourism-demand forecasting obsolete. Furthermore, literature review shows the absence of studies on the supply chain in the HoReCa (hotel, restaurant, catering) sector from a sustainability perspective that also addresses economic and social aspects, and not only environmental ones. In this context, the objective of this article is to carry out a prospective analysis on how the changes in the behaviour of consumers during the pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the exit from the health emergency can give rise to social trends with a high impact on the HoReCa sector in the coming years and, specifically, how they will affect the HoReCa supply chain. In the absence of investigations due to the proximity of what has happened, public sources and reports of international relevance have been identified and analysed from the future studies and strategic and competitive intelligence disciplines. The HoReCa sector in Spain has been chosen as field of observation. This analysis draws the future of the HoReCa sector, describes the changes in customer behaviour regarding food and beverages, explains the changes in distribution chains, and reflects on the impact of potential scenarios on the sector. The confluence of all these changes and trends can even configure a new supply chain in the hospitality sector with the emergence of new actors and the increase of access routes to a new final customer for whom security prevails in all its dimensions: physical, emotional, economic, and digital.</jats:p>"

The concept of supply chain economics shows that integration and harmony between engineering fields with economic and social science are very important to be reconstructed to produce Indonesia's best economic competition performance. Independence in making defense equipment must continue to be utilized and developed. By making its own defense equipment, Indonesia will get various benefits, from the economic benefits of the emergence of defense industry clusters that will help drive economic growth, provide plenty of jobs, and enhance technological capabilities. Technology is an aspect that can distinguish a country's defense capabilities from other countries. If the mastery of technology can be carried out by defense industry players in Indonesia, this will be a big advantage for Indonesia's defense forces. Guiding corporations or defense companies is as important as industrial coaching. Defense industry companies actually become a vehicle and the spearhead of the formation of an independent, professional, efficient, modern, and innovative defense industry as well as implementing good corporate governance.

Human intake of omega-3 occurs mostly via seafood, particularly fish. The primary source of omega-3 in aquatic systems is represented by primary producers, from which omega-3 are transferred throughout the food web. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for primary producers and can be supplied to surface waters as nitrate upwelled from below, or as ammonium and other regenerated nitrogen forms recycled <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>. Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are the most productive marine systems on Earth, together covering only 2% of the ocean’s surface area but supporting 25% of the global fish catch, thereby providing food for humans. In EBUS, nitrate and other nutrients are advected to the surface to support the proliferation of a phytoplankton community dominated by known omega-3 producers (i.e., diatoms). Given current climate change-related projections of ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and increased upwelling intensity, phytoplankton community composition in EBUS may change. Additionally, the global production of EPA + DHA is expected to decrease by up to 30%, rendering its supply for human consumption insufficient by 2050. Here we discuss the state of knowledge related to omega-3 transfer from phytoplankton to small pelagic fish in EBUS, including factors that can influence omega-3 production, links to nitrogen cycling, climate change implications for the omega-3 supply to humans, and suggestions for future research directions to improve our understanding of omega-3 in the ocean.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a novel four-echelon closed-loop supply chain model is presented, where base-stock replenishment policies are modelled by means of a proportional controller. A stochastic state-space model is implemented, initially to capture the supply chain dynamics while the model is analysed under stationarity conditions with the aid of a covariance matrix. This allows the bullwhip effect to be expressed as a function of replenishment policies and product return rates. Next, an optimisation method is introduced to study the impact of the Internet of Things on inventory variance and the bullwhip effect. The results show that the Internet of Things can reduce costs associated with inventory fluctuations and eliminate the bullwhip effect in closed-loop supply chains.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the spatio-temporal assessment of groundwater quality and hydrogeochemical processes, as well as, statistical analyses in the Azarshahr and Ajabshir plains located in the Urmia Lake basin were investigated. The results revealed that within six years (from 2014 to 2019), the value of total hardness was higher than the permissible level and the quality of groundwater for drinking was very hard and fresh in both plains. In 2019, 84 and 67% of the samples fell within the range of good to poor groundwater quality in the Azarshahr and Ajabshir plains, respectively. The temporal assessment with the help of water quality index values for both plains revealed a good groundwater quality for the Azarshahr plain and a good to poor groundwater quality for the Ajabshir plain. However, deterioration of water quality was observed in both plains from 2014 to 2019. The level of water quality for irrigation was better in the Azarshahr plain than in the Ajabshir plain, due to the presence of fewer salty sites. In addition, Ca–Mg–HCO3 and rock dominance were identified as hydrochemical facies and the controlling factor in the groundwater of both plains, respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated both natural and anthropogenic sources (such as weathering, fertilizers, and wastewater) for hydrochemical parameters. It was suggested to develop a comprehensive regulation to control the entry of pollutants into the groundwater of the study area.</jats:p>",

An analysis of the descriptions of vibro-acoustic signals given in the literature, caused by the asymmetry of the power supply, shows that this defect leads to the appearance of oscillations that contain a harmonic component localized at the frequency of the supply voltage of the electrical network. This fact justifies the expediency of analyzing the frequency range, which includes the frequency of the supply voltage, and the selection of the mother wavelet, based on the features inherent in a single harmonic oscillation.\n\nA method for detecting a defect in the asymmetry of power supply to rotating electric machines of alternating current using a discrete wavelet transformation of a vibro-acoustic signal is proposed. The frequency band has been established, which is advisable to analyze in order to identify the indicated defect.\n\nIt was found that the detection of a power asymmetry defect with the use of the wavelet transform of the temporal realization of the vibroacoustic signal is advisable to carry out using the Haar maternal wavelet function, which provides a combination of a high degree of affinity of the maternal wavelet with the form of vibration change due to the introduced asymmetry and relative the simplicity of such a transformation.\n\nIt is shown that when detecting power asymmetry, it is advisable to analyze the behavior of the wavelet coefficients of the frequency band, which includes the frequency of the supply voltage of the electric machine. Since the influence of the indicated defect on other frequency bands will be minimal, the analysis of the behavior of their wavelet transform coefficients in order to identify the indicated defect is ineffective.\n\nA numerical criterion for assessing the influence of power asymmetry on the wavelet transform coefficients is proposed in the form of the mean square value of the wavelet coefficients of the informative frequency band in the study of the time interval, which significantly exceeds the period of the supply voltage of the electric machine. It is shown that this criterion has a reduced sensitivity to the impact of non-informative single disturbances that may arise during the operation of an electric machine.

Water samples which are collected from different sites of Adesh Medical College and\nHospital, Shahabad, Haryana were processed.\nMaterial and methods- Most Probable Number (MPN) test was done to detect the coliform bacteria in drinking water, samples were collected\nfrom different sites of AMCH, bacterial isolate was identied by culture, colony morphology, Gram's staining and biochemical characterization\nof bacteria.\nResults- Out of 40 samples of drinking water 7(17.5%) were positive in which coliform bacteria were present, while 33(82.5%) were negative. In\nwhich 1(14.2%) of the total water samples were contaminated with mix growth organism, 1(14.2%) harbored Klebsiella sp., while 5(87.5%)\namong 7 water samples were highly contaminated with E.coli species. Out of 7 positive samples, 4(57.1%) water sample were satisfactory,\n1(14.2%) were unsatisfactory sample and 2 (28.5%) were suspicious samples.\nConclusion- On the basis of the results obtained, the quality analysis revealed that most of water samples were satisfactory and were not\ncontaminated with coliforms and various pathogenic bacteria. The water cooler samples showing positive results have E.coli while less of\nKlebsiella species. Therefore, we suggest that all the water sources of drinking water should be properly sanitized, continuously monitored and\nbacterial load should be estimated on daily basis.</jats:p>",

It is especially relevant for complex systems such as power supply systems. A modern industrial site from the power supply point of view is a complex technical system of hazardous industrial facilities, the technological processes continuity and safety of which directly depends on the power supply reliability. Electricity receivers of the considered industrial site in terms of power supply reliability belong to the second category. The task of ensuring the power supply reliability includes a whole range of technical, economic and organizational measures aimed at reducing damage from disruption of the electricity consumers’ normal operation. In addition, in modern market conditions, the power supply reliability is inextricably linked with the economic performance and industrial enterprises energy security. The paper proposes to modernize the industrial site power supply circuit, using the existing standby diesel power plant, which would automatically provide the industrial site power supply in automatic mode in case of disappearance, decrease, increase in voltage level, phase failure, and the phase sequence violation of the three-phase supply voltage on the busbar sections TP-1, TP-2 site. It is obvious that with the existing power supply scheme of the industrial site, the manual switching sequence, control over the backup diesel power plant operation, the normal power supply scheme restoration, it takes an average of 2.5 hours, which is not desirable, especially in winter. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce at the industrial site production control devices for the reserve automatic transfer, which ensure the power supply restoration to the industrial site in automatic mode.</jats:p>",

Electricity demand is increasing day by day in urban as well as rural areas but instant extension of national grid seems difficult in many remote places of Nepal. Thousands of Micro hydropower are being installed throughout the country where extension of grid is difficult. This paper presents the introduction of battery bank for the supply side management in the micro hydropower plants. Surplus power during off load time is stored in a battery instead of wasting in dump load. The system is designed in Matlab Simulink where system containing Electronic Load Controller(ELC), Battery Management System(BMS), three phase ac/dc converter were used. Synchronous Generator which generates constant power feeds the load, battery and dump load according to requirement. Battery uses the power for charging during off load hour and supplies deficit power during peak hour. Case study of Pinthali microhydro power of capacity 8.1 KW was carried out for load survey to calculate excess power. Simulated system was able to distribute the power to load when load demand was higher than generation through the battery.</jats:p>"

For this study, 108 experiments were carried out to investigate energy dissipation. In the experiments, the discharge rate, drop height, and porosity of the screens were varied. Parameters yc/h, yd/yc, and p were input variables, and ΔE/Eu was the output variable. The efficiencies of the models were compared using the following metrics: correlation coefficient (CC), mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE). Results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS_gbellmf based model with a CC value of 0.9953, RMSE value of 0.0069, MAE value of 0.0042, NRMSE value as 0.0092 and NSE value as 0.9895 was superior to other applied models. Also, a linear regression yielded CC = 0.9933, RMSE = 0.0083, and MAE = 0.0067. This linear model outperformed multiple linear regression models. Results from a sensitivity study suggest that yc/h is the most effective parameter for predicting ΔE/Eu.</jats:p>",

The controlling constriction size for selected shapes and gradations were worked out and related to the experimental values of hydraulic conductivity. The empirical model for determination of hydraulic conductivity based on controlling constriction size for each shape of granular filter material was developed. Finally, a combined empirical model for the determination of hydraulic conductivity of granular filters was developed based on shape parameters and the controlling constriction size. The model was validated with the experimental data of a past research work; the predicted values of hydraulic conductivity were found in close approximation to the values obtained from the literature.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the properties of electrical energy, that causes significant economic losses for both suppliers and consumers of electricity, is voltage unbalance. The most universal criterion for identifying voltage unbalance sources is the nodal distorting current. The accuracy of its determination depends on the method of measurement organization and is characterized by the greatest error for the local approach. The reason for this lies in an approximate method for determining the equivalent circuits of consumers of electrical energy and their parameters when measuring the parameters of the network operation mode only at one point of common connection to the power supply system. Analysis of the influence of approximate equivalent circuits and their parameters on the determination of the nodal distorting current showed that adequate identification of the sources of voltage unbalance distortion is possible only in the reverse sequence. At the same time, it is difficult to accurately determine the error in calculating this criterion in real time measurements due to the presence of additional unknowns that are required for its calculation. Based on this, it is proposed to carry out an upper estimate of this error. This required the introduction of additional functions with the search for their maximum under the given constraints. In addition, the uncertainty associated with the non-zero value of the identification criterion for a non-asymmetric consumer of electricity was taken into account that led to the need to introduce a dead zone for it. As a result of the studies carried out, expressions were obtained for an upper estimate of the error in determining the criterion for identifying sources of voltage symmetry distortion in the reverse sequence and determining its dead zone in real time measurements in relation to three-phase three- and four-wire power supply systems.</jats:p>",

Water quality indexes (WQIs) are frequently used methods to assess water quality for drinking purposes. A WQI can be predicted using chemical analysis which might not, however, be viable for a longer period in all country-scale rivers. Thus, in this investigation, two neural-based soft computing techniques – an artificial neural network (ANN) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) – and one hybrid soft computing techniques – an adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) with four membership functions – were used to predict WQIs in Khorramabad, Biranshahr and Alashtar sub-watersheds in Iran. Ten distinct physiochemical parameters were used as input variables and WQI as output. Simultaneously, a correlation plot and pairs were used to ascertain the relation of input and output variables. The soft computing techniques were compared using six fitness criteria: Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Legates-McCabe Index (LMI), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of correlation (CC). Results indicated that ANN better predicted WQI than did GRNN and ANFIS. Among the different membership functions of ANFIS, ANFIS_trimf was far better than were the others. Thus, it was concluded that ANN was a viable tool for the prediction of a WQI.</jats:p>",

The simplest lacus consisted of a stone basin and a spout stone, concealing one or two supply pipes. 35 street fountains of this type have been surveyed in Pompeii, to gather information on their supply and its variation in time. A new method was devised for calculating the discharge through the overflow channel of each <jats:italic>lacus</jats:italic>, and this value was taken as an estimate of the water supplied to each fountain. The overflow channel internal cross-section width was measured at four elevations, and the cross-section profile was reconstructed based on these data. Three water levels of 1 cm, half of the cross-section height and entire cross section height, were considered at each channel’s inlet, obtaining a corresponding channel discharge. The values obtained, ranging from 0.03 to 2.9 l/s, were checked against the trajectory of the fountain water jet, making sure that it remained within the basin length. For 28 fountains the average discharge was found to be 0.08 l/s when the water was at the lowest level, 0.43 l/s for the intermediate level and 1.18 l/s for a full inlet. The average time of residence of the water, in the <jats:italic>lacus</jats:italic> draw basin, was estimated between 11 min and 3 h. An estimate of the demand of all the town <jats:italic>lacus</jats:italic> was compared with the capacity of the aqueduct channel entering at Porta Vesuvio: the town <jats:italic>lacus</jats:italic> could have been supplied contemporaneously at the minimum and intermediate discharges.</jats:p>",

The traditional SL system utilizes a vat filled with ceramic slurry with a high solid content, which for ceramics contributes to several limitations and operational difficulties, and further renders it nonrecyclable mainly due to the presence of printed residue and its high viscosity. In this study, we utilized a continuous film supply (CFS) system integrated with a tape-casting type digital light processing (DLP) printer to fabricate zirconia prototypes with a solid content of 45 volume percent (vol.%). Various printing and postprocessing parameters were studied for optimization, to achieve a relative density of 99.02% ± 0.08% with a microhardness of 12.59 ± 0.47 GPa. Slurry reusability was also demonstrated by printing with recycled slurry to produce consistent relative density values in the range of 98.86% ± 0.02% to 98.94% ± 0.03%. This method provides new opportunities for material recycling and the fabrication of dense complex ceramic products, reducing the consumption of the material.</jats:p>"

Although there are some practical examples of blockchain in the port supply chain (eg. Trade Len or Cargo Smart), there are few application scenarios. Therefore, blockchain technology has yet to be widely used in the port industry. This may be related to the construction of blockchain. This paper analyzes the impact of blockchain technology on the port supply chain and the technology sharing on the shipping market. It is found that the investment of blockchain technology in a competitive environment has different characteristics. When the efficiency of technology investment and the proportion of market expansion reach a certain combination, there are two different equilibrium strategy choices: Only technology investment or technology sharing. Based on the above research results, this paper further investigates the results of the comprehensive influence of different factors such as competition intensity and market expansion proportion.</jats:p>",

This work takes the agricultural product supply chain as the research object and investigates how the supplier role performance affects the relationship quality of supply chain. An empirical study is conducted through questionnaire-related data based on the model. The research results show that supplier role performance has a significant positive effect on the relationship quality, and the distributive fairness of supplier has a significant intermediary effect on both supplier role performance and relationship quality of the supply chain. In addition, price satisfaction has a positive impact on commitments when considering the fairness perception of suppliers.</jats:p>",

In low- and middle-income countries, waste pickers underpin the recycling loop of the circular economy. Where informality and working poverty are the norm, waste pickers typically receive little social protection, work in dangerous conditions, and earn low wages. Nevertheless, waste pickers’ work addresses multiscalar environmental problems from localised flooding of plastic-clogged waterways, to preventing the release of greenhouse gases when plastic is burnt. Here, we review recent academic and grey literature on waste picking, the social circular economy, and corporate circularity to understand the role and position of waste pickers in the contemporary circular economy. We explain how given the recent outcry against plastic waste, and subsequent corporate commitments to plastic recycling, there has been greater action on material flows than in support of the people who move these flows. Overall, the corporate response remains limited, with a general preference for recycling over redesign and only a fifth of packaging accounted for. Based on this review, we present two models. The first is a hierarchy of plastic recycling showing the foundational role of waste pickers in the recycled plastics supply chain. As plastics move up the hierarchy, their value increases and working conditions improve. We also propose a new model for a socially restorative circular economy which provides fair pay, safe working conditions, social protection, legal rights, voice, respect, services, and education. Some governments, co-operatives, non-governmental organisations, and businesses are already working towards this—and their work offers pathways towards a new standard of fair trade recycled materials. We argue that for true sustainability and the best version of circularity to be achieved, deeply ingrained social challenges must be resolved.</jats:p>",

The emergence of the green supply chain is one of the most important developments of the last decade. It provides an opportunity for companies to adjust their supply chains according to environmental goals and sustainability. The integrated production-inventory-routing is a new field that aims to optimize these three decision-making levels. It can be described as follow: a factory produces one or more products, and sells them to several customers (by direct delivery or a specific customer chain). The current study aims to model a production-inventory-routing system using a system dynamics approach to design a green supply chain under uncertain conditions. For this purpose, first, the association between selected variables was determined. Then, the proposed model was validated. Finally, to identify variables with the highest influence, four scenarios were developed. The results indicated that minimum total transportation cost, the total warehouse capacity of the supply chain, and the maximum production rate are the most influential strategies to achieve ideal condition.</jats:p>",

The results show that: under the carbon trading mechanism, the carbon emission reduction level of the manufacturer is inversely proportional to the relevant price, and the demand and profit of the two channels increase with the increase in emission reduction; when carbon trading and green financial loans are carried out at the same time, participants have lower profits, but with the increase in emission reductions, it is still a growing trend.</jats:p>"

In some cases, seventeen (17) or more potentially toxic compounds are found in a single street purchased bag or block of cocaine or heroin. Pharmacologically active compounds, impurities, or breakdown products from drug manufacturing and industrial chemicals (collectively referred to as toxic adulterants) are now found in street drugs. They include, but are not limited to: antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihistamines, anthelmintics, anesthetics, antiinflammatorys, antipyretics, analgesics, antispasmodics, antiarrhythmics, antimalarials, veterinary medications, bronchodilators, expectorants, sedatives, muscle relaxers, natural/synthetic hallucinogens, decongestants, new psychoactive substances (NPS), industrial compounds, fungicides, and impurities in the manufacturing process. All can be found within a single street purchase of heroin or cocaine. Routine clinical or workplace drug testing will not detect all these toxic adulterants. Only specialty forensic tests, specifically ordered, will detect them. The synergistic effect on the human body of such an unprecedented combination of pharmacologically active compounds is unknown and potentially deadly. This is especially seen in daily substance users who are exposed to these combinations multiple times a day over an extended period of time. Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have several co-occurring health problems that make them more susceptible to COVID-19, including compromised immune, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.

The data were entered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and XLSTAT. Mann-Kendall test (M-K) and Sen’s slope method were used for trend analysis. The results showed that the potato cultivation area increased by 341.786 ha/year, production increased by 8323.933 Mt/year and productivity increased by 0.231 Mt/ha/year from 1999/00 to 2017/18. Similarly, the red potato supply from Kavre to the Kalimati market increased by 13.412 Mt/year and the white potato supply decreased by 234.174 Mt/year during the period from 2000/01 to 2019/20. The instability analysis showed 34.41%, 41.36% and 11.16%. coefficient of variation for area, production and productivity while red potato and white potato supply showed 11.64% and 107.86% variation.

In this regard, in some countries, building codes do not allow gasification of buildings above 10 floors.

A comparison with US law serves as a benchmark for drawing conclusions, in particular, whether the requirements are appropriate and proportionate for SFSCs. The Regulation takes into account these alternative sales channels, as Art. 44 only requires information on allergens when offering unpackaged food for sale to final consumers or mass caterers, or when foodstuffs are packaged in the sales room at the consumer's request or packaged for direct sale. However, Member States have adopted national measures imposing an obligation to provide, in writing, more information on food in the direct sale, such as the ingredients list, but not the nutrition declaration. The US legislature is more restrictive, as it requires not only ingredient lists but also nutritional information for nearly all packaged and unpackaged food products, except for agricultural raw materials. The multitude of obligations imposed at various legislative levels is undoubtedly a challenge for farmers involved in SFSC, who are not prepared on a par with professional food companies to implement them.</jats:p>"

In view of the characteristics that the overload operation state and maintenance interval of equipment are closely related to the equipment state level, the evaluation feature vector composed of five indexes, including overload time of heavy overload equipment, whether the central power supply equipment is in the city center, unrepaired time of equipment, whether it is the power supply equipment and the voltage level of equipment is maintained, is constructed in this subject. In addition, based on the Stacking ensemble learning framework, a hybrid ensemble learning framework algorithm is proposed, which combines the single Bagging and Boosting framework algorithms, and realizes the mapping between feature vectors and importance levels. The data of actual railway power grid equipment are substituted into the model for analysis, and the model is compared with the random forest model based on single ensemble learning algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with other ensemble learning algorithms, the accuracy of equipment state evaluation is significantly improved by using the combination model of stacking ensemble learning method.</jats:p>",

In addition, the shoot length, yield efficiency and fruit weight were determined. The trees of the cultivar ‘Regina’ on Weiroot 72 or Gisela 5 rootstocks were either irrigated or non-irrigated. Irrigated trees received, in addition to rainfall, an amount of water equal to 100% of evapotranspiration, while non-irrigated trees received only rainwater (40% less). An analysis of phytochemicals was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Irrigated trees had a higher content of total sugars in leaf and bud, higher content of total organic acids in the fruit, and lower content of total hydroxycinnamic acids, total flavonols and flavanols in the leaf and fruit. Irrigated trees also had higher shoot length, fruit weight and lower yield efficiency. The content of phytochemicals in bud and leaf was not affected by rootstock, but the fruit phytochemical composition, shoot length and yield efficiency were. The content of phytochemicals in the bud and leaf was influenced by the presence or absence of fruits. Our results show that irrigation, rootstock and the presence of fruits had an influence on the composition of phytochemicals in sweet cherry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wildfires are an increasing threat in the Mediterranean region, causing frequent losses of goods and human lives. Not only are wildfires a concern due to their immediate effects on vegetation and soil, but they can also have substantial impacts on surface water quality. Approximately one-third of the world’s largest cities obtain their drinking water from forest catchments. The removal of vegetation and consequent runoff increase with a high concentration of ash and sediment often leads to increased nutrient and contaminant loads to downstream reservoirs, damaging the aquatic ecosystem and threatening human health. This study focused on the post-fire degradation of surface water in Castelo de Bode reservoir, a strategic freshwater supply for Lisbon’s metropolitan area (2,000,000 inhabitants), Portugal. Output data from the catchment model Soil and Water Assessment Tool were used as inputs to the CE-QUAL-W2 reservoir model. CE-QUAL-W2 was then calibrated for water level, temperature, nutrients, total suspended solids, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen. The post-fire impacts were assessed by adjusting land use features (curve number, crop vegetation management factor), and soil properties (soil erodibility) in the catchment model, considering the different impacts of fire (low, medium, and high severity). The reservoir model was able to perform temperature seasonality and stratification while a weak performance was found for chlorophyll-a probably for having considered only a group of algae. Simulations showed a deterioration of water quality at the dam wall during the first year after the forest fire. Nevertheless, contamination did not appear worrisome with regards to water quality standards likely due to the capability of the reservoir to attenuate inflow concentrations.</jats:p>"

The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the unmanned aerial system (UAS) have been under investigation in the world of logistics, having been pointed as the next logistic technology. For that reason, this article proposes the use of UAV in urban logistics.Design/methodology/approach: We set for the methodology study the current state of this system and analyze what lies ahead soon. Based on this information, we intend to implement a scenario of deliveries in an urban environment. This scenario will be in the city of Aveiro and consists of the delivery of medicines into pharmacies located in an urban environment. With this study, we pretend to find the best current and future solution to operate in an urban environment, with the conventional vehicle or the UAV/UAS.Findings: The legal implications for the use of UAV/UAS are one important factor that can set back the use of these technologies due to the lack of legislation. Although this technology has some limitations in endurance and payload, this investigation reached a consensus in the use of UAV for logistics in urban areas, in small payloads (around 15 kg), and low endurance (around 25 min). The UAV/UAS brings excellent advantages that the conventional vehicle cannot overcome: direct routes; traffic congestion; and environmental legislation.Practical implications: This study brings an overview of a possible scenario for urban logistics. Although this is currently not possible, soon, this scenario could be implemented. This would bring a reduction in operation costs and reduce the congestion in the urban cores of the cities.Originality/value: Based on this research, this delivery system could, in the future, help and be the starting point for UAV/UAS logistics, specifically in the delivery of medicines.</jats:p>"

This article argues that the prevailing focus of the supply chain literature on industrial labour has inadvertently posited sexual labour as the ‘other’ of industrial labour thus obfuscating how the legal blurring of boundaries between industrial and service labour is engendering new modalities of the erosion of workers’ rights that are increasingly resembling those typical of sex work. This article advances the debate on unfree labour both conceptually and empirically. Conceptually, it highlights the relevance of social reproduction in understanding forms of labour unfreedom. Empirically, it demonstrates the similarities in forms of control and exploitation between sex work and industrial work by illustrating how debt and housing operate in both settings. </jats:p>",

In addition, some of the barriers that hinder the simplicity of the throughput planning process in the chain are considered. They are the “whip effect” and the conflict of interests of the participants in the chain. The article also proposes approaches that allow to achieve the most efficient planning of throughput in the chain, taking into account all the existing requirements and restrictions. The author proposes supply chain management as a single system and its synchronization with every moment of actual market demand. The next propose is the introduction of strategic alliances.</jats:p>"

This improved model accounts for Turkey’s “BEP-TR” (“Regulation on Energy Performance in Buildings”). In the present study, the effect of the obstruction angle parameter of buildings on lighting energy consumption and daylight provided is examined through a sample hotel project by the BEP-TR calculation method. This study investigates the effect of daylight on lighting energy performance alternatives that were produced according to the height, building distance variations (causing obstruction angle), and the correlation between annual lighting consumption values, daylight supply factor, and obstruction parameters. Accordingly, the current study aims to develop a method to assist zoning regulations, building intervals, and height decisions by determining specific ratios between obstruction parameters, daylight supply factor and lighting energy consumption values. Results of this study clearly show that obstruction parameter variables affect both the daylight supply factor and annual lighting energy significantly.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study compared the net farm income of fresh tomato supply chain actors (SCAs) among central, western and northern zones of Bauchi State. Primary data were collected with the use of a structured questionnaire. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 658 supply chain actors (producers, wholesalers, and retailers). The data collected were analysed using farm budgeting technique and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The result reveals net incomes of N186025.35, N321883.48 and N 66858.45 for producers, wholesalers and retailers, respectively. Also, the study shows returns per naira invested on every one naira as N0.78, N0.29 and N0.2, minimum net incomes of N -314058.33, N -2499400, N-80250.00 and maximum net incomes of N979826.67, N 4929150.00,  N 368050.0 for producers, wholesalers and retailers, respectively. The result shows significant differences in the net incomes of wholesalers and produce; wholesalers and retailers; and between retailers and producers at p &lt; 0.05 and P&lt;0.01 was observed. The result further reveals minimum costs incurred as N115122.50, N253450.00, N73470.00 and maximum costs incurred as N 805658.33, N4026350.00 and N 725570.00 for the SCAs. The result indicated significant differences in costs incurred between wholesalers and producers, wholesalers and retailers at P&lt;0.01. The study concluded that fresh tomato production and marketing in the study area was profitable among the supply chain actors. It can also be said that there was significant differences in both the net incomes obtained and costs incurred by the supply chain actors among the zones. The study recommends that decisions on fresh tomato production and marketing be adjusted and re-established so as to optimise their profits. Also, SCAs can sell their products online by registering their product and location. This will allow easy access of the product by customers and it will help broaden fresh tomato market, which in turn will increase the income of the supply chain actors in the study area.</jats:p>"

Considering that the cascading failure is triggered by overloading in the cyber supply network and is provoked by underload in the physical supply network, a realistic cascading model for cyber-physical supply networks is proposed. We conducted a numerical simulation under cyber node and physical node failure with varying parameters. The simulation results demonstrated that there are critical thresholds for both firm’s capacities, which can determine whether capacity expansion is helpful; there is also a cascade window for network load distribution, which can determine the cascading failures occurrence and scale.

Hence, the development of aeronautical combustors will face major challenges to meet future stringent environmental regulations. In the present study, an innovative gas turbine combustor with angular air supply called Short Helical Combustor (SHC) is investigated. The main feature of this concept is the helical arrangement of the fuel injectors around the turbine shaft. Aiming at the implementation of a lean-burn concept, a low-swirl lifted flame is adopted. This flame is lifted off and not anchored to the injector which opens the potential of low NOx emissions due to a high degree of premixing within the combustor.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, isothermal flow characteristics of such a generic SHC combustor are studied by use of RANS predictions with special emphasis on the interaction of adjacent low-swirl flows. For evaluating the influence of injector parameters on the flow field, a parametric study based on single sector simulations is performed. It is shown that the asymmetrically confined swirling jet flow is strongly deflected towards the sidewall of the staggered SHC dome. The deflection of the flow is associated with an asymmetric pressure field in the vicinity of the burner which is generally known as Coandă effect. As a consequence of the deflected flow, the angular momentum flux at combustor outlet is increased.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The interaction of the low-swirl jet and the SHC sidewall is investigated with regards to backflow momentum and residence time in the recirculation zone. It is concluded that by modifying the momentum of the air flow through the injector, the amount of recirculating air flowing back along combustor walls is strongly affected. The present work establishes an understanding of the underlying aerodynamics of the SHC concept which is essential for matching the requirements of lean lifted flames.</jats:p>",

We use MUSE integral field spectroscopy data to study the active S0 galaxy NGC 5077, which is known to have disturbed dynamics that are indicative of a past external interaction. We confirm the presence of a stellar kinematically distinct core with a diameter of 2.8 kpc that is counter-rotating with respect to the main stellar body of the galaxy. We find that the counter-rotating core consists of an old stellar population that is not significantly different from the rest of the galaxy. The ionised gas is strongly warped and extends out to 6.5 kpc in the polar direction and in a filamentary structure. The gas dynamics is complex, with significant changes in the position angle as a function of radius. The ionised gas line ratios are consistent with LINER excitation by the active galactic nucleus, both in the nucleus and at kiloparsec scales. We discover a nuclear outflow with projected velocity<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> ∼ 400 km s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, consistent with a hollow outflow cone intersecting the plane of the sky. The properties of the misaligned gas match predictions from numerical simulations of misaligned gas infall after a gas-rich merger. The warp and change in the gas orientation as a function of radius are consistent with gas relaxation due to stellar torques; these are stronger at small radii where the gas aligns faster than in the outer regions, driving gas to the nucleus. The stellar and gas dynamics indicate that NGC 5077 has had at least two external interactions, one that resulted in the formation of the counter-rotating core, followed by the second, late-time external gas accretion. NGC 5077 illustrates the importance of external interactions in the replenishment of the galaxy gas reservoir and the nuclear gas content available for black hole fuelling.</jats:p>",

Mathematical modelling is essential to understand the physics of this drying process and to optimize the operation conditions. However, there are few modelling studies about intermittent microwave drying. This work proposed a mathematical model based on mass balances of liquid and vapor water in which a non-equilibrium formulation described the water phase change. The microwave heating, described by Lambert’s law, was accounting as source term on the thermal energy conservation equation. The numerical solution used the finite element method, and the experimental drying of potato samples validated the simulated drying. The values of moisture content and temperature obtained by numerical solution of the model showed good agreement with experimental data. From this, it was observed the presence of three periods in the drying kinetics: an initial heating phase almost without drying, follow by a phase with constant drying rate, and final a decrease of drying rate and temperature increasement. The model results showed that the interior temperature was higher than the surface temperature of sample, and there was water evaporation inside the potato. In additional, the gradients of temperature were reduced due to intermittency of the microwave power. This redistribution of temperature could contribute to the improvement of product quality during drying.</jats:p>"

Despite their fundamental function on landscape construction, current knowledge on their plano‐altimetric evolution in response to environmental forcing is still limited. We developed a mathematical model to address the interplay of biogeomorphic processes on the plano‐altimetric equilibrium of a straight tidal channel flanked by adjacent intertidal platforms. The model couples a one‐dimensional hydrodynamic model with a bed evolution model. The former describes the flow field within the channel and the storage contribution of lateral shoals. The latter accounts for the main physical processes responsible for shaping the tidal landscape, namely erosion, deposition, and sea level rise, mediated by halophytic vegetation growth. Model results reproduce a variety of channel morphologies, ranging from those typical of tidal‐flat channels, with large width‐to‐depth ratios, to those characterizing salt‐marsh creeks, which have much narrower cross sections and small width‐to‐depth ratios. Our results show that vegetation encroachment on the marsh surface produces two competing effects. First, vegetation increases flow concentration within the channel, owing to the increased flow resistance on the vegetated platform thus favoring channel incision. Second, vegetation promotes a reduction in the tidal prism, owing to higher accretion rates of the salt‐marsh surface thus leading to channel infilling. Which effect prevails over the other depends on the elevation of the intertidal platform in the tidal frame. The latter is in turn dictated by sediment availability, the rate of relative sea level rise, and vegetation biogeomorphic effects.</jats:p>",

This research study ranked supply chain contracts by the EAMR in uncertainty environments, such as when breaking down the health care industry. This is done by providing a theoretical framework for sustainable entrepreneurship in telecommunications industry, focusing on managerial and operational practices that should be modified, in accordance to a set of CSFs identified from experts in fertility hospital. As a novel strategy, in this research, the initial factors of selecting customized Supply Chain Management (SCM) were extracted via a Delphi method along with the EAMR to symbolize a decision matrix that needs primary weights acquired through the SWARA method by hesitant fuzzy number. CSFs for achieving SCM contract selection in fertility hospitals were found to rely on a tripod based on effectiveness, transparency, and accountability that are embedded within the ambit of managerial and operational practices, such as focusing and reducing cost and based on these factors the best SCM contract must be selected. Besides, the EAMR method has more reliability than other similar MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, MOORA, VIKOR, and so on main contribution of this paper is the combination of SWARA, EAMR, and using hesitant fuzzy set in the EAMR method. Finally, the result indicates that hospitals based on these CSFs must be selected contracts.</jats:p>"

Using the measured values of pressure difference Δp determined the absolute roughness of internal walls of the pipes after 30-year exploitation, which was referred to the new pipelines. The absolute roughness for the exploited pipes was equal to k = 27.6 mm, whereas for the new ones it was significantly lower and equal to k = 0.9 mm. Additionally, an analysis of the chemical and mineral composition of sediments gathered in the investigated pipelines was also performed. The top layer of the sediments was dominated by the compounds of a character of the iron hydroxide: goethite (α-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), whereas the internal layer was supplemented by the gypsum and sulfur, which was proven by the investigations performed with the use of scanning electron microscope (SEM). The sediment gathered within the pipes is the main reason of ca. 30-fold increase of the absolute roughness, which resulted in the flowability drop of the exploited water supply pipes.</jats:p>"

Methodology: A series of collaboration agreements involved in joint planning were established according to the designed CPFR model. This allowed (i) raising the levels of interaction between the health insurance company, the healthcare provider, the supplying pharmaceutical laboratories, and the patients; (ii) determining demand forecasts; (iii) locating distribution centers; and (iv) defining medicine distribution strategies oriented to the minimization of costs along the chain. Subsequently, the main differences between the current operation and CPFR models at the level of structure and decisions were characterized and then evaluated in terms of supply chain costs. Results: The significant impact of the proposed model is demonstrated. The total monthly cost of operating the chain is reduced by 11.2 % on average. Within the proposed innovation, an outstanding place is held by the savings reached in the purchase and distribution of medicines from the laboratory to the distribution centers, and by the customer satisfaction differences, which increased 15.3 % on average during the studied six-month period.</jats:p>"

The AC exists as a solid at room temperature, and it is decomposed to NH3 and CO2 gases by heating. Therefore, adequate heat transfer is an essential issue in the design of AC pyrolysis reactor. In this study, a numerical model that describes the sublimation of AC was developed. For modeling, this study considered the three different calculation zones: solid-phase zone, gas-phase zone, and sublimation zone. Additionally, during the sublimation process, collapse of upper solid AC into the hollow space below by the effect of gravity is considered. As a result, it is presented that the modeling shows reasonable information about the AC sublimation in a reactor, such as temperatures in a reactor, pressure of reactor, and flow rate of sublimated gas. However, it is also found that accurate prediction of spatial temperature distribution is challenging because it is related to the accurate prediction of the internal shape of AC and its collapse in a reactor.</jats:p>"

The effects, which relate to the cold temperature, associated with fuel freeze or wax point, cause a malfunction in the fuel pumps, nozzles, and other areas of the fuel system. On the other hand, high fuel temperature also leads to negative effects — the most common failure of high-flow fuel systems is cavitation, or “vapor-lock.” The combination of too much heat or too much inlet restriction can create this operating condition, where the liquid fuel literally boils inside the fuel pump. These effects are eliminated by the fuel/oil heat exchange system. In case of low fuel temperature, the fuel is used as a refrigerant to cool down hot oil coming from bearings. And in case of high fuel temperature, the oil serves as a coolant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper considers the method of evaluating normal and critical aircraft engine operation modes of the oil supply system with a fuel-oil heat exchanger utilizing an unsteady-state thermal-fluid network approach. The analyses are done based on the aircraft engine example to evaluate fuel and oil systems parameters variation in time under different flight conditions — the amount of fuel in the tank, inertial thermal effects, and the response time of the system to the regulation of the heat exchanger. The article is focused on sudden switching from a high to low gas engine operating mode. Fuel consumption to the engine is reduced abruptly, but the heat transfer from the bearings to the oil is still high due to thermal inertia. In this situation, a large amount of heated fuel must be returned to the fuel tank. At a certain point in time, the temperature of the fuel can reach a critical value. At the same time bearing cooling becomes ineffective, which leads to overheating. The calculation of thermal management system was performed at nominal conditions to obtain the initial data for low power settings analysis. As results of analysis at the low power settings mode the oil temperature before fuel cooled oil cooler is reached above 138 °C, which is high value. The failure of flow return valve is considered. The variations of oil temperature after the tank and increasing of fuel temperature at the tank in case of emergency situation are obtained. The influence of cooled fuel amount on the system thermal management is analyzed.</jats:p>",

The German high‐pressure gas pipeline network's length is roughly 40 000 km, which enables highly fluctuating quantities of gas to be transported safely over long distances. Considering that similar amounts of gas are also transshipped through Germany to other EU states, it is clear that Germany's gas transport system is essential to the European energy supply. Since the average velocity of gas in a pipeline is only 25 km/h, an adequate high‐precision, high‐frequency forecasting of supply and demand is crucial for efficient control and operation of such a transmission network. We propose a deep learning model based on spatio‐temporal convolutional neural networks (DLST) to tackle the problem of gas flow forecasting in a complex high‐pressure transmission network. Experiments show that our model effectively captures comprehensive spatio‐temporal correlations through modeling gas networks and consistently outperforms state‐of‐the‐art benchmarks on real‐world data sets by at least 15%. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can deal with complex nonlinear gas network flow forecasting with high accuracy and effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Experiments were conducted for 26 various Modified Venturi flumes and one Parshall flume. A total of 99 observations were obtained from experiments. The results of soft computing models were compared with regression-based models i.e., with multiple linear regression (MLR) and multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR). Results of the analysis revealed that the MARS model outperformed other soft computing and regression-based models for predicting AE20 of Parshall and Modified Venturi flumes with Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.9997, and 0.9992, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.0015, and 0.0045 during calibration and validation periods, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out by using the best executing MARS model to assess the effect of individual input variables on AE20 of both flumes. Obtained results on sensitivity examination indicate that the oxygen deficit ratio (r) was the most effective input variable in predicting the AE20 of Parshall and Modified Venturi flumes.</jats:p>",

The 268 respondents included in this study were employees of firms that implemented GSCM in Thailand. Our structural model was analysed using partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that only social and operating performance mediated the impact of four different GSCM practices on employee engagement and organizational commitment, including environmental education, green marketing and green warehousing and distribution which have positive effects, and green manufacturing which has a negative effect on firm performance. Though these four GSCM practices are reported to have a significant influence on environmental and marketing performance, these two aspects of performance failed to mediate the relationship of these practices with employee engagement and organizational commitment. The results suggest that in order to enhance employee engagement and organizational commitment, firms should invest more in GSCM practice drivers of social and operating performance. These include environmental education, green marketing and green warehousing and distribution. Thus, we explained more clearly the mechanisms under which GSCM practices influence employee engagement and organizational commitment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The manufacturing industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Additive manufacturing, owing to its multiple advantages, plays a critical role in innovating the current manufacturing industry, especially from a supply chain perspective. Currently, the majority of research on GHG emissions in the manufacturing industry is focused on traditional manufacturing, either single processes in the supply chain or specific case studies, indicating the lack of models on GHG emissions in additive manufacturing-enabled supply chain structures. In this work, a mathematical model is established to estimate the GHG emissions in both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing-enabled supply chains. To explore the advantages of additive manufacturing in terms of fast production and reduced or even eliminated the need for assembly and labor involvement, a unique integrated production-inventory-transportation structure is investigated in additive manufacturing case studies. The results indicate that a potential reduction of 26.43% of GHG emissions can be achieved by adopting the additive manufacturing technique in the supply chain. Also, the impacts of rush order rate, emission intensity, and vehicle GHG emission constant rate on the overall GHG emissions are investigated in the sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that a 20% variation in GHG emission intensity (the amount of CO2eq emissions caused by generating a unit of electricity) can lead to a 6.26% change in the total GHG emissions in additive manufacturing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background</jats:bold>Rapid and specific diagnostic tests are essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to allow prompt isolation and early treatment initiation if necessary. Currently, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing but are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings with poor access to laboratory infrastructure. Point of care (POC) testing may be more feasible in resource-limited settings because POC testing is cost-effective, easy to perform, results are rapid, and they can be performed at all levels of healthcare by health professionals with minimal training. To ensure equitable access, it is important that SARS-CoV-2 testing is optimised through well-established supply chain management (SCM). Here we outline a protocol for a scoping review aimed at mapping literature on SCM for POC testing in resource limited settings to guide both future research and the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 POC diagnostics. <jats:bold>Methodology</jats:bold>This scoping review will be guided by an adapted version of the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework. We will search the Medline Ovid, Medline EBSCO, Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EBSCOHost databases. We will search gray literature in the form of dissertations/theses, conference proceedings, websites of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and government reports. We will include articles reporting evidence published since inception. Language restrictions will not be applied. We will use a search summary table to test the effectiveness of the search strategy. Two reviewers will screen eligible studies using a tool developed for this scoping review. The quality of the included studies will be appraised using the mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2018. <jats:bold>Discussion </jats:bold>The proposed scoping review will gather relevant studies on SCM systems for POC diagnostics services globally. We anticipate that this review’s findings will guide future research on SCM systems for POC diagnostics services in resource-limited settings. The results will be published in a scientific journal, presented at relevant conferences and form part of workshops with key stakeholders involved in SCM systems for POC diagnostics services.</jats:p>"

How to form an effective food supply chain in pandemic conditions is the one of the most important questions nowadays. The agro-food system is becoming not only a tool for solving many economic and social problems that arise in the context of a pandemic, but itself is experiencing a serious impact from consumers, business, and the state. The pandemic negatively affected the agri-food system of different countries. Among the main problems, we will single out the reduction in demand for fresh food, disruptions in the supply of incoming resources, both for the production of products and for their sales, a shortage of labour, especially seasonal. The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chains in Russia. Using the example of supply chains in St. Petersburg, we show that the food supply chain tends to be shorter because of the consumer’s willingness to buy food direct from farmers avoiding risks to be infected with COVID-19. Another change in food supply chain is the increasing role of government in regulation of food security in region.</jats:p>",

A framework is developed that supports analysis and management of value‐creating relationships between the focal firm, suppliers, and stakeholders of suppliers. By extending the conceptualization of sustainable business models to consider relationship chains beyond direct relationships, this article proposes that a focal firm has to actively manage interactions both with suppliers and with suppliers' stakeholders.</jats:p>",

The specific objective of the study included finding out the key local commodities that are important driver of tourism backward linkage with local economy of Kisumu County, establish differences in the average score profile among local suppliers and find out the main dimension along which they are separated. The study adopted across sectional and correlation design in which stratified random sampling of 106 tourism enterprises from a target population of 266 enterprises was obtained. Self – administered questionnaires were distributed to managers and collected by researcher. The first, second and third objectives were analysed using descriptive statistics, MANOVA and descriptive discriminant analysis respectively. It was found out that while poultry products, fish and vegetables were main commodities in the trade between local suppliers and tourist industry, fish, beef, and detergent were the most consumed commodities. Secondly, suppliers were different in their mean score profile by the value and quality of their supply, promptness in their delivery of supplies and in the longevity in commercial relationship with the tourist industry. Lastly, the suppliers were separated significantly along two main dimensions: The first dimension was interpreted to be efficiency and effectiveness, being represented by high value of weekly supply and high rating on promptness in making deliveries. The second dimension was experience, which was indicated by suppliers` education level and their longevity in the commercial relation with the tourist industry. The key contribution of the study is the creation of understanding of the main commodities driving tourism backward linkage with local economy and the factors which confer competitive advantage among local traders of Kisumu County in tourist industry.</jats:p>",

We constructed an original sample from two sources to empirically test this conceptualization using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Our empirical results reveal that the ability of firms to leverage SC traceability for a high financial performance is contingent upon creating a transparency perception of SC with a wide range of stakeholders. Our results also identified the firm size and its international presence, as having a significant bearing on the ability of firms to leverage SC traceability and SC transparency capabilities for a competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

First, the effect of indirect electricity usage on PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> emission-related deaths is approximately four times larger than that for direct usage. Second, a large percentage of pollution-related deaths can be attributed to India’s domestic final demand usage; however, electricity usage in the intermediate and final demand sectors is inextricably linked. Third, foreign final demand sectors from the Middle East, the USA, and China contribute indirectly toward PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> emission-related deaths, specifically in the rice export supply chain.

Commonly, pollen limitation reduces seed set or bees experience nectar dearth. Using a cost‐benefit approach, we show that natural selection will lead to lower nectar production when pollinators are abundant, and vice‐versa. At the community level, competition among plants for pollinators causes positive feedback that exacerbates pre‐existing seasonal imbalances between nectar supply and demand. When pollinators are scarce, plants will be selected to produce more nectar to outcompete other plants in attracting pollinators, and when pollinators are abundant, plants will be selected to produce less nectar. We suggest ways to test this positive feedback hypothesis and note that evidence for seasonal variation in nectar availability provides preliminary empirical support. If correct, our hypothesis indicates that pollination faces a particular challenge in balancing nectar supply with pollinator demand and is a further example of the underappreciated role of positive feedback in ecology and evolution.</jats:p>",

For influent turbidity varied from 2 to 20 NTU, coagulation-flocculation behavior exhibited under the two fundamentally different treatment processes with PACl influenced inter-related performance parameters. The residual turbidity was found to be lower by 74%, flocs and fine colloids in suspension larger by 73 and 75% respectively, and the total and dissolved residual aluminum lower by 50 and 49% respectively on average for PFBC compared to CC. Particulate form comprised major fraction (≈72%) of total residual aluminum for both. PFBC abetted formation of a more consolidated floc structure, which rendered the shape, size and morphology such that the settling velocity was 50% to 410% higher than that of the CC flocs. Reaction-limited aggregation (RLA) process and inter-particle bridging were dominant and the resulting floc structure and its formation mechanism have been presented.</jats:p>",

Weighted Failure Mode Effect Analysis (WFMEA) enriched by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was implemented to evaluate high-risk priorities and to manage those risks. The results showed that risk in marketing chain got the highest priority to be controlled since the greatest potential failure occurred in this channel with the weighted Risk Priority Number about 647.3. Risk indicators in this channel were cashless payment, major harvesting, and price fluctuations. Strategies to manage those risks were the provision of storage warehouses, planting time arrangements, bailout funds for cash purchase, harvest and post-harvest technology and farm capital loan. Government supports was required for providing the small-scale storage, home scale ozonation technology to extent the chilli shelf life and improve the product quality as well as policies on accessible farmer’s credit with farming guarantee system.</jats:p>",

Many researchers have predicted and written about the unimaginable new supply chain configurations after the large-scale adoption of 3D printing. A supply chain is a lifeline for any business because it drives the business by satisfying customers’ demands economically. This study was undertaken to explore the factors that are critical for developing a supply chain ecosystem for the 3DP industry. The study used the literature of the relevant research papers, conference articles, additive manufacturing business reports, and supply chain management (SCM)research papers &amp; articles on 3D printing technology. This study highlights factors that are critical for the supply chain ecosystem for the 3DP industry. Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology identified interactive association among those factors. Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC analysis) has classified those factors into four categories for better understanding and strategy making. The stakeholders in the 3D printing industry can draw insights from the output of this study.

The situation is serious in Sialkot the district of Punjab where groundwater is contaminated due to effluents' improper disposal. The current study is designed to find the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) by households for clean drinking water supply in the affected area. A contingent valuation survey approach and a stratified random sampling technique have been applied. A double bounded dichotomous choice question followed by an open-ended question format has been used to elicit WTP and maximum willingness of the respondents for clean drinking water supply. Logit and Multiple Linear Regression Model is used as an econometric tool to analyze the data. The results reveal that as the income of the respondent increases, the WTP for the clean water supply also increases. While multiple regression reveals a monthly mean WTP of Rs. 234.54 which is greatly affected by age, household income, education, and environmental awareness i.e. respondents with higher household income and a higher level of education are willing to pay more for a clean water supply. Residents who are living closer to the tanneries are more affected and their WTP is higher. \r\nKeywords: Willingness to Pay, Clean drinking water, Contingent Valuation Method, Binomial Logit Regression, Leather Tanneries, Sialkot, Pakistan</jats:p>"

The study would answer the question: (1) to what extent does sterilization effort of the Central Bank of Nigeria effective in controlling capital inflows in Nigeria, (2) to what extent is sterilization policy able to regulate money supply in Nigeria. By utilizing monthly data spanning a period of 2010-2018 under the framework of Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), findings show that the sterilization policy of the CBN is effective in regulating money supply and depressing capital inflows both in period of normal capital inflows and in period of intensive capital inflows. We therefore recommend that in periods of sudden and volatile capital inflows, sterilization measure should be given a priority in order to stave off the negative consequences of such unexpected inflows.

This transition creates new challenges for both short-term wholesale market design and investment incentives consistent with achieving both decarbonization commitments and security of supply criteria. Thinking broadly about the options for institutional change from a Williamsonian perspective – thinking like Williamson – provides a useful framework for examining institutional adaptation. Hybrid markets that combine ‘competition for the market’ that relies on competitive procurement for long-term purchased power agreements with wind, solar, and storage developers, ideally in a technology neutral fashion, and ‘competition in the market’ that relies on short-term markets designed to produce efficient and reliable operations of intermittent generation and storage, is identified as a promising direction for institutional adaptation.

The case study is Stewart Island, where the cost of electricity, provided by a central diesel power station, is higher than the grid network in New Zealand. Local residents believe that reducing the consumption of diesel and having a renewable source of electricity generation are two of the island’s highest priorities. Merging a tidal energy source (predictable) with wind (unpredictable) and diesel (back-up), through a microgrid, may be a way to increase reliability and decrease the cost of generation. Several off-grid configurations are simulated using HOMER and WRPLOT software. Using two wind and four tidal turbines, plus one diesel generator for back-up, is the best design in terms of lower greenhouse gas emissions, higher renewable fraction, and reduced net present cost.</jats:p>"

This study evaluated local people's perceptions regarding conservation of sacred groves for water services, through willingness-to-pay (WTP), willingness-to-accept (WTA) and willingness-to-labour-work (DLP). Data were collected through a pre-tested questionnaire from 107 randomly selected households in 18 villages of Uttarakhand. The villages were categorised into 3 classes (core, nearby, faraway) based on proximity to the forests. The contingent-valuation method was used to evaluate WTP [Rs 3,802 (≈$57)] and WTA [Rs 38,224 (≈$571)] for water as an ecosystem service and statistical analyses were performed to evaluate whether factors such as gender, age, household income and location explained differences in the parameters. It was found that gender had a significant impact on WTP, with women having higher WTP, and that location had significant impact on WTA. The result shows that WTA increased with increasing distance from the sacred groves (Rs 43,077 ± 21,139 in faraway villages and Rs 35,323 ± 10,483 in core villages). The results indicated that consideration of gender inequality and education status in villages should be included in planning and decision making about participatory forest management of sacred groves. These findings facilitate forest resource management in mountains and provide guidance for programmes and policies dealing with irrigation, drinking water and community development.</jats:p>",

Still, large‐scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few years, sustainable supply chain initiatives (SSCIs) have grabbed attention in the domestic, as well as global, marketplace of the food sector. Nowadays, the success of the entire food supply chain depends on the prosperity of farms, local communities, trader processors, and agro-based industries. Despite its importance, food processing industries (FPIs) are encountering various hurdles in achieving sustainable business goals due to the sheer number of potential barriers. Due to this reason, stakeholders are continuously pressuring the management of FPIs to embrace sustainable food processing activities. In light of this, the present study aims to apply a hybrid fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) framework, based on fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (F-TOPSIS), for analyzing the barriers and prioritizing the possible pathways in adopting the SSCIs for the development of FPIs. Based on the extensive review of literature and panel consultation with experienced experts, a total of seven main barriers, forty-two sub barriers, and five possible pathways as strategic tools were finalized and ranked. An empirical case investigation of a Pakistani-based food processing company has been taken to check the practical application of the proposed framework along with sensitivity analysis. The findings of this study reveal that the lack of sustainable outsourcing factors were found as the top-ranked barrier in implementing SSCIs, and the possible pathway to overcome this barrier is the appropriate management of the procurement cycle. The major contribution of this study is to establish a barriers prioritization framework and suggest possible pathways to overcome these barriers for the successful implementation of SSCIs. Finally, the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications are provided as a way forward for the concerned stakeholders and policymakers.</jats:p>"

In this study, the correlation of molecular weight and fluorescence characteristics was examined and the fouling behavior of NOM was examined in a comprehensive manner through a lot of analysis including redundancy analysis (RDA), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that NOM from Tong Xin river was composed of humic acid (500 Da–8,000 Da), tryptophan-like substance, soluble microbial product (SMP) and aromatic protein (600,000 Da–2,000,000 Da). Notably, UF performance was significantly affected by the humic acid-like substance. Concurrently, the combined mechanism (CM) model was adopted to evaluate the fouling mechanism of NOM. The results indicated that the cake-intermediate model played an important part during membrane fouling and the cake layer fouling had a larger predominance over the intermediate blocking, which can be further proved in the membrane morphology detection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized supply chain management, offering significant potential for optimizing efficiency in the energy sector. The integration of AI-driven technologies into supply chain processes enables predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated decision-making, which contribute to improving operational performance, reducing costs, and enhancing sustainability. This paper explores the role of AI in optimizing supply chains within the energy industry, focusing on key areas such as demand forecasting, inventory management, transportation, and maintenance scheduling. AI-driven algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to predict demand patterns, allowing energy companies to optimize inventory levels and minimize the risks associated with overstocking or stockouts. Furthermore, AI can enhance logistics and transportation efficiency by optimizing routes, reducing fuel consumption, and improving delivery timelines, leading to significant cost savings. AI's impact extends to predictive maintenance, where machine learning models can analyze sensor data to predict equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and maintenance costs. This capability is particularly crucial in the energy sector, where equipment reliability is vital for uninterrupted service delivery. Additionally, AI-driven supply chain optimization promotes sustainability by optimizing energy use, reducing waste, and improving resource management. It enables energy companies to meet regulatory standards, achieve sustainability targets, and enhance corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. In conclusion, AI-driven supply chain optimization offers transformative benefits for the energy sector by enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability. As AI technologies continue to evolve, their application in supply chain management will become increasingly critical for the energy sector’s competitiveness and operational excellence. This paper highlights the need for energy companies to embrace AI technologies to maintain a competitive edge, reduce environmental impact, and improve overall supply chain resilience. The future of supply chain optimization in the energy sector lies in the continued adoption and integration of AI for smarter, more efficient, and sustainable operations.</jats:p>"

Die Rohstoffpolitik sollte sich besser am eigentlich einschränkenden Faktor, der erforderlichen Energie zur Rohstoffbereitstellung, statt an dieser spekulativen Diskussion orientieren. Dazu ist ein Verständnis des energetischen Aufwands und seiner Einflussfaktoren unerlässlich. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein generisches Modell der Kupfergewinnung vorgestellt und der kumulierte Energieaufwand (KEA) sowie das Treibhausgaspotential (GWP) der Primärkupferbereitstellung für Deutschland ermittelt. Der mittels des Modells berechnete KEA beträgt 40 MJ/kg Cu, das GWP 3,3 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-Äq/kg Cu. Eine detaillierte Betrachtung zeigt, dass KEA und GWP des importierten Kupfers abhängig von der Bezugsquelle deutlich variieren. Die Bezugsquelle und die mit ihr einhergehenden geologischen und technischen Parameter stellen somit wichtige Einflussfaktoren hinsichtlich des energetischen Aufwands und der Emission von Treibhausgasen dar. Neben den Bezugsquellen spielt auch die Art des importierten Guts, d. h. Kupferkonzentrat oder Kupferkathode, eine Rolle. Der Transportaufwand ist beim Import von Kupferkonzentrat aufgrund dessen geringen Metallgehalts deutlich höher. Unter gleichen technischen Voraussetzungen ist es daher sinnvoll, dass die metallurgische Behandlung möglichst in der Nähe der Minen stattfindet. Dies gilt es jedoch im Einzelfall und unter Berücksichtigung weiterer z. B. rohstoffpolitischer Aspekte zu prüfen.</jats:p>",

One of the reasons is that there may be inadvertent damage to the arterial blood supply to the humeral head during surgical intervention. The blood supply to the humeral head displays large amounts of variation with regard to origin, course and distribution. Therefore, to shed light on the pathogenesis, the blood supply of the humeral head is reviewed together with a summary of all reported cases of osteonecrosis of the humeral head that occurred following rotator cuff repair. Inconsistencies with regard to terminologies used and contradictions concerning arterial contributions from the anterior circumflex humeral artery and the posterior circumflex humeral artery towards humeral head supply are addressed. Moreover, variations in the course of the anterior circumflex humeral artery and its branches are summarized. The vascular anatomy of the humeral head is clinically relevant due to the close relationship of these blood vessels with the surgical repair sites for rotator cuff surgery and biceps tenotomies or tenodesis procedures. Potential sites of disruption of blood supply following arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery are discussed. Detailed knowledge of the course of the arteries supplying the humeral head may help to minimize the risk of vascular injury and subsequent osteonecrosis. Given the great interindividual variations of vascular anatomy, imaging procedures preceding arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery may be advisable.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to estimate the characteristics of surface runoff based on probabilistic and fuzzy analysis. Separation and generation of basic hydrological information, probabilistic modeling, fuzzy analysis, and optimization to achieve the solution were the main steps of the decision-making problem. Long-term hydrological data of the study area were collected, analyzed and used as a basis for the simulation model. In this study, a copula-based stochastic method was developed to deal with uncertainties related to rainfall and runoff characteristics as well as to address the nonlinear dependence between multiple random variables. The relationship between rainfall variables and flood characteristics was formulated through fuzzy set theory. The feasible domain of the fuzzy problem was searched using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to find the optimal extreme points. The obtained solutions were used as a fuzzy response to calculate the flood of the Baghmalek plain in Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran. The results showed that the maximum model error occurred in predicting rainfall depth and flood volume, and the maximum rainfall rate and runoff flow could be calculated more accurately. Moreover, the developed fuzzy-probabilistic model was able to predict more than 90% of flood events within the defined fuzzy range.</jats:p>",

The key requirement for the quality of cooling water is to ensure normal vacuum in condensers. Cooling water must not form mineral and biological deposits and corrosion products in the system. Deposits of mineral salts in the condenser tube system, as well as in auxiliary cooling systems, lead to deterioration in heat exchange and a major decrease in the cost effectiveness of the power equipment operation, and require the heat-exchange equipment to be periodically cleaned. The source water used for cooling is normally taken from nearby water bodies (large rivers or lakes). Circulating water supply systems are used most commonly: these systems use repeatedly the same water inventory for cooling, and require only small amounts of water added to make up for evaporation losses. Coolers, in this case, are cooling towers, spray pools and evaporation ponds. The water chemistry should ensure the operation of equipment without any damage to its components or the loss of efficiency caused by the corrosion of the internal surfaces as well as without scale and sludge formation. It is exactly when using circulating water supply that a stabilizing treatment program is the most practicable way to ensure a cost-effective and environmentally friendly mode of operation. To inhibit scaling processes on the heat-exchange surfaces of the turbine condenser tubes at the Novovoronezh NPP’s unit 5, the cooling water was treated with the NALCO 1392 inhibitor. The results of the NALCO 1392 inhibitor pilot tests in the circulating water supply system (with a cooling pool) are presented.</jats:p>"

In this regard, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used to evaluate and rate the suppliers. Then, considering the resource constraint, weight of criteria and a rank of suppliers are taken into account in a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) to determine the optimum order quantity of each supplier under uncertain conditions.

This shortfall causes impacts on hydrology, agriculture, and the economy of a country. Secondly, drought/dryness has certain unique characteristics (severity, duration) among natural hazards which makes it difficult to classify the persistent and subjective network of impacts. Drought classification is important for managing drought, allowing both quantitative evaluation and potential risk assessment planning. The simpler approach of drought indices has made it easier for various researchers and organizations to classify drought. Several drought indices have been proposed at the national and global level to characterize hydrological, meteorological and agricultural droughts. Until now, there has been no widely agreed drought index among researchers. Therefore, researchers are trying to modify and reconstruct a simple, complete, and robust drought index for effective use and planning of the management of water resources. Due to the complex terrestrial ecosystem, researchers have integrated multiple drought indices for evaluation and monitoring of regional drought conditions. The reviewed composite or aggregated indices revealed that researchers are mainly focused on regional climatic and environmental conditions, and differences of theoretical backgrounds while integrating a drought index. There is a lack of performance evaluation of these indices because usually the comparative analysis between the integrated index and earlier developed composite indices is not performed. Secondly, the developer researchers did not mention limitations such as data, which is considered a paramount issue while applying these indices in other regions. Therefore, there is still comprehensive work needed for the simple integration of drought indices for general applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The supply management literature assumes that supplier selection is devoid of emotions and unaffected by the history and experience associated with a previously‐selected supplier. In this paper, we relax these assumptions. Specifically, we consider the following sourcing opportunity: a sourcing professional had (alternatively, had not) recommended a critical‐component supplier that originated an avoidable (alternatively, unavoidable) supply disruption (aka, the “disrupted supplier”). In the aftermath of this supply disruption, the sourcing professional is asked to recommend a supplier for a new‐to‐beoutsourced critical component (i.e., one unrelated to the component whose flow was interrupted), taking into consideration the influence of guilt as an emotional reaction to the supply disruption. Analyses of data from 286 sourcing professionals participating in a scenario‐based, roleplaying experiment reveal that sourcing professionals experience higher levels of guilt when (a) they (versus their predecessor) had been responsible for selecting a disrupted supplier and (b) they deem the supply disruption to be controllable (versus uncontrollable) by the disrupted supplier. Guilt‐laden sourcing professionals are then more likely to recommend a riskier albeit more advantageous supplier for a new‐to‐be‐outsourced critical component. Our results provide the first evidence that prior supplier selection decisions gone awry influence future supplier selection decisions through the emotion of guilt. Moreover, they demonstrate that supply disruptions in one context have carryover effects on future sourcing decisions in unrelated contexts—an insight that is absent from the literature on supply disruptions.</jats:p>",

Considering the rapidly aging population in South Korea, it is important to establish whether the current ICU bed availability meets its demand. Methods: We evaluated the 9-year trend in ICU bed rates and bed-days in South Korea between 2011 and 2019 in a population-based cross-sectional analysis, using data from the Korean Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service and Statistics database. We described changes in ICU bed rates in adult (≥ 20 years) and older adult (≥ 65 years) populations. ICU bed-days were categorized similarly and were used to predict future ICU bed demands. Results: The ICU bed rate was higher in 2011 than 2019 (23.3 and 20.2 per 100,000 adults; 161.2 and 107.5 per 100,000 older adults, respectively). Conversely, the number of ICU bed-days was lower in 2011 than 2019 (100.5 and 137.8 per 1,000 adults; 59.0 and 86.1 per 1,000 older adults, respectively). In 2019, the regional differences in the ICU bed rate and ICU bed-days nearly doubled and tripled, respectively. The occupancy rate of ICU beds in South Korea is expected to rise to 97.7% in 2030. Conclusions: Our study revealed a significant discrepancy between the demand and supply of ICU beds in South Korea, necessitating significant action.</jats:p>"

The data used in this research collected from both primary and secondary sources. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics, where simple percentages and tables used. The data analysis revealed that 57.4% of the residents in the study area patronized the services of water vendors.     Patronage of vendor service dominated the frequency with 64.9% of respondent’s patronage of vended water. Seasonal variation in vended water supply patterns exist in the study area, with dry season account for the highest water demand and most supplies occurred during morning and evening hours.

A description of the models of this plant, predictive controllers and energy storage, as well as the results of modeling when the system goes into an isolated mode of operation are given. Simulation was performed in MATLAB environment using Simulink and SimPowerSystems packages. The purpose of the work was to study the behavior of the proposed predictive controllers during the transition of the power supply system to the island (isolated) mode. Based on the results of computer simulation, it was concluded that the use of predictive controllers improves the damping properties of the system. The use of an energy storage device that is automatically connected to the network when the voltage drops, allows to reduce the overvoltage at the terminals of the generator during its unloading, as well as to reduce the required mechanical power on the turbine shaft in comparison with a permanently connected device. Predictive controllers can be recommended to increase the stability of distributed generation plants when switching to an isolated mode. It is advisable to conduct further research in the direction of creating algorithms for coordinated operation of controllers</jats:p>",

Both increasing the BAP doses and number of applications led to an unusual response: an excessive decrease in the frond plastochron and a significant increase in the frond number initiated at the apical shoot meristem. This large frond number was not sustained due to the low net photosynthetic rate of the younger fronds and significantly limited outward appearance.</jats:p>"

To study the amino acid composition in the tops of alfalfa under different water supply (60 % MVC (maximum water capacity) and 30 % MVC) depending on the inoculum strain (Sinorhizobium meliloti 425a, T17, AC08). Methods. Microbiological (bacterial cultivation), physiological (vegetation experiment), biochemical (determination of amino acid content in the tops of plants). Results. It was established that the qualitative amino acid composition in the tops of ALFALFA was identical in all variants. However, quantitative content of the studied samples differed depending on the inoculum strain and water supply. It was found that aspartic and glutamic acids, leucine and lysine are dominant in the tops of alfalfa under different water supply. In the absence of moisture, an increase in the content of individual amino acids was reported at the background of Sinorhizobium meliloti AC08 and T17, while inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti 425a resulted in a decrease in the content of all amino acids except tyrosine. In plants exposed to water stress, a tendency towards decrease in the content of glutamic acid at the background of bacterization with Sinorhizobium meliloti 425a and increase — under inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti T17 and AC08 was reported, which may support the use of the latter to increase the ability of symbiotic systems to recover during a post-stress period. Conclusion. Pre-sowing inoculation of alfalfa of the variety Laska with new active strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti AC08 and T17 helps to increase the content of amino acids, in particular essential, in the tops of plants, both under optimal conditions of moisture and insufficient water supply. The prospects of using new strains of rhizobia in the cultivation of alfalfa for green mass under the conditions of optimal water supply and drought has been verified.</jats:p>"

However, we find support to be highly malleable by framing: it increases when respondents are primed to think of the policy as a way of protecting farmers and decreases when they are primed to think of its costs to consumers. Contrary to expectations, framing effects are not stronger when messages are ideologically congenial or among those with high levels of policy knowledge.

Firstly, the change rule of pump flow rate and rotation speed under transient solar radiation was obtained by Simulink. Then the results of the change rule were transformed into the boundary condition of CFD by CEL function and the transient flow field in the photovoltaic pump was obtained. The internal flow characteristics and pressure pulsation in the pump were analyzed when the solar radiation increases or decreases transiently. The results demonstrate that the numerical calculation can provide accurate prediction for the characteristics of internal flow in the pump. The numerical results are closed to the experimental results, the minimum error of pressure is 0.93% and the maximum error is 1.78%. When the solar radiation increases transiently, the low pressure area at the impeller inlet gets larger obviously and the jet-wake at the impeller outlet becomes more obvious. The pressure pulsation in the impeller gradually increases and becomes stable after 0.6 s. The pressure from the impeller outlet to the guide vane outlet is stable at 123 kPa. When the solar radiation decreases transiently, the pressure in the impeller takes 1.6 s to be stable. Larger pressure pulsation occurs from the impeller outlet to the guide vane inlet and the maximum differential pressure is 10 kPa. Compared with the transient increase of solar radiation, the pressure in the impeller takes over 0.2 s to stabilize when the solar radiation transient decreases. Meanwhile, the results in this paper can provide references for other transient characteristics research.</jats:p>",

Additionally, “green buildings” play a special role in reducing energy consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions in the building sector. This research article analyzes the performance of alternative primary energy sources (sun and hydrogen) integrated into a hybrid photovoltaic panel/fuel cell system, and their optimal synergy to provide green energy for a green building. The study addresses the future hydrogen-based economy, which involves the supply of hydrogen as the fuel needed to provide fuel cell energy through a power distribution infrastructure. The objective of this research is to use fuel cells in this field and to investigate their use as a green building energy supply through a hybrid electricity generation system, which also uses photovoltaic panels to convert solar energy. The fuel cell hydrogen is supplied through a distribution network in which hydrogen production is outsourced and independent of the power generation system. The case study creates virtual operating conditions for this type of hybrid energy system and simulates its operation over a one-year period. The goal is to demonstrate the role and utility of fuel cells in virtual conditions by analyzing energy and economic performance indicators, as well as carbon dioxide emissions. The case study analyzes the optimal synergy between photovoltaic panels and fuel cells for the power supply of a green building. In the simulation, an optimally configured hybrid system supplies 100% of the energy to the green building while generating carbon dioxide emissions equal to 11.72% of the average value calculated for a conventional energy system providing similar energy to a standard residential building. Photovoltaic panels account for 32% of the required annual electricity production, and the fuel cells generate 68% of the total annual energy output of the system.</jats:p>"

A prerequisite for the operation of hydrogen-fired gas turbines is the availability of sufficient quantities of hydrogen. The combination of electrolysis and renewable power generation is currently considered the most relevant pathway for the large-scale production of CO2-neutral hydrogen. Regarding the fuel supply of hydrogen-fired gas turbines, this pathway is associated with various technical and economic challenges. This applies in particular to configurations in which electrolyzers and hydrogen storage capacities are installed directly at gas turbine sites to avoid hydrogen transport. Considering an exemplary system configuration, the present study extends prior model-based investigations by focusing on the economic viability of the on-site fuel supply of hydrogen-fired gas turbines. The impact of various design parameters and operational strategies is analyzed using the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen as the main economic indicator. The study reveals that the investigated on-site hydrogen production is not economically viable within the current (2019) framework of the German energy sector. Assuming the extensive availability of renewable power generation in the long-term, additional investigations indicate that on-site hydrogen production and storage systems for gas turbines could potentially become economically viable if various advantageous conditions are met. These conditions include a sufficient availability of inexpensive renewable power for the operation of electrolyzers as well as a sufficient utilization of on-site hydrogen storage capacities to justify corresponding capital expenditures.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the performance of four RO plants of Bharatpur, which face frequent replacement of membrane modules primarily due to accelerated scaling of carbonates and sulphates of calcium. A detailed chemical analysis of different streams from these plants was carried out to assess the reasons of scaling through a mass balance approach. The chemical analysis was substantiated through ion balance and the scaling potentials were analysed through different saturation indices. Efficacy of antiscalant usage plants was further assessed through mass balance approach followed by detailed characterization of the RO membrane to understand the complete fouling process, which brought out subtle differences in brackish and seawater desalination. The membranes adopting commonly used antiscalant showed an enhanced life span of 2–2.5 year by reducing calcium carbonate scaling but not calcium sulphate scaling. This study highlights the requirement of customized antiscalant application according to the feed characteristics. With a better understanding of the fouling phenomenon, this study would help enhance the life of membrane in RO plants treating brackish water.</jats:p>",

This study proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming model for an integrated green closed-loop supply chain network designed to maximize profit, amicable production level (environmentally friendly materials and clean technology usage), and quality level. A scenario-based robust optimization method is used to deal with uncertain parameters such as the demand of new products, the return rates of returned products and the sale prices of remanufactured products. The proposed model is applied to a real industry case example of a manufacturing company to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. The result shows a robust optimal resource allocation solution that considers multiple scenarios.

Currently, there are no widely available technologies and equipment available at service stations and repair facilities to accurately assess the technical condition of Common Rail battery fuel supply system injectors. The methods implemented in practice mainly give a generalized assessment of the nozzle performance without identifying a specific defect, which entails an unjustified replacement of still working parts of electrically controlled injectors. The purpose of this article is to familiarize a wide range of specialists with a new non-slip test method for injectors with electronic control based on the evaluation of their fuel supply characteristics, which allows identifying specific malfunctions of the nozzle during the procedure of diagnostic without disassembling.\nMaterials and Methods. The study is based on a systematic analysis of the factory methods for testing injectors, a review of modern scientific publications, the use of computer simulation in specialized programs, and experimental testing of the obtained results.\nResults. A method for testing and evaluating the technical condition of diesel injectors based on the fuel supply characteristics has been developed and tested that can significantly increase the information content of the diagnostic and reduce the overall labor intensity of repairing electronically controlled injectors by 24%.\nDiscussion and Conclusion. The authors have developed and tested a measurement module and a test procedure for diesel injectors with the ability to assess the technical condition of their parts, which allows identifying and eliminating specific malfunctions of injectors without disassembling them and avoid unjustified replacement of serviceable elements during repair. The results of the study have been implemented in the Bosch Diesel Service fuel equipment repair center of Bashdiesel LLC.</jats:p>",

The operating parameters included the rotational speed of shaft (N), submergence depth (h), and propeller angle (α). The response surface methodology (RSM) and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used for modelling and optimizing the standard aeration efficiency (SAE) of a PDA system. The results of both approaches were compared for their modelling abilities in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), computed from experimental and predicted data. ANN models were proved to be superior to RSM. The results indicate that for achieving the maximum standard aeration efficiency (SAE), N, h and α should be 1,000 rpm, 0.50 m, and 12°, respectively. The maximum SAE was found to be 1.711 kg O2/ kWh. Cross-validation results show that best approximation of the optimal values of input parameters for maximizing SAE is possible with a maximum deviation (absolute error) of ±15.2% between the model predicted and experimental values.</jats:p>",

But in literature, limited engagement has been given to explore the CE initiatives, particularly in the agri‐food supply chain (AFSC). This paper aims to address this gap by critically reviewing the existing literature and identify the drivers and barriers for implementing the CE in the AFSC. This study uses a systematic literature review approach to critically analyse the current literature to develop future empirical research areas. The popularity of the CE drivers and barriers in the AFSC following the number of times they appeared in the research studies is examined. It shows that environmental (67%), policy and economy (47%), and financial benefits (43%) are the three top drivers. However, institutional (64%), financial (48%), and technological risks (40%) are the top three barriers in implementing CE practices in the AFSC. It is observed that there is an utmost need for international communities to introduce internationally accepted standards and frameworks for CE practices to be used globally to eliminate waste, particularly in the agriculture sector. Moreover, government intervention to stimulate CE initiatives plays a critical role in the transition process.</jats:p>",

We find that these supply networks are an aggregate of predominantly illicit—yet legitimate—channels and social relationships that support the economic exchange of goods and services between distinct actors or actor groups. We not only identify the cultural conventions and behavioral codes that govern ties between refugees—and between refugees and relief‐related actors—but also define how these networks are configured. Considering these findings, we contend that the informal economic activities emanating from the refugee camp benefit the host community and enhance the resilience of the informal supply networks. As informal economic activities also improve the quality of life in the camp, camp authorities and host country governments should attend to informal activities as they create rules and policies for refugee resettlement.</jats:p>",

On a larger scale, the peculiar yield trend will fluctuate oil palm supply and thus impact the crude palm oil (CPO) price. This study was aimed to assess the impact of climate change on palm oil price dynamics and to anticipate its adverse effect faced by the vulnerable smallholder in Indonesia. The system of equations was estimated by employing simultaneous equation model. The simulations were set to generate the forecasts from 2018 to 2050 using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. A time series data ranging from 1980 to 2018 of CPO yield, oil palm mature areas, stock changes, export, as well as monthly rainfall rate were taken into account. The simulation revealed that the climate change in terms of fluctuating rainfall would cause unfavourable palm oil price level that eventually would exacerbate smallholder welfare.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The benefits provided by a model of system dynamics are directly related to its correct construction. One of the main challenges in the process of building such models is that they must be able to effectively represent a specific problematic situation. Thus, the main objective of this study is to develop a multi-methodological approach, adapting the problem structuring method of strategic options development and analysis (SODA) in the initial stage of the system dynamics (SD) model. The role of each of them clearly represents the contribution of this study: the SODA in the structuring (representation) phase of the problem and proposition of alternatives and the SD in the evaluation phase of these alternatives. To illustrate its application, the multimethodological approach developed was used to simulate scenarios considering management strategies, and the various variables affecting a water supply system, including population growth, in order to evaluate more “assertive” water management strategy(s) that could have been adopted to address the water crisis (2012–2017) and analysis future scenarios. The results show that, based on the vision of specialists with enough experience for the case studied, it was possible to structure the problem, and therefore propose a set of strategies (alternatives), which were: water loss control, wastewater reuse, application of more efficient tariffs to reduce water waste, inter-basin water transfer, and awareness regarding the use of water resources. After the survey of alternatives, scenarios were simulated considering these water management strategies. Simulation results showed that actions taken on the demand side would only be effective for a short period of water scarcity, (for example, the impact of the scarcity-based tariff on water consumption reduction). For severe drought scenarios and with a water producing system heavily dependent on rainfall, such action would no longer be efficient. However, water supply management-oriented strategies, e.g., inter-basin water transfers (PISF) and wastewater reuse, are highly effective in securing water supply and preventing water supply collapse in the region. The development of this multi-methodological approach is expected to be useful to support managers in the decision-making and implementation of water management strategies.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the role of a managerâ€™s social commitment in achieving an organizationâ€™s social performance. A model with four constructs was developed to study the impact of the managerâ€™s social commitment on social outcomes. Research was carried out on Pakistani firms through a survey-based questionnaire. From a total of 360 respondents (managers of Pakistani organizations) identified initially, 158 sent their responses after repeated follow-ups. Structural Equation Modeling was used for data analysis. The results show that socially committed managers play a significant role in achieving organizationâ€™s social performance. Furthermore, implementing social sustainable supply chain practices mediates the relationship between managerâ€™s social commitment and organizationâ€™s social performance. This study shows that an organizationâ€™s culture promotes the implementation of social practices and helps managers adopt social responsive activities and achieve social outcomes. Additionally, this study along with theoretical support to understand the managerâ€™s role in changing the business environment to resolve emerging social issues and improve the firmâ€™s reputation, also provides empirical evidence from a developing countryâ€™s perspective, supported by the significant results.</jats:p>"

Within the textile industry, the circular economy (CE) obstacles adopted have been studied by several scholars. However, the interrelationships among these obstacles are easily ignored. The present study aimed to identify CE adoption obstacles from the supply chain (SC) perspective in Taiwan’s textile sector by analyzing the interrelationships among the CE adoption obstacles and establishing a hierarchical network and the causal inter relationships of the identified obstacles. Furthermore, the CE adoption obstacles and interrelationships were analyzed using interpretative structural modeling and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (ISM-DEMATEL). The common results of the two methods demonstrated that two obstacles, consumers not having sufficient knowledge and awareness of reuse/recycling (B1) and a lack of successful business models and frameworks for CE implementation (B3), were the significant obstacles influencing adopting CE in the textile supply chain, while the obstacle making the most efficient way (B12) of the right decision to implement CE was minor. Thus, the government should formulate friendly laws and regulations that encourage CE adoption, while textile firms should monitor and control recycling and efficiency approaches handling the CE adoption problems. Our results could offer first-hand knowledge to textile firms or managers to effetely achieve CE implementation objectives.</jats:p>"

A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select 808 supply chain actors comprising of 301 producers, 105 wholesalers, 252 retailers and 150 consumers. Data were collected through the use of a structured questionnaire. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, percentage, mean, minimum, maximum standard deviations and graph. Comparing among the supply chain actors for modes of transportation, the result reveals that most (25.23% 23.63% and 29.96%) of the producers, wholesalers and retailers used busses, lorry, pickups and cars, respectively, for their transportation, while half (50%) of the consumers used tricycle for transportation. Also, the result shows that majority (47.16%, 47.09% and 57.27%) of the producers, wholesalers and retailers, respectively, depended on personal savings as their source of capital. The result reveals that 75.38% of fresh tomato consumers obtained information from marketers. Producers (34.88%) obtained their information from fellow farmers, while 31.16% and 38.71% of the wholesalers and retailers obtained information from fellow marketers. The result also reveals that producers, wholesalers and retailers collectively agreed that high temperature with mean of 3.00, 3.00 and 2.92 was a real cause of fresh tomato loss. Further, the result shows that, of the quantities of 524.82, 162.52 and 22 produced and purchased by producers, wholesalers and retailers, 15.39%, 12.72% and 8.69% were lost. The result reveals that producers, wholesalers and retailers collectively agreed that high temperature with mean of 3.00, 3.00 and 2.92 was a real cause of fresh tomato loss. It was concluded that high temperature, lack of ready market, disease, storage facilities and car brake-down contributed significantly to fresh tomato losses among the supply chain actors. The study recommended that large cold storage facility can be made available, to reduce fresh tomato losses.</jats:p>"

This review identified 64 articles of 4863 candidate articles obtained from four Boolean search queries in six databases. Included studies examined naturally detected/isolated Listeria species and L. monocytogenes in fresh produce-related environments, and/or from past fresh produce associated outbreaks or from produce directly. Listeria species and L. monocytogenes were detected in each stage of the fresh produce supply chain. The greatest prevalence of Listeria species was observed in natural environments and outdoor production, with prevalence generally decreasing with each progression of the supply chain (e.g., packinghouse to distribution to retail). L. monocytogenes prevalence ranged from 61.1% to not detected (0.00%) across the entire supply chain for included studies. Listeria persistence and diversity were also investigated more in natural, production, and processing environments, compared to other supply chain environments (e.g., retail). Data gaps were identified for future produce safety research, for example, in the transportation and distribution center environment.</jats:p>"

For the Jatibarang WTP to be absorbed according to schedule, it is necessary to divert the existing water supply to other service areas that need and are not included in the Jatibarang WTP service area. This study aims to comprehensively study the most likely directions for transferring water supplies to areas that currently require additional supply with the transfer system. The research method uses hydraulic analysis of the piping network using the Epanet 2.0 program. The analysis results will be displayed in pipe diameter, flow velocity and pressure at each junction point. The results obtained are the diversion of the existing water supply to another area outside of Jatibarang WTP. The result to be achieved from this research is an increase in the capacity and service coverage of Tirta Moedal Regional Drinking Water Company in the North Branch.</jats:p>",

Terminals that handle dry bulk cargoes which have low unit prices and high elasticity to transportation prices, and general cargoes that require different planning and management for almost each operation have significant roles in the chain as well. This study aims to determine and evaluate the role of dry bulk and general cargo terminals in the supply chain with the value-added logistic services by focusing on Aliağa Region. Delphi technique has been employed to shed light on the role of the dry bulk and general cargo terminals and manufacturers in the scope of supply-chain and logistics-based components. Findings indicate that service effectiveness is important as well as operational efficiency in such terminals and service characteristics should be improved to become more supply-chain oriented.

This paper aims to examine the factors influencing the intention of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in India to adopt blockchain technology in their supply chains. A questionnaire-based survey was used to collect data from 216 SMEs in the northern states of India. The study has considered an integrated technology adoption framework consisting of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE). Using this integrated TAM-TOE-DOI framework, the study has proposed eleven hypotheses related to factors of blockchain technology adoption. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) have been used to test the hypotheses. The results show that relative advantage, technology compatibility, technology readiness, top management support, perceived usefulness, and vendor support have a positive influence on the intention of Indian SMEs to adopt blockchain technology in their supply chains. The complexity of technology and cost concerns act as inhibitors to the technology adoption by SMEs. Furthermore, the three factors, namely, security concerns, perceived ease of use, and regulatory support, do not influence the intention to adopt the technology. The study contributes to filling a significant gap in the academic literature since only a few studies have endeavored to ascertain the technology adoption factors by supply chains of SMEs in a developing country like India. The study has also proposed a novel integrated technology adoption framework that can be employed by future studies. The findings are expected to enable SMEs to understand important factors to be considered for adopting blockchain technology in their supply chains. Furthermore, the study may benefit the blockchain technology developers and suppliers as they can offer customized solutions based on the findings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Revenue distribution is an important issue in the operations of a logistics service supply chain (LSSC). The existing works on revenue distribution are mostly based on the assumption of rational economic people that are purely self-interested. However, people also have a fairness preference, which impacts people’s decision-making behavior or even the success operations of the LSSC. For a two-level supply chain consisting of logistics service integrator (LSI) and several functional logistics service providers (FLSP), this paper establishes an improved revenue distribution model considering FLSPs’ inequity aversion. Specifically, the BO model (abbreviation of a model proposed by Bolton and Ockenfels in 2000) is improved to describe the FLSPs’ inequity aversion, which is combined into the conventional revenue distribution model. The proposed model aims to maximize the revenue of logistics service supply chain and obtains the best revenue distribution ratio of each member under equilibrium. In the numerical cases, the impacts of inequity aversion and the number of members with inequity aversion on the revenue distribution are discussed, respectively. The results show that a higher degree of FLSP’s advantageous inequity aversion corresponds to a lower revenue distribution ratio; a higher degree of FLSP’s disadvantageous inequity aversion corresponds to a higher revenue distribution ratio. Increasing the number of FLSP members with inequity aversion results in a higher profit of LSI and lower total utility of FLSPs and the utility of the supply chain. The more FLSP members with inequity aversion there are, the higher the LSI’s profit is, and the lower the total utility of FLSPs and the utility of supply chain are. In addition, the revenue distribution ratio of the FLSP increases with its relative fairness revenue coefficient among FLSPs.</jats:p>"

Combining variational inequality theory (VI) with complementary theory, we first characterize the optimal conditions for members in each tier first, and then derive that of the entire CLSCN. In addition, we focus on the effects of carbon caps and EOL collection rate target on CLSCN performances with numerical examples. The results reveal that, in some cases, there is a consistency between carbon emission reduction target of the government and the profit target of enterprises. The government should choose reasonable and moderate carbon caps for all the enterprises to balance the CLSCN members’ economic interests, carbon emissions, as well as resources utilization rate. Moreover, the government should not blindly pursue a high collection rate target. The above conclusions can provide practical guidance for governments and enterprises in a CLSCN under CAT regulation.</jats:p>"

The first fistula was supplied by the ASA with additional supply by the dilated PSA connecting with the ASA. Another fistula was supplied by the LSA and the PSA communicating with the ASA. The first case was successfully treated by endovascular treatment with N-butyl cyanoacrylate through the enlarged PSA, whereas the second case was surgically treated by direct obliteration of the fistula. Both patients had good neurological outcome.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Recent global climate change and vegetation greening have important implications to Earth’s global biogeochemical cycles and climate, raising concern about the water supply of water diversion projects. To quantify how such a greening trend impacts local water balance and the capacity of water supply, we built a hybrid model based on the Coupled Carbon and Water (CCW) and Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) models. We conducted a case study using the Upper Han River basin (UHRB) in southern China that serves as the water source area to the middle route of the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). Significant vegetation greening occurred in the UHRB during 2001–2018, with the normalized difference vegetation index increasing at a rate of 0.5 % yr−1 (p &lt; 0.01) but no significant trends in climate during the same period (albeit with high interannual climate variability). Annual water yield (WY) greatly decreased during this period, and vegetation greening alone induced a significant WY decrease of 3.5 mm yr−1 (p &lt; 0.01). Vegetation greening could potentially reduce the annual water supply by 7.3 km3 on average, accounting for 77 % of the intended annual water diversion volume of SNWDP. Vegetation greening could also increase the possibility of hydrological drought and reduce about a quarter of WY on average during drought periods. In the future, water supply capacity is likely to decline further as vegetation greening continues along with increasing temperature and vapor pressure deficit. Our findings demonstrate the large effects of vegetation greening on water balance and hydrological drought, which have important implications for management of water resources in long-range water diversion projects.\n                        </jats:p>"

Therefore; searching for solutions to restricting or surmounting these effects such as finding clean renewable sources of power have become inevitable. Among those renewable sources which are environmentally friendly and of middle cost is the solar power that includes solar heater and solar cells boards. Using 100.000 solar heaters saves (324.800 Megawatt hour) within one year, while using 100.000 solar cells system with an energy of (1000 watt) saves (438.000 Megawatt hour) within one year. Other means of reducing the effects of using fossil fuel is spreading the culture of power rationing and avoiding the waste and excessive consumption through cooperation with educational institutions by setting special programs such as courses, symposiums, posters and setting out a day for power consumption rationing. Turning off 10% of sets operation time in 1.000.000 house would save more than (2.076.120 megawatt hour) per annum.</jats:p>"

В целях совершенствования организационно-экономических механизмов функционирования региональной системы нефтепродуктообеспечения Республики Саха (Якутия) предложена разработка практического инструментария, учитывающего вариативность схем завоза топлива, использование нескольких видов транспорта, пункты хранения и перевалки и сезонный характер работы транспортного комплекса.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The article discusses the main aspects of the formation and functioning of systems for the supply of oil products to the northern regions. The relevance of the problem of fuel and energy supply of the northern regions is dictated by the special natural and climatic conditions, their historically established territorial production specialization and the need for annual self-sufficiency in petroleum products due to their import from other constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Potential interruptions in the supply of petroleum products for remote areas of the northern regions can lead to extremely strong threats to energy security and risks associated with deteriorated living standards of the population. The purpose of this work is to analyze the processes and features of the functioning of the regional structure of oil product supply in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). Two groups of organizational factors have been identified that affect the efficiency of uninterrupted and timely delivery of oil products to hard-to-reach territories of the northern regions. The analysis of the current state and the main components of the regional structure of oil product supply in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) in conditions of low transport accessibility. The contribution of the transport factor to the process of supplying fuel and energy resources to the territories of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) are considered with the allocation of the ensuing economic effects in the management of regional enterprises of oil products supply. We also indicated directions for solving priority tasks to increase the stability and economic efficiency of the delivery of petroleum products in the region. In order to improve the organizational and economic mechanisms of the functioning of the regional structure of oil product supply in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), it is proposed to develop practical tools that take into account various supply schemes and options for fuel delivery, the use of several types of transport, storage and transshipment points, and the seasonal nature of the transport complex. Keywords: regional and sectoral economics, oil product supply, fuel and energy resources, transport system, delivery of goods, northern delivery, fuel supply.</jats:p>",

The managerial and designer of supply chain network design (SCND) have to plan to apply RE in pillars of supply chain (SC). This research indicates resilience and sustainable SCND by considering RE (RSSCNDRE) for the first time. A two‐stage new robust stochastic optimization is embedded for RSSCNDRE. The first stage locates facility location and RE and the second stage defines flow quantity between SC components. We solve the model by GAMS‐CPLEX solver to locate components of SC and RE. Effects of changing conservative coefficient and demand are investigated and by increasing 20% for conservative coefficient, the cost function increase by 0.5%. Also, when demand is high, activating RE is economically feasible and we cannot buy and supply energy by the government power network and have to supply energy by RE. After activating RE, by increasing 20% for demand, the cost function increases by 6%. We contribute fix‐and‐optimize strategy to define the upper bound for a large‐scale problem. The proposed upper bound for the main model is less than 10% and appropriate for estimating the cost of large‐scale problems. This research suggested to equip SC by RE that SC becomes resilient against demand fluctuation and sustainable energy resource compatible with sustainable development goal (SGD7).</jats:p>",

This work has focused on determining the effect of conduit cross-section geometry on the air-demand ratio. A series of experiments were carried out on high-head radial gated conduits having different cross-section geometries. Experimental results showed that conduit cross-section geometry had an important effect on the air demand ratio especially in small gate opening rates. Further, design equations for the air demand ratio are presented relating the air demand ratio to Froude number, gate opening rate, and the ratio of gate opening to conduit length.</jats:p>",

These disruptions significantly impact the consumer demands, which in turn affect the capacity and profitability of a supply chain network. Economic survivability is the ability to maintain a net positive economic worth, or at least keeping it above a certain threshold, in the presence of sudden and prolonged disruptions that drastically reduce the product demands, prices, resource availability, or others. We address the economic survivability of geographically distributed interconnected networks under demand disruptions. We formulate and incorporate the necessary conditions for ensuring economic survivability in supply chain design. The overall problem is formulated as a mixed‐integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Increasing the economic survivability in general also increases the return‐on‐investment (ROI) and profitability. However, for multi‐regional, distributed and interdependent supply chains, a more balanced distribution of investment portfolio is important to improve the local survivability of each region, but it comes at the expense of overall or global profitability. We also observe that the economic survivability is negatively impacted by over‐designing a supply chain to meet excess demands (typically from spot markets). Decision‐makers should balance the trade‐offs between survivability and excess demand satisfaction by thoroughly assessing the probability of positive and negative demand fluctuations.</jats:p>",

However, so far nutrient‐utilization efficiencies could not be enhanced when control and PAC‐treated maize plants received the same amount of fertilizers. With adjusted fertilizer supply according to the lower requirement of the smaller, PAC‐treated plants, an improvement of nutrient‐utilization efficiencies may be expected. Thus, in the present study, PAC was applied at growth stage V5 to two maize cultivars (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L. cvs. Galactus and Fabregas) grown in a container experiment. Shortly after PAC application, differential NPK fertilization was introduced in order to obtain a nutrient supply according to the requirement of control plants (100% NPK), the requirement of PAC‐treated plants (85% NPK) and a further slight decrease (78% NPK). Plant height and transpiration rates were significantly reduced due to PAC treatment with stronger effects on Galactus than on Fabregas. Pollen shed, silking and the anthesis‐silking interval (ASI) were unaffected by PAC application and fertilizer supply. Senescence of PAC‐treated plants was delayed, whereas it was accelerated with reduced fertilizer supply. The grain yield of cultivar Galactus was significantly decreased due to PAC application by 13% to 20%, and this effect was strengthened due to reduction in NPK supply. These grain yield reductions were solely caused by decreases in kernel number, which were closely linked to reductions in cob length. On the contrary, PAC treatment did not affect grain yield of Fabregas and reductions due to less NPK supply were small. Harvest index and water‐use efficiency were enhanced by PAC treatment. Plant nutrient contents were similar for control and PAC‐treated plants, but strongly related to fertilizer supply with significant decreases due to reductions in NPK application. The N‐, P‐ and K‐utilization efficiencies of both cultivars were either decreased or unaffected by PAC treatments. The key constraint for improvements of nutrient‐utilization efficiencies is grain yield reduction due to PAC. This problem should be addressed in further studies with avoidance of grain yield decreases by delayed application time combined with fine‐tuning of cultivar‐specific PAC application rates.</jats:p>",

We find that irrespective of the status of horizontal information sharing, vertical sharing always hurts the manufacturer, and sharing information horizontally is a dominating strategy for each manufacturer when the competition intensity is small. Furthermore, when competition intensity is not extremely large, full transparency can be realized through some transfer from the suppliers to the manufacturers, achieving a Pareto improvement for all parties, because the vertical and horizontal sharing are complementary to increase the supplier's benefit.

However, recently, it was argued that carboxylate release may be a way to discharge surplus carbon produced under conditions that limit plant growth. Plant P status may not be the main factor driving carboxylate release by roots. Instead, plant nitrogen (N) status and/or N:P ratio of the soil or plant may play a more important role in enhancing carboxylate release.\nMethods\n A greenhouse pot experiment was performed to grow alfalfa in a P-deficient soil, supplied with two rates of P (0 and 20 mg kg<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>) in combination with four forms of nitrogen (N) at five rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg kg<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>), to explore the effects of P rate, N form, N rate, and their interactions on plant growth, P and N status, and carboxylate release, and to determine the factors driving carboxylate release.\nResults\n Nitrogen addition weakened the positive effect of P addition on plant growth, and increased plant N ([N]) and P concentrations ([P]); P addition increased plant [P], but weakened the effect of N addition on plant [N]. The amount of tartrate increased dramatically with increasing N rate, which decreased shoot growth, depending on N form.

We build a three-level game between customers, shipping companies and the retailer. The equilibrium market structure is determined. The optimal volume–investment ratio for each shipping company is the same for both centralized and decentralized supply chains, and it is dependent on the delivery time function, independent of competitors’ decisions. The efficiency loss of the decentralized supply chain with one retailer and one shipping company is found to be 1/4, independent of the delivery time function and the demand function. The loss is reduced when competition is introduced into shipping companies and an upper bound of efficiency loss with multiple homogeneous shipping companies is derived. Revenue-sharing contracts may be designed to allow the decentralized supply chain to perform as well as a centralized one. The necessity of coordination is reduced when competition is introduced and the number of competitive companies increases. Finally, we extend the model to consider heterogeneous shipping companies and find that the disparity between shipping companies increases the efficiency loss because in the decentralized supply chain less efficient shipping companies also provide service. This research explicates the relationship options between e-commerce retailers and shipping companies, providing managerial insights for industry practitioners. </jats:p>",

An extensive review of literature, and unstructured interviews with industry personnel were conducted to identify the risk factors. Then, a questionnaire was distributed among the industry personnel to rank the identified risk factors based on a Likert type scale. Risk matrix analysis was employed to assess the risk factors. Five critical risk factors were identified related to quality control, communication, timing of product delivery, inventory, and lack of technology which demands immediate mitigation strategies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s complex and ever-changing world, concerns about the lack of enough data have been replaced by concerns about too much data for supply chain management (SCM). The volume of data generated from all parts of the supply chain has changed the nature of SCM analysis. By increasing the volume of data, the efficiency and effectiveness of the traditional methods have decreased. Limitations of these methods in analyzing and interpreting a large amount of data have led scholars to generate some methods that have high capability to analyze and interpret big data. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to identify the applications of machine learning (ML) in SCM as one of the most well-known artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By developing a conceptual framework, this paper identifies the contributions of ML techniques in selecting and segmenting suppliers, predicting supply chain risks, and estimating demand and sales, production, inventory management, transportation and distribution, sustainable development (SD), and circular economy (CE). Finally, the implications of the study on the main limitations and challenges are discussed, and then managerial insights and future research directions are given.</jats:p>",

Rainwater pH, major ions and trace metals were measured in samples collected from five different locations with different land-use patterns of the Chattogram Metropolitan area (CMA) during two rainy seasons. The results of this study showed variability in rainwater quality across the sites signifying site-specific influences. The mean concentration of all measured physicochemical parameters, ions and trace metals in rainwater samples was also found to be significantly lower compared with the drinking water quality standard of Bangladesh and WHO guidelines. The correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that and originated from anthropogenic sources, while the average concentration of trace metals found in rainwater was exhibited in the following order: Zn&amp;gt;Cu&amp;gt;Fe&amp;gt;Cr&amp;gt;Mn&amp;gt;Pb&amp;gt;Cd.

The majority (28) of the systems installed were adsorptive media (AM) technology with the media replaced when exhausted. This paper reports on the results of two ADP projects and two laboratory rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) using the iron-based media, Bayoxide E33 (E33) AM for the removal of arsenic (As) and the co-occurring contaminants (COCs) of vanadium and to a lesser degree fluoride (F) and nitrate (NO3). The ADP studies found that the AM effectively removed the COC of V, but with a lower removal capacity than of As. One ADP study found the AM to be ineffective for the removal of F and NO3. The RSSCT conducted on two other source waters also found vanadium to be removed by the same AM. The study results suggested the AM selectively sequence of As &amp;gt; V &amp;gt; F = N. The study also investigated the AM to achieve an As limit of 5 μg/L. The AM was found to reduce As to below 5 μg/L with around 30% shorter treatment run lengths.</jats:p>",

Five hydrologically connected barrier lakes (Lakes 5 to 1) and upwelling cold mineral springs occur, forming a complex lake-groundwater system. Clarifying the water-source contributions and the role of water-rock interactions in the hydrological cycling for barrier lakes remains a challenge from scientific and engineering perspectives. In this study, seasonal variations of multiple isotopes were analyzed. δ18O and δD data indicate that the Wudalianchi lakes were mainly fed by mineral springs. The values, however, were greatly influenced by precipitation (rain and snow) and varying evaporation intensities. In contrast, 87Sr/86Sr ratios varied little between seasons (0.70701–0.7079), suggesting similar water-rock interactions through time. Nonetheless, Sr isotopic mixing models suggested that shallow mineral springs generally contributed &amp;gt;50% of the water to lower reaches. In contrast, the upstream wetland contributed &amp;gt;50% to Lake 5 and decreased down-valley (10.3–53.6%). Calculations based on the δ18O and δD Rayleigh fractionation equation suggest that evaporation in upper reaches was higher than the lower reaches. The evaporation in July was generally higher than in October. This study demonstrates the homogenous water-rock interactions and the associated water mixing effects on the terrestrial volcanic area.</jats:p>",

The method is based on the use of the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the gas generator of the storage and supply system of hydrogen. The method involves the implementation of three stages. At the first stage, the mathematical dependence of the gas generator time constant on its static parameter and amplitude-frequency characteristic at a fixed frequency is obtained. In the second stage, the choice of this fixed frequency is justified. This dependence includes the value of the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the gas generator of the storage and supply of hydrogen at a fixed frequency, the static parameter of such a gas generator – its transmission coefficient, and the value of the fixed frequency. In the second stage, the choice of this fixed frequency is justified. This choice is made provided that the minimum error in determining the time constant of the gas generator. To determine the static parameter of the gas generator and the value of its amplitude-frequency characteristic at a fixed frequency, an array of data is used, which is formed by measuring the values ​​of the transient function of the gas generator through equal moments of time. These time intervals are chosen according to the Kotelnikov-Nyquist-Shannon theorem. The amplitude-frequency characteristic of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system is determined numerically. According to the research results, an iterative procedure for determining the time constant of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system is given. Recommendations for using this procedure are given. The choice of the time constant of the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system is made using the tolerance criterion.</jats:p>",

In this article we present a Monte Carlo simulation method to quantify the likelihood of wildfire impairing water supplies by combining stochastic representations of annual wildfire and rainfall activity. Water quality impairment was evaluated in terms of turbidity limits for treatment by modeling wildfire burn severity, postfire erosion, sediment transport, and suspended sediment dilution in receiving waterbodies. Water supply disruption was analyzed at the system level based on the impairment status of water supply components and their contributions to system performance. We used this approach to assess wildfire‐water supply impairment and disruption risks for a system of water supply reservoirs and diversions in the Front Range Mountains of Colorado, USA. Our results indicate that wildfire may impair water quality in a concerning 15.7–19.4% of years for diversions from large watersheds. Reservoir impairment should be rare for off‐network reservoirs—ranging from at most 0.01% of years for large reservoirs to nearly 2% of years for small reservoirs. System redundancy meaningfully reduced disruption risk for alternative conveyance routes (4.3–25.0% reduction) and almost eliminated disruption risk for a pair of substitutable terminal sources (99.9% reduction). In contrast, dependency among reservoirs on a conveyance route nearly doubled risk of disruption. Our results highlight the importance of considering water system characteristics when evaluating wildfire‐water supply risks.</jats:p>",

In nations like Bangladesh, online-based shopping has not been simple due to an immature foundation and the hesitance, or failure, of consumers to use banks and electronic payment. It is certain that the once-in-a-century-pandemic, the Covid-19, has modified the way individuals think, shop, and transact while purchasing goods and services. This paper found out how the COVID-19 emergency has made significant changes in consumers’ buying behavior in the online business sector. Three different questionnaire surveys have been prepared that cover the demand side scenario of the consumers and the supply side scenario of online businesses, especially cover e-commerce, f-commerce, and ed-tech sectors. As the crisis measures have been embraced and urban areas like Dhaka have been put on lockdown, consumers have moved to purchase an ever-increasing number of things online. The online consumers’ buying behavior reflects how essential commodity purchases have replaced luxuries analyzing the pre-COVID and post-COVID buying behavior. Suppose this shift towards online purchases brings up issues about what relevant businesses can expect in the near and long-haul future, and shopper conduct has been changed irreversibly. An eco-friendly digital environment, proper optimization of online marketing channels, improved digital payment procedures may help sustain the upsurge of the online business sector as a whole.

Indeed, the control of production processes is fast becoming a key driver for manufacturing operations. Manufacturing control systems have recently been developed for distributed or semi-heterarchical architectures, e.g., holonic systems improving global efficiency and manufacturing operations’ reactiveness. So far, previous studies and applications have not dealt with continuous production processes, such as applications for Water Supply System (WSS), oil refining, or electric power plants. The complexity of continuous production is that a single fault can degrade extensively and even cause service disruption. Therefore, this paper proposes the Holonic Production Unit (HPU) architecture as a solution to control continuous production processes. An HPU is created as a holon unit depicting resources in a continuous process. This unit can detect events within the environment, evaluate several courses of action, and change the parameters aligned to a mission. The proposed approach was tested using a simulated model of WSS. The experiments described in this paper were conducted using a traditional WSS, where the communication and decision-making features allow the application of HPU. The results suggest that constructing a holarchy with different holons can fulfill I4.0 requirements for continuous production processes.</jats:p>",

This paper takes the 7.9 t fuel cell logistics vehicle as the research object, and designed the EMS from two levels of qualitative and quantitative analysis, which are the composite fuzzy control strategy optimized by genetic algorithm and Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) optimized by objective function, respectively. The cost function was constructed and used as the optimization objective to prolong the life of the power system as much as possible on the premise of ensuring the fuel economy. The results indicate that the optimized PMP showed a comprehensive optimal performance, the hydrogen consumption was 3.481 kg/100 km, and the cost was 13.042 $/h. The major contribution lies in that this paper presents a method to evaluate the effect of different strategies on vehicle performance including fuel economy and durability of the fuel cell and battery.

A large-scale water service interruption decreases the reliability of a WSN; therefore, an emergency interconnection plan (EIP) is adopted to prevent it. To establish an EIP involving emergency interconnection pipes, in most cases, only the operation plan is considered. However, it is required to evaluate possible interconnected supply areas (PISAs) from the EIP to achieve the purpose of the EIP. It is obvious that PISA is dependent on the structure of the WSN, elevation difference between the adjacent interconnected blocks, size and location of the emergency interconnection pipes, and inline pumping station. In this study, we categorized the reasons resulting in insufficient PISA from the EIP and suggested improvement methods such as increasing the pipe diameter, new pumping stations, adding emergency interconnection pipes, and adding pressure relief valves. To quantify the effect of the improvement methods on the performance of the EIP, we applied them to a real WSN and estimated the emergency supply rate for each improvement method by using Pressure Driven Analysis (PDA) was used as the hydraulic simulation tool. Consequently, each improvement method increased the PISA and the emergency supply rate on the network. Thus, the suggested method will be used in the design and operation of EIPs to improve their performance.</jats:p>",

In this study, EO content (EOC) and linalool content (LC) in basil irrigated with reclaimed water were investigated. Plant development parameters, nutrient absorption and crude protein (CP) content were also evaluated. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, with five different treatments and five repetitions each. Compared with treatments only using water, the results of those with reclaimed water irrigation showed higher nutrient absorption, CP contents (in their foliar tissue), length of plant branches, foliar biomass weights, and EOC and LC. EOC reached up to 0.58% of the dry biomass and LC was up to 5.84% of EO mass. In practice, it is estimated that around 5.8 kg of EO and 0.34 kg of linalool can be obtained from one ton of dry basil biomass.</jats:p>",

The main results of investigations of the melt flow in the mold are considered. The objects of research were hydrodynamic and heat flows of liquid metal at new process of steel casting into a CCM mold of rectangular section. The result is spatial mathematical model describing flows and temperatures of liquid metal in the mold. To simulate the processes occurring during metal flow in the mold, special software was designed. Theoretical calculations are based on fundamental equations of hydrodynamics, equations of mathematical physics (equation of heat conduction taking into account mass transfer) and proven numerical method. The area under study was divided into elements of finite dimensions; for each element, resulting system of equations was written in difference form. The results are fields of velocities and temperatures of metal flow in the mold volume. A calculation program was compiled based on developed numerical schemes and algorithms. An example of calculation of steel casting into a mold of rectangular cross-section, and flow diagrams of liquid metal along various sections of the mold are given. Vector flows of liquid metal in different sections of the mold are clearly presented at different angles of rotation of the deep-bottom nozzle. The authors have identified the areas of intense turbulence. Metal flows of the described technological process were compared with traditional metal supply through a fixed bottom nozzle.</jats:p>"

In‐depth interviews were conducted with key informants from the investigated companies. The results show that the cost of obtaining certification is borne by the companies’ own resources, which are motivated by pressure from the environmental demands. The main conclusion of the study is that B Corporations, driven by economic perspectives, tend to assume the role of drivers of supply chain development. The main contribution, therefore, consists of demonstrating, based on the agency theory and the finance supply chain, that the performance of an organization under the bias of sustainability creates a collaborative cycle that induces the development of its entire supply chain.</jats:p>",

Water is a basic physiological need, and smart management of water plays a significant role in a smart city. This paper focuses on a mathematical model and IoT framework that aid in developing a smart city. A framework is developed for water supply management. The efficiency of the water supply can be measured by monitoring leakage conditions, overflow of water, automatic meter reading and online bill payments, and water consumption status of households, community, state, and eventually the whole country as well as the automatic water supply line cut-off. The system where the IoT is being deployed consists of embedded hardware in which sensors and microcontrollers provide messages and gain feedback from each other with the help of the internet, and this process can not only be monitored but also can be controlled from a remote location. The developed framework addresses all these aspects and mathematical equations are used and formulated while developing the IoT application. The mathematical equations are concentrated on consumption level (CL), leakage reporting (LR), and bill amount (BA) based on consumption. These become the point of contact for deploying IoT and eventually a framework is developed. This framework can be useful not only in water supply management but also in the management of road traffic, pollution, garbage, home automation and so on. In a nutshell, this paper illustrates the usage of the IoT framework in water supply management which contributes to developing the smart city.</jats:p>"

The results showed that TN and TP loads in flood season were significantly higher than that in the non-flood season. The distribution of loss intensity of TN and TP load has a strong correlation with runoff and sediment erosion intensity, respectively. Among the eight individual BMPs, the reduction rates of stubble coverage, grassed waterway and returning farmland to forest land were relatively high, and the comprehensive attribute value Z of stubble coverage was the highest. Among the three combined BMPs, the reduction rate of ‘stubble coverage + grassed waterway + returning farmland to forest land (&amp;gt;25°)’ was the highest and the Z value was the largest. Overall, the BMPs such as stubble coverage, grassed waterway, and returning farmland to forest land can be adopted alternately to control NPS pollution in the Hanjiang River Basin.</jats:p>",

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted this fishery as well as a number of other fisheries reliant on international export markets. The TRL fishery is managed using an empirical (data-based) Harvest Control Rule (eHCR) to rapidly provide a recommended biological catch (RBC), based on catch, fishery-independent survey indices and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). Here, we summarize the impacts of COVID-19 on each of these critical data inputs and discuss whether the eHCR was considered adequately resilient to this unprecedented disruption to the system. Next, we use a quantitative supply chain index to analyze the impact of disruptions to the supply chain, and inform on potential adaptation strategies. The catch and CPUE data were impacted to varying degrees by external constraints influencing fishing effort, but the fishery-independent survey wasn’t affected and hence there remains an unbroken survey time-series for the fishery extending back to 1989. The eHCR was shown to be reasonably robust because it incorporates longer-term trends over a 5-year period, and accords substantially more weighting (80%) to the fishery-independent survey rather than CPUE data which can be affected by trade and other disruptions. Despite the eHCR not having been tested for scenarios such as a global pandemic, this robustness is a positive given the types of disruptions we will likely face in future climate. The weak links identified in the supply chain were the same as those previously highlighted as sensitive to climate change disruptions. Our supply chain analysis quantifies the impact on system resilience of alternative paths connecting producers to consumers and reinforces that supply chains may be particularly vulnerable to external disruptions if they are not sufficiently diverse.</jats:p>"

As a result, the flood disaster caused by stormwater runoff has become increasingly prominent. The infiltration function of the permeable area can lead to flood disasters, but the extent and depth of the effect are still unclear. Therefore, based on the storm water management model (SWMM) and Green-Ampt infiltration model, this paper discussed the effect of improving soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (SSHC) and soil capillary suction head (SCSH) on the stormwater runoff process. The results show that the increase in SSHC and SCSH can significantly reduce runoff and increase infiltration. However, the improvement of SSHC can more effectively alleviate flood disasters compared with the improvement of SCSH. The change of SSHC has a significant effect on the stormwater runoff with a critical SSHC value while the effect can be ignored. In addition, there is a cross value; when the value of SSHC and SCSH is larger than the cross value, the difference between SSHC and SCSH in reducing runoff duration no longer exists. The critical value and cross value are not constant but change with the change of rainfall intensity.</jats:p>",

We test the model on a two-bus case study with wind power, energy storage, and a constrained transmission line. The case study shows that cuts created from the day-ahead problem gives the lowest expected total cost for the stochastic CEP. The stochastic CEP results in 3% lower expected total cost compared to the deterministic CEP capacities evaluated under uncertain operation. The number of required stochastic iterations is efficiently reduced by introducing a deterministic lower bound, while extending the horizon of the operational problem by persistence forecasting leads to reduced operational costs.</jats:p>",

Because I can virtually rule out many possible iron sources at this time of year, I suggest Alaskan glacial dust is the likely iron source. Large plumes of such dust are known to be generated regularly in the autumn by anomalous offshore winds and channeled through mountain gaps, simultaneously from several locations spanning ∼1,000 km of the northern Gulf of Alaska coastline. Large dust flux events occur when below‐freezing, low‐humidity air temperatures persist for many days during the autumn. I suggest that existing state‐of‐the‐art global dust models fail to reproduce this Alaskan dust flux because the model spatial resolution is too coarse to resolve the high winds through the narrow mountain gaps that generate the dust. Future work that could help to confirm this Fe source to the central GoA includes time‐series profiles of iron concentrations, and ancillary information from sensor‐equipped profiling floats. If this mechanism of Fe supply to the central GoA were confirmed, it would imply this Alaskan dust is transported ≥1,100 km from the coast, more than twice as far as has been visually documented from satellite observations.</jats:p>",

Mechanisms of symbiotic efficiency are important to study not only to reveal the “fine tuning” of the host–symbiont supra-organismal genetic system emergence, but also to develop agriculture with minimal environmental risks. In this paper we demonstrate that among seven genes whose inactivation by Tn5 insertions results in an increased efficiency of rhizobia (Sinorhizobium meliloti) symbiosis with alfalfa (Eff++ phenotype), six genes are involved in the metabolism of small molecules. One of them (SMc04399) encodes for acetate-CoA transferase catalyzing the formation of acetyl-CoA from acyl-CoA. Since acetyl-CoA is required for operation of the Krebs cycle, providing ATP for symbiotic N2 fixation, we suggest that a significant portion of this coenzyme utilized by bacteroids is provided by the plant cell supporting the energy-consuming nitrogenase reaction. Proteomic data analysis allow us to reveal the lability of enzymatic pathways which are involved in bacteroids in the production and catabolism of acetyl-CoA and which should be modified to obtain the Eff++ phenotype. This phenotype was developed also after inactivation of NoeB protein which is involved in the host-specific nodulation and is characterized by an elevated production in wild type S. meliloti bacteroids, suggesting a multifunctional role of noeB in the symbiosis operation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent advances in the development of information technology and the rapid use of decision support systems play significant roles in various fields, including the fisheries sector. Fishery-based activity for small island regions created more complicated problems that limited marine resources and high production costs. Thus, the need to develop efficient and effective tools for interconnecting supply and production becomes more crucial than ever to help local coastal communities. This study aimed to designs a web-based DSS for a sustainable supply chain of sectors in Southeast Maluku Regency, Indonesia (SIRIPIKAN). Firstly, we crafted the DSS framework to identify the fishing, supplier, and seller locations. Secondly, we measured the level of sustainability of marine resources. Thirdly, the web-based DSS can help local coastal communities increase managers' capability and ability in the fisheries-related business activity carried out. SIRIPIKAN aims to increase the profitability of fisheries business activities in coastal communities and preserve marine resources. This research combined the data mining activities with spatial analysis to obtain the cluster support map and MSY to measure sustainability and feasibility study as an approach for the development of the system. The model provides an integrated sustainable production with users' input used to optimize the decision-making process of profitability and sustainability in existing marine resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning of future supplies of agricultural water is beset by uncertainties stemming from inaccuracies in general circulation models, assumed greenhouse gases emissions scenarios (GHGESs), imperfect models employed for estimating reservoir inflows and approximate methods for estimating agricultural water demand. The uncertainty of providing agricultural water under climate change was assessed, relying on simulations involving baseline (1971–2000) and future periods (2040–2069 and 2070–2099). Climatic variables were simulated using six atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) driven by GHGESs A2 and B2 in the Aidoghmoush basin, Iran. Projection of reservoir inflow was performed using the IHACRES model and artificial neural network (ANNs). Agricultural water demand was calculated using the FAO–Penman–Monteith and Hargreaves-Samani (HS) methods. Eight modelling scenarios were considered based on combinations of AOGCMs, GHGESs, reservoir inflow and agricultural water demand projections. Reservoir operation rules were calculated with a particle swarm optimisation algorithm. The results show that agricultural water demand will increase in future periods compared with the baseline period. The operation rule derived from the combination of the HS and ANN models (under GHGES A2) showed the best performance in 2040–2069 by achieving the highest reliability (93%) of water supply. The operation rule derived from the combination of HS and ANN models (under GHGES B2) achieved the highest reliability (95%) of water supply in 2070–2099. The results provide adjusted reservoir operation rules under uncertainty caused by climate change and related impacts on water resources management. </jats:p>",

A low TDS and pH value dissolves intake structures, GI pipes, concrete reservoir, household plumbing systems and cementing structures when it comes in contact with it. Furthermore, the corrosive water causes nuisance and health-related problems. Excess intake of lead, aluminum, copper, iron, chromium etc. in human body due to corrosive water causes serious damage to the different human organs such as brain, kidney, nervous system, blood cells, and even degrade an IQ level. High TDS and low pH value causes scale formation which blocks the whole water supply system. This paper presents a method for identification of corrosive and precipitative water and propose a solution to normalize it. The corrosive and scale forming water is detected easily by measuring a chief indicator parameter, TDS. The increasing value of TDS from intake to tap stand notifies that the water is corroding, and its decreasing values denotes the scale formation. Corrosive water is stabilized using calcium carbonate stones which is easily available in nature. On the other hand, scale forming water is controlled by the structural modifications of intake, collection tank, pipeline and reservoir etc. which we have constructed or going to construct. To verify the proposed methods, case study on Padampokhari and Mahendranager water supply schemes are studied and presented here in detail.</jats:p>"

NLPs have been widely studied in vascular plants but very less is known about NLPs in non-vascular bryophytes till date. In current study, first, the <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> tools were employed for identification and characterization of NLPs in model bryophyte <jats:italic>Physcomitrella patens</jats:italic> genome. Furthermore, the expression profiles of <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic> were assessed under variable supply of nitrogen. A total of 6 <jats:italic>Physcomitrella patens</jats:italic> <jats:italic>NLP</jats:italic> genes (<jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic>) were identified that shared resemblance in their physical and chemical attributes with <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana NLPs</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>AtNLPs</jats:italic>). <jats:italic>PpNLP</jats:italic> genes possesses similarities in there iso-electric point and hydropathicity values with those of <jats:italic>AtNLPs</jats:italic> while gene lengths, protein lengths, and molecular weights were found higher in <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic> than <jats:italic>AtNLPs</jats:italic>. It was further observed that all <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic>, except <jats:italic>PpNLP6</jats:italic>, yield acidic hydrophilic proteins localized in nucleus and share a significant degree of homology in their gene structures and protein motifs with <jats:italic>AtNLPs</jats:italic>. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic> possess significant evolutionary linkage with <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic>. Protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic> possess substantial coordination with nitrogen responsive genes like nitrate reductase. Expressions of all <jats:italic>PpNLPs</jats:italic> were up-regulated in the availability of nitrate (5 and 10 mM) as sole nitrogen source while no significant increment was observed in the absence (0 mM) of nitrogen. The expression levels increased with increasing retention-time treatment of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Results proposed that <jats:italic>NLPs</jats:italic> are responsive to as well as significantly regulated by nitrogen supply.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is a comparative comparison of water leakage management patterns in Tokyo and Tehran. In this study, the existing documents in the field of water leakage management in both cities were collected, classified, and evaluated. A comparison at the level of preventive measures showed that the city of Tokyo has a conceptual model (with an effective water ratio of more than 98%) with «corrective» subdivisions including old network management and providing solutions for maintenance and repair of the current network and also subdivisions including «technology development» and «education.» However, in Tehran, due to financial constraints, the preventive approach (PM11) is entirely passive, and emergency maintenance (EM2) units usually enter into operation after the incident. Operational comparisons showed that the Tokyo Water Leakage Control System consists of two main parts: “continuous monitoring” and “measures commensurate with the type of challenge” and is based on strategic policies. In Tehran, the movement towards using new technologies to control leakage in urban water supply networks has been significant; However, these measures are not based on a plan and have created unbalanced growth in this regard.</jats:p>"

An ecological study was carried out in Espirito Santo state (ES), based on data from the Drinking Water Quality Surveillance Information, from 2014 to 2017. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests were applied to compare municipal indicators with the availability of information and the quality of fluoridation, respectively. Fluoridation quality was calculated to define the percentage of fluoride concentration values in each municipality within the range of the optimal level corresponding to the maximum benefit for preventing dental caries and minimum risk for the occurrence of dental fluorosis. The proportion of 80% or more samples were defined as a compliance criterion. In 2014, 62.8% of the municipalities had information available, and 16.7% performed analyses of fluoride concentration. The percentage of available data increased about 30%, in 2017, with 3.8% referring to fluoride. The quality of fluoridation remained high (&gt; 80%) in ES in almost every year, except in 2014. The municipalities with the largest population, the highest GDP per capita, and the lowest coverage of the oral health team exhibited a greater availability of information about fluoride (p &lt;0.05). The child mortality rate showed a strong negative correlation with the quality of fluoridation. The findings reinforce the importance of directing public policies that ensure the correct practices for monitoring and maintaining the quality of fluoridation.</jats:p>"

Each firm has exclusive access to a signal useful in updating market forecast. The quality of the signal received exclusively by a supplier is low when it adheres to the retail channel but improves after it engages in direct selling. Firms communicate signals along two directions. Competing suppliers or retailers may exchange signals in between, while suppliers may acquire retailers’ signals with payments. A firm can voluntarily share its undisclosed signals—including its exclusive signal and the signals received from information flow—with other firms through vertical interactions as per the specified decision sequence. Firms rely on available signals to decide prices and quantities. Direct selling by suppliers produces structure and information effects. The structure effect arises as suppliers gain flexibility in balancing sales across channels. The information effect arises as suppliers receive exclusive signals of improved quality and initiate signal acquisition from retailers, influencing the availability and utilization of signals among firms in responsive decision making. Channel structure, competition intensity, and cost of direct sales are important factors affecting suppliers’ incentive for direct selling and the magnitude of the arising structure and information effects on firms’ profit performance. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model for the collaborative planning of the pineapple supply chain. The model allows the articulation and planning of the production and distribution echelons, considering the production planning and the transportation process, to maximize profits and increase the efficiency of the sector. We applied the model to the pineapple supply chain in the municipality of San Marcos, Sucre, Colombia. We carried out a characterization of the current state of pineapple production and distribution. Then, the mathematical model was developed and finally, the model was evaluated by developing analysis scenarios to make efficient decisions. Optimal computational results were obtained in a 10.53% increase in utility in the pineapple supply chain.</jats:p>",

India should import more oil from America and Russia while substantially reducing imports from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In terms of the regional analysis, the Middle East plays a crucial role in the oil import strategies. They account for almost half of the total oil imports to China and India. African countries provide an alternative choice to diversify their energy supply risks. Based on forecasts of oil demand, we investigate the optimal oil import strategies for both countries until 2030 and 2040. China’s imports from the United States and Kazakhstan are forecasted to increase by more than ten times by 2030. India should import four times as much oil from the United States as it does now and import 10 times more crude oil from Russia.

The electronic engine control unit generates commands for biphasic fuel injection from each injector. Due to the wear of the injector elements, there is an uneven fuel supply to the engine cylinders and, as a rule, deterioration of its operation. (Research purpose) The research purpose is in studying the process of adjusting the fuel supply in the Common Rail system when diagnosing the engine of a Ford Transit vehicle. (Materials and methods) The most relevant method of commissioning Common Rail fuel system injectors are various service procedures, such as the Low Injection Training procedure. Authors used a scanner and appropriate software to estimate total fuel delivery at idle mode. Authors performed the study on a 2.4 liter Duratorq diesel engine. (Results and discussion) The article presents the engine parameters before and after adjustment (Small Injection Procedure). Before adjustment, two cylinders of the engine received more fuel than the other cylinders. It manifests in an increase in crankshaft speed. After the adjustment, the fuel supply to the cylinders was equalized, resulting in an equalization of crankshaft RPM, reduced vibration and noise. (Conclusions) The study showed that fuel adjustment and Low Injection Training should be a must for engine diagnostics. Correction is effective if the value of injection discrepancy is no more than 5 mg/stroke.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to examine the Owner’s Physiognomies &amp; Incitements for using EAA for SCM in SMEs in the Capricorn District Municipality. The empirical analysis is presented using data from a dissertation for a master's degree in commerce from 2018 to 2020. The study employs a quantitative approach based on a linear regression model. Cronbach's Alpha, descriptive statistics on the normality test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Pearson Correlations, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's Coefficients, and linear regression are all included. Empirical investigation demonstrates that both the Owner’s Physiognomies &amp; Incitements are directly associated with EAA adoption. Overall, the model accounts for a substantial proportion of the variation in EAA adoption for SCM in SMEs. This work leads to the conclusion that there is a positive correlation between variables. The findings of this study will confirm the positive and negative impact of owner physiognomies and incitements on the adoption of EAA for SCM in SMEs.

Cooperation between supply chain members always reduces unforeseen costs and speeds up the response to customer demand. In the new situation, according to the category of return products and their reprocessing, supply chains have found a closed-loop structure. In this research, the aim was to design a closed-loop supply chain in competitive conditions. For this purpose, the key decisions of this chain included locating retail centers, adjusting the inventory of chain members, and selling prices of final products, optimally determined. For this purpose, a nonlinear integer mathematical model is presented. One of the most important innovations of this research was considering the variable value for return products. Then, in order to solve the proposed model, a whale optimization algorithm was developed. Numerical results from the sample examples showed that the whale algorithm had a very good performance in terms of response quality and speed-of-action in finding the optimal solution to this problem.</jats:p>"

This study is based on a pilot-scale simulated water distribution system to understand the effects of chlorine disinfection treatment (without free chlorine) on ARB and ARGs in biofilms. The hydraulic parameters and pipe materials of the system were simulated based on a drinking water system. The results of the colony counts showed that bacterial multi-antibiotic resistance could be enhanced 13-fold in the biofilms of the pipeline. The use of high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) indicated that the total relative abundance of ARGs in biofilm samples increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while the diversity of bacteria was shown to be reduced via taxonomic analysis of the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA. The prominent types of ARGs were conferred resistance by aminoglycoside and β-lactam after the chlorine disinfection treatment, and antibiotic deactivation was the main mechanism. Phyla Proteobacteria had the highest abundance in both treatment and control groups but decreased from 70.81% (initial biofilm sample) to 26.09% (the sixth-month biofilm sample) in the treatment groups. The results show that the chlorine disinfection plays a role in the risk of development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in pipe networks owing to bacteria in biofilms. This study was the first to investigate the contribution of chlorination without free chlorine to the bacterial community shift and resistome alteration in biofilms at a pilot-test level.</jats:p>",

During a successive bloom, typical characteristics of elevated cell-density and pH were observed from development to maintenance stage. However, studies about their influences on the coagulation process have been limited. Here, PACl coagulation experiments were conducted to investigate Microcystis removal with varied pH and cell-density. Results showed that PACl coagulation alone was sufficient to remove Microcystis with low cell-density (105–106 cells mL−1), since an elevated pH value (8.5–9.5) can promote PACl coagulation, possibly ascribed to sweeping cells via neutral gelatinous precipitate of alum. Nevertheless, elevated cyanobacterial biomass was a striking factor in decreasing Microcystis removal (80%–100%) by PACl coagulation, since its inhibitory effects on the coagulation process could not be offset by in situ elevated pH value. Chlorination-assisted (1 mg L−1) coagulation was recommended to treat cyanobacteria-laden source waters with high cell-density of &amp;gt;107 cells mL−1, as it promoted cyanobacterial removal and achieved the highest removal ratio of DOC and turbidity among these treatments. These findings will provide an important reference for water supplies to choose the proper water treatment process to treat cyanobacteria-laden source waters during a successive bloom.</jats:p>",

However, its accuracy, constancy, and repeatability over the course of the running process is not given. Reasons among others are the performance of the powder conveyors, the complex nature of the powder behavior, and the resulting issues with existing closed-loop control approaches. Additionally, a direct in situ measurement of the powder mass flow rate is only possible with intrusive methods. This publication introduces a novel approach to measure the current powder mass flow rate at a frequency of 125 Hz. The volumetric powder flow evaluation given by a simple optical sensor concept was transferred to a mass flow rate through mathematical dependencies. They were found experimentally for a nickel-based powder (Inconel 625) and are valid for a wide range of mass flow rates. With this, the dynamic behavior of a vibration powder feeder was investigated and a memory effect dependent on previous powder feeder speeds was discovered. Next, a closed-loop control with the received sensor signal was implemented. The concept as a whole gives a repeatable and accurate powder mass flow rate while being universally retrofittable and applicable. In a final step, the improved dynamic and steady performance of the powder mass flow rate with closed-loop control was validated. It showed a reduction of mean relative errors for step responses of up to 81% compared to the uncontrolled cases.</jats:p>",

Hitherto, the database consisted of 85 images, 61 were used in the training stage and 24 in the testing stage. In both stages, the images were subjected to thresholding using Otsu's Method, binarization, linear expansion on saturation, application of a Laplacian filter, extraction of characteristics by using co-occurrence matrices and classification by the Bayes Discriminant. Such techniques were also implemented on a computational platform in the MATLAB® environment, responsible for the interface between the system and users.

The batch experimental results showed that the nCaO2/Fe(III)/L-cys process was effective in the destruction of BTEX in both ultrapure water and actual groundwater. A proper amount of L-cys could enhance BTEX degradation due to the promotion of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycles by the participation of L-cys, but an excessive presence of L-cys would cause inhibition. Adding 1.0 mM L-cys to the nCaO2/Fe(III) system, the concentration of Fe(II) increased to 1.15 mM instantly. Simultaneously, the yield of HO• produced by the 1.0 mM L-cys-containing system was 0.066 mM at 180 min reaction, higher than that without L-cys (0.049 mM). When excess L-cys (5.0 mM) was added to the system, the amount of Fe(II) increased to 3.73 mM because excessive L-cys caused a large amount of Fe(III) in the system to be reduced. However, the yield of HO• decreased to 0.043 mM since excessive Fe(II) could conversely scavenge HO• to produce Fe(III) again. EPR tests and quenching results indicated that HO• was the dominant reactive species in the nCaO2/Fe(III)/L-cys system. For the removal of BTEX, the optimal molar ratio of nCaO2/Fe(III)/L-cys was 10.5/20/1 based on calculation by response surface methodology (RSM). Finally, the BTEX destruction pathway was proposed according to the detected intermediates by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).</jats:p>",

The agri-food industry is the largest water-consuming industry among all industries, and various efforts have been made to reduce the loss of water in the agricultural supply chain. Improving the resilience of water resource management is a key measure to reduce the risks in the agricultural supply chain. This study aims to identify the factors affecting the resilience of water management in the agricultural supply chain and to help manage the risks related to water resources use. A total of 14 factors are selected from five dimensions of society, economy, environment, institution, and crop characteristics, and an index institution is constructed. This was used to determine the level and importance of each factor. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey involving 28 experts from the agricultural industry in Northwest China, as well as a thorough literature analysis and interactions with experts. Using a combination of an interpretative structural model (ISM) and an analytical network process (ANP), a hierarchical structure model was developed, composed of direct factors, indirect factors, and basic factors. The results show that the selection of agricultural products, the establishment of a water audit control institution, the recycling of wastewater, and the investment in water-saving technologies are the main factors affecting the resilience of water resources management in the agricultural supply chain. These findings provide useful guidance for practitioners involved in the management of water resources in agricultural supply chains. These results are expected to contribute to the sustainable management and strategic deployment of water by agricultural supply chain stakeholders.</jats:p>"

AMF act as an extension of the root system helping phosphate uptake. In agriculture, harnessing the symbiosis can potentially increase plant growth. Application of the AMF <jats:italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</jats:italic> has been demonstrated to increase the yields of various crops. However, there is a paradigm that AMF colonization of roots, as well as the plant benefits afforded by inoculation with AMF, decreases with increasing phosphorus (P) supply in the soil. The paradigm suggests that when fertilized with sufficient P, inoculation of crops would not be beneficial. However, the majority of experiments demonstrating the paradigm were conducted in sterile conditions without a background AMF or soil microbial community. Interestingly, intraspecific variation in <jats:italic>R. irregularis</jats:italic> can greatly alter the yield of cassava even at a full application of the recommended P dose. Cassava is a globally important crop, feeding 800 million people worldwide, and a crop that is highly dependent on AMF for P uptake. In this study, field trials were conducted at three locations in Kenya and Tanzania using different AMF and cassava varieties under different P fertilization levels to test if the paradigm occurs in tropical field conditions. We found that AMF colonization and inoculation responsiveness of cassava does not always decrease with an increased P supply as expected by the paradigm. The obtained results demonstrate that maximizing the inoculation responsiveness of cassava is not necessarily only in conditions of low P availability, but that this is dependent on cassava and fungal genotypes. Thus, the modeling of plant symbiosis with AMF under different P levels in nature should be considered with caution.</jats:p>"

In the first stage, the bank decides an interest rate and shows it to the TO and the competitive MPBC. In the second stage, the TO and MPBC are engaged in Cournot games: a simultaneous subgame, a TO-as-leader sequential subgame, and an MPBC-as-leader sequential subgame. The TO’s and the MPBC’s decisions and the production/sale quantities are investigated. The impacts of the interest rate and the substitute factor on the TO’s and the MPBC’s optimal decisions are analyzed. When the substitute factor is high, at a low interest rate, the total sales in the simultaneous subgame is higher than those in the other two subgames; at a high interest rate, the total sales in the MPBC-as-leader subgame is higher than those in the other two subgames. However, when the substitute factor is low, at a low enough interest rate, the total sales in the simultaneous subgame is higher than those in the other two subgames; at a high enough interest rate, the total sales in the MPBC-as-leader subgame is higher than those in the other two subgames; at a moderate interest rate, the total sales in the TO-as-leader subgame is higher than those in the other two subgames. Besides, the optimal interest rate of the bank is investigated and the impact of the substitute factor on the optimal interest rate is analyzed. The bank sets a higher interest rate in the MPBC-as-leader subgame than those in the other two subgames.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To increase the resilience of regional water supply systems in South Africa in the face of anticipated climatic changes and a constant increase in water demand, water supply sources require diversification. Many water‐stressed metropolitan regions in South Africa depend largely on surface water to cover their water demand. While climatic and river discharge data is widely available in these regions, information on groundwater resources – which could support supply source diversification – is scarce. Groundwater recharge is a key parameter that is used to estimate groundwater amounts that can be sustainably exploited at a sub‐watershed level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a reliable hydrological modelling routine that enables the assessment of regional spatio‐temporal variations of groundwater recharge to discern the most promising areas for groundwater development. Accordingly, we present a semi‐distributed hydrological modelling approach that incorporates water balance routines coupled with baseflow modelling techniques to yield spatio‐temporal variations of groundwater recharge on a regional level. The approach is demonstrated for the actively managed catchment areas of the Amathole Water Supply System situated in a semi‐arid part of the Eastern Cape of South Africa. In the investigated study area, annual groundwater recharge exhibits a high spatio‐temporal heterogeneity and is estimated to vary between ~0.5% and 8% of annual rainfall. Despite some uncertainties induced by limited data availability, calibration and validation of the model were found to be satisfactory and yielded model results similar to (point) data of annual groundwater recharge reported in earlier studies. Our approach is therefore found to derive crucial information for efficiently targeting more detailed groundwater exploration studies and could work as a blueprint for orientating groundwater potential exploration in similar environments.</jats:p>",

The booming e-commerce also accelerates the development of the dual-channel supply chain. In the dual-channel supply chain of fresh food, the carbon emission and freshness of fresh food are becoming important factors affecting consumers’ purchase demand. This paper focuses on the optimal decision of carbon emission reduction and pricing, which is investigated by a Stackelberg game-theoretic approach in three dual-channel supply chain sales models (retailer dual channel, producer dual channel, and mixed dual channel). A two-stage fresh food supply chain system composed of a producer and a retailer is explored. The sensitivity analysis and the comparison of three dual-channel models are carried out. The results show the following: (1) the sales price, carbon emission reduction, market demand, producer’s profit, retailer’s profit, and supply chain’s profit of fresh food under the three dual-channel supply chains show the same change on different levels of consumers’ low-carbon preference coefficient and freshness level, respectively; (2) the optimal decision of carbon emission reduction and pricing, demand, and profit of the three dual-channel models need to be determined according to the value of consumers’ purchasing preferences for the retailer’s offline channel. The paper gives some enlightenment to the decision-making members in the fresh dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

This paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Austrian drinking milk supply chain. For this purpose, a tripartite approach was chosen consisting of a process description using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), a qualitative System Dynamics analysis with a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD), and the use case of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020 in Austria. The results show that the drinking milk supply chain is complex and consists of many individual process steps. However, the number of locations that are passed through during drinking milk production is rather small. The CLD revealed that reinforcing feedback loops occur in the provision of packaging material and the availability of dairy staff. Analysis of the use case showed that the system of dairy production in Austria is stable in the tested scenario, and that the supply chains preserved their function also during the pandemic. Dairies with diverse product ranges were able to react more easily to the massively changed demand situation. The insights gained by this research may be used to increase the resilience of the drinking milk supply chain. Furthermore, the methodological approach can be transferred and used to analyse the supply chains of other foods.</jats:p>",

However, current agricultural and postharvest handling practices may result in decreased fruit quality. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of conventional or reduced fungicide applications on the quality of ‘Florida Radiance’ strawberries exposed to supply chain conditions. Strawberries held under steady temperature had better sensory and physicochemical quality than fruit exposed to supply chain conditions, regardless of the disease control treatment. Strawberries from the reduced fungicide treatment were firmer, lost less moisture, had higher sugar and higher or similar bioactive contents than fruit from the conventional treatment. Sensory scores were better for reduced fungicide fruit held under steady temperature conditions than other treatments at the consumer level. Microbial load increased during the supply chain but results strongly suggest that washing the fruit significantly reduces the microbial load and residual fungicide levels (fludioxonil, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin, and captan) on the fruit. Overall, the use of reduced fungicide applications to control strawberry disease constitutes a promising alternative to conventional practices. It will help reduce costs by reducing labor and the amount of fungicides used while maintaining overall strawberry quality. Moreover, avoiding abusive and fluctuating temperature conditions during the supply chain will extend shelf-life and reduce strawberry waste.</jats:p>"

Hence, the design and interpretation of this self‐powered and disintegration–reorganization–regeneration power supply are generally considered to be almost insurmountable obstacles to haunt both experimenters and theorists. Herein, a self‐powered and disintegration–reorganization–regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized by the principle of ion‐selective diffusion, which regenerates by radical polymerization. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self‐powered and disintegration–reorganization–regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperatures and variable temperature (0–25 °C). As a hypothetical model, a self‐powered and deformable arch bridge with disintegration and reorganization is fabricated. In the future, this power supply is expected to be applied in prosthetic limbs, bionic skins, implantable power supplies, mobile phones, portable computers, wearable devices, etc. Moreover, with the improvement of the stability and discharge life, it could promote major revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent industrial automation, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent power systems, etc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A sufficient supply of phosphorus (P) to pigs in livestock farming is based on the optimal use of plant-based phytate and mineral P supplements to ensure proper growth processes and bone stability. However, a high P supplementation might bear the risk of higher environmental burden due to the occurrence of excess P and phytate degradation products in manure. In this context, the intestinal microbiota is of central importance to increase P solubility, to employ non-mineral P by the enzymatic degradation of phytate, and to metabolize residual P. A feeding experiment was conducted in which piglets were fed diets with different P levels, resulting in three groups with low, medium (covering requirements), and high concentrations of available P. Samples from caecum and colon digesta were analysed for microbial composition and phytate breakdown to estimate the microbial contribution to metabolize P sources. In terms of identified operational taxonomic units (OTU), caecum and colon digesta under the three feeding schemes mainly overlap in their core microbiome. Nevertheless, different microbial families correlate with increased dietary P supply. Specifically, microbes of Desulfovibrionaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Anaerovoracaceae, and Methanobacteriaceae were found significantly differentially abundant in the large intestine across the dietary treatments. Moreover, members of the families Veillonellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, and Succinivibrionaceae might contribute to the observed phytate degradation in animals fed a low P diet. In this sense, the targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by feeding measures offers possibilities for the optimization of intestinal phytate and P utilization.</jats:p>"

Compared with the active response of sediment microbiota to NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> additions, the supply of glucose (approximately 300 μM final concentration added) did not significantly change the NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> removal efficiency under aerobic conditions (dissolved oxygen saturation approximately 100%). Similarly, an insignificant increase of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> removal rate after glucose amendment of the circulating water was obtained when dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation decreased to approximately 70% in the input solution. When DO at the input solution was decreased to 30% saturation (sub-oxic conditions), the removal rate of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> in the group amended with glucose increased, suggesting that glucose stimulated denitrifiers. These results revealed that NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> removal relied mainly on the anaerobic environment at particle surfaces, with a dependence on the sedimentary organic matter as an electron supplier under bulk aerobic conditions, while the bio-labile DOM was consumed mainly by aerobic respiration instead of stimulating NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> reduction. However, the respiration triggered by the over-supply of bio-labile DOM reduced the DO in the porewater, likely depressing the activity of aerobic reactions in the permeable sediment.

This paper provides the explicit option coordination conditions for the disrupted supply chain under two supply chain structures, and then explores the effects of the disruptions and supply chain structure on the option coordination conditions. The results suggest that it is unfavorable to apply the original coordinating contracts without disruptions to coordinate the disrupted supply chain. The coordination of the disrupted supply chain can be achieved with knowledge of the distribution of demand. In two coordinating contracts for the disrupted supply chain, the exercise price is still at the original level without disruptions while the option price deviates from the original level without disruptions. Moreover, the relationships of the coordination conditions in two supply chain structures depend on the value of the profit allocation coefficient. When the profit allocation coefficient exceeds (falls behind) a certain threshold, the option price is set at a higher (lower) value in the supplier-led supply chain structure than in the distributor-led supply chain structure, while the exercise price is set at a lower (higher) value in the supplier-led supply chain structure than in the distributor-led supply chain structure. Finally, the disrupted supply chain with any supply chain structure will perform better in the modified coordinating contracts than in the original coordinating contracts without disruptions.</jats:p>"

However, these masks are often unavailable in pandemic situations due to a strain on supply/demand logistics. In such cases, establishing development of respiratory protection within the organization may be beneficial. Our work presents one such novel method of designing customized masks by considering facial anthropometrics of the specific sample population. In fact, such a design may provide a more efficient fit with the users as compared to currently available masks, which are often designed for a much wider range of people. The protocol followed a fast-paced method of obtaining facial data (~2.8 mins/participant), and a data-driven approach for extracting design profiles. We have demonstrated the same through a pilot study, which involved recruiting a group of 7 participants with ethnic and gender variation. A total of 7 landmarks representing zygomatic process of the temporal, angle of mandible, zygomatic arch, nasal-maxillary region, and apex of nose, mid-lips and the chin were selected. Analysis included determining closest, mid-points, and farthest points for each landmark among the entire datasets. Results indicated that the landmarks: Apex of Nose, Midlips and Chin represented a straight-line path with a lateral shift of ~4.58 inches between the closest and farthest dimensions from the nose point, based on which the facepiece was designed. Meanwhile, geometric transformations consisting of several construction lines and bisectors were used along with obtained data from zygomatic arch, process of temporal, and angle of mandible landmarks to determine the contours of the straps for securing the mask. Our design addresses common issues in masks like discomfort around the ear, humidity, and reuse, by provision of a novel mounting method, fabric-based materials, and sleeve for replacement of filters, respectively. The proposed concept of the mask and the methods followed could also be applied in broader applications including manufacturing/construction and also daily-life activities besides hospital environments. </jats:p>",

On their basis, a rational range of preliminary cooling of exhaust gases of rotary kilns was revealed, the upper level of which is determined, first of all, by their initial temperature. It has been established that the rational ratio of water consumption for heating systems with traditional temperature drops and hot water supply is in the range of 0.3-0.9. At the same time, an increase in energy efficiency is noted in the process of operational regulation of systems with a decrease in the ratio of the costs of heat carriers for technological and household purposes. The degree of precooling of exhaust gases, which significantly depends on their initial temperature, is in the range of 0.35-0.5 with a decrease in the corresponding flow rates of heat carriers in heating and hot water supply systems. The rational ratio of the consumption of the heating and heated medium in the process of contact interaction, which significantly depends on the initial temperature of the exhaust gases, is in the range of 0.2-1.2. For low-temperature waste gases (up to 500С), the reciprocal values of the analyzed ratio logically agree with the corresponding values of the irrigation coefficient.

Control fruit were described by consumers as more acidic and under-ripe compared with those from Early-High carbohydrate canes, but as sweeter than those from Low carbohydrate canes. This study showed that carbohydrate supply can have a major impact on the growth, sugar accumulation and maturity of ‘Zesy002’ fruit sinks.</jats:p>"

Two groups of magnetopause shape control coils (labeled CK coils) are used to slightly adjust the magnetic field distribution on the magnetopause. A capacitive pulsed power supply (PPS) system with a modular design is developed to excite CK coils. The PPS system consists of six sets of PPS with the same principle and structure, which are used to excite six sub-coils of the CK coils, respectively. Each set of PPS consists of ten modules and one local controller, and each module consists of a charger and discharge unit. Each set of PPS can provide a pulsed current of no less than 400 kA for the corresponding sub-coil at 0.11 ms when the charging voltage is 20 kV, and the duration of the pulsed current from the peak to 10% of the peak is no more than 0.6 ms. The detailed design of the PPS is discussed in this paper, and the discharge test of the PPS is carried out to verify the design of the PPS. Because there are acquisition and control devices in the discharge unit, the electromagnetic interference immunity design is also discussed to ensure the normal operation of the PPS.</jats:p>",

M-CHT can restore its original layered structure after the adsorption of nitrate or nitrite, and can be easily separated by an applied magnetic field. The first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (R2 ≥ 0.97) can better describe the adsorption kinetic process. The equilibrium isotherm showed that the Langmuir model provided a better fit to the experimental data than the Freundlich model for nitrates and nitrites. With temperature increased from 298 to 308 K, the maximum adsorption capacity obtained by the Langmuir model increased from 10.60 to 16.90 mg-N/g for nitrate and 7.89 to 14.28 mg-N/g for nitrite, respectively. The adverse effect of coexisting anions ranked in the order of ClO4− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; F− &amp;gt; CO32− &amp;gt; PO43−. The actual Fe2+/Fe3+ value of M-CHT (0.56) is nearly consistent with the theoretical value of 0.5, and the saturation magnetic strength value of M-CHT is 9.15 emu/g, greatly contributing to the solid–liquid separation. Overall, M-CHT with features of magnetic properties and satisfactory adsorption capacity exhibits great promise for application in wastewater purification.</jats:p>",

It is therefore possible to subdivide the response of nutrient content to water transfer into three components: (a) Direct Impact (DI) of dilution through water diversion, (b) Indirect Impact (II) by sediment release, and (c) Self Impact (SI) of nutrient degradation and attenuation of nutrients. By combining field investigation, laboratory experiment, and numerical simulation, the contribution weight of DI, II, and SI to the change of nutrient concentration was quantitatively analyzed. The results show that: (1) in the upper reaches of the river network, II plays a leading role in that the weight is more than 75%, and increasing the amount of water diversion increases the nutrient content; (2) SI plays a leading role in the tributary of the central part of the river network, the weight is more than 60%, and when the auxiliary pumping station is opened, the weight of II is less than 1%; (3) in the southeast of the river network, the nutrient release rate is sensitive to the change of hydrodynamics, and the weight of II is more than 90%. The results of this study can provide a reference for the formulation of a comprehensive hydrodynamic water quality management control scheme in the urban river network.</jats:p>",

This paper aims at exploring the optimal information acquisition strategy and its incentive contracts in an e-commerce supply chain with two competing e-tailers and an offline showroom. Based on signaling game theory, we build a mathematical model by considering the impact of experience service and competition intensity on consumers’ demand. We find that, on the one hand, information acquisition promotes supply chain members to obtain demand information directly or indirectly, which leads to forecast revenue. On the other hand, information acquisition promotes supply chain members to distort optimal decisions, which results in signal cost. The optimal information acquisition strategy depends on the joint impact of forecast revenue, signal cost and demand forecast cost. Notably, in some conditions, the offline showroom will not acquire demand information even when its cost is equal to zero. We also design two different information acquisition incentive contracts to obtain Pareto improvement for all supply chain members.</jats:p>"

Therefore, they are the first choice to replace petroleum polymer membranes. In this study, cellulose (BC) and chitosan (CS) were used as raw materials, and N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) was used as solvent. A new kind of cellulose nanofiltration membrane (BC-NFM), cellulose/chitosan nanofiltration membrane (BC/CS-NFM), and interfacial polymerized cellulose/chitosan composite nanofiltration membrane (IP-BC/CS-NFM) were successfully prepared by NaOH hydrolysis and chloroacetic acid carboxymethylation modification, piperazine (PIP), and 1,3,5-trimellitic chloride (TMC) interfacial polymerization, respectively. These two methods were used for the preparation of cellulose nanofiltration membranes for the first time.We also studied their structure, separation performance and their capacity to remove typical pollutants. The results showed that obvious holes appeared on the surface of the nanofiltration membrane obtained by alkali hydrolysis and chloroacetic acid carboxymethylation modification, and the cross-section showed a spongelike structure. The surface of the nanofiltration membrane obtained by interfacial polymerization formed a rough and dense separation layer. The rejection rates of the three kinds of nanofiltration membranes were all over 30% for monovalent salt ions, over 60% for divalent salt ions, over 92% for methyl orange, and over 98% for methyl blue. They had good removal effects for typical pollutants in drinking water.</jats:p>",

To this end, in this study, we analyzed the impact of long-term suboptimal N conditions on the metabolome and transcriptome of tomato to identify specific molecular processes and regulators at the organ scale. Physiological and metabolic analysis revealed specific responses to maintain glutamate, asparagine, and sucrose synthesis in leaves for partition to sustain growth, while assimilated C surplus is stored in the roots. The transcriptomic analyses allowed us to identify root and leaf sets of genes whose expression depends on N availability. GO analyses of the identified genes revealed conserved biological functions involved in C and N metabolism and remobilization as well as other specifics such as the mitochondrial alternative respiration and chloroplastic cyclic electron flux. In addition, integrative analyses uncovered N regulated genes in root and leaf clusters, which are positively correlated with changes in the levels of different metabolites such as organic acids, amino acids, and formate. Interestingly, we identified transcription factors with high identity to TGA4, ARF8, HAT22, NF-YA5, and NLP9, which play key roles in N responses in Arabidopsis. Together, this study provides a set of nitrogen-responsive genes in tomato and new putative targets for tomato NUE and fruit quality improvement under limited N supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. The purpose of this research is to increase the efficiency of the charging station, which is to meet the demand of energy for charging the batteries of electric vehicles without exceeding the limits of the grid restrictions. Methodology. The model of a controlled charging system was considered to study the efficiency of charging stations with the quantitative connection of electric vehicles to the charger under conditions of power limitation. Results. The load graph during the controlled charging method does not exceed the set limit voltage and power consumption settings, but with the uncontrolled method there is an overload of 16% during peak hours. The main disadvantage of the conventional method of charging with restrictions is that EVs that have been connected to the charging slots later than other EVs, were not charged in conditions of limited power supply. The charging stations require a charging system that does not have such a disadvantage – it is necessary that almost all connected electric vehicles fill their required level of charge and meet the limitations of the network at the same time. Investigating such a system is the task of future research. Originality. Every year the number of electric vehicles in Ukraine is growing rapidly. This also determines the development of a network of charging stations, both commercial and for domestic use. According to the Rules for the use of electricity, the contract for electricity consumption specifies the allowable capacity for the household or enterprise. Violation of this limit may cause the facility to become disconnected from the power supply with additional penalties. Practical value. The solutions to the problem of charging a large number of EVs are mainly based on different types of planning and creating a profile of their charging scenarios with technical limitations. These restrictions depend on the situation of the charging station (the number of connected EVs, their charging levels, the possibility of simultaneous charging for a few EVs, and the declared charging time). The charging period convenient for the EV owner and the network load schedule may conflict. The development of a realtime charging control system should provide each EV guaranteed charging even in conditions of limited power consumption. References 13, tables 4, figures 18.</jats:p>",

The objective of the study was to verify the conditions in which two innovation ecosystems were structured and operated in Mato Grosso do Sul, which emerged at the encouragement of the Banco do Brasil Foundation during the Covid-19 pandemic, working through short chains, in the search for urgent solutions to supply healthy food to the most vulnerable populations. The object of this investigation was the ecosystems articulated by the Central dos Trabalhadores/as da Economia Solidáriain Campo Grande and the Associação dos Produtores Orgânicos de Mato Grosso do Sul (APOMS) in Glória de Dourados, with an area of activity in several surrounding municipalities, involving suppliers and the beneficiary population. The research, of a descriptive and exploratory type, was based on an initial bibliographic review, followed by the collection of information from bibliographic and documentary sources and also the application of semi-structured interviews to those responsible for the entities that articulate each ecosystem. It was possible to verify that the structure and functioning of the two innovation ecosystems responded in great part, not only to the context of the circumstances and territories in which they were manifested, but also to the nature of public incentive policies. In addition to boosting the local economy, they favored the social inclusion of vulnerable populations and, even if in a palliative way, they guaranteed food security for numerous families in the territories where they demonstrated an innovative way of building social markets in Mato Grosso do Sul.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the reliable operation of access monitoring and control systems is the most important technical challenge. Electromagnetic interference can disrupt the functions of the control system. One of the reasons for system malfunctions can be electromagnetic interference on the power supply network. The article analyzes the sources of electromagnetic interference in the power supply network. Experimental studies of the functioning of the control system under the influence of nanosecond noise on the power supply network have been carried out.

However, the interactions among multiple ESs supplies and demands remain under-researched, and ESs supply and demand spatial heterogeneity and correlation characteristics at the city level are rarely studied, especially in arid areas. To fill this gap, we established a comprehensive assessment framework of ESs supply and demand through integrating multi-source remote sensing data, social economy, and policy objectives, for the oasis city of Urumqi, China. The ESs supply–demand mismatches were revealed at the city level, and the spatial relationship between the ESs supply and demand was analyzed using spatial statistics. The results demonstrated that: (1) The total quantity of supply and demand of food provision, carbon sequestration, PM10 removal, and recreation services in Urumqi revealed that the demand was greater than the supply, the deficits being 16.10 × 107 kcal/ha, 6.88 × 104 t/ha, 155.86 kg/ha, and 697.26, respectively. (2) The supply and demand assessment of ESs revealed spatial differences from the city center to the suburbs, which further indicated that there are neighborhood similarities between the supply and demand of ESs. (3) The matching types of ESs supply and demand present obvious spatial heterogeneity, which can be divided into four types: High–high, high–low, low–high, and low–low. Owing to rapid urban development in the inner city, the city center is dominated by low–high, whereas the urban–rural ecotone is characterized by high–low, owing to the higher elevation and water resource advantages in the suburbs. Based on the analysis of the supply, demand, and matching of ESs, economic development and sustainable management policies are proposed for different ecological spaces.

The authors assess the possibility of organizing the power supply for the operation of the mines using the resources of local coal deposits. The Soginsky brown coal and Krasnorechensk coal deposits are most suitable for mining.  The research proves that the use of coal in generation can reduce the cost of power supply in the development of ore and placer deposits. They determined that the lowest unit cost of electricity generation is achieved when brown coal from the Kularski deposit is used as fuel (9.3 rub/kW·h). The use of coals from the Soginsky deposit is 20% more expensive than the Kularsky coals, but the quality characteristics of the coal and the readiness of the deposit for mining are significantly better. The most accessible, but more expensive option for organizing the supply of coal to gold deposits is the use of imported coal of the required quality. The authors outline the necessity of additional appraisal of coal resource potential of the Arctic zone of Yakutia on the base of contemporary economic criteria. There is a need to clarify the extent of coal production and to determine the importance of coal in investment projects in the northeast of Arctic zone of Yakutia.</jats:p>",

The study assessed urban domestic water demand and supply in Edo North senatorial district in Edo State, Nigeria. This is with the view of exploring some critical water resource variables to determine water security, distribution, and accessibility of safe drinking water in Edo North in Edo State in Nigeria. Integrated Water Resource Management Tools (IWRT) such as Water Poverty Index (WPI) and Water Accessibility Indicator (WAI) was applied. The results show that Auchi is highly water-stressed at the Estako-west area with MPI and WAI values of 0.24 and 0.33. Conversely, Okpella and Agenebode in Eskako central have MPI and WAI values 0.34 and 0.31, and 0.31 and 0.32. Sabo Gida Ora and Isobe in Owan East and West have better safe drinking water coverage and accessibility with the indicator values of 0.54, 0.53 [WPI], and 0.61 and 0.59 [WAI]. It is generally observed that the supply of potable water in the Edo North is highly unsecured and unsustainable to meet the current and future demand. Valuable and economic time is wasted to gather water from an average closest distance of 1.3 km from home to some designated water taps. In conclusion, it is imperative to design a robust integrated water policy that should include Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) to invest in the provision of safe drinking water.</jats:p>"
