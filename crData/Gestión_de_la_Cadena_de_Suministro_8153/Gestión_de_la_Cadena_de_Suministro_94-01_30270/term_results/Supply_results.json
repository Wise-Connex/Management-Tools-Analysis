It pinpoints the reason why competitive intelligence is on hold in corporate America and offers practical advice and solutions to position competitive intelligence systems as the systems of choice for intelligence users. The key is to stimulate demand and the author tells us why and how. A must read for intelligence providers, for managers and intelligence users, and for management program faculty and students in our colleges and universities.</JATS1:p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<JATS1:p>The author identifies missing links in the system--purpose, domain, terminology, and research. He identifies value-added opportunities for strengthening competitive intelligence programs by focusing on user needs and benefits. How to define and measure the benefits of a Competitive Intelligence program, as the primary source of competitive advantage, the key question plaguing intelligence providers, is addressed and answered.</JATS1:p>"

This anomalous muscle was situated medially between the distal part of the tibia and the tendo calcaneus. The muscle arose from the anterior aponeurosis of the soleus muscle and was attached with a separate tendon to the calcaneus anteromedial to the tendo calcaneus. The soleus muscle was supplied by two nerves from the tibial nerve. The ramus posterior entered its posterior surface near the proximal border, and the ramus anterior entered the bipenniform part which was located on the anterior aspect of the soleus. One of branches from the r. anterior descended on the surface of the medial half of the bipenniform part and gave off a few twigs for this muscle part. Finally, its terminal entered the accessory soleus muscle and ramified in this muscle. In a teased preparation of the tibial nerve, both the nerve fibres composing this branch to the anomalous muscle and those constituting the r. anterior proper which supplied the bipenniform part were contained in the same funiculus. This mode of nerve supply to the soleus and the accessory soleus muscle suggested that this anomalous muscle derived from the part of the proper soleus muscle supplied by the r. anterior.</jats:p>"

This study of unit behavior performance focused on steam capacity control during expected operational transients, from the trigger event to system recovery. Transients specified in the project steam sale contract include the conditions of unit upset and the dynamic interruption criteria. Performance is measured by the quantitative steam supply variables of pressure, flow, temperature, enthalpy (at the battery limit) and response time following the disturbance of a combustion turbine (CT) trip. A unit especially configured for steam supply uses an availability strategy for response to a CT loss, which requires back-up equipment in the boiler island to activate in time to compensate for disturbance effects without loss of steam-sale continuity as defined in the contract. Dynamic simulation was used to validate seamless transitions of plant alignments from one mode to another during the specified scenarios. A discussion of steadystate availability and facility power block structure sets the context for the investigation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of cropping sequence on soil nitrogen (N) supply to a rice crop was investigated using an in situ incubation technique in a direct drill system on a red-brown earth soil in south-eastern Australia. The crop sequences were (i) a rice crop in each of the previous 4 summers, (ii) rice then 4 seasons of annual pasture (long pasture phase), (iii) rice, 2 winter cereal crops then 2 seasons of annual pasture (short pasture phase), and (iv) rice then 4 winter cereal crops. This study was undertaken in the fifth year of the crop sequence experiment, when all sequences had returned to rice. Within the rice crop, fertilised (160 kg N/ha) and unfertilised plots were established on the burnt stubble portion of the main crop sequence plots. Nitrogen uptake in unfertilised plots ranged from 79 kg N/ha in continuously cropped rice treatments to 165 kg N/ha in short pasture phase treatments. Application of 160 kg N/ha at permanent flood increased N uptake to 207 kg N/ha for the short pasture treatment. Crop biomass and tillering varied with cropping sequence and increased with fertiliser nitrogen application. Crop sequence had little effect on soil mineral N content during the growing season. However, total soil N mineralisation during the season varied with both crop sequence and fertiliser application. The continuous rice sequence mineralised 119 kg N/ha, whilst the long pasture phase sequence mineralised 246 kg N/ha. Fertiliser application increased mineralised N to 267 and 337 kg N/ha for continuous rice and short pasture phase treatments, respectively. Nitrogen mineralisation rate peaked (4 kg N/ha.day) some 40-50 days after permanent flood, coinciding with panicle initiation and the period of high N demand in the rice crop. Increased N availability after panicle initiation resulted in significantly higher grain yields. This work demonstrates that both the magnitude and timing of N supply affects the grain yield of the rice crop. Nitrogen supply is affected by the previous crop sequences. Practical implications are that pasture phase length of highly clover-dominant pastures could be reduced (from 4 to 2 years) and still provide similar contributions of N to succeeding rice crops; that continuous rice growing might achieve high yields similar to rice in rotation with legume pastures with the judicious application of fertiliser N; and that these N fertiliser applications may have to be quite high to achieve grain yields similar to rice in rotation with legume pastures.</jats:p>"

Theory provides little guidance, however, in the actual specification of empirical models. This paper applies an integrated approach for choosing between price expectation mechanisms in a multiple‐equation model when the alternatives are non‐nested. Nine alternative specifications of market price and policy information are developed. Price forecasting accuracy, non‐nested tests of hypotheses, and out‐of‐sample predictive accuracy are examined for agricultural production in Iowa. The results call into question the reliability of using forecasting accuracy as the sole guide to selecting a price expectation proxy.</jats:p>",

The deep plantar arch was always well developed and complete, whereas the superficial plantar arch was usually slender and incomplete. The first proximal perforating artery arising from the dorsalis pedis artery formed the main component of the deep plantar arch in 82% of the feet. The second proximal perforating artery arising from the dorsal rete contributed to the deep plantar arch in 43% of the feet, and formed most of the arch in one foot. The dorsal rete was classified into four groups of variants based on the arterial source of the second dorsal metatarsal artery. These were the arcuate artery (25%), distal lateral tarsal artery (12%), proximal lateral tarsal artery (6%), and nondorsal rete (57%) variants. In the first intermetatarsal space, the dorsal and plantar metatarsal arteries shared a common trunk in 54% of the feet, but this did not occur in the other intermetatarsal spaces. The second dorsal metatarsal artery arose from the dorsal rete in 43% of the feet, and this artery was quite large, sometimes being the largest of all the dorsal and plantar metatarsal arteries. Variations of the arterial supply found in humans sometimes resembled the typical pattern found in the macaque.</jats:p>"

However, reports on the vascular supply of this muscle are incomplete or contradictory. Therefore the pectoral region was examined in 57 human cadavers. A complex pattern of variations in the arterial supply was found: it was, however, systematically arranged and limited to a small part of the arterial tree. A topographical classification was made, based on the dominant muscle artery, to provide a useful orientation during reconstructive surgery. Related to the origin of this dominant artery, three main patterns are distinguished. In the most frequent pattern a major role is played by an artery not mentioned in <jats:italic>Nomina Anatomica</jats:italic> (Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1989). This artery usually arises directly from the axillary artery, accompanies the medial pectoral nerve, and supplies the major lateral part of the muscle from its deep surface. For topographical reasons we propose the name “lateral pectoral artery.” The classification, presented in this study, may provide a better insight for the reconstructive surgeon working in this area. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

At lesser depths,\nD. linkii var. fulva showed greatest tolerance to increasing sowing depth, whilst D. tenuior was\nintermediate and D. richardsonii was least tolerant of seed burial. In a separate experiment, seedlings\nof Danthonia linkii var. fulva and two geographically distinct populations of D. richardsonii emerged\nearlier, grew faster and had a higher biomass than those of D. tenuior in response to nutrient supply.\nThe latter population grew more slowly than the others, but by day 54, the number of emergents of\nD. tenuior had equalled those of the other populations. Nutrient addition had little effect on seedling\ndevelopment, except that by day 54, four times normal nutrient level reduced root growth in all four\npopulations. No population by nutrient interactions were found for either time to emergence or for\nseedling biomass up to 54 days from sowing. Increases in shoot biomass and the reversal of shoot to\nroot ratios occurred between 41 and 54 days after sowing, by which time seedling establishment of\nDanthonia was complete.

The principal methods of investigation were pitfall trapping in summer, and quadrat sampling in winter. In addition to carabids, potential food organisms were evaluated from the pitfall catches.The bogs, although of different types and located on different continents, show similar physiognomic vegetation units. Eight of these units are considered relevant as carabid microhabitats. The carabid assemblages of open sunny, and wooded shaded habitats are clearly distinguished. Only a few species are adapted to the extreme environment of open<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>L. habitats. Among them, stenotopic species are dominant. The seasonal distribution of two species on Swedish Ryggmossen [<jats:italic>Agonum ericeti</jats:italic>(Panzer),<jats:italic>Pterostichus rhaeticus</jats:italic>Heer] suggests that the carabids of open bog plateau habitats use damp<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>lawns for their summer activities and migrate to drier hummocks for overwintering.On bog plateaus, larger populations of ground beetles were only found where a pronounced pattern of hummocks and hollows exists. In bogs with a prevailing uniform vegetation of<jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic>mats, carabids were conspicuously scarce. Thus, the development of a bog indigenous carabid fauna is closely related to the presence of a hummock–hollow mosaic. The data indicate that in most bog habitats food is not a limited resource and does not play a key role as a population controlling factor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Evidence exists that night temperatures &lt;18�C immediately preceding flowering in rice crops can adversely affect floret fertility and, hence, yields. It has been suggested that sterility induced by low temperature is also influenced by floodwater depth and nitrogen (N) rate. In southern New South Wales, low night-time temperatures are believed to be a major constraint to the achievement of consistently high yields. The availability of a comprehensive model of rice growth and yield that is sensitive to this constraint would aid the development of better management practices. CERES RICE is a comprehensive model that simulates the phasic development of a rice crop, the growth of its leaves, stems, roots, and panicles, and their response to weather. It also simulates the water and N balances of the crop and the effects of stresses of water and N on the yield-forming processes. The model has been extensively tested in many rice-growing systems in both tropical and temperate environments. However, the original model was unable to simulate the level of chilling injury evident from yield data from southern New South Wales. This paper reports modifications made in the model to simulate these effects and the evaluation of the model in environments of low night temperature. Inclusion of the chilling injury effect greatly improved the accuracy of estimated yields from treatments in an extensive field experiment. However, additional testing with a wider range of data sets is needed to confirm the international applicability of the modifications. </jats:p>"

Egg production rates were independent of the concentration of chlorophyll in situ, the abundance of autotrophic microplankton cells, in situ gut fluorescence, and the rate of ingestion of autotrophic particles. Heterotrophic microplankton—including ciliates and dinoflagellates presumed to be heterotrophic—constituted a disproportionate fraction of the ration of <jats:italic>C. finmarchicus</jats:italic> in the open Gulf of St. Lawrence, despite their relatively low cell densities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> \n   This paper presents a comparison of the effects of RF plasma discharge and ion beam supply on the   growth of cubic boron nitride films formed by excimer laser physical vapor deposition (laser PVD).   The film structure was analyzed by fourier transformation infrared region (FT-IR) spectroscopy and   thin-film X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure of the film deposited with an RF plasma discharge   provided between the substrate and target was hexagonal BN. On the other hand, that of the film   deposited by irradiating the substrate directly with an ion beam was hexagonal BN (hBN) and cubic   BN (cBN). It is thought that direct irradiation of the vapor generated from the target by accelerated   ions increased the activation energy of the vapor, with the result that the film structure was changed.   Besides irradiating the substrate directly with the ion beam resulted primarily in the etching of   hBN while cBN remained. \n   </jats:p>",

A pressure-control method was newly developed to produce precisely controlled surge pulses of source gases. Strong temperature dependence of the growth rate per source cycle obtained for the oxide deposition was caused by the decomposition of metalorganics, and by the thermal desorption of the oxide during the deposition. A critical thickness of 20 nm for the thermal desorption of gallium oxide was observed, which gives the upper limit of the promotive effect of underlying GaAs on thermal desorption of gallium oxide. With implications for in situ process use, deposition of GaAs on gallium oxides and on indium oxides was performed by chemical beam epitaxy, and the differences between the two oxides were discussed from the viewpoint of gallium-atom-induced desorption and selectivity for GaAs deposition.</jats:p>",

Während der Leucinoxidationsmessung erhielten die Ratten eine Ration mit einem festen Anteil an Rohprotein und zwei verschiedenen Gehalten an Leucin. Vor der Oxidationsmessung wurden die Ratten über Nacht gehungert und erhielten 5 g der HP‐Ration für 30 min. vor der <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐Messung in der Atemluft über 7,5 h. Vor der <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐Messung wurde den Tieren außerdem entweder L‐[Carboxyl‐<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]‐Leucin oder L‐[Universal‐<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]‐Leucin verabreicht. Die Leucin‐Überversorgung war durch die Supplementierung mit synthetischen Leucin (70 mg Leucin/g Protein) gegeben. Die Proteinrestriktion verursachte eine geringfügige Absenkung in der kumulativen <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐Ausscheidung bei wachsenden Ratten (P &lt; 0,05), allerdings nur nach der Verabreichung von L‐[Karboxyl‐<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]‐Leucin.

Die hohe Leucinversorgung führte sowohl stündlich als auch kumulativ bei allen vier Versuchsgruppen zu einer höheren <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐Expiration (P &lt; 0,001) ohne nennenswerte Unterschiede hinsichtlich der verabreichten <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C‐Verbindung. Daraus läßt sich schließen, daß sowohl eine Proteinrestriktion als auch das Alter der Tiere keinen wesentlichen Einfluß auf die postprandiale Leucinoxydation ausüben, die erhöhte Versorgung mit synthetischem, freien Leucin aber einen deutlich negativen Effekt auf die Leucinverwertung verursacht.</jats:p>",
