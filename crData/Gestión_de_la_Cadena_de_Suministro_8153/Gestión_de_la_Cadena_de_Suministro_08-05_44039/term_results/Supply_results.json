It gives sufficient conditions for the existence of stable networks and presents an algorithm for finding two of them. One is the best stable network for the agents on the “upstream” end of an industry. The other is best for the agents on the “downstream” end. The paper describes several properties of the set of stable networks and discusses applications of the theory to the design of matching markets with more than two types of agents and to the empirical analysis of supply chains.

It is suggested that more use can be made of web pages to provide information about the policies and services that individual libraries offer. It is reported that the use of credit cards and IFLA vouchers as methods of payment has removed some barriers to co‐operation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Customers increasingly demand that companies offer a wide variety of products and services. As a result, many companies spend millions of dollars conducting profitability analyses of their customers. For instance, the banking industry alone spends an estimated $500 million per year on customer profitability analyses. Accordingly, customer profitability analysis is listed as one of the recent major developments in managerial accounting (Cotton 2005). Customer profitability analysis refers to the practice of estimating the profitability of individual customers and identifying both customers that create value for the company and, just as importantly, those customers that destroy value. Effective customer profitability analysis provides the company with a strong competitive advantage by improving key strategic and operating decisions involving customer selection and retention. For example, Sprint Nextel drew the attention of investors, analysts, and customers alike when it “fired” 1,000 of its worst customers via a form letter (Srivastava 2007). This case reflects the experiences of several international companies in the automotive supply industry and provides you with an opportunity to enhance your knowledge about customer profitability. First, the case demonstrates the importance of customer profitability analysis. Second, the case enhances your ability to perform customer profitability analysis. Third, it helps you improve your critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills. Finally, the case enables you to integrate business knowledge across functional boundaries.</jats:p>",

Water supply facilities are now obliged to estimate the radon exposure of their staff. In 75 water supply facilities in Bavaria, Germany, radon exposures above the action limit of 6 mSv per year were determined. In these facilities the radon exposure has to be continuously monitored. By the proposal of the Bavarian Environment Agency (LfU), this should be done by continuous wearing of personal track-etch detectors, that are changed every three months. The results are sent to the LfU and reported to the central German dose register. Because of measuring periods of three months a high radon exposure that could probably exceed the annual limit of 20 mSv can be recognised at an early stage and immediate protection measures can be taken. In collaboration with the University of Regensburg remedial strategies for the permanent reduction of the radon exposure have been developed. The exposure is effectively reduced by reducing the time spent inside the units as much as possible. A very effective way to reduce the radon concentration inside buildings and hence the radon exposure is to blow fresh air directly into the work place of the staff with stationary or mobile devices. An alternative way to reduce the indoor air concentration is to avoid any transfer of radon polluted air exhausted from purification tanks to indoor air. For a long lasting success of the remedial measures a work instruction was developed by the LfU. All plants, their mean radon concentration and the measures to be taken have to be stated there.</jats:p>",

The impact of varying current profiles is shown to be minimal. In a regular power grid with regular bump connections, the impact of on-chip inductance on the cycle average of the supply voltage can be neglected, even for a worst case estimation of on-chip inductance. Whereas, the maximum transient power supply drop can be significantly underestimated by neglecting on-chip inductance. The impact of on-chip inductance in a System-on-Chip (SoC) environment also can be neglected if the on-chip inductance is conservativly estimated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>Information sharing among firms within many industries accounts for a substantial part of the gains from information technology adoption in these industries. In this paper we examine the determinants of information sharing between retailers and their suppliers, in the food industry supply chain. Using a data set known as the Super Market Panel Data gathered by the University of Minnesota's Food Industry Center, the behavior of food retailers is examined in their adoption of information sharing technologies that facilitate vertical exchange of information with suppliers. Evidence supports the hypothesis that retail firms with larger number of suppliers are more inclined to share, rather than to withhold, information. Prior theoretical work suggests that this happens because retail firms with large number of suppliers are less concerned about opportunistic behavior of suppliers from the misuse of retailer information by the supplier. We also find that self‐distribution chains are more inclined to share information. Finally, the structure of the market plays an interesting role in the type of information sharing platforms that the retailers adopt.</jats:italic> </jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Dans de nombreux secteurs, l'échange d'information entre entreprises représente une part substantielle des gains issus de l'adoption des technologies de l'information. Dans le présent article, nous avons examiné les déterminants de l'échange d'information entre les détaillants de la chaîne d'approvisionnement alimentaire et leurs fournisseurs. À l'aide de l'ensemble de données Supermarket Panel Data, établi par le Food Industry Center de l'University of Minnesota, nous avons examiné le comportement des détaillants en alimentation quant à l'adoption des technologies d'échange d'information facilitant l'échange d'information vertical avec les fournisseurs. Les observations appuient l'hypothèse selon laquelle les détaillants qui comptent de nombreux fournisseurs sont plus disposés àéchanger qu’à retenir l'information. D'après des études théoriques antérieures, cette situation serait attribuable au fait que les détaillants qui comptent de nombreux fournisseurs sont moins préoccupés par le comportement opportuniste de fournisseurs qui utiliseraient de façon malveillante de l'information sur le détaillant. Nous avons également observé que les chaînes d'autodistribution étaient plus enclines àéchanger de l'information. Finalement, la structure du marché joue un rôle intéressant dans le type de plateformes d'échange d'information qu’adoptent les détaillants.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We consider a supplier–customer relationship where the customer faces a typical Newsvendor problem of determining perishable capacity to meet uncertain demand. The customer outsources a critical, demand‐enhancing service to an outside supplier, who receives a fixed share of the revenue from the customer. Given such a linear sharing contract, the customer chooses capacity and the service supplier chooses service effort level before demand is realized. We consider the two cases when these decisions are made simultaneously (simultaneous game) or sequentially (sequential game). For each game, we analyze how the equilibrium solutions vary with the parameters of the problem. We show that in the equilibrium, it is possible that either the customer's capacity increases or the service supplier's effort level decreases when the supplier receives a larger share of the revenue. We also show that given the same sharing contract, the sequential game always induces a higher capacity and more effort. For the case of additive effort effect and uniform demand distribution, we consider the customer's problem of designing the optimal contract with or without a fixed payment in the contract, and obtain sensitivity results on how the optimal contract depends on the problem parameters. For the case of fixed payment, it is optimal to allocate more revenue to the supplier to induce more service effort when the profit margin is higher, the cost of effort is lower, effort is more effective in stimulating demand, the variability of demand is smaller or the supplier makes the first move in the sequential game. For the case of no fixed payment, however, it is optimal to allocate more revenue to the supplier when the variability of demand is larger or its mean is smaller. Numerical examples are analyzed to validate the sensitivity results for the case of normal demand distribution and to provide more managerial insights. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Importers rate small farmers poorly on their ability to achieve the last two factors, but these are also the items rated least important to the importers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aeolian sediment transport systems have been treated frequently as transport limited, where transport is governed by the force of the wind, or as supply limited, where sediment transport is controlled by the availability of surface grains. Although many arid environments are dominated by supply‐limited surfaces, almost all available dust emission and sand transport models are restricted to transport‐limited conditions. To examine the emission of PM<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> (particulate matter ≤10 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m aerodynamic diameter) and horizontal sand transport from supply‐limited environments, a series of wind tunnel tests were conducted in the Mojave Desert, California. In situ testing was conducted with an open‐floored, portable wind tunnel (12 × 1 × 0.75 m) on a variety of natural soils having disturbed and undisturbed surface conditions. Results indicate that for these supply‐limited environments, PM<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> emissions are primarily driven by the aerodynamic resuspension of loose surface material as opposed to the dynamic entrainment mechanisms associated with saltating grains. Emission rates were directly influenced by wind shear and mechanical disturbance and indirectly influenced by soil texture. In addition, disturbance of the surface was found to increase the potential for multiple emission events, which may affect the temporal accumulation of atmospheric dust.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While there is great interest in the degree to which local interactions “scale‐up” to predict regional patterns of abundance, few studies in marine systems have simultaneously examined patterns of abundance at both the large scale (tens of kilometers) typical of larval movement and the small scale (meters) typical of post‐settlement interactions. We addressed this gap by monitoring larval supply, adult survivorship, and giant kelp (<jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Macrocystis pyrifera</jats:named-content>, a primary habitat‐forming species) abundance for 13 populations of kelp bass (<jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Paralabrax clathratus</jats:named-content>) spread over ∼200 km in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. At the small, within‐site scale, both recruitment and adult survivorship of kelp bass were density‐dependent and positively related to kelp abundance. At the larger, among‐site scale, the spatial pattern of adult kelp bass abundance was predicted well by the pattern of kelp bass larval supply, but there was a consistent negative spatial relationship between kelp abundance and kelp bass larval supply despite the positive effects of kelp on kelp bass at the smaller spatial scale. This large‐scale negative relationship was likely a product of a channel‐wide spatial mismatch between oceanographic conditions that favor kelp survival and those that concentrate and distribute fish larvae. These results generally support the recruit–adult hypothesis: kelp bass populations are limited by recruitment at low recruit densities but by density‐dependent competition for food resources and/or predator refuges at high recruit densities. At the same time, spatial variation in kelp abundance produced substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in kelp bass demographics, which argues for a multispecies, metacommunity approach to predicting kelp bass dynamics.</jats:p>",

In pursuit of such goals they are increasingly turning to the use of dynamic business models. Dynamic business models represent continuous change and therefore make firms learn constantly new and better ways of doing things. These changes are manifestations of inter‐firm knowledge transfer. The aim of this research is to explore dynamic business models as an example of inter‐firm knowledge transfer. Adopting a case study approach, we examine three components of dynamic business models – network structure, inter‐firm routines and knowledge forms – and describe their integration through a problem solving approach to building an offshore supply network. Our empirical findings suggest that dynamic business models help organizations identify and link key actors with each other (at the firm and individual level), and aid the identification and specification of appropriate knowledge types and knowledge transfer mechanisms for different actors, in different contexts.</jats:p>",

Since then mid‐season purchasing has evolved into purchasing throughout the year; and the ‘throwaway market’ (now called fast fashion) has become almost the norm. Here we revisit one of those British retailers (Marks &amp; Spencer) together with its Turkish suppliers and observe a trend towards the diffusion of design capabilities to suppliers that is more widespread than is suggested in the literature. We also consider the question of how most appropriately to conceptualize the nature of these retailer‐ supplier relations in today's circumstances. We especially look into the manner in which these relations are reflected in price negotiations, the eventual distribution of the value‐added, and the nature of everyday interactions such as accreditation and reclamation practices. We conclude that even though Turkish suppliers seem to be successfully upgrading into design–a high value‐added activity–the question of whether or not this development has entailed a renegotiation of power between retailer and supplier remains a complicated one.</jats:p>",

Taking the professional evaluation practice and actual on-site measurements into account, this study examines the probable maximum demands of the water supply system for some Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong using the Bayesian approach. The installed capacities, usage patterns, flow rates and `per customer' hourly demands of tea urns, dishwashers, kitchen sinks and washbasins employed in a typical Chinese restaurant were evaluated. With the assumption of normally distributed discharge probability, the fixture units of these appliances were estimated for local Chinese restaurants; comparisons with the existing design values were also made. The posterior results, which showed that the sinks for tea urn and dishwasher required bigger plant capacity, would be useful for updating the calculation of water demands in certain Chinese restaurants to justify the installation cost. </jats:p><jats:p> Practical application: The probable maximum demands of the water supply system for some Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong were examined using the Bayesian approach; the fixture units of tea urns, dishwashers, kitchen sinks and washbasins employed in a typical Chinese restaurant were estimated for local Chinese restaurants.

This age discrepancy increases with rising sea level since the Last Glacial Maximum. A progressive shift in TOC <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C toward more negative values with rising sea level reflects an increasing fractional contribution of terrestrial organics (soil organics, plant debris, and/or fossil organics) to the buried organic pool.

During the Holocene when sea level is above −40 m, <jats:italic>δ</jats:italic><jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>TOC</jats:sub> values stabilize within a narrow range (−22.3 to −22.8‰) while age discrepancies continue to increase and less chemically weathered sediments are deposited. The increase in age discrepancy between TOC and foraminifera in the Holocene may be due to a wetter climate that drove higher rates of physical weathering on Taiwan and greater transport rates of fossil organic C‐bearing lithogenic sediment to the ocean. The climate impact on the relative delivery of fossil and nonfossil TOC in depositional settings influenced by fluvial sources should be considered in interpretations of sedimentary C isotope records.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Industry, government, and labor representatives have all acknowledged that air supply systems on commercial aircraft sometimes get contaminated with pyrolyzed engine oil or hydraulic fluid, but efforts to define “sometimes” have been lacking. Despite the lack of attention it has received, the answer to this “how often” question is important because it will influence the willingness of industry, as well as regulators and legislators, to develop and implement control measures to prevent such air supply contamination. To address this data gap, an industrial hygienist collected reports of air supply contamination over an 18-month period (January 2006 through June 2007) from the following sources, all per defined inclusion criteria: (1) Service Difficulty Reports (SDR) and Accident and Incident Data System (AIDS) reports that airlines submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); (2) incidents that flight attendants documented with one of 20 airlines and copied to one crewmember labor union; and (3) newspaper clips identified in online searches. A qualified airline mechanic reviewed each SDR and AIDS report with an oil or hydraulic fluid-related mechanical defect that did not explicitly mention oil or hydraulic fluid in combination with a specific word that indicated air supply contamination (i.e., “fume,” “haze,” “mist,” “odor,” “smell,” or “smoke”) to determine its eligibility. The resulting dataset of 470 air supply contamination events reported in the U.S. commercial fleet over an 18-month period translates into an average of 0.86 events per day and includes 350 incidents reported by airlines to the FAA, 115 reported flight attendants to their airline, and 37 incidents reported by at least one newspaper. There was limited overlap between sources. The data are discussed in detail along with commentary on whether and how the data are representative, the health and operational costs associated with air supply contamination, and some preventive measures.</jats:p>",

The degree of stomachic repletion and of accumulated visceral fat was analyzed, as was the intestinal length in each class of total length. The frequency of occurrence and the degree of food preference (DFP) of the food items of Brycon opalinus were determined by separating the vegetal and animal items, autochthonous and allochthonous, by insect order and vegetal family consumed. The frequency of occurrence of items of animal origin was found to be equivalent to that of vegetal origin, thus characterizing the omnivorism of Brycon opalinus feeding.</jats:p>",

This paper explores a range of metrics and benchmarks that are based on understanding of the whole construction supply chain, together with its impacts on the global climate and resource base. It draws on new evidence from the UK resource analysis framework with an associated toolkit, the Resource and Energy Analysis Program modelling and data system. The resource flow and metabolism of the construction industry has been explored within this framework, by application of input–output analysis, at national and regional level. The result provides a first-estimate evidence base for issues such as ‘carbon neutral’ buildings, housing replacement against rehabilitation, local against imported materials and ‘one planet’ performance targets for sustainable construction. These first results also show future directions for improved methods of assessment and benchmarking. </jats:p>",

We succeeded in achieving a dramatic improvement in the surface roughness of AlN/AlGaN layer by introducing a short‐period pulsed supply of TMAl during the growth intervals of a ‘standard’ AlGaN growth regime. We speculate that the improvement in surface roughness is due to the realization of stable group III (+c) polarity by the growth of an Al‐rich surface. In addition, we have found that this method is effective for reducing threading dislocation densities (TDD). The TDD was reduced from 2.9×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> to 1.1×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup> by introducing the TMAl pulsed supply growth. We fabricated a 350 nm‐band InAlGaN multi‐quantum well (MQW) UV light‐emitting diode (LED) on an AlN/AlGaN template formed by the TMAl pulsed supply method, and obtained an output power of 1.95 mW under room temperature (RT) CW operation. The output power of the LED was increased by a factor of 1.7 by introducing the TMAl pulsed supply method. (© 2008 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",
