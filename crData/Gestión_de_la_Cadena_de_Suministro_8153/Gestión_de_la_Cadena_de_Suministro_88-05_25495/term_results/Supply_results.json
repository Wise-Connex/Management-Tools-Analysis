      "abstract": "<jats:p> The prolonged performance of submaximal exercise depends on the adequate supply of exogenous fuels (e.g., hepatic glucose) to slow down the use of endogenous substrates (e.g, intramuscular fat or glycogen) and delay their depletion. This paper investigates the adaptive strategies available to vertebrates for increasing the rate of exogenous fuel supply in endurance locomotion. Two steps can be defined for the design of a \"good\" system: (i) the choice of oxidizable fuels and storage sites that maximize the rate of energy transfer to the working muscle and (ii) the provision of adequate regulatory mechanisms which alter substrate fluxes rapidly in response to work of different intensities. The principal oxidizable fuels used by vertebrates (free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, and lactate) are examined to determine the major constraints on maximal supply rates. The delivery of albumin binding sites to adipose tissue represents a specific constraint on FFA transport to working muscles. Furthermore, because the supply of all exogenous fuels is probably limited by membrane transport, animals requiring the rapid use of oxidizable substrates to sustain locomotion can follow two strategies: (i) switch to endogenous substrates whenever possible to avoid this constraint and (ii) evolve different transmembrane fuel carriers or augment the density of existing ones to increase maximal rates of substrate translocation across cell membranes. </jats:p>",

No significant compositional changes occurred during the 22‐day eruption, and along the 20 km vent system, even though crystallinity increased substantially, accompanying a decline in the eruption rate. Such homogeneity in lava composition is typical of many historic Mauna Loa eruptions. The 1984 lava, along with most other homogeneous Mauna Loa lavas, is multiply saturated, crystallizing olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase. Bulk compositions are “perched” at the intersection of an olivine‐control trend with a trend for more differentiated lavas. There is no evidence to indicate that the 1984 lava is a differentiate of the 1975 magma, or that it results from mixing a new batch of magma with differentiated melt remaining in the magmatic plumbing system after the 1975 eruption. It is proposed that these lavas are erupted directly from a small, continuously replenished magma reservoir located about 3–4 km beneath the summit caldera. Successive eruptions therefore provide a sampling of magma chamber processes, and small but discernible changes in lava composition reflect the competing processes of magma supply, differentiation, and eruption.</jats:p>",

Several authors have used it to indicate the strength of the industrial forward linkages in the economy at hand. Others have used it to indicate the impact of specific supply shortages on output levels. Finally, it has been used as a general description and projection vehicle for entire economies that are thought of as being supply‐constrained, such as centrally planned economies.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper critically reviews this literature and concludes that most of these applications suffer from more or less severe theoretical flaws. It is argued that using the supply‐driven model as a descriptive device to indicate the strength of forward linkages is justified. In the case of impact studies, straightforward use of the model is criticized and a more careful estimation procedure is suggested. For the purpose of a general description of a supply‐driven economy, a dynamic optimization model is proposed to replace the theoretically implausible, supply‐driven input‐output model.</jats:p>",

This example of convergent evolution is used to identify common features of cardiac oxygen delivery and fuel supply in relation to energy demand. Foremost, both groups of animals exhibit morphological alterations to enhance oxygen delivery to the myocardium. In cephalopods, the heart is positioned to directly receive oxygenated blood, and coronary arteries can be present in both fish and cephalopods. At the cellular level, oxygen extraction is facilitated by elevated concentrations of myoglobin in the hearts of fish, which face particularly acute low levels of extracellular oxygen. These features represent adaptations to meet the challenge of oxygen delivery. In temperate-zone teleosts and cephalopods, maximal in vitro activity of ATPase reflects maximal in situ oxygen demand. In both groups of animals, there is a linear relationship between maximal in vitro hexokinase and ATPase activities, and in temperate-zone teleosts a similar relationship exists between carnitine palmitoyl transferase and ATPase activities. These enzyme activities are interpreted to reflect adaptations in maximal capacities to utilize glucose and fatty acids in response to increased energy demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Net photosynthesis, concurrent carbon export and starch, sucrose and inorganic phosphorus concentrations were measured in leaves of white clover (<jats:italic>Trifolium repens</jats:italic> L. cv. Grasslands Huia) grown at four levels of phosphorus supply in the presence or absence of mineral nitrogen. The nitrogen treatments had no effect on growth, photosyntheis or carbon export. At the three higher levels of phosphorus supply, the amount of carbon exported was about 77% of net fixation. Photosynthesis and export per leaf decreased with phosphorus supply, primarily through the effect of phosphorus supply on leaf area. The rate of photosynthesis was reduced only at the lowest level of phosphorus supply.</jats:p><jats:p>Inorganic phosphorus rose with phosphorus supply but starch concentration was unaffected. Sucrose was reduced at the lowest level of phosphorus supply but not significantly affected at higher levels. The ratio between starch and sucrose concentration was also unaffected at the higher levels, but was increased at the lowest level of supply. There thus appeared to be direct effects of phosphorus supply on photosynthesis, partitioning of carbon to carbohydrates and, by implication, export, only at the lowest level of phosphorus supply. As leaf area and plant growth were affected over the whole range of phosphorus supply, factors other than photosynthesis per se must have determined the response of growth to phosphorus supply.</jats:p>",

Though being successful in generating positive returns on advertising it was found that a 35% reduction in the advertising expenditures would have been optimal in the marginal sense.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigated dobutamine effect on infarct size during permanent coronary artery occlusion in dogs. The coronary artery of closed-chest dog was embolized by a 2.5-mm Teflon bead. Regional flow was measured 8 min after embolization with microspheres and, in drug-treated animals, again 20 min after starting dobutamine infusion (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 5 h immediately after the first microsphere measurement). The percent of the ischemic region progressing to infarct was determined 48 h later in each animal. Percent necrosis in the control group correlated closely with collateral flow to the epicardial one-third of the ischemic zone normalized against flow to the corresponding layer in the nonischemic zone. This flow should reflect an index of supply (collateral flow) and demand (flow to the nonischemic region determined by autoregulation). Percent necrosis in the drug-treated group did not correlate with normalized collateral flow measurement made before drug infusion, indicating that dobutamine had modified the course of infarction. Percent necrosis correlated well with normalized collateral flow measured during drug infusion, and that relationship was not different from that in the control group. Dobutamine increased infarct size over that expected from the predrug flow measurement in some dogs and reduced it in others. In all cases, however, the drug effect on infarct size was clearly reflected in normalized collateral flow measurement during drug infusion. Percent necrosis correlated with absolute collateral flow but less closely than with the normalized one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The effects of a high dose of acetylcholine (ACh) on oxygen consumption (VO2) and changes in phosphorus energy metabolites during secretion were studied in isolated perfused mandibular gland of rats at 24 degrees C. Sugar phosphates (SP), Pi, phosphocreatine (PCr), and ATP were identified by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. One micromole ACh induced a tachyphylactic secretory response, a persistently elevated VO2, and decreased PCr and ATP; 1 mM ACh caused an initial burst of secretion that was followed by suppression of secretion and a rapid increase in the VO2 to the same level as that with 1 microM ACh. These findings indicate a dissociation between secretion and VO2. During stimulation with 1 mM ACh, the level of PCr first decreased and then partially recovered, but the level of ATP continued to decrease and the levels of Pi and SP increased markedly. These findings suggest compartmentalization of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) systems and the possibility that a high concentration of ACh interferes with the transport of PCr between one CPK system near adenosinetriphosphatase and another system near mitochondria in acinar cells. </jats:p>",
