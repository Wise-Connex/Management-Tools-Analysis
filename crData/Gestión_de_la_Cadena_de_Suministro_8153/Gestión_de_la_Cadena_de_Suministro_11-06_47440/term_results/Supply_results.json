      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Significant amounts of carbon and nutrients are released to the atmosphere due to large fires in forests. Characterization of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the intense fire emissions is crucial for assessing the atmospheric loadings of trace gases and aerosols. This paper discusses issues of the representation of forest fires in the estimation of emissions and the application to an atmospheric chemistry transport model (CTM). The potential contribution of forest fires to the deposition of bioavailable iron (Fe) into the ocean is highlighted, with a focus on mega fires in eastern Siberia.  Satellite products of burned area, active fire, and land cover are used to estimate biomass burning emissions in conjunction with a biogeochemical model. Satellite-derived plume height from MISR is used for the injection height of boreal forest fire emissions. This methodology is applied to quantify fire emission rates in each three-dimensional grid location in the high latitude Northern Hemisphere (&gt;30° N latitude) over a 5-yr period from 2001 to 2005. There is large interannual variation in forest burned area during 2001–2005 (13–49 × 103 km2 yr−1) which results in a corresponding variation in the annual emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) (14–81 Tg CO y−1). Satellite observations of CO column from MOPITT are used to evaluate the model performance in simulating the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the fire emissions. The model results for CO enhancements due to eastern Siberian fires are in good agreement with MOPITT observations. These validation results suggest that the model using emission rates estimated in this work is able to describe the interannual changes in CO due to intense forest fires.  Bioavailable iron is derived from atmospheric processing of relatively insoluble iron from desert sources by anthropogenic pollutants (mainly sulfuric acid formed from oxidation of SO2) and from direct emissions of soluble iron from combustion sources. Emission scenarios for IPCC AR5 report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Fifth Assessment Report) suggest that anthropogenic SO2 emissions are suppressed in the future to improve air quality. In future warmer and drier climate, severe fire years such as 2003 may become more frequent in boreal regions. The fire emission rates estimated in this study are applied to the aerosol chemistry transport model to examine the relative importance of biomass burning sources of soluble iron compared to those from dust sources. The model reveals that extreme fire events contribute to a significant deposition of soluble iron (20–40 %) to downwind regions over the western North Pacific Ocean, compared to the dust sources with no atmospheric processing by acidic species. These results suggest that the supply of nutrients from large forest fires plays a role as a negative biosphere-climate feedback with regards to the ocean fertilization.\n                    </jats:p>"

One of these problems is the crisis in urban water supply systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the water supply system crisis in urban environment (WSC) able to tackle with the ambiguity of the real available data.Design/methodology/approach – The applied methodology comprises the following steps: (1) identification of the influencing factors in WSC; (2) proposal of a conceptual model for WSC description; (3) gathering and simulation of the necessary and available data; (4) optimization of the conceptual model parameters; and (5) verification of the proposed model performance.Findings – The results indicated that there is a great amount of influencing factors in WSC (showed in the complete text); the conceptual model that was developed is composed by two others partial models ( ). The first partial model explained the water consumption ( ),and the second partial model explained the water availability ( ), in which functions are related to influencing factors in water consumption (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, revenues collected, unemployment indicator), and functions are related to the influencing factors in water availability (i.e. total water-loss, intermittence in water supply system). The proposed conceptual model has showed good agreement to the simulated data.Originality/value – The paper is among the first works to describe a WSC model and to analyze the possibility of applying fuzzy logic to deal with the ambiguity of the real data. The water supply crisis in urban environments was adequately modelled.</jats:p>"

Firstly, by using Apparel Popularity Index (API) model, a kind of pricing model for supply chain has been built. Then, by introducing cooperation and other constraint conditions, a kind of cooperative pricing model was constructed. This model is a kind of Stackelberg game. The manufacturer and the retailer obtained their excess profits through the game. Lastly, this paper gave a numerical example which demonstrated that the excess profit of the cooperative supply chain was constant, and when the constraint conditions changed, the excess profit space would change at the meantime.

Therefore manufacturers need to handle the returned product in an effective way to improve customer's relationship and decrease its associated costs.This paper describes the return processes of two Spanish companies, pertaining to the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) group, focusing on the forward and reverse flows in the supply chain and highlighting the relevance of managing reverse supply chain issues efficiently. The methods used are interviews with the main managers at both companies. We have found that the main motivation of these companies to accept returns is to create a good company's image. Additionally, the same design of return processes and logistics networks has been identified in both companies, independently of the company's industry sector and the management qualification.</jats:p>"

There are two hidden layers with a maximum of 64 nodes per layer in the model. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented to optimize the node numbers of the hidden layers in the model.

Lighter products have been necessary when considering in taking action to reduce fuel consumption. One of the key is the utilization of high strength and light materials, such as stainless, high-tensile strength steels and magnesium alloys, which are difficult to be formed due to their high strength compared to normal steel pipes. This paper is concerned with the development of pressing technology that copes with forming relatively high strength stainless pipe with screw threads on the surface of pipes. Our new press-forming process in order to obtain accurate screw threads on the stainless pipe was tested. A 3-D digitizer was used for the measurement of the accuracy of manufactured pipes by the proposed pressing method. It is found that the proposed our press-forming was effective to improve decrease of pipe thickness compared to conventional roll forming technology. The maximum decrease in material thickness was 20% using our press-forming process for screw threads in the formed pipe.</jats:p>"

The ACT network depicts a strong evidence of actor interdependence and long‐term relationships. However, the key supply chain enabler – the use of information technology – was found to be lacking, leading to delays and disruptions in the supply chain system. Disruption was found to be the main detrimental factor to the supply chain although delay was found to be occurring more frequently. Price increases indicated a low effect on the supply network at the pharmacy level, but the general price of the highly subsidised effective ACT (Coartem) remains very high.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Owing to constraints in accessibility, it was challenging to contact all the actors in the network individually, especially the consumer.

Time capacity adjustment is required if production-distribution plan obtained from analytical model requires longer production and delivery time than available. The adjustment is using a procedure developed based on duration obtained from simulation model and is used to obtain adjusted time capacity. The implementation of hybrid method to resolve integrated production-distribution problem on two echelon supply chain with 2 factories and 5 DCs shows a feasible solution was obtained on the third iteration</jats:p>"

The study used an explorative study in measuring to which extent Tanzanian SMEs adopt SCM practices and whether there is a trend towards increased adoption of these practices over time. In doing so, test propositions on the differences between manufacturing firms, and between medium-sized and small enterprises were done. Furthermore, the motives of SMEs to engage in SCM innovations and perceived management challenges are explored. From analysis of our findings, we conclude that, SMEs still lag behind larger firms in utilizing the benefits of SCM practices. SMEs still face obstacles like knowledge, financial resources, technology and the like. Lack of trust between small firms has been identified as a major non-financial obstacle to information sharing and integration with other suppliers in the chain.</jats:p>"

We adopt a spatial correlations approach and instrument for current immigration using ethnic networks. We find that female immigration increases the local availability of household services and reduces their price. It also increases the labor supply of skilled native women, by allowing them to return to work earlier after childbirth, and to continue working while caring for elderly dependents. Immigration can account for one third of the recent increase in the employment rate of college-educated women providing child or elderly care.</jats:p>"

This certification of quality affected several actors, since the consequences of the label for the different actors involved are unknown. Thus, in this study, the implications of the certification for the grape growers and wineries were identified, through interviews and questionnaires. The main results point to a scenario of value creation in the viticulture network. The label has a positive impact on the sales of fine and common wines of the wineries. It was also identified that the certification shows a positive influence on the income of the region's producers. The research demonstrates that the profits existent in networks overcome the risks and costs of such collective systems.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the perception of logistics professionals about the effectiveness of MMOG/LE (Materials Management Operating Guideline/Logistics Evaluation), which is a set of recommendations regarding logistics and materials management that was created by the automotive industry to be used by those comprising its supply chain. The respondents, who were naturally all from the automotive industry (they were suppliers of large vehicle assemblers with industrial plants located in Brazil), had been previously trained on this logistics performance evaluation tool in order to implement it in their organizations. They filled in an email survey with Likert scale questions, early in 2008. Among other findings of the research, it was noticed that the impact of the MMOG/LE recommendation is stronger with respect to activities that had not been previously addressed by quality norms and recommendations. Most respondents also considered that their organizations were already efficient in integrating their activities with their customers (car assemblers) but rarely with their suppliers, which was acknowledged to be the bottleneck of their logistics systems.</jats:p>"

In this study, we used finite element methods to simulate the flow profile as well as oxygen and glucose supply to the multilayered cells in a microwell array chip for static and perfusion cultures. The simulation results indicated that oxygen supply is more crucial than glucose supply in both static and perfusion cultures, and that the oxygen supply through the wall of the perfusion culture chip is important in perfusion cultures. Glucose concentrations decline with time in static cultures, whereas they can be maintained at a constant level over time in perfusion cultures. The simulation of perfusion cultures indicated that the important parameters for glucose supply are the flow rate of the perfusion medium and the length of the cell culture chamber. In a perfusion culture chip made of oxygen-permeable materials, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane, oxygen is hardly supplied via the perfusion medium, but mainly supplied through the walls of the perfusion culture chip. The simulation of perfusion cultures indicated that the important parameters for oxygen supply are the thickness of the flow channel and the oxygen permeability of the walls of the channel, i.e., the type of material and the thickness of the wall.</jats:p>",

With the development of science and technology, the request of the performance of accelerometers is increasingly higher and the precision of reference directly affects the performance of accelerometers. Therefore, a reference voltage applicable to accelerometers is presented based on the analysis of basic principles of conventional bandgap reference (BGR) in this paper. A high-order curvature compensation technique, which uses a temperature dependent resistor ratio generated by a high poly resistor and a nwell resistor, effectively serves to reduce temperature coefficient of proposed reference voltage circuit and to a large extent improve its performance. To achieve a high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) over a broad frequency range, a pre-regulator is introduced to remain the supply voltage of the core circuit of BGR relatively independent of the global supply voltage. The proposed circuitry is designed in standard 2.0<jats:italic>μm</jats:italic> CMOS process. The simulated result shows that the average temperature coefficient is less than 2ppm/°C in the temperature range from -40 to 120°C. The improvement on temperature coefficient (TC) is about 10 times reduction compared to the conventional approach. And the PSR at DC frequency and 1kHz achieves -107 and -71dB respectively at 9.0V supply voltage.</jats:p>"

Drawing on case study evidence from three sectors – business services, information and communication technology (ICT) and food manufacture - we focus on the experiences of workers, who have been neglected in extant debates. We find that move to supply LPOs is extremely challenging for EMBs. Although workers express satisfaction with working relationships, the power of LPOs contributes to a tightening of control over practices like recruitment, work organization and work hours. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The healthcare industry in India caters to a large population, and the sector is expected to continue growing close to previously projected rates of 10 to 12 per cent. The administrative and management complexities of a large organisation like a hospital need the frequency matching and fine-tuning of all the associated staff with the hierarchy. A qualified man-agement graduate specially trained to work within the health sector would have an advantage in the inter-disciplinary interactions, effective and efficient management of the available resources, coordination along the hierarchy, logistics and supply-chain related issues along with many other issues that are required in a hospital. It is evident that there is a huge backlog of trained hospital managers and administrators to work for hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, health insurance and third-party administration and other health care provider organisations. Despite having a diverse range of options to choose the educational institutions for such managerial courses, there is still a gap between the supply and the demand side, as no exhaustive list of program related data from these institutes is available till date. This article analyses the demand and supply issues surrounding courses offering hospital management in India, thereby attempting to highlight the current mismatch. A systematic, predefined approach was used to collect and assemble the data. All the institutes offering such courses were contacted for detailed infor-mation. Fifty one institutes have been identified which annually produce around 2500 qualified professionals to work in the domain of hospital management. The article also discusses the demand analysis where these prospective students can be placed. To estimate these numbers, various stakeholders of the hospital industry were consulted and desk reviews were performed. An estimated 21,750 professionals would be required based upon the country’s present status, which reflects the dearth in their workforce capacity. The findings could be adapted for future health work force planning in the country. </jats:p>",

Despite the abundance of theoretical studies extolling the advisability of smooth intra-company interfacing, the operations strategy literature has not been as prolific regarding tools to increase this desired integration. This paper develops an uncomplicated multi-period analytical model that helps increase coordination of the engineering, purchasing, marketing, and sales areas among themselves and with manufacturing by focusing on the overall company objective of maximizing contribution to profits. The paper begins describing the theoretical underpinnings of production and operations processes as they relate to the strategy of the firm, presents the model, and then expands its scope to include interfaces with other functional areas of the firm. The methodology is based on a two-stage multi-period optimization model for aggregate production planning encompassing component supply management and final assembly. This methodology expands the concept of Sales and Operations Planning (S&amp;OP) through a linear programming model that uses cost and profit contribution data to select the optimal product and customer mix. The sensitivity of results to costing and pricing data leads to increased cross-functional coordination. An illustrative application improving the medium-term operations strategy of a Brazilian OEM manufacturer is presented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radio Frequency Identification is going to play a veryimportant role as auto-identification solution for manyapplication scenarios, where item-level tagging and highperformance are crucial. In such a context, the use of passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tags is strongly suggested but, unfortunately, general-purpose commercial tags could not meet all the requirements in presence of critical operating conditions, including the presence of metals and liquids, the misalignment between tag and reader antennas, and the need of multiple reading of tags. In this paper, the main features that a UHF tag should own to work properly in the whole supply chain are presented. A tag, named below Enhanced tag, satisfying all theindividuated requirements has been also realized and validated in a controlled test environment simulating the pharmaceutical supply chain. Tests have been focused on the above-mentioned critical conditions. The performance of the Enhanced tag, in terms of successful read rate, has been compared with that of some commercial Far Field and Near Field UHF tags. The experimental results are impressive and clearly demonstrate that ad hoc Far Field UHF tags are able to effectively solve many of the performance degradation problems affecting generalpurpose tags. Finally, the proposed tag has been also tested in extreme conditions, applying it directly on Tetra Pak packages containing liquid, with interesting results in terms of platformtolerant features.</jats:p>"

As a social consensus grew up around the market, town and city councils were able to forge a far-reaching grain supply policy that encouraged consumption and incentivized local production. However, rising indebtedness forced the municipal authorities to reduce public provision and increase the taxation of grain in the seventeenth century. These measures in turn encouraged both private initiatives in the market and an emerging black market. Despite efforts to moderate the worst effects of these phenomena, reform had serious consequences for the poorest town dwellers.</jats:p>",

We propose here that logistics decisions concerning security in the supply chain will be made more effectively when made in concert with decisions in related supply chain processes, especially supplier and carrier selection. Indeed, managers may minimize cost, transit time, and security risk by integrating decision processes internally, as well as with their carrier's and supplier's operations. Thus, we account for both intra‐firm collaboration between logistics and purchasing managers, as well as inter‐firm collaboration among buyers, suppliers, and carriers in a supply chain. In this paper, we propose a decision process that features a set of security rules and a multi‐objective optimization model to accomplish this aim. We then provide an illustration to demonstrate the potential usefulness of these concepts in practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is experiencing rapid urbanisation coupled with high economic growth rates. This situation is both a challenge and an opportunity for the upgrading of existing technical infrastructures. Regarding wastewater treatment, the situation in Hanoi today is characterised by a lack of wastewater treatment plants, processing only a small fraction of the accumulating wastewater. Prevalent means of sanitation are septic tanks installed under buildings for the collection of domestic wastewaters, with overflowing liquids draining into the groundwater in an uncontrolled manner. This decentralised means of sanitation is therefore currently not able to clean domestic wastewaters in an effective way. This paper explores circumstances under which a semi-centralised approach can offer a sustainable solution to cope with these challenges in Hanoi. The approach has been designed to meet the challenges of fast growing urban areas around the world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An increasing number of organisations are beginning to operate in a standardised business process environment suggesting that there is benefit in a standardised business messaging infrastructure.Novozymes A/S is the first known industrial biotech organisation in Denmark to apply the GS1 and the Consumer Goods Forum's global upstream standards initiative (GUSI) in a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) scenario. The combination of applying a standardised VMI business process using the aforementioned integration standards for electronic business messaging and pre-agreed standardised message choreography has been proven by Novozymes to add significant business benefit to their organisation.This case study methodology outlines the results of Novozymes' application of GUSI standards over three separate implementations replenishing 25 customers' factories and describes the resultant reduction in internal IT effort. The implementation data were collected from a total of twenty five factories (sites) which Novozymes, today, replenish using GUSI VMI. The 'ex post' results were then compared and interpreted against a Novozymes internal benchmarking analysis which was used an 'ex ante' base line.The findings strongly suggest that the GUSI VMI application provides not only reduced integration effort, but also is a foundational basis for higher rent generating processes and improved demand transparency management.</jats:p>"

The pulser (pulse duration of 1 μs) is based on transistor switching and wound transmission line transformer technology. For a capillary of length 40 mm and diameter 265 μm and gas backing pressure of 100 mbar, a fast voltage pulse risetime of 95 ns initiates breakdown at 13 kV along the capillary. A peak current of ∼280 A indicates near complete ionization, and the r.m.s. temporal jitter in the current pulse is only 4 ns. Temporally stable plasma formation is crucial for deploying capillary waveguides as plasma channels in laser-plasma interaction experiments, such as the laser wakefield accelerator.</jats:p>",

At low growth temperature (∼600 °C), the formation of adducts occurred, which degenerates the crystal quality. With increasing the growth temperature, the adduct formation was suppressed because the decomposition of Cp<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Mg was enhanced and thus the incorporation of carbon into the film was suppressed. The use of Cp<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Mg during InN growth increases the growth rate in the lateral direction. Non‐doped InN film grown on GaN buffer has an In‐face of the top side. On the other hand, the inversion domains seems to be formed in the highly Mg‐doped InN. Tilt distribution decreases from 65 to 30 arcmin with the increase of Cp<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Mg/TMI molar ratio 0 to 0.06. The donor is produced in highly Mg‐doped MOVPE‐grown InN (Cp<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Mg/TMI molar ratio &gt; 0.005). Therefore, the effect of Cp<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Mg supply on MOVPE growth behavior of InN is found to improve a macro‐scale crystal quality but also produces the donor (© 2011 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The aim of this paper is to develop a relationship amongst the identified GSC drivers; including management commitments, regulatory pressure etc. This paper is also helpful in understanding mutual influences of drivers, it helps in identifying those drivers which support other drivers as well as those drivers which are most influenced by other drivers (dependent) using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and it classifies these drivers depending upon their driving and dependency on power. </jats:p>",

This circuit has been designed and optimized using a global analysis technique which associates electromagnetic and circuit approaches. Due to the differential topology of the rectifier, neither input low-pass filter nor via-hole connections are needed. This makes the structure more compact reducing losses. Measurements of a single rectenna element show 83% efficiency over an optimal load of 1050 Ω at a power density of 0.31 mW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. To increase the received RF power and then increase dc power over the load, identical rectennas have been interconnected to form arrays. Two and four elements rectenna arrays, connected either in parallel or in series, have been developed. It was shown that by properly choosing the interconnection topology and the optimal output load, higher dc voltage or dc power have been obtained. The four-element series-connected array can provide experimentally up to 3.85 times output dc voltage compared to the single rectenna. The parallel-connected rectenna arrays generate approximately 2.15 and 3.75 times output dc power for two and four elements, respectively.</jats:p>",

Product recalls due to safety hazards entail societal costs, such as property damage, injury, and sometimes death. For firms, the related external failure costs are many, including the costs of recalling the product, providing a remedy, meeting the legal liability, and repairing damage to the firm's reputation. The recent spate of product recalls has shifted attention from <jats:italic>why products are recalled</jats:italic> to <jats:italic>why it takes so long</jats:italic> to recall a defective product that poses a safety hazard. To address this, our research subjects to empirical scrutiny the time to recall and its relationship with recall strategies, source of the defect and supply chain position of the recalling firm. We develop and verify our conceptual arguments in the U.S. toy industry by analyzing over 500 product recalls during a 15‐year period (1993–2008). The empirical results indicate that the time to recall, as measured by difference between product recall announcement date and product first sold date, is associated with (1) the recall strategy (preventive vs. reactive) adopted by the firm, (2) the type of product defect (manufacturing defect vs. design flaw), and (3) the supply chain entity that issues the recall (toy company vs. distributor vs. retailer). Our results provide cues that could trigger a firm's recognition of factors that increase the time to recall.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

To address this issue we measured gas exchange rates of 13 perennial grassland species from four functional groups across 11 years of long‐term free‐air CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment (<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, +180 ppm above ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) in the BioCON experiment in Minnesota, USA. Eleven years of <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> produced consistent but modest increases in leaf net photosynthetic rates of 10% on average compared with plants grown at ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations across the 13 species. This <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced enhancement did not depend on soil N treatment, is much less than the average across other longer‐term studies, and represents strong acclimation (i.e. downregulation) as it is also much less than the instantaneous response to <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The legume and C3 nonlegume forb species were the most responsive among the functional groups (+13% in each), the C4 grasses the least responsive (+4%), and C3 grasses intermediate in their photosynthetic response to <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> across years (+9%). Leaf stomatal conductance and nitrogen content declined comparably across species in <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> compared with ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and to degrees corresponding to results from other studies. The significant acclimation of photosynthesis is explained in part by those <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced decreases in leaf N content and stomatal conductance that reduce leaf photosynthetic capacity in plants grown under elevated compared with ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations.

Body temperature was highest at night and decreased rapidly early in the morning, reaching a nadir at 10:00 h, after ambient temperature and solar radiation had begun to increase. On hotter days, the minimum morning body temperature was lower than on cooler days, decreasing from a mean of 36.2°C in the spring to 34.0°C in the summer. This effect correlated better with the time of the year than with proximate thermal stressors, suggesting that either season itself or some factor correlated with season, such as food availability, caused the change. Water saving has been proposed as a selective advantage of heterothermy in other large mammals, but in kangaroos the water savings would have been small and not required in a reserve with permanent standing water. We calculate that the lower core temperature could provide energy savings of nearly 7%. It is likely that the heterothermy that we observed on hot days results either from decreased energy intake during the dry season or from a seasonal pattern entrained in the kangaroos that presumably has been selected for because of decreased energy availability during the dry season.</jats:p>",

In four tumors, TACE was incomplete because of technical problems. PB supply to recurrent tumors was demonstrated 7.3 ± 3.7 months after TACE.

All tumors progressed except for one treated by RF ablation. On serial CTAP images, relatively large‐diameter portal veins directly entered 11 tumors (91.7%) and connected with intratumoral vessels in nine (75%). During follow‐up, partial arterial supply was demonstrated in two tumors and additional TACE was performed. Nine patients died after 31.4 ± 16.2 months due to tumor progression (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 8), or hepatic failure (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Currently, one of the main challenges for most of the shipbuilding companies is to manage the activities performed by a network of suppliers worldwide. Empirical evidence shows that the lack of integration and coordination between partners of the same supply chain affects the quality and the delivery date. Supply chain management (SCM) has been proposed to manage the flow of material, information, and service through the supply chain. However, the literature has dedicated significant emphasis to the high-volume sector, while other sectors have been largely ignored. Different approaches for SCM should be considered according to the characteristics of each industry. Therefore, this paper was proposed to provide an understanding of the role of SCM in the shipbuilding industry. A review of the literature identifies the main concepts, principles, and methods of SCM, and a case study provides a discussion of the barriers to implementing them. The results showed that SCM in shipbuilding depends essentially on improving the relationship with suppliers and adopting appropriate information and communication technology (ICT). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Power dissipation has become a critical design constraint for the growth of modern multicore systems due to increasing clock frequencies, leakage currents, and system parasitics. To overcome this urgent crisis, this article presents an embedded platform for on-chip power management of a multicore System-on-Chip (SoC). The design involves the development of two key components, from the hardware to the software level. From the hardware perspective, a multiple-supply power management unit is proposed and is implemented using a Single-Inductor Multiple-Output (SIMO) DC-DC converter. To dynamically respond to the sensed instantaneous power demands and to accurately control the power delivery to the processor cores, the power management unit employs a software-defined adaptive global/local power allocation feedback controller. The proposed controller is designed using the hardware-software codesign methodology to uniquely control the SIMO converter during various operation scenarios. This is achieved using several embedded software control algorithms that operate synergetically to ensure efficient and reliable system operation. The hardware-software codesign technique also allows the SIMO controller to be integrated with future microprocessor cores. Therefore, by employing the vast amount of on-chip resources, the converter can perform effective power processing to provide the most power-optimal voltages at the hardware level. Such an embedded power management module leads to an integrated, power-aware, and autonomous SoC design that is independent of additional external hardware control, thereby reducing on-chip area and system complexity. In this design, each power output from the SIMO converter provides a step-up/down voltage conversion, thereby enabling a wide range of variable supply voltage. An adaptive global/local power allocation control algorithm is employed to significantly improve Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) tracking speed and line/load regulation, while still retaining low cross-regulation. Designed with a 180nm CMOS process, the converter precisely provides three independently variable power outputs from 0.9 V to 3.0 V, with a total power range from 33 mW to 900 mW. A very fast load transient response of 3.25\n            <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>\n            s is achieved, in response to a 67.5-mA full-step load current change. The design thus provides a cost-effective power management solution to achieve a robust, fast-transient, DVFS-compatible multicore SoC.\n          </jats:p>",

The switch also changed district level storage utilization from a mean of 65% to means of 64%, 66% and 68% (range for all scenarios: 3-100%).
