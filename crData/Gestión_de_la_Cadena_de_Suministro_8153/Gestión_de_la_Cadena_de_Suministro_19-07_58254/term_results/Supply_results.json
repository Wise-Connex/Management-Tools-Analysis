      "abstract": "<jats:p>While research has extensively explored the potential benefits companies gain with integrated supply chains, the topic of why some companies are better at pursuing supply chain integration (SCI) is relatively under‐examined. We take the perspective that SCI is associated with preferred forms of leadership using leadership preference derived from path–goal logic. By combining global data sources, we examine the relationships among leadership style preferences, internal integration (i.e., between sales and purchasing) programs, and external integration (i.e., supplier side) programs. Our country‐level results challenge the assumption that the choice to pursue internal and external integration has similar origins. Specifically, while collaborative‐style leadership preferences relate to internal integration programs, societies preferring individualistic‐style leaders will be predisposed toward external integration programs. Our study’s contribution is in the novel use of theories on leadership to explain variations in approaches toward supply chain integration.</jats:p>",

Series of monthly precipitation and temperature data are estimated up to 2050, using recorded data and data for predicted changes of air temperature and precipitation according to climate change scenarios. Climate change impact on drinking water supply is assessed using multi-regression models for the dependence of the water supply data on the main climate parameters: temperature and precipitation. Forecast of future water quantities includes implementation of multi-regression models defined with a set of independent variables: the number of the population for time sets (t, t-1, t-2, t-3), precipitation and air temperature including predicted changes of the data under climate change conditions for the same time sets. Two scenarios are analysed: the first predicts that the number of the population until 2050 remains nearly the same as nowadays, the second predicts an increase of the number of the population at an average annual rate of increase of 0.58%. Results indicate shortage of available water resources for population and industry in climate change scenarios (increase of temperatures and decrease of precipitation) and increase of population.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to introduce methods and tools for hydrological analysis and robust reservoir performance evaluation in this time of deep uncertainty. Newly developed lumped water balance and reservoir simulation models will be used to perform hydrological analysis, and a robust reservoir storage capacity reliability assessment will also be conducted. The hydrological data in relation to climate change will be constructed using two climatological datasets created by statistical downscaling tools LARS WG and ENSEMBLE Downscaling Portal. The hydrological analysis and the temporal reliability of the assessment of reservoir storage capacity and robustness in the context of climate change uncertainty will be presented as a case study of the Vir I reservoir and the Svratka River basin in the Czech Republic, in central Europe. The resulting models show a decrease in long-term mean flow, ranging from 6% to 32%, and in reservoir outflow from 1.5% to 26%, depending on the timescale, downscaling tools and emission scenarios.</jats:p>",

Saat ini konsumen juga memberikan tuntutan tambahan pada rantai pasokan. Manajemen rantai pasok sangat penting dalam keunggulan persaingan perusahaan, oleh karena itu pengukuran kinerja rantai pasok menjadi sangat fundamental untuk perbaikan berkelanjutan pada perusahaan. KPBS PangalenganÂ  merupakan koperasi yang mewadahi para peternak sapi perah yang memiliki produk andalan susu pasteurisasi. KPBS Pangalengan terus berupaya untuk mengoptimalkan produksi susu pasteurisasi mulai dari penerimaan bahan baku hingga produk diterima oleh konsumen. Salah satu upaya yang dapat dilakukan adalah dengan melakukan pengukuran kinerja supply chain di KPBS Pangalengan. Penelitian ini membahas pengukuran kinerja supply chain dengan pendekatan Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) di KPBS Pangalengan untuk menentukan indikator kinerja yang akan dinilai dan Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) untuk menentukan bobot setiap indikator kinerja. Pada level satu terdapat lima proses inti SCOR yaitu Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, dan Return. Pada level dua terdapat tiga dimensi pada setiap proses yaitu Realibility, Responsiveness, dan Flexibility. Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah pada level tiga hirarki terdapat 50 indikator kinerja yang dinilai. Proses inti yang menghasilkan nilai kinerja tertinggi terdapat pada proses Plan. Disisi lain nilai yang terendah adalah proses Return. Total nilai kinerja supply chain di KPBS Pangalengan sebesar 78,00 yang menunjukkan bahwa kinerja yang dicapai berada pada kategori Good. Selain itu terdapat beberapa saran perbaikan untuk pihak KPBS Pangalengan dan untuk penelitian selanjutnya.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Nowadays, the members in a supply chain are seen as an integrity. In order to maximize the supply chain profit, the authors consider a contract of buyback. In this article, they focus on a single manufacturer and a single retailer in the supply chain. In order to match the market demand, a new perspective is introduced into the buyback contract model. By comparing the predicted demand of the manufacturer and the retailer with the real demand, they will obtain four quadrants about the difference of the market demand forecasts. By combining the profit models with different market demand forecasts in the four quadrants, the closed-form optimal market model is created. The solutions of the optimal price and the optimal quantity under the centralized mode, non-contract decentralized mode and buyback contract mode are compared. The authors find that the non-contract decentralized mode model cannot successfully coordinate the supply chain, while the buyback contract mode allows for the coordination of the supply chain and the generation of more profit from the supply chain. From this new perspective of the supply chain contract, a reasonable result can be obtained. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results, with analysis conducted on the model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Information sharing has been extensively studied as a key enabler for coordination and integration in supply chains. However, exactly how the shared information is utilized for decision making has only received limited scientific attention in the research literature. The aim of this study is to identify the characteristics of information sharing, and conceptualize how to move from information sharing to information utilization in food supply chains. Using a case study methodology together with a review of the existing literature the authors describe the main facets of shared information - which influence the information utilization in a supply chain - and propose a mapping notation for how these facets can be visualized together with a supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. Information utilization is especially important because more information sharing does not necessarily result in a better supply chain performance unless the shared information is effectively used in the relevant processes in the chain and well-aligned with the requirements for those processes. The proposed notation provides a systematic structure for mapping the information flows, their specific facets, and helps clarify what information is available and how this information can be utilized in different supply chain processes. Four facets of information sharing are identified and elaborated for food supply chains, together with a mapping tool that emphasizes the information flows and the utilization of information in supply chains.</p>",

The authors investigate a hybrid problem in which the firm needs to develop a suitable distribution strategy under disruption risks along with an optimal checking policy when faced with the supply of varying quantities of damaged items. The authors formulate a non-linear mathematical model in which the overall objective is to maximise the expected profit and to help the firm in decision making under uncertain environments.

      "abstract": "<p>The use of the concept of supply chain management in Indonesia based on the data presented is mainly to collaborate with world-class manufacturers in order to participate in global trade, it is still very lacking and not yet this is due to one sub system with another sub-system still running partially and does not have an intact network. From the data above, Indonesia must improve its infrastructure and human resources more in an integrated manner so that it can join in the big wave of global trade because geographically, Indonesia is in a strategic position in the world trade route. The basic weakness is the high cost of logistics which includes transportation costs, warehousing costs, inventory storage costs, customer service costs and logistical administrative costs when compared to other countries in the Asian region. Another disadvantage is that there are still various infrastructure standards such as ports, highways and air and water transportation networks and other supporting infrastructure. The lack of availability of funds for infrastructure programs, unclear infrastructure development priorities, uncertain legal rules, and inadequate law enforcement make Indonesia's ranking still inferior to other ASEAN member countries.</p>"

Compared with steady airflows, dynamic airflows are capable of improving thermal comfort. Turbulent characteristics of airflows can affect human thermal comfort. This study aims to investigate the turbulent characteristics of airflows in the occupied zone under stratum ventilation with pulsating air supply, which can produce dynamic airflows. The turbulent characteristics were compared with that under conventional steady air supply. Experiments were conducted in a classroom mock-up using stratum ventilation. Five cases, namely, one with steady air supply and four with pulsating air supply were designed. The turbulent intensity (Tu) and power spectrum of air velocity signals were analysed. The results showed that the Tu of the airflows in the occupied zone under pulsating air supply was greater than that under steady air supply by 10-15%. Power spectrum density exponents (β) of airflows under the two air supplies fluctuated within the same range of 0.5 to 1.2. However, the power spectrum density function showed different distributions on low frequency area. The turbulent characteristics of airflows created by pulsating airflows may provide better thermal comfort.</jats:p>",

The power generated is delivered to the National Interconnected System (SNI), which services the city. This research confronts two sets of real data, the electricity use of the urban area of Loja, and the power generated by the Villonaco Wind Farm. Electricity use follows clearly defined daily and weekly cycles, and wind power has a seasonal behaviour. The study shows that wind power integration cannot be a long-term stable power source regardless power or generation surplus. Another essential finding is that time series can be used as a statistical source to determine the need for short- (seconds) and long- (days, weeks) term energy storage. Strategies to further the energy autonomy of the urban area through the expansion of the wind farm by a factor of 2 are discussed.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to assess current approaches used in water quality and quantity management in Tanzania. This was achieved through secondary water data tends, on-site water quality assessments, visits of respective water supply and sanitation authorities, and assessment of their performances. It was observed that water supplied in rural-based authorities was quite different from that supplied in an urban setting as far as quality and quantity is concerned, urban-based supplies being of assistance to users over rural ones. A new strategy on water management is presented for sustainable water supply in Tanzania; it is based on controlling groundwater abstractions and preference of surface water in public water supplies. Rural water supply management must learn several practices realized at urban supplies for the betterment of respective majority water users.</jats:p>"

We mine a commercially available database in order to assemble a network of chemical reactions. We describe molecules within the network by a portfolio of graph theoretical features, and identify strategic molecules with an isolation forest search algorithm. In this work we have identified a list of potential strategic molecules and indicated possibilities for reaction planning using these. This is exemplified by a potential supply chain of functional molecules from bio-waste streams that could be used as feedstocks without being converted to syngas. This work extends the methodology of analysis of reaction networks to the generic problem of development of new reaction pathways based on novel feedstocks.</jats:p>"

A blockchain technology is a\npeer-to-peer digital ledger of transactions that may be publicly or privately\ndistributed to all users and therefore is said to be decentralized and\ndistributed. The most important feature that distinguishes block-chain-based\ntechnologies from other technologies is that it has a special algorithm without\nbeing connected to any center. Therefore, this technology makes a significant\ndifference in supplying fast, secure and accurate information flow among supply\nchain members. Reducing the costs and time that arise in the supply chain, it\nprovides significant advantages to enterprises such as the transparency of the\noperations performed. The purpose of this study is; to explain the block chain\ntechnology and to contribute to supply chain processes and stakeholders. In\nthis context, the study is considered as literature review. The study is\nimportant in terms of contributing to the relevant literature in basic level.</jats:p>"

The Post-Keynesian theory is tested against the fractional reserve theory of money creation that assumes money supply to be exogenously determined and controlled by the monetary authority. Granger-causality tests, the estimates from a vector error-correction model and the analysis of impulse-response functions from a general vector autoregression support the Post-Keynesian proposition of money-supply endogeneity in Poland during the 2001–2016 period. The demand for bank credit, represented by bank lending, causes changes in both bank deposits and the M3 money supply. Bank loans also Granger-cause the monetary base, as Post-Keynesian theory asserts. In short, loans make deposits, instead of the reverse. The M3 money multiplier does not Granger-cause broad money supply in Poland – a finding which further undermines the popular ‘money multiplier’ view. The above conclusions provide important insights for the Polish central bank regarding how it should understand monetary policy.</jats:p>",

Widely understood heating secures both: the living needs of society and industrial recipients. Modern heating systems should guarantee reliability of heat supply while limiting energy consumption and transmission losses. It results from the sustainable development strategy, implemented in the European Union, which is based on the development of renewable energy and improvement of energy efficiency. As a consequence of such an energy policy, investments and innovations are implemented in the two areas of the heating sector: technical infrastructure and management of the heat generation and transmission system. The article discusses legal as well as technical and economic conditions for the operation of heating companies, including aspects of energy security. The characteristics of the heat market in Poland and investment expenditures related to the modernisation of infrastructure and environmental protection has been presented in it. Selected innovations used in the process of heat production and supply have been described as well as modern technologies and IT tools that improve management of heating system. The possibilities and limitations of innovative heating development have also been indicted here.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An important and often researched area of management science is mathematical modeling of a supply chain. Competitive situations can occur in supply chains owing to the involvement of multiple decision makers (players) that independently decide their behaviors. To investigate competitive supply chain networks, a supply chain network equilibrium (SCNE) model was proposed. Recently, particular attention has been paid to risk management of a supply chain. In equilibrium models, it is vital to consider players’ decisions and interdependence relations. Thus, we consider competitive supply chain networks with uncertainties in the other players’ strategies. In the proposed model, each player cannot know exactly the other players’ strategies, and they decide their strategy using the minimax principle (that is, assuming the worst case). We call it the robust SCNE model. We formulate the robust SCNE model as a variational inequality problem (VIP) in which the set associated with the VIP is constructed by second-order cone constraints. We show the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium under mild assumptions. In addition, we give, in a special case, some relations between players’ strategies in the equilibrium and magnitudes of uncertainties. Finally, some numerical results are provided. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a brief overview of a simple industrial RFID system and then describe the basic concept of tag collision problem. Despite many useful applications, the RFID tag collision creates a major problem for fast tag identification process. There are different algorithmic solutions available to overcome tag collision problem in industrial supply chains. Based on binary search algorithm (BSA) of dynamic and backtracking, two variations of binary anti-collision search algorithms for tag identification processes are described in this paper. Simulation-based experimental results on the performance of these algorithms are evaluated when handling multiple RFID tags simultaneously. The backtracking binary search algorithm has obvious advantages in terms of tag identification process compared to the other two algorithms.</jats:p>",

Environmental oxygen is widely believed to be limiting of metabolic rate and aerobic scope, setting thermal tolerance and body size limits with implications for species diversity and biogeography. Here we derive a quantifiable linkage between maximum and basal metabolic rate and their temperature, size and oxygen dependencies. We show that, regardless of size or temperature, the capacity for oxygen supply precisely matches the maximum evolved demand at the highest persistently available oxygen pressure which, for most species assessed, is the current atmospheric pressure. Any reduction in oxygen partial pressure from current values will result in a decrement in maximum metabolic performance. However, oxygen supply capacity does not constrain thermal tolerance and does not cause hypometabolic scaling. The critical oxygen pressure, typically viewed as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance, instead reflects adaptations for aerobic scope. This simple new relationship redefines many important physiological concepts and alters their ecological interpretation.</jats:p><jats:p>One sentence summary: Metabolism is not oxygen limited</jats:p>"

Residential groundwater is abstracted by means of garden boreholes or well points and – in the study area – abstracted groundwater is typically used for garden irrigation. The volume irrigated per event is a function of event duration, frequency of application and flow rate, which in turn are dependent on numerous factors that vary by source – including water availability, pressure and price. The temperature variation of groundwater abstraction pipes at residential properties was recorded and analysed as part of this study in order to estimate values for three model inputs, namely, pumping event duration, irrigation frequency, and flow rate. This research incorporates a basic end‑use model for garden irrigation, with inputs derived from the case study in Cape Town, South Africa.  The model was subsequently used to stochastically evaluate garden irrigation. Over an 11-d period, 68 garden irrigation events were identified in the sample group of 10 residential properties. The average garden irrigation event duration was 2 h 16 min and the average daily garden irrigation event volume was 1.39 m3.</jats:p>"

Despite death tolls climbing, a myriad of evidence-based medications exist to effectively treat many substance use disorders including nicotine, alcohol, and opioid use disorders. To date, hospitals have largely been overlooked as a setting ripe for the delivery of specialized addiction care. This occurs despite a high lifetime prevalence of a substance use disorder (50%) occurring among hospitalized individuals. A potential barrier to this is the lack of addiction medicine training that currently exists in undergraduate and graduate medical education. Consequently, a paucity of existing physicians report feeling competent to adequately screen for, diagnose or treat substance use disorders.

The concept of superimposing the contaminant over the hydraulic analysis was used to develop the proposed model. Four water sample networks were used to test the performance of the proposed model. The results obtained displayed the contaminant distributions across the water network at a limited computational time.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>National electricity supply utility in South Africa (Eskom) has been facing challenges to meet load demands in the country. The lack of generation equipment maintenance, increasing load demand and lack of new generation stations has left the country with a shortage of electricity supply that leads to load shedding. As a result, alternative renewable energy is required to supplement the national grid. Photovoltaic (PV) solar generation and wind farms are leading in this regard. Sunlight fluctuates throughout the day, thereby causing irradiation which in turn causes the output of the PV plant to become unstable and unreliable. As a result, storage facilities are required to mitigate challenges that come with the integration of PV into the grid or the use of PV independently, off the grid. The same storage system can also be used to supplement the power supply at night time when there is no sunlight and/or during peak hours when the demand is high. Although storage facilities are already in existence, it is important to research their range, applications, highlight new technologies and identify the best economical solution based on present and future plans. The study investigated an improved economic and technical storage system for generation of clean energy systems using solar/PV plants as the base to supplement the grid. In addition, the research aims to provide utilities with the information required for making storage facilities available with an emphasis on capital cost, implementation, operation and maintenance costs. The study solution is expected to be economical and technically proficient in terms of PV output stabilization and provision of extra capacity during peak times. The research technology’s focus includes different storage batteries, pumped storage and other forms of storage such as supercapacitors. The analysis or simulations were carried out using current analytic methods and software, such as HOMER Pro®. The end results provide the power utility in South Africa and abroad with options for energy storage facilities that could stabilise output demand, increase generation capacity and provide backup power. Consumers would have access to power most of the time, thereby reducing generation constraints and eventually the monthly cost of electricity due to renewable energies’ accessibility. Increased access to electricity will contribute to socio-economic development in the country. The proposed solution is environmentally friendly and would alleviate the present crisis of load shedding due to the imbalance of high demand to lower generations.</jats:p>"

Studies on supply chain management have emphasized the vitality of a long-term strategic relationship between the supplier, distributor and retailer. In this article, the authors have studied a two-stage supply chain coordination problem under uncertain costs and demand information when integrated procurement and distribution decisions of supply chain has to be employed. The model incorporates a single supplier transporting its products to multiple destinations of a retailer. This process becomes tedious, as when items have an inventory carrying cost incurred due to perishable nature of products. Different discount policies are offered to procure and transport goods from the one stage to other stage. Fuzzy set theory is applied to estimate the uncertainty associated with the input parameters and triangular fuzzy numbers are used to analyze the model. A case is presented to validate the procedure.</jats:p>",

The results demonstrated the general applicability of the method. For all cases a combination of measures/options yielded the most sustainable solution. The absence of a single clearly most optimal solution highlights the need for a transparent and systematic analysis, which can be obtained with the presented methodology.</jats:p>",

However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing‚ manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects.</jats:p>"

The automotive industry, as one of the largest and most influential industries in the world, could have a substantial effect on the movement toward a sustainable society. Despite the growing body of literature in the field of sustainable supply chain management, there is no review article that comprehensively synthesizes the state-of-the-art research in the automotive industry. To cover this gap, this paper reviews the sustainable supply chain management literature in the automotive industry published between 1995 and 2017. A systematic review and content analysis were conducted to collect the studies and analyze their content. The content analysis was structured based upon a set of key business processes following the Integration Definition Function (IDEF0) method, which is a structured approach of analyzing business processes. The study provides a practical guideline for designing a sustainable automotive supply chain and culminates with the outlined research gaps and recommendations for future research.</jats:p>"

However, there is a good cluster of application scenarios where complete anonymity is not desirable and accountability is in fact required. In this work, we utilize non-interactive proofs of knowledge of elliptic curve discrete logarithms to present membership and verifiable encryption proof, which offers <jats:italic>plausible anonymity</jats:italic> when combined with the regular signing process of the blockchain transactions. The proof system requires no trusted setup, both its communication and computation complexities are linear in the number of set members, and its security relies on the discrete logarithm assumption. As a use-case for this scenario, we present Mesh which is a blockchain-based framework for supply chain management using RFIDs. Finally, the confidentiality of the transacted information is realized using a lightweight <jats:italic>key chaining</jats:italic> mechanism implemented on RFIDs. We formally define and prove the main security features of the protocol, and report on experiments for evaluating the performance of the modified transactions for this system.</jats:p>",

Hitherto, the reforms seem to have introduced greater uncertainty into the market given increasing rates of price volatility. Methodology: This study, therefore, models supply responses in Nigerian Rice production that include the standard arguments as well as price risk. Statistical information on domestic and imported quantities of rice was obtained for 41 years (1970 to 2011) from the AGROSTAT system of the statistical division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture statistical bulletins, Central Bank of Nigeria statistical bulletins and National Bureau of Statistic. (NBS). Results: The data are analyzed using descriptive, equilibrium output supply function and co-integration models and vector autoregressive distributed lag. Rice importation showed a negative sign and was statistically significant with changes in output also responsive to changes in price. Conclusion: The results indicate that producers are more responsive not only to price and non-price factor but to price risk and exchange rate. It is therefore imperative to reduce price risk as to increase the response of producer to supply by bridging the gap in production.</jats:p>"

Employing a mixed-methods longitudinal panel design, our study objectives were to (a) explore perceptions among entry level nursing students regarding AOD work and (b) explore whether current alcohol and drug education efforts impact on the perception of AOD by nursing students over time. Two hundred forty-two students were recruited (94% response rate). Most (86%) of the study participants identified AOD training as relevant/extremely relevant to their future practice. After exposure to AOD sessions in the nursing curriculum, there was no significant change to participants' score on either alcohol or drug role security between T1 and T2/T3. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in alcohol therapeutic commitment between T1 and T2/T3 (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">F</jats:italic>(2, 136) = 5.87, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; .01), but not between T2 and T3; conversely, drug therapeutic commitment was significantly higher at T2 but signficantly lower at T3 (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">F</jats:italic>(2, 149) = 254.19, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in alcohol or drug role security between the three nurse training pathways. However, alcohol and drug therapeutic commitment scores at T1 were significantly higher in students taking the mental health field/track (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">F</jats:italic>(2, 160) = 9.45, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; .001, and <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">F</jats:italic>(2, 236) = 15.23, <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic> &lt; .0001). Although the positive message is that students recognize the importance of the topic to their future practice, concerns remain regarding the impact and efforts of readiness for practice. Over a 3-year training period, no significant gains were made in increasing students' knowledge and skills, and their training experiences in clinical practice appear to have a negative effect on “therapeutic commitment” influenced by exposure/contact to patients with drug use disorders specifically and less than positive mentoring experiences with qualified nursing staff. How to address these issues is explored including the need to perhaps shift the focus of attention from “negative attitudes” held by students to exploring the barriers and obstacles in upskilling nursing faculty and clinical mentors so that they feel able and willing to teach and be a role model of good practice in this area.</jats:p>",

Researchers have adopted different techniques to integrate the three components of sustainability. But the relationship between different sustainability initiatives and the performance outcomes are still to be analyzed systematically. In the present study, the review of various works published in sustainable supply chain management domain is carried out with a hybrid method of meta-analysis and content analysis. The research papers were selected based on different theories of sustainable development. The theories considered in the present study are the following; theory of population ecology, resource-based view theory, natural resource-based view theory, resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, and transaction cost economics theory. The developments in the sustainable supply chain management area and the methodologies used for modelling and analysis are reviewed using this hybrid method by carefully analyzing the literature published during the period 2005-2017. This review will enable researchers in identifying the potential areas for research on sustainable supply chain management.</p>",

We find empirical support for this model, using women’s exposure to the Hindu Succession Act in India as a source of exogenous variation in their unearned income. Exposure to the Hindu Succession Act increases a woman’s labor supply by between 3.8 and 6.1 percentage points, particularly into high-paying jobs. Autonomy increased by 0.17 standard deviations, suggesting that control of income is a potential channel for these effects. Thus, policies that empower women can have an additional impact on the labor market, which can further reinforce autonomy increases.</jats:p>",

The wet biomass feedstock contains aqueous sludge, kitchen waste, and organic wastewater. A simulation model is designed and used to investigate the control strategy for the hydrogen and electricity management through detailed size estimation of the system to meet the load requirements of a selected household area, including ten detached houses in a subject district around the Shinchi station located in Shinchi-machi, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. As indicated by results, the proposed HRES can generate about 47.3 MWh of electricity and about 2.6 ton of hydrogen per annum, using the annual wet biomass consumption of 98 tons, with a Levelized Cost of Energy (electricity and heat) of the system at 0.38 $/kWh. The implementation of the proposed HRES in the selected residential area has GHG emissions reduction potential of about 21 tons of CO2-eq per year.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the effect of PTA exclusion on firms embedded in the global supply chains, focusing on the case of China's exclusion from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Drawing on a survey of Chinese firm managers during the TPP negotiations, we find that productive and downstream firms anticipated the exclusion and made adjustments accordingly, which led to a general sense of optimism toward the agreement. When presented with the prospect of an expanded TPP, however, firms are divided depending on how their own positions in the global supply chain complement or compete with the new member. These findings, validated with interviews in the field, suggest that the effects of PTA exclusion depend on the ability and need for firms to adjust. As a result, exclusion does not equate to an unalloyed loss for excluded firms.</jats:p>",

This often is the case when teaching a business school core course that all majors must take. The motivation of these non-SCM students is sometimes just to pass and move on to their major course of study. Using a number of cases and examples from the real world that the students can relate to may help increase attention and learning. The increased interest level may give students a better understanding of supply chains. This article discusses approaches to teaching the core course with real world applicability, and suggests future research to examine the possible benefits.</jats:p>"

A literature review has been conducted by using selected studies from reputed journals. It has been found that IoT applications in the sustainable agricultural supply chain and is currently under a nascent stage in developing countries. This is due to influence of multiple barriers, which poses serious problems, and therefore it is imperative for agricultural scientists and managers to understand the interrelationships. Farm managers, research scientists, and policy makers must aim to remove the barriers for achieving sustainability in agricultural supply chain management. The study is unique, first, in terms of scope of study; second, it identifies and categorizes the barriers to IoT application in agricultural supply chain; and third, it proposes a conceptual framework with research propositions and finally provides food for thought to the research community.</jats:p>",

The study uses a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) approach to develop a model that explores benefits, costs, opportunities, and risks of a buyer-supplier relationship in a sustainable supply chain. A case study of the Indian automobile sector is used to determine the appropriate form of the buyer-supplier relationship. This study found that a problem solving relationship is the most preferred form of relationship. Long term relationships and joint development ranked 2 and 3, respectively. A sensitivity analysis showed that if the weights of benefits, opportunities, costs and risks are changed the preference for alternatives selection also changes. The most important implication of the study is in providing supply chain managers with a model for development of buyer-supplier relationships with their supply chain partners based on the considerations of benefits, opportunities, costs and risks involved in developing such a relationship in a sustainable supply chain. The novelty of the present study rests in the incorporation of sustainability specific criteria for selection of the relationship between two parties in a supply chain context considering benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks of a relationship type. This is the first such model that incorporates considerations of BOCR in a sustainable supply chain.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The just-in-sequence inventory strategy, as an important part of the supply chain solutions in the automotive industry, is based on feedback information from the manufacturer. The performance, reliability, availability and cost efficiency are based on the parameters of the members of the supply chain process. To increase the return on assets (ROA) of the manufacturer, the optimization of the supply process is unavoidable. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe a flower pollination algorithm-based heuristic optimization model of just-in-sequence supply focusing on sustainability aspects, including fuel consumption and emission. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model of just-in-sequence supply, including assignment and scheduling problems. The objective of the model is to determine the optimal assignment and schedule for each sequence to minimize the total purchasing cost, which allows improving cost efficiency while sustainability aspects are taken into consideration. Next, a flower pollination algorithm-based heuristic is described, whose performance is validated with different benchmark functions. The scenario analysis validates the model and evaluates its performance to increase cost-efficiency in just-in-sequence solutions.</jats:p>"

Combining detailed register data from Norway with an instrumental variables approach based on random assignment to appellant judges, we comprehensively assess how DI receipt affects these understudied outcomes. To consider the welfare implications of the findings from this instrumental variables approach, we estimate a dynamic model of household behavior that translates employment, reapplication, and savings decisions into revealed preferences for leisure and consumption. The model-based results suggest that on average, the willingness to pay for DI receipt is positive and sizable. Because spousal labor supply strongly buffers the household income and consumption effects of DI allowances, the estimated willingness to pay for DI receipt is smaller for married than single applicants.

In other words, the increase in budget deficits leads to an increase in money supply and as a result, inflation rates rise. Inflation is based on fiscal policies rather than monetary policies according to Price Level Fiscal Theory. Accordingly, increasing budget deficits leads to increases in loans, thus causes interest rates to rise and consequently inflation rises as money supply increases. In this study, the relationship between inflation, budget deficit and money supply in Turkey is analyzed using the ARDL bounds testing approach for the 1980-2017 period. According to the empirical results, there was a positive and significant relationship between inflation and budget deficit both in the long and short term.Keywords: Inflation, Deficit, Money Supply, Turkey, ARDLJel Codes: E31, E51, E52</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Economic potential of feedstock generated low-valued forest residue can be enhanced by emerging biomass conversion technologies (BCT), such as torrefaction, briquetting, and gasification. However, for implementing these emerging processes within the woods, several hurdles are to be overcome, among which a balanced supply chain is pivotal. Centralized biomass recovery operation (CBRO) could be an economically viable solution in accessing harvesting sites and allows integration of BCT into forest management. The goal of this study was to examine the logistic effects of integrating a BCT into a CBRO, under different in-wood scenarios based on variations in travel time between the facility locations, amount of raw materials handled, intermediate storage capacity, and duration (number of days) of annual operations. Specific objectives included analyzing the effects of forest residue recoverability (BDMT, bone dry metric ton/ha), total transportation time from the harvest unit to the market, and the annual number of in-woods production sites on the overall efficiency of the BCT operations. Concurrently, this study examined the forest managerial impacts due to such an integration. Location-allocation tool (maximize market share problem type) within the ArcGIS Network Analyst platform was utilized to model the scenarios and generate one-way travel times from the harvest site to final markets. Results from geospatial analysis showed that there were 89–159 and 64–136 suitable locations for the BCT for logistics model (LM) I and II, respectively. Total one-way travel time for all the models ranged between 1.0–1.7 h. Additionally, the annual numbers of BCT sites was inversely proportional to the total one-way travel time (i.e., harvest unit to market). Arranging CBRO and BCT operations to occur at the same in-woods site returned shorter total and average travel times than arranging the two activities at separate in-woods sites. The model developed for this study can be used by forest managers and entrepreneurs to identify sites for placing BCTs in the forest that minimizes transportation times.</jats:p>"

This article instead positions their political economy as part of a much longer history of liberals’ efforts to restructure the economy in order to stimulate new jobs and tax revenues that might also generate public revenue and support a progressive policy agenda. With roots in local, state, and regional industrial policies inspired by the New Deal, “supply-side liberalism” reemerged with force in the 1970s and 1980s, revealing heretofore unappreciated continuities that contextualize and clarify the origins of New Democrats’ promotion of a set of seemingly “neoliberal” economic policies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main purpose of this study is to develop a sustainable healthcare supply chain performance measurement (SHSCPM) model, which simultaneously considers intangible characteristics and sustainability aspects to ensure customer and/or stakeholder satisfaction. This model combines a balanced scorecard (BSC) with a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytical network process (ANP). After the arrangement and classification of perspectives and indicators from a literature review, the strategy map of the BSC is designed with DEMATEL. Furthermore, this study used a survey with in-depth interviews of seven expert respondents to make a pair-wise comparison between perspectives and indicators in order to determine the weights of indicators, perspectives, and sustainability aspects on ANP. The study finds the following. First, the innovation and learning perspective that reflects intangible assets has the most influence on the others but is not important, while the customer perspective has the most importance for SHSC performance. Second, the economic aspect has the greatest weight, followed by social and environmental aspects. Finally, indicators of the financial and customer perspectives as drivers of SHSC performance consist of profit, quality of service, revenue, customer satisfaction, and stakeholder satisfaction. Further, indicators of the economic aspect of sustainability have the most effect on SHSC performance, followed by social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, human resources, as an intangible asset and key factor in social aspects, are main factor in improving SHSC performance.</jats:p>"

Although the number of workers in agriculture is relatively high and the sector contributes 14% to Indonesian GDP, many challenges still remain hampering growth. One of the key issues is the limited data availability in the agriculture sector causing imperfect and incomplete information on agriculture products. Data can provide the information about the quality of the product to the consumer to create transparency between producer and consumer. In order to facilitate data access, a big data base is needed in which all stakeholders can access the near-time data. A technology that can help to support this database is called blockchain. Blockchain is an immutable, transparent, public and append-only ledger. It is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates and verifies those updates to the ledger in a way that it is impossible to alter the data. This paper discusses HARA, a use-case of blockchain implementation in the food and agriculture sector.</jats:p>",

For this aim, a sustainable performance assessment system is needed to be implemented for evaluating different supply chain segments and clarify supply chains' indicators. The assessment can be performed based on three sustainability dimensions: economical, environmental, and social. The first purpose of this paper helps to identify sustainability issues and highlights the gaps and inconsistencies of literature. The second purpose of the study is to identify the most important indicators of sustainability for sustainable development supply chain of Iranian Oil Company stakeholder engagement. The indicators of the sustainable supply chain are studied and collected using metasynthesis approach, and the most important indicators of sustainability were identified for the company with Delphi technique. The proposed sustainability indicators can be useful for the researchers to develop practical and comprehensive measures in their respective industries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Researchers have been actively investigating various issues concerning food safety and halal food in the supply chain. The ultimate goal is to provide guarantees for quality and conformance regarding food standards and demanding expectation from the consumers. We review a set of two-decade food safety and halal food in supply chain (SC) literature from 1990 to 2018 (month of February) in order to pinpoint the problems, models, solution approaches and more importantly, the future directions of this field. Design/methodology/approach: Our method employs the 120 published articles on food safety and halal food in SC research. Various techniques from statistics, bibliometrics, and analytics are systematically deployed to gain insights on how the literature address these two topics.Findings: The predominant contributing articles, authors, affiliations, and keywords have been reviewed, clustered, and thoroughly analyzed. Through systematic graphical and clustering analyses, four major clusters regarding food safety and two clusters in halal food in SC research have been identified as the most promising and potential future for research opportunities.Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on articles that discuss food safety and halal.Practical implications: Our findings provide valuable insights to understand the major clusters of the research endeavour along with the plausible pathways to where they would likely develop in the future. With these insights, researchers and practitioners shall be able to devise initiatives that are of high relevance and significance in the near future.Social implications: This research provides an understanding to the reader about the relationship between food safety and halal.Originality/value: This paper provides the first systematic overview of food safety and halal food for supply chain researchers to see the big picture of the field. Serving as the thread connecting research endeavour in these two research areas, our novel work highlights how the work is connected, which research clusters have been the center-of-attention during the last two decades, and consequently, which areas are still lacking an investigation. We believe that people in both academia and industry who are keen to develop a rigorous solution to ensuring food safety and food halal-ness to satisfy global market requirement will be benefitting the most from our analysis.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the supply-demand for rice commodity is necessary as an effort to improve the national rice condition along with the logistics and supply chain point of view. This study aims to analyze the supply chain risk management of rice to provide recommendations on improving rice supply chain performance on each tier. In this study, supply chain of rice mainly consists of farmer, collector who acts as trader, and retailer. Meanwhile, the role of government is represented by The Indonesia Logistics Bureau (BULOG). The different supply chain pattern can be identified from the role of middleman in each province. This study uses ISO 31000:2009 standard for analyzing the risk in each tier along the supply chain. Based on the risk analysis, on-farm activity plays a vital role in transferring risk along the supply chain in terms of quality and quantity. Risk mitigation of each tier is explored in this study.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the supply chain's traditional view has been developed to sustainable supply chain perspective. Organizations that emphasize on the importance of sustainability will benefit from improved performance. For categorizing the supply chain indicators, sustainability deployment is necessary to identify the second layer or dimensions and aspects of sustainability in addition to the main sustainability dimensions such as the economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Literature has shown that in the important paradigm of sustainability, careful attention is not paid to the distinction between dimensions and aspects of sustainability. Therefore, for smoothing implementation and assessment of sustainability, consideration of the role and effect of dimensions and aspects of sustainability is essential. This paper is conducted by two fundamental and practical objectives. First, the dimensions and aspects of sustainability have been investigated and identified highlighting the lacks of conflicts in the literature. Second, the most important dimensions and aspects of sustainability are identified in one of the supply chains of Iran's oil companies using experts' opinions. The results of this research is beneficial for the researchers to consider the sustainability aspects and improve the related measures of their industries.</jats:p>",

An analysis is carried out of the strategic plans of such retailers, as well as recent developments in the sector. We begin by identifying the priority actions of retailers and then evaluating, by means of a survey, how small horticultural marketing firms (mainly cooperatives) in southeast Spain respond to the needs of these retailers. Subsequently, an analysis is carried out on these small marketing firm exporters to identify the relative weight which they assign to the variables assessed, while also considering the existing relationships between said weighted variables and business profits. Our results show that retailers tend to establish more simplified supply chains (that is, shorter and more vertical), essentially demonstrating their interpretation of a sustainable supply chain. In contrast, horticultural marketing firms have concentrated more on tactical and operational issues, thereby neglecting environmental, social and logistics management. Thus, their success rate in meeting the sustainability demands of their customers can be considered medium-low, requiring a more proactive attitude. Improved and collaborative relations, and the integration of sustainability concepts between suppliers (marketing firms) and their clients could contribute to successfully meeting sustainability demands. From the point of view of the consumer, close supplier–retail relationships have solved food safety issues, but the implementation of sustainability in other supply chain activities and processes is a pending issue. We propose strategic approximation and collaboration to bridge the gap between the varying sustainability demands in the supplier–retail relationship within perishable supply chains. Although this article specifically addresses fresh vegetable supply chains, the results may be extrapolated to other agri-food chains with a similar structure.</jats:p>"

The analytical determination of tin isotopic compositions and a possible use of tin from different ore sources between the Carpathian Basin, the Aegeo-Balkan-Complex and tin bearing regions in Central and Western Europe will be discussed. Since the 2nd millennium bronzes show in general a different isotopic composition than those of the 3rd millennium, the presented analyses indicate a possible reorientation of exchange routes in Europe during the 2nd millennium BC. This is supported by the composition of a few Aegean samples from the turn of the millennia, which have heavier tin isotopic compositions than all other sample sets. This suggests that different tin sources might have been used to manufacture these bronzes.</jats:p>"

There is an urgent need to improve efficiency and effectiveness of food supply chains. The global population is expected to reach at least 9 billion by the year 2050, requiring up to 70% more food than nowadays and demanding food production and distribution to become much more sustainable. Today, food safety is a worldwide concern due to a number of food safety scandals. As supply chains become more globalized and complex, the ability to track and trace products from fork to farm becomes more difficult but remains equally important. Good traceability may minimize the production and distribution of unsafe or poor quality products. It allows targeting the product affected by a food safety problem, minimizing disruption to trade and any potential public health risks. The objective of this paper is therefore to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traceability methods and technologies in food supply chains.</jats:p>",

The effect of Medicaid in the USA on the labour supply of its recipients is ambiguous. The employment-coverage link is an important determinant of the labour supply of people with health problems and self-employment decisions.

There are many high-performing supply chains that have benefitted from globalization. However, globalization of supply chains has also resulted in exposure to increased risks and frequent disturbances at various stages. One way to address these disturbances is to make supply chains resilient in nature. This paper identifies and prioritizes a set of important resiliency strategies for supply chains using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). Responses from 23 experts from the Indian pharmaceutical sector have been analyzed. We found that supply chain agility, visibility, and collaboration were the three most important resiliency strategies that a pharmaceutical organization should follow to address the vulnerability within their supply chain. The findings will serve the supply chain managers and the policymakers in designing resilient supply chains through the better understanding of strategies and formulation of action plans, while also introducing MCDM techniques into resiliency studies.</jats:p>"

LCA method was used and system steps of the mining and processing during LCA method of a specific metal was first identified. The midpoint and endpoint data were derived separately for Al and Cu as case study. Then normalization was applied to the endpoint data and the section with biggest value was considered most serious environmental effect. And the endpoint value for this section is chosen as environmental implication for a specific metal.

Energy consumption and carbon emissions vary significantly, and the effective location-allocation of blood facilities is a key strategy for the optimal use of energy. The total cost of the supply chain for perishable products is minimized when energy consumption is optimized. The proposed model is too complex to be solved with existing methodologies; therefore, mathematical tools are used to solve it. A numerical experiment is carried out to validate the proposed model, and graphical representations are presented for better visualization of the study’s outcomes.

There are many articles that have focused on this field presenting many different points of view. This research is centred on the evaluation of supply chain sustainability based on two critical dimensions. The first is the importance of evaluation metrics based on economic, environmental and social aspects, and the second is the degree of difficulty of information gathering. This paper aims to increase the accuracy of the evaluation. The proposed method is a combination of quality function deployment (QFD) with plithogenic aggregation operations. The aggregation operation is applied to aggregate: Firstly, the decision maker’s opinions of requirements that are needed to evaluate the supply chain sustainability; secondly, the evaluation metrics based on the requirements; and lastly, the evaluation of information gathering difficulty. To validate the proposed model, this study presented a real world case study of Thailand’s sugar industry. The results showed the most preferred and the lowest preferred metrics in order to evaluate the sustainability of the supply chain strategy.</jats:p>"

Based on the transaction and agency cost perspective and literature of information systems and B2B governance, this study investigates how IT resources affect the effects of relational and contractual governance. The results show that IT resources could improve the relational governance (i.e., joint-actions) and contractual governance (explicit and contingent contract clauses designing), and thus, effectively mitigate partner’s opportunism.

Some enterprises have already begun to implement green supply chain management, which brings pressure to other enterprises. Through the investigation of 245 building materials enterprises, this article establishes a model of the influence of external stakeholders on green supply chain management through the environmental awareness of internal executive and uses factor analysis and regression analysis to verify the research hypotheses. Empirical analysis results show that government regulation, consumer pressure and supplier and distributor pressure have significant positive effects on green supply chain management, and there exists intermediary effect of executives’ environmental awareness between external stakeholders and enterprise green supply chain management. Thus, this article puts forward some suggestions on how to effectively improve the green supply chain management level of building materials enterprises from the perspective of executives, government and consumers.</jats:p>",

This paper aimed to develop a strategy for reducing GHGE in the Swedish school food supply without compromising nutritional adequacy, affordability, and cultural acceptability. Amounts, prices and GHGE-values for all foods and drinks supplied to three schools over one year were gathered. The amounts were optimized by linear programming. Four nutritionally adequate models were developed: Model 1 minimized GHGE while constraining relative deviation (RD) from observed food supply; Model 2 minimized total RD while imposing stepwise GHGE reductions; Model 3 additionally constrained RD for individual foods to an upper and lower limit; and Model 4 further controlled how ratios between food groups could deviate. Models 1 and 2 reduced GHGE by up to 95% but omitted entire food categories or increased the supply of some individual foods by more than 800% and were deemed unfeasible. Model 3 reduced GHGE by up to 60%, excluded no foods, avoided high RDs of individual foods, but resulted in large changes in food group ratios. Model 4 limited changes in food group ratios but resulted in a higher number of foods deviating from the observed supply and limited the potential of reducing GHGE. Cost was reduced in almost all solutions. An omnivorous, nutritionally adequate, and affordable school food supply, with considerably lower GHGE is achievable with moderate changes to the observed food supply. Trade-offs will always have to be made between achieving GHGE reductions and preserving similarity to the current supply.</jats:p>"

The paper aimed to identify geographical areas that are at a high risk for bacterial contamination of wash water and to study the temporal distribution of positive samples. Water samples from 120 farms, whose water supply came from a private well, were tested for the presence of the three mentioned bacterial groups by the membrane filtration method. To investigate whether the presence of positive herds for a particular bacterial group in water samples was higher in some areas or during a specific time period, data were tested using the Bernoulli model. In farms without a purification system, the prevalence of positive samples for total coliform, faecal coliform and faecal streptococci was 36.7%, 13.3% and 24.5%, respectively. In farms using hydrogen peroxide, these figures were 15.4%, 7.7% and 7.7%, respectively. In farms using chlorine or ultraviolet radiation all the samples were negative for the three bacterial groups. The spatial analysis identified one statistically significant spatial cluster of herds with positive samples of faecal streptococci in an area characterized by a high cattle density. Moreover, one most likely temporal cluster was identified for each of the three groups between July and August 2017, which were the driest months in the studied area.</jats:p>",

In this scenario, the present work aims to study the effect of nickel ferrite nanoparticles on the degradation of Irgalite violet dye by Fenton's reaction using oxalic acid as an oxidizing agent in the presence of sunlight. The effect of pH and adsorbent dosage on the rate of dye degradation was monitored. Based on these studies it was observed that 99% dye degradation was achieved for catalyst dosage of 0.2 g, 400 ppm dye concentration and 2.0 mM oxalic acid at pH 3.0 within 60 min. The studies reveal that the degradation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics and the catalyst reusability remained constant almost for five cycles. Further, nickel ferrite nanoparticles are proven to be an efficient alternative for the removal of dyes from coloured solutions.</jats:p>",

The sequent depth ratio is one of the important characteristics of hydraulic jump useful in designing the stilling basin. Despite its importance, the exact value of sequent depth ratio is still undetermined. In the present study an attempt has been made to find out the effects of roughness heights and slopes by conducting an experimental study and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Three different roughness heights of crushed and rounded aggregates and two positive bed slopes were used. The experimental results show that the reductions in sequent depth ratios are more in the case of crushed aggregate (4%–35%) than rounded on the same slope. By increasing bed slope, the sequent depth ratios show increasing trend in the range 3%–45%. The proposed ANN model has the capability to predict the sequent depth ratio with least MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) value 3.15%. Therefore, based on the results obtained from the empirical model and ANN model, it has been concluded that the present study can be better utilized for the estimation of the sequent depth ratio of hydraulic jump.</jats:p>",

The review of 491 selected academic papers was expanded to include the grey literature and online information resources to construct a first‐pass theory of the medicinal maggot supply chain. It shows that the literature to date has focused on isolated discussions of echelon‐specific issues such as diet improvement and sterilization protocols in the production echelon, and the relative effectiveness of medicinal maggot application methods in the treatment echelon. There is little knowledge in the public domain regarding the transport and distribution of medicinal maggots, but existing supply chains for vaccines, blood and pathology specimens may provide learning and supply chain integration opportunities. Maggot therapy knowledge across the treatment echelon is generally substantive but there is still insufficient knowledge regarding patients' and health care providers' attitudes toward the therapy, and their experiences of receiving and administering MT. Moreover, there is no research concerned with the humane disposal of medicinal flies during production and after treatment.</jats:p>",

The perchlorate concentration in the tap water increased to 13.6 μg/L during the 35 hours following the display, and then gradually decreased. To evaluate the state of mixing through the water treatment process, a model for chemical reactors was applied to concentration time-courses in the source and tap water.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Social norms comparisons are tools that are being used more and more often by energy and water utilities all over the world in order to induce households to conserve resources. Such conservation programs are appealing to utilities since they are an easy-to-implement alternative to raising prices and commonly result in short-term reductions in energy and water use of about 2–5%. However, the welfare effects of social norms programs are rarely discussed and assessed, especially in the context of municipal water supply. The purpose of this paper is to identify the costs and benefits of social norms information treatments (SNITs) to all social groups and to illustrate a conceptual framework for conducting a benefit–cost analysis of social norms treatments in the municipal water sector. We provide plausible estimates for the costs and benefits of social norms treatments to different affected groups in the municipal water supply sector using current knowledge for both developing and industrialized countries in order to show how practitioners can conduct a benefit–cost analysis of an SNIT for a specific water utility. Our calculations show that the outcome of a benefit–cost analysis of an SNIT is highly location-specific and likely subject to substantial uncertainty. We also present a simple benefit–cost analysis of a price increase that would lead to an equivalent initial reduction in household water use. The latter is found to be more likely to result in net benefits to the society as a whole in low- and middle-income countries, but we show that, in this case, households would have to bear most of the costs. </jats:p>",

Based on the development background of Fujian province’s free trade zone and supply chain finance, this paper analyzes the current situation of SME financing in China and Fujian province, and focuses on the insufficient industrial chain of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone. Supply chain financial intermediaries are unbalanced development, inadequate laws and regulations, and relatively weak technology. The paper proposes a comprehensive model of supply chain financing based on free trade zone, carries out QFLP financing for the real economy, develops supply chain financial services for shipping centers, and encourages intermediaries to develop supply chain financial services, improve credit system and legal system, and utilize blockchain technology to improve the informationization degree of supply chain finance and other proposals, promote the rapid development of supply chain finance in Fujian Free Trade Zone, and solve the financing difficulties of SMEs.</jats:p>",

Therefore, sustainability has become a widely discussed aspect in the agendas of programmes related to these projects. Benefits can be obtained by developing a framework for measuring sustainability and identifying the factors affecting the sustainability of RWSS. This can help to predict sustainability before implementing projects and to take necessary actions to enhance the sustainability during the project implementation stage itself.

The purpose of this study is to analyse the supply chain management to increase profitability of the poultry in between two options of decision, buying the day-old chicks from third-party supplier or doing vertical integration to produce its own day-old chicks. This study found that doing vertical integration is the best option for the poultry because it can increase the profitability of the poultry and reduce the sensitivity of day-old chick price to the poultry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: We investigate multinational firms’ inspection and pricing strategies to address the challenges of combating child labor in global supply chains. We also examine how several factors (such as information disclosure, goodwill loss, inspection cost, external monitoring by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and penalty scheme) affect firms’ incentives to use different strategies to combat child labor. Academic/practical relevance: Nearly 200 million children are engaged in child labor, many in developing countries that are part of the supply base of global manufacturing networks. However, there has been little research on evaluating the impact of firms’ strategies and NGOs’ initiatives on child labor. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model based on a two-tier supply chain, in which a multinational firm in a developed country sells the product made by a supplier in a developing country. Results: If internal inspections are economical, a global firm can reduce the incidence of child labor by inspecting the supplier’s use of child labor. Otherwise, the firm can deter the supplier’s child labor employment by offering a sufficiently high wholesale price or simultaneously using internal inspections and a medium wholesale price. The latter strategy should be adopted only when information about the firm’s inspection policy can be informed credibly. This strategy combats child labor more effectively when a higher penalty is levied onto the supplier’s use of child labor. Managerial implications: A multinational firm that adopts a zero-tolerance policy should consider disclosing its effort to combat child labor (e.g., through a social responsibility report), whereas it should take extra caution when using other penalty schemes. NGOs should help raise the firm’s goodwill cost (e.g., through campaigns and consumer education), but they should be careful about helping to reduce the firm’s inspection cost (e.g., by improving a monitoring system). To prevent children from going back to work after initial removal, a sufficient amount of compensation should be provided to those children, especially when firms rely on inspections without paying a high wholesale price to suppliers.</jats:p>",

The aim of this work was to give a review of own studies of dynamics of the activity of energy metabolism enzymes in the brain during postnatal ontogenesis which characterizes the functional relations within the analysers, the destruction of their functions and the impact of adverse environmental factors on the body as well. Methods. The methods for the determination of the activity of energy metabolism enzymes in the brain of animals under the impact of adverse environmental factors and dysfunction of the analysers have been used. Results. It has been stated that the enzyme activity is regionally different in the tissues and sub cellular fractions of the brain depending on the animal species and the degree of the intensity of the stress factors, age and sex of the animal, circadian rhythms, season andmoreover, the resulting changes in the enzyme activity in most casesare irreversible. Conclusions. The data allow the dynamics of the activity of the energy supply enzymes to be considered as a determinant of cell reaction in response to exposure to adverse environmental factors and disturbance of sensory impulsation, which results in temporary increasing in the protection of intracellular energy metabolism through the development of an adaptive brain response.Key words: ontogenesis, brain, analysers, enzymes, environmental factors.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the removal of PFOA and PFOS in laboratory-prepared water, surface water, and groundwater via NF to determine the effect of water matrix properties on PFOA and PFOS rejection by NF. PFOA and PFOS rejections were up to approximately 38% higher in the natural water matrices when compared to the laboratory-prepared water. The rejection of PFOA did not vary in the tested river water and groundwater; however, an increasing trend in PFOS rejection was observed and attributed to enhanced size exclusion of PFOS-cation complexes via the sulfonate (–SO3−) ‘head’ of the PFOS ions and cation-induced membrane fouling by natural organic matter. Compound rejection increased with declining flux that was consistent with the dissolved organic matter (DOM) content of the respective water matrices. This study confirmed that DOM and cations indigenous to natural water matrices can lead to improved rejection of PFOA and PFOS when using NF.</jats:p>",

Member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized the critical need to address these three key risk factors through global action plans and policy recommendations. The 2013-2020 WHO action plan identifies the need to engage economic, agricultural and other relevant sectors to establish comprehensive and coherent policy. To date one of the biggest barriers to action is not so much identifying affective policies, but rather how a comprehensive policy approach to NCD prevention can be established across sectors. Much of the research on policy incoherence across sectors has focused on exposing the strategies used by commercial interests to shape public policy in their favor. Although the influence of commercial interests on government decisions remains an important issue for policy coherence, we argue, that the dominant neoliberal policy paradigm continues to enable the ability of these interests to influence public policy. In this paper, we examine how this dominant paradigm and the way it has been enshrined in institutional mechanisms has given rise to existing systems of governance of product environments, and how these systems create structural barriers to the introduction of meaningful policy action to prevent NCDs by fostering healthy product environments. Work to establish policy coherence across sectors, particularly to ensure a healthy product environment, will require systematic engagement with the assumptions that continue to structure institutions that perpetuate unhealthy product environments.</jats:p>"

Based on the demand, different technical options are analyzed. The integration of renewables is coupled with energy storage to increase the self‐sufficiency of the residential area. The economic feasibility of the energy supply concept depends on the requirements to be met as well as the regulatory framework.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The voluntary/mandatory divide is a constant feature of scholarly debates on corporate accountability for sustainability in global supply chains. A widely held assumption is that the addition of state authority to private transnational governance in global supply chains will “harden” accountability and, thus, promote more sustainable production. The state's ability to set legally binding requirements is expected to coerce companies into complying. The hybridization of private and state authority is seen to strengthen good practice in private authority. This empirical study questions these assumptions based on an analysis of two hybrid governance arrangements for sustainability in global supply chains: the EU's Timber Regulation (EUTR) and Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The results demonstrate that both EUTR and EU‐RED yield sector wide efforts of compliance and to this extent can be seen as enhancing accountability in the sense of answerability. At the same time, we find that the policies in both cases are not more demanding, nor enforced strictly, the latter putting into question their potential to coerce companies. Further, a “hardening” of accountability is at least obscured as both EUTR and EU‐RED have stripped private authority they employ in their hybrid transnational governance from the need to establish legitimacy with a broader audience. This makes legal compliance and cost‐effectiveness the core factor for companies’ efforts to demonstrate compliance. Our findings hence question whether the EUTR and EU‐RED have led to “hardened” accountability compared to private transnational governance, and ask for an empirical, more nuanced understanding of what there is to gain or lose from hybridizing private and state authority in transnational governance.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the research on how to solve the water scarcity is of great value. Firstly, considering the dynamic influence of time on water resource supply and demand and the two factors including the degree of water resource exploitation and per capita availability of water, the water resource supply and demand model is built to measure the capacity of the region to offer clean water. This paper selected the lower per capita water use in north China as the object. This water scarcity in this area is severe due to its large population, less natural water distribution, large proportion of agriculture and low usage of industrial and agricultural water. Secondly, building up the Logistic model and grey prediction model to predict the following 15 years’ population situation and the total water resource supply in north China. Use the intervention plan which combined waste water recycling and water transfer project to intervene water resources. Lastly, combined with intervention plan and introducing validity coefficients to improve the supply and demand model of water resources, it can be estimated that by the year of 2020, water scarcity in the certain area will be alleviated.</jats:p>",

The results show that: (i) there will be a strong increase in the demand for wood materials in the coming years; (ii) the domestic supply from the planted forests in Vietnam is yet to meet the demand due to their poor quality and small quantity; (iii) despite that, the domestic raw materials have been improved recently; (iv) the Vietnamese enterprises show a greater concern about the origin of wood materials. From these findings, we suggested some solutions to ensure the supply of wood materials in the coming years as follows: (i) adopting detailed, systematic and scientific methods for forecasting the supply of wood materials; (ii) developing clearer policies on afforestation, exploitation and use of domestic wood materials; (iii) building a portal for the wood materials; and (iv) promoting the links between the suppliers of raw wood materials and the furniture producers.</jats:p>"

These stations can perform smart charging processes, and can take advantage of the involvement of distributed generation sources in a microgrid framework. Furthermore, since photovoltaic batteries and EVs are sources based on direct current (DC), the realization of a DC microgrid structure is promising, though challenging. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear procedure for determining optimal operation planning of a DC-based electric vehicle supply infrastructure is proposed. The procedure aims at optimizing daily operational costs, based on forecast of photovoltaic production and EV exploitation. Peculiar aspects of energy storage devices and of the DC microgrid framework are accounted for through a non-linear iterative procedure. The proposed approach is applied to a test DC microgrid on different operation days and its effectiveness is compared to non-linear formulation solved by means of a genetic algorithm.</jats:p>"

Good quality groundwater is required for high crop yields in arid regions. A total of 45 samples were collected from wells and analyzed in the laboratory for this research work. Different water quality parameters were determined from these samples, namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percent (Na%), and permeability index (PI) during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The water types were identified through a Piper-trilinear diagram. Fifty per cent of the water samples of the total basin area fall under the saline category. The local farmers heavily rely on groundwater for the irrigation of crops. Excess use of groundwater for irrigation raises soil salinity. Some parts of the study area are facing serious problems such as loss of crop yields, and low availability of good quality groundwater even for drinking purposes. The results highlight that the study area has a high salinity content (C3) and low sodium (S1). The maps for different water quality parameters were generated using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method in ArcGIS 10.3 software.</jats:p>",

The objectives of the proposed mathematical model are to maximize the increase in cash flow, maximize the total created jobs in the supply chain, and maximize the reliability of consumed raw materials. To encounter the fuzzy uncertainty in this model, a possibilistic programming approach is used. To solve large‐sized problems, the multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm, multiobjective gray wolf optimization, and multiobjective invasive weed optimization are proposed and developed. The numerical results demonstrate that these algorithms solve the problems within about 1% of the required solving time for the augmented ε‐constraint and have similar performance and even better in some cases. The multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm with a weak performance takes less time than the other two algorithms. The multiobjective gray wolf optimization and multiobjective invasive weed optimization algorithms are superior based on the multiobjective performance indices.</jats:p>",

Comparing the structure of water usage and the structure of groundwater usage estimated by previous studies in each region, 35 municipalities were selected and they were classified into 12 catchments in focusing on the geographical location and the similarity of the shape of the structure of water supply-and-demand. In the upper reaches, surface-water is mainly used and the share of agricultural usage is small, therefore, seasonal variability of groundwater usage is small. On the other hand, in the middle and the lower reaches, the share of groundwater is large and the share of agricultural usage is large, therefore, seasonal variability of groundwater usage is large. Especially, these characteristics are obvious in the Loess Plateau. In addition, surface-water is mainly used again in the lowermost reaches. The results qualitatively identify the spatial pattern of the classification of water supply-and-demand structure and investigate the geographical heterogeneity within each catchment. Performing a GIS (Geographic Information System) -based estimation is meaningful for grasping the geospatial pattern of water supply-and-demand structure and for providing an area-by-area report of the situation of the water resource usage. It is hoped that this study serves as an academic reference for optimizing the water resource management and for providing some policy recommendations on resource’s sustainability by using a GIS-based approach.</jats:p>"

Lamina I neurons in the trigeminocervical complex integrate and relay peripheral inputs, thus playing a key role in both cranial nociception and primary headache syndromes. Because of the technically challenging nature of recording, the long-range trigeminal afferent inputs to the medullary and cervical lamina I neurons were not intensively studied so far. Therefore, we have developed an ex vivo brainstem–cervical cord preparation with attached trigeminal nerve for the visually guided whole-cell recordings from the medullary and cervical lamina I neurons. Two-thirds of recorded neurons generated intrinsic rhythmic discharges. The stimulation of the trigeminal nerve produced a complex effect; it interrupted the rhythmic discharge for hundreds of milliseconds but, if the neuron was silenced by a hyperpolarizing current injection, could elicit a discharge. The monosynaptic inputs from the trigeminal Aδ, high-threshold Aδ, low-threshold C, and C afferents were recorded in the medullary neurons, as well as in the cervical neurons located in the segments C1 to C2 and, to a lesser degree, in C3 to C4. This pattern of supply was consistent with our labelling experiments showing extensive cervical projections of trigeminal afferents. Excitatory inputs were mediated, although not exclusively, through AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors, whereas inhibitory inputs through both GABA and glycine receptors. In conclusion, the trigeminocervical lamina I neurons receive a complex pattern of long-range monosynaptic and polysynaptic inputs from a variety of the trigeminal nociceptive afferents.</jats:p>",

The first case is about multi-period force expansion. An analytical expression is presented to relate the expansion target, training capacity, and expansion period. The system dynamics model forecasts the personnel level achievable against the expansion target for varying input of training capacities. This can be used to inform military force planners about the required training capacity and timeframe to achieve the expansion. The second case examines the sustainability of the deployment of a volunteer-based Army reserve unit. The soldiers’ behavior changes due to their deployment experiences (in terms of willingness to deploy) are modeled and their impact on personnel availability is simulated. The second system dynamics model predicts the personnel level sustainability against the required number of soldiers to deploy. It provides insights regarding the required size of the pool of soldiers to support a deployed Army reserve unit, and promotes policy exploration to boost soldiers’ willingness to deploy. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the applicability of system dynamics to assist decision makers in “raising, training, and sustaining” military workforce supply chains. </jats:p>",

This study demonstrates that both NAPs contain elements addressing the governance gaps surrounding modern slavery, such as enacting new laws, adapting existing regulations, strengthening multi-stakeholder mechanisms for business accountability, and promoting innovation. However, it is argued that the NAPs themselves were not the catalysts for the majority of these measures. This article concludes that states should optimize the five characteristics of polycentric governance outlined in this study to improve the relevance and effectiveness of NAPs as drivers of change.</jats:p>",

The Chinese Dayang cruise has conducted detailed towed line surveys of hydrothermal activity on segment 27 of the ultra-slow spreading southwest Indian ridge in 2015. The results have identified as many as 9 hydrothermal fields along 85-km-long segment, including one confirmed hydrothermal field, three inferred hydrothermal fields and five suspected fields. Hydrothermal activities are not only limited along-axis but also found approximately 10 km away from the axis. These vent fields are likely powered by a seismically identified axial magma chamber, including melt migration along normal faults to flank areas. The calculated hydrothermal activity frequency on segment 27 is approximately 3.6–8 times higher than that calculated from the Interridge database, suggesting that careful system exploration can reveal more hydrothermal activities even on ultra-slow spreading ridges effected by hotspot.</jats:p>"

The first point is that, for Guyana, trade liberalization has resulted in the expansion of the country’s supply of exports and the reduction in its poverty rate. The second point is that the impact of trade liberalization on export supply and poverty has been quite small. In addition, this study finds that the real effective exchange rate and the growth of the economy along with the growth of the agricultural sector were important drivers for expanding the country’s supply of exports and reducing its poverty rate over the period covered in this study. </jats:p>",

Although the antifouling mechanisms of Al-based coagulants have been widely investigated, there is little data about their impact on costs and treatment efficiency for decentralized membrane-based systems. In this study, a comparative assessment of two decentralized ultrafiltration (UF) units with and without polyaluminum chloride (PACl) coagulation was undertaken to evaluate the influence of coagulation on the fouling, water quality, and costs nexus. The results showed that PACl suppressed both total fouling and hydraulically irreversible fouling. A matched-pair analysis also revealed that PACl improved the permeate quality by enhancing the removal of particulates and dissolved organics. Compared with the conventional UF system, the hybrid coagulation–UF system contributed to a 21% increase in the flux rate, allowing for a 27% reduction in membrane area and thus, providing cost benefits in terms of both capital and operating costs. These results suggest that PACl coagulation is potentially a cost-effective antifouling method for decentralized membrane-based water systems.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, to date, there have been no available studies that have employed TEM for riverbank filtration (RBF) application. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the capability of TEM technology in profiling the subsurface of RBF areas adjacent to Sungai Perak, Kota Lama Kiri, Kuala Kangsar. A total of 27 survey points of simple rectangular loop configuration with loop area of 100 m2 (10 m × 10 m) were executed in the study area. A suite of TerraTEM equipment was used for the data acquisition process. The inversion and interpretation processes were then conducted by using the modeling program of ‘TDEM Geomodel’ and Surfer 13. The results showed four 2-D resistivity cross-section (depth–distance) profiles with their corresponding geological units. The interpretation results indicated that the subsurfaces of the study area were identified as alluvial-type soils (with a range of 10 to 40 Ωm) up to 8 m due to the presence of silt, sand and gravel. Based on the good quality results produced as well as its convenience, it is recommended that the TEM method is used for RBF exploration in future work.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is critical but challenging to mitigate supply disruption risks by improving management methods. The extant literature has mainly investigated the sourcing strategies of manufacturers with price-taking suppliers. Where there is an option to source from multiple generators, including regular but unreliable generators and reliable backup generators, a flexible sourcing strategy is usually regarded as the best tactic for the grid operator. Our objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits of flexible sourcing and sole sourcing when generators are strategic price-setters. In this paper, we develop a Stackelberg game with wholesale prices contingent on the dominant grid operator’s sourcing strategy. We describe and analyze the resulting equilibriums under different scenarios. The results show that the grid operator does not necessarily benefit from a backup generator and that the flexible sourcing mode is not in fact optimal, except when the disruption ratio of the unreliable generator is medium and the penalty-sharing ratio of the unreliable generator is low. The model is applied to a numerical case study of a real-word electricity supply chain to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed conclusions.</jats:p>"

The scheme represents a wind power complex containing the park of wind generators located at the points with high wind potential. The wind generators provide guaranteed power supply even in periods of weak wind. For heat supply of the consumer, all surplus of the electric power goes on thermoelectric heating of water in tanks of accumulators, and also on receiving hydrogen by a method of electrolysis of water. The current heat supply is carried out with the use of hot water storage tanks, and the heat supply during the heat shortage is carried out by burning the stored hydrogen in condensing hydrogen boilers. We have developed the algorithm of calculation and the program \"Wind in energy\" which allows calculating annual balance of energy and picking up necessary quantity of the equipment for implementation of the scheme proceeding from the annual schedule of thermal and electric loading, and also potential of wind energy in the chosen region. The calculation-substantiation of the scheme proposed in relation to the real energy-insulated object Ust-Kamchatsk (Kamchatka) is carried out. The equipment for the implementation of an alternative energy supply scheme without the use of imported fuel is selected and compared with the traditional energy supply scheme based on a diesel power plant and a boiler house operating on imported fuel. With the introduction of an alternative power supply scheme, the equipment of the traditional scheme that has exhausted its resource can be used for backup power supply. Using climate databases, a number of energy-insulated facilities in the North and East of Russia with high wind energy potential are considered and the conditions for the successful implementation of the energy supply scheme are analyzed. This requires not only a high average annual wind speed, but also a minimum number of days of weak wind. In addition, it is necessary that the profile of the wind speed distribution in the annual section coincides with the profile of the heat load consumption.</jats:p>"

The aim of this work is to study the structure of the world energy supply, including Russia, and the role of energy cooperatives abroad in the past and present on energy supply to agriculture and rural areas, and the possibility of applying their experience in the Russian economy. The authors used observation, abstraction, analysis and synthesis, as well as dialectical and logical methods. Having studied the data of domestic and foreign statistical institutes, the authors came to the conclusion that non-renewable energy sources make up the largest share in the world. In addition to the economical use and efficient conversion of fossil raw materials, the focus is increasingly shifting to the use of renewable energy sources that reduce dependence on oil and gas, in particular in countries that do not have their own reserves, and therefore ensure sustainable energy production. At the same time, the global energy transition to energy resources, which will be available to all, can be carried out with the help of energy cooperatives. In Russia, the capacity of renewable energy facilities is also constantly growing. The peculiarity of the country is the need to transfer energy over long distances with significant wear of transmission networks, a deep monopoly of the market, and, consequently, high tariffs for consumers. One of the ways to solve the problems of affordable energy availability for agriculture, the authors see the creation of energy cooperatives. In the article the approximate model of energy cooperative is offered, their classification is given. The results of the study will help to create competition in the energy market, optimize the budgets of the village and reduce costs in the process of commodity circulation of agricultural products to the final consumer.</jats:p>"

Unavoidable reality is that boil off gas (BOG) generates, because of low temperature of LNG, about -162.5 °C at 101.3 kPa for storage and transportation of liquefied natural gas. As natural gas productions increasing globally, BOG and handling problems become serious critical subject in both economic and environment regulations. In this work, liquefied natural gas storage facilities and loading facilities are simulated to investigate the generated BOG by calculating the heat leaks through cargo tank, pipelines, storage tank, and the generated heat by equipment’s. Later, boil off gas rates are estimated for each sector into LNG supply chain with different operational conditions, parameters and voyage time. Factors that affect BOG such as operation temperatures and pressures, methane content, and nitrogen content are presented. Current study would help to properly store and transport LNG to minimize the venting of BOG into supply chain, and thus reducing greenhouse emissions, save energy, and reducing waste of natural gas.</jats:p>",

A CCS-MPC is designed using the DOB for reference voltage tracking purpose, and input constraints are considered in the controller design to calculate the optimal control input. Model uncertainties are defined using polytopic uncertainty class, and a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization method is used to compute the optimal observer gain matrix.

Here, we aimed to produce the plant polyketide curcumin in A. oryzae. Curcumin is synthesized from feruloyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl-CoA by curcuminoid synthase (CUS). A. oryzae expressing CUS produced curcumin (64 μg/plate) on an agar medium containing feruloyl-N-acetylcysteamine (a feruloyl-CoA analog). To increase curcumin yield, we attempted to strengthen the supply of malonyl-CoA using two approaches: enhancement of the reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which produces malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and inactivation of the acetyl-CoA-consuming sterol biosynthesis pathway. Finally, we succeeded in increasing curcumin yield sixfold by the double disruption of snfA and SCAP; SnfA is a homolog of SNF1, which inhibits ACC activity by phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and SCAP is positively related to sterol biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus. This study provided useful information for heterologous polyketide production in A. oryzae.</jats:p>",

One source of pollution is leakage from polluted streams such as open drains. The effect of open drains on groundwater quality has become an essential issue. This study aims to use different lining materials to minimize the seepage from open drains to protect groundwater. MODFLOW is used to investigate flow and contaminant transport and to evaluate efficiency of different lining materials. A hypothetical case study is used to assess different lining materials such as clay, bentonite, geomembranes and concrete. The results showed that decreasing the conductivities of lining materials reduced the extension of the contaminate. The extension of contaminants was reduced by 43, 89.6, 91.4 and 93% compared with the base case when drains were lined by clay, bentonite, geomembranes and concrete, respectively. Also, cost analysis of lining materials was done to detect the best lining material. Lining using geomembranes reduced contaminant extension at low cost compared with concrete, which reduced contaminant extension at double the cost. This reveals that the geomembranes represent the preferred material to protect groundwater from drain seepage due to its high durability and low cost compared with concrete.</jats:p>",

At each water source, an infrastructure checklist was used (n = 48); 10 users were interviewed (n = 472); and, if the pump had water, water quality samples were collected (n = 24). The results show that use of a professional driller does not guarantee a functioning rope and washer pump that produces safe water. Where the pumps were functional, most provided safe drinking water. However, only 8% (4/48) of pumps had good water quality, a flow rate of &gt;20 L/min and a full consensus of positive satisfaction among users. Pumps are not necessarily working better or worse in more remote areas. A process of introducing and creating evaluative guidelines for new (approved) technologies for rural water supply has not been established in Malawi.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the hydro-chemical quality of the Marvdasht aquifer located in the semi-arid region of Iran and to map the groundwater quality parameters. For this purpose, a mean data of 11 groundwater quality parameters collected from 49 wells (2010–2015) were used. Pie, Schoeller and Piper diagrams were used to determine the dominant ions and type of water. Ion ratios and Gibbs diagrams were used to illustrate the chemistry and processes in the groundwater. Spatial distribution of quality parameters were mapped using ArcGIS. Results showed that the water type is Na-Cl and Cl− with abundance orders of CL− &gt; SO42− &gt; HCO3− and Na+ with abundance orders of Na+ &gt; Mg2 + &gt;Ca2+ &gt; K+ are dominant anion and cation, respectively. Gibbs diagrams revealed that geological formations control the groundwater chemistry in 66% of the groundwater samples. Based on the Wilcox diagram, only 24% of the samples fell into the C4–S4 class with high salinity and alkalinity hazard. The maps showed that generally groundwater in the north of the study site has better quality than that the south of the study site, where the existence of dolomite and chalky formations leads to decreasing water quality.</jats:p>",

In this regard, there has been an increasing interest in the local food supply of cities and their surrounding regions, as local food is considered to be a contributing factor toward more sustainable, resilient and just urban food systems. Based on this background, a roadmapping process was conducted to assess the status quo and to identify measures to enhance the local food supply in the city-region of Graz in Austria. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 stakeholders, analysed textual materials and calculated food carrying capacities. The obtained data served as input for a series of three workshops, where measures were derived. Our results suggest that cooperation among agri-food stakeholders should be facilitated by local decision makers in order to promote food from regional sources within the target area. Furthermore, smart technologies can help to scale-up local food supply schemes, and to track down food stocks and flows more efficiently. Besides, food policy councils and open food labs can help to incubate food product innovations and to support partnerships among agri-food stakeholders, including local small-scale farmers. In the future, engagement and empowerment processes with local food stakeholders should be addressed to enable transformational processes. Roadmaps can help to initiate such processes.</jats:p>"

As part of that review, this paper examines two key concerns with current blockchain designs for accounting and supply chain transactions: data independence and multiple semantic models for the same information distribution problem. Blockchain applications typically integrate database, application and presentation tiers all in the same ledger. This results in a general inability to query information in the ledger and other concerns. Further, since most applications appear to be private blockchain applications, there is a concern of agents needing to accommodate multiple blockchains depending on who their trading partners are and what they request. Finally, this paper uses a distributed database to design a ‘blockchain‐like’ system for virtual organizations.</jats:p>",

A questionnaire was selected to obtain data from across the UK food packaging supply chain. Participants were selected from six industry stakeholder groups, with 24 completing the questionnaire. This study has clearly shown there is a large spectrum of solutions in a move to CE, each with their own benefits and limitations. TT has an ability to enable these, but in selecting the best one for a specific packaging solution, a decision maker must take into consideration business constraints of the supply chain and the consumer's behaviour towards new solutions.</jats:p>",

There are laboratory studies on the processes of stirring and crystallization under the action of a traveling magnetic field. However, in the majority of studies it is assumed that the inductor power supply of the linear induction machine is carried out by a symmetrical three-phase system of currents with an equal phase shift, which, in some cases, is not quite correct. To approximate the model to real operating conditions, a numerical simulation of the magnetic field and the flow of liquid metal was carried out when supplied from a power source of symmetric three-phase voltage. The distortion of magnetic field, which, in turn, causes an nonuniform distribution of forces and the flow of a liquid metal, is shown. Evaluation of asymmetrical effect on the liquid metal flow was carried out by means of finite element method. That effect is caused by different coefficients of mutual coils induction of the linear induction machine, which is confirmed by experimental data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider an on-demand service platform using earning-sensitive independent providers with heterogeneous reservation price (for work participation) to serve its time and price-sensitive customers with heterogeneous valuation of the service. As such, the supply and demand are “endogenously” dependent on the price the platform charges its customers and the wage the platform pays its independent providers. We present an analytical model with endogenous supply (number of participating agents) and endogenous demand (customer request rate) to study this on-demand service platform. To coordinate endogenous demand with endogenous supply, we include the steady-state waiting time performance based on a queueing model in the customer utility function to characterize the optimal price and wage rates that maximize the profit of the platform. We first analyze a base model that uses a fixed payout ratio (i.e., the ratio of wage over price), and then extend our model to allow the platform to adopt a time-based payout ratio. We find that it is optimal for the platform to charge a higher price when demand increases; however, the optimal price is not necessarily monotonic when the provider capacity or the waiting cost increases. Furthermore, the platform should offer a higher payout ratio as demand increases, capacity decreases or customers become more sensitive to waiting time. We also find that the platform should lower its payout ratio as it grows with the number of providers and customer demand increasing at about the same rate. We use a set of actual data from a large on-demand ride-hailing platform to calibrate our model parameters in numerical experiments to illustrate some of our main insights. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The last decade has seen a numerous studies focusing on the closed-loop supply chain. Accordingly, the uncertainty conditions as well as the green emissions of facilities are still open issues. In this paper, a new fuzzy multi-objective programming approach is to present for a production-distribution model in order to develop a multi-product, multi-period and multi-level green closed-loop supply chain network problem, which this model is formulated as multi-objective mixed linear integer programming (MOMILP). In regards to offered fuzzy multi-objective model, three conflicting goals are exited, simultaneously. The objective functions are to minimizing the total cost, minimizing the gas emissions costs due to vehicle movements between centers, and maximizing the reliability of delivery demand due to the reliability of the suppliers. To get closer to real-world applications, the parameters of model are considered by fuzzy numbers. Another novelty of proposed model is in the solution methodology. To solve the model, this study not only uses a well-known Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) but a number of new modifications of ICA (MICA) also have been provided to address the proposed problem, which is to demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms included: SA, ICA, ACO, GA, and PSO are compare. Finally, different analyses with a variety of problem complexity in different sizes are performed to assess the performance of algorithms as well as some sensitivity analyses on the efficiency of model are studied.</jats:p>",

Improved compliance requires understanding of reaction kinetics and wall effects of different distribution materials used on DBP formation. To validate results in a full-scale system, effect of different materials, wall effects, bulk reactions, and water movement is analyzed using simulated distribution system (SDS) tests, material specific simulated distribution system (MS-SDS) tests, pipe loop, and pipe section reactor (PSR); all built using materials from the city of Columbia, Missouri's distribution system. On average, the choice of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and ductile iron can account for as much as 36% difference in trihalomethane (TTHM) formation and 60% difference in chlorine residual decay over time irrespective of the prediction model and operational strategy used. In the case of ductile iron, pipe effect (PE) is &lt;1, which shows that in the ductile iron pipe systems there is a net loss of TTHM yield due to non-TTHM forming chlorine demand imposed by the pipe environment, whereas in PVC pipe, PE is &gt;1. In PVC systems there is an overall increase in TTHM formation as a result of pipe wall surface reactions.</jats:p>",

This topic constitutes a strategic and transverse challenge for the sciences and public policies in the current context of global climate change. As a contribution to this challenge, the aim of this research was to qualitatively describe and analyze a territorial intervention model based on two case studies. Both involve stakeholders from the public sector, forest companies, and rural communities within the framework of implementing a participatory process at a local scale. The first case study was based on the collective creation of a set of indicators for local water monitoring. The second case, through the incorporation of the social and local dimension, culminated in the collective creation of a forest watershed management guide. The research hypothesis was that the inclusion of stakeholders and local knowledge in forest watershed management is essential to create and/or strengthen local abilities that ensure the involvement of communities in water governance, surpassing the current informative and consultative approaches. The research methodology was qualitative, and the data collection strategies were focused on the compilation of the process, the participatory work, and gathering diverse local knowledge. The data analysis included content tabulation, including both local indicators and ones extracted from the guide. In both cases, the systematization process and the main empirical findings were included. Among the findings, it was observed that both the pilot of local indicators and the design of the forest watershed management guide confirmed that the main challenge of local participation is the effective inclusion of local knowledge in water governance. This ethical and methodological challenge must be approached more rigorously and with more commitment.</jats:p>"

The study was conducted at Bahir Dar University with participants who were first-degree graduates from the 2015 and 2016 cohorts. Stratified multistage random sampling was used to select respondents. Out of 4208 graduates, 867 graduates were selected to participate in the study. To determine the potential factors for graduate employability in the labour market, both descriptive and inferential statistics were applied.Results revealed that 79% percentof surveyed graduates were gainfully employed, with the majority (93%) having their first job related to their completed course. The time taken to find employment was from 1 to 6 months and the overall average duration of unemployment was 5.08 months. Sixty five percent of graduates reported that they used a public advertisement to find their first job and 58% reported that their employers used examinations to select   potential candidates. A 12% variation in employability was explained by CGPA, preferred field of study, the number of companies contacted and time management skills of graduates. Moreover, graduates’ transitional employability has a positive association with cumulative GPA, preferred field of study, and internship practice. It is recommended that sustainable employment of graduates can be secured if the University improves its current curriculum to incorporate more employability skills demanded by the labour market.</jats:p>"

Then the hydropower generation processes are simulated by the RHC model, and the performances of hydropower generation with different EFHs and EDHs are evaluated, respectively. The results show that: (1) the RHC can adapt to varying conditions by re-optimizing the decisions during the EFH; (2) with the EFH increasing, the hydroelectric reliability increases and the efficiency decreases, while the efficiency and reliability are improved with shortened the EDH.</jats:p>",

Although green supply chain learning has been suggested to be a crucial approach for enhancing innovative capability, whether and under what conditions it affects green innovation is still unclear. This study investigates the influence of two dimensions of green supply chain learning (i.e., green supplier and customer learning) on two types of green innovation (i.e., green product and process innovation) and the moderating role of green technology turbulence. Survey data collected from 249 Chinese firms were used to test research hypotheses. The findings show that both green supplier and customer learning positively influence green product and process innovation. However, green technology turbulence moderates these relationships differently. Specifically, green technology turbulence strengthens the impacts of green customer learning on green product and process innovation, while weakens the impact of green supplier learning on green process innovation. The moderating effect of green technology turbulence on the link between green supplier learning and green product innovation is insignificant. These results highlight the importance of learning from supply chain partners for sustainable development and firms' agility in adapting to external technological conditions in implementing their environmental practices.</jats:p>",

Based on the equation of motion of the pump motion parts, the relationship between the external characteristics and the internal flow field in the pump is further investigated because the dynamic behavior of the pump and the detailed fluid field evolutions inside the pump are captured during the transition process, and the transient flow rate, rotating speed, and pressure inside the impeller are comprehensively investigated. Meanwhile, compared with the data gained by experiment and traditional 1D-MOC, the relative errors of rotating speed and the flow rate obtained by 1D-3D coupling method are smaller than those by 1D-MOC. Furthermore, the influences of the main coupling parameters and coupling modes on the calculation results are analyzed, and the cause of the deviation is further explained.</jats:p>",

The performance indexes are employed in the models as the dependent variables while the power supply indexes are the explanatory variables. The data were sourced primarily through a well-structured questionnaire and the samples determined by the Cochran sampling techniques. The data were analyzed with the Qualitative Respond Model. It was revealed that a lower duration of public power supply significantly reduces the profitability, productivity and revenue, as well as the storage of products of the SMSEs, examined.

The actual parameter verification and theoretical verification of the system are carried out by means of experimental identification, and the research of subsequent control strategies is guided. According to the analysis results and the dynamic parameters of the power supply, a control strategy based on Predictive PI is proposed and simulated. In addition, in order to realize the actual verification of the power supply control algorithm, a power controller based on the ARM and FPGA architecture is designed to be applied to the system.

To clarify the key process of the intensification of the superbomb cyclone, we specifically examined the role of heat supply from the Gulf Stream by performing cloud‐resolving numerical experiments. When the cyclone rapidly developed, sensible and latent heat fluxes from the warm current predominated around the cold conveyor belt (CCB) of the cyclone. These fluxes created a convectively unstable layer near the surface. When the instability was released around the cyclone center, latent heating (LH) occurred. The increased LH further intensified the cyclone and its associated CCB. These findings indicate that the positive feedback process between the CCB and LH played a key role in intensification over the Gulf Stream. In this way, the heat supply from the Gulf Stream significantly impacted the development of the superbomb cyclone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The number of domestic apartment houses in South Korea that use district heating is steadily increasing. In addition, most Korean residential buildings use radiant floor heating systems. For such systems, the heating water temperature supplied by a heat exchanger in a mechanical room serves as one of the critical control parameters for providing heat to individual residential apartments. Fixed temperature (FT) and outdoor temperature reset control (OTR) have conventionally been used to adjust the heating supply water temperature. However, both control methods have a major technical weakness; they do not reflect changes in residents’ heating use. To overcome this issue, this study proposes a new method for controlling the heating supply water temperature, called Residential Energy Demand (RED). To verify the proposed method, researchers conducted both simulation- and experiment-based tests. The RED control method achieved about 4% reduction in heating energy consumption compared to the conventional OTR control process. In addition, the RED control method increased the average indoor temperature by 0.17 °C during the heating period. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the proposed control method is capable of achieving energy savings and a warmer thermal indoor environment.</jats:p>"

In the first trial, 648 male 21-day-old animals were divided among six treatments and six replicates, with 18 birds per experimental unit, organized in a completely randomized design (DIC). The treatments were diets with different acacia tannin levels (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, or 1250 g ton-1). The results indicated that 250 g ton-1 of tannin was not harmful to weight gain, final weight, or feed conversion. Tannin levels caused a decrease in carcass yield and fat deposition and an increase in liver size. For the second trial, 900 male broilers of 21 days of age were used and distributed in a DIC, with different levels of substitution of calcitic limestone by the golden mussel meal (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 %) and supplementation or not with acacia tannins (250 g ton-1), with 5 replicates and each experimental unit being composed of 18 birds. The performance data show that the use of 250 g ton-1 of tannin is detrimental to bone performance and resistance and golden mussel meal can be used to substitute up to 100 % of the limestone in the diets without affecting the variables studied.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the simulation principle and advantages of OpenDSS are explained from the aspects of model construction and power flow calculation. Secondly, the optimal power supply access model with multiple time slots and multiple scenarios is established with the goal of minimum planning end value. Thirdly, a model solving method based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. Finally, a typical example is chosen to calculate the optimal planning scheme of distributed power supply under multi-period, and the rationality of the model is verified.</jats:p>",

To avoid cancer cell reintroduction at transplantation, a multi-step culture system has been proposed to obtain fully competent oocytes for in vitro fertilization. Current in vitro systems are limited by the low number and health of secondary follicles produced during the first step culture of ovarian tissue fragments. To overcome such limitations, bioreactor designs have been proposed to enhance oxygen supply to the tissue, with inconsistent results. This retrospective study investigates, on theoretical grounds, whether the lack of a rational design of the proposed bioreactors prevented the full exploitation of follicle growth potential. Methods: Models describing oxygen transport in bioreactors and tissue were developed and used to predict oxygen availability inside ovarian tissue in the pertinent literature. Results: The proposed theoretical analysis suggests that a successful outcome is associated with enhanced oxygen availability in the cultured tissue in the considered bioreactor designs. This suggests that a rational approach to bioreactor design for ovarian tissue culture in vitro may help exploit tissue potential to support follicle growth.</jats:p>"

We focus on cross-border Internet purchases, as part of the digital economy, the total value of which cannot be accurately estimated by using existing consumer survey approaches. In fact, they lead to a serious underestimation. To obtain an accurate estimate, we propose a three-step data-driven approach based on supply-side data. For the first step, we develop a data-driven generic method for firm level probabilistic record linkage of tax data and business registers. In the second step, we use machine learning to identify webshops based on website data. Then, in the third step, we implement recently developed bias correction techniques that have hitherto been overlooked by the machine learning community. Subsequently, we claim that our three-step approach can be applied to any European Union member state, leading to more accurate estimates of cross-border Internet purchases than those obtained by currently existing approaches. To justify the claim, we apply our approach to the Netherlands for the year 2016 and find an estimate that is six times as high as current estimates, having a standard deviation of 8%. Hence, we may conclude that our new approach deserves more investigation and applications.</jats:p>",

Such systems include (1) water systems in intermediate stages of water treatment, in particular lime-coagulated or clarified water after pre-treatment, (2) cooling water in the circulating cooling system (COO) of the station, (3) water heat transfer medium in conjugated heat networks, (4) boiler water. All these systems are characterized by the presence of a stabilized (metastable) solid phase, mainly calcium carbonate, capable of forming a crystalline phase of calcite under certain conditions. The crystallization process is undesirable, since it can lead to dense deposits on the heat exchange surfaces. Approximately the instability of such systems is characterized by the value of ΔQw - by changing the total alkalinity of water in time (hours, days).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Uncertainty is unavoidable and addressing the same is inevitable. That everything is available at our doorstep is due to a well-managed modern global supply chain, which takes place despite its efficiency and effectiveness being threatened by various sources of uncertainty originating from the demand side, supply side, manufacturing process, and planning and control systems. This paper addresses the demand- and supply-rooted uncertainty. In order to cope with uncertainty within the constrained multi-objective supply chain network, this paper develops a fuzzy goal programming methodology, with solution procedures. The probabilistic fuzzy goal multi-objective supply chain network (PFG-MOSCN) problem is thus formulated and then solved by three different approaches, namely, simple additive goal programming approach, weighted goal programming approach, and pre-emptive goal programming approach, to obtain the optimal solution. The proposed work links fuzziness in transportation cost and delivery time with randomness in demand and supply parameters. The results may prove to be important for operational managers in manufacturing units, interested in optimizing transportation costs and delivery time, and implicitly, in optimizing profits. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of ecosystem services (ES) supply and demand has attracted increasing attention in science and policy making because it effectively links ecosystem services to human well-being. The imbalance of ES supply and demand in urban areas has become a key issue in regional sustainable development. In this context, we calculated ES supply and demand for Wuhan City, China, using the ES supply and demand ratio (ESDR) and the comprehensive ES supply–demand ratio (CESDR) to express the relationship between ES supply and demand. Ecological zoning was proposed according to the spatial differentiation of the ES supply–demand relationship, and policy recommendations are made. The results show that from the perspective of total ES supply and demand, the water yield supply (SWY), grain yield supply (SGY), and recreation services supply (SRS) are greater than the water yield demand (DWY), grain yield demand (DGY), and recreation services demand (DRS), and that the climate regulation supply (SCR) is less than the climate regulation demand (DCR). From a spatial perspective, there are imbalances and mismatches in ES supply and demand, especially in urban central areas. The values of SWY, SGY, SCS, and SRS per unit area are less than their respective demand values, and the area of mismatch has expanded with the gradual increase of the built-up area. The spatial pattern of ES supply and demand is circular, with the form of “deficit zone–relative equilibrium zone–surplus zone”, which corresponds to “urban central area–near suburbs–distant suburbs and rural areas”.</jats:p>"

Unlike the conventional induction generators, in the proposed configuration of this study, in addition to the phase windings, the stator utilises an assisted DC field coil, which is responsible for production of controllable flux inside the machine. As the main salient feature of including the DC field coil which increases controllability of the flux, providing a regulated terminal voltage in a very wide range appropriate for CCPS applications can be pointed out. In addition, due to the lack of brush and winding on the rotor in the proposed BFAIG, stability, long life and high reliability can be addressed as appropriate characteristics of this structure. Moreover, in this study, analytical design of the proposed BFAIG is presented and two‐dimensional magnetic‐field distribution is performed by using MagNet CAD package to verify the design procedure. On the basis of obtained results from electromagnetic‐field analysis, a CCPS is simulated and studied. The simulation results confirm the performance and efficiency of the presented CCPS.</jats:p>",

In situ data was collected during ARKTIKA-2018 expedition and then completed with satellite estimates of sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS), sea surface height, satellite-derived wind speeds and sea ice concentrations. Derivation of SSS is still challenging in high latitude regions, and the quality of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SSS retrieval was improved by applying a threshold on SSS weekly error. The validity of SST and SSS products is demonstrated using ARKTIKA-2018 continuous thermosalinograph measurements and CTD casts. The surface gradients and mixing of river and sea waters in the free of ice and ice covered areas is described with a special attention to the marginal ice zone. The Ekman transport was calculated to better understand the pathway of surface water displacement. T-S diagram using surface satellite estimates shows a possibility to investigate the surface water masses transformation in detail.\n                        </jats:p>"

A solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), which is a type of FCCGS, determines the amount of power generation and power generation time according to the demand for electricity and hot water supply in houses. Therefore, residents’ lifestyle influences a PEFC’s load following speed and efficiency. However, there are few actual surveys of household electricity and hot water supply demand, and we haven’t fully grasped factors that affect them. Therefore, we aim to acquire home electricity and hot water usage habits that affect PEFC operation by measuring detailed electricity and hot water supply demand in 10 houses in Japan. In addition, we also conducted a questionnaire survey for the households and analysed the influence of resident’s behaviour on demand for electricity and hot water supply. We can’t see instantaneous changes in the amount of PEFC generated based on hourly data, so we measured the electricity consumption of the entire house and the electricity consumption and hot water consumption of each household appliance every 2 seconds. In this report, we analysed the usage habits of home appliances.</jats:p>",

The inactivation efficiency of E. coli and removal percentage of UV254 were studied under different rotation speeds of the RPB and varying concentrations of inorganic salts such as NaHCO3, Na2SO4 and CaCl2. Results indicate that both the inactivation efficiency of E. coli and removal percentage of UV254 increased with an increasing rotation speed of the RPB but decreased with an increase in concentrations of the inorganic salts. Analyses on the mechanism of the treatment process reveal that the inorganic salts consume O3 and ·OH to generate products with lower oxidation ability, and thus result in a poor treatment effect on the effluent. This work provides fundamentals for the O3-RPB process in the treatment of SE from urban wastewater treatment plants.</jats:p>",

Despite that, the water distribution system (WDS) loses an average of 35% of its water resources, and the leakage rates may reach even higher values in some regions. The dual pressures of the lack of water resources and severe WDS leakage become even more problematic considering that commonly used leakage detection methods are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and can only detect single-point leakages. For multiple leakage point detection, these methods often perform poorly. To solve the problem of multiple leakage point detection, this paper presents a method for multiple leakage point detection based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN can forecast the leakages from a macro-perspective. It extracts the features of the collected historical leakage data by constructing a CNN model and predicts whether the real-time data are leakage data or not based on the learning of the features that are extracted from the historical data. The experimental results show that the detection accuracies based on 21 sensors of one, two, and three leakage points are 99.63%, 98.58% and 95.25%, respectively. After the number of sensors is reduced to eight, the leakage detection accuracies of one, two, and three leakage points are 96.43%, 94.88% and 91.56%, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Nearly one billion people worldwide receive water through piped networks that are not continually pressurized and operate intermittently. The prevalence and persistence of these Intermittent Water Supplies (IWS) is surprising as this mode of operation induces water contamination and customer equity issues. Shortages of source water, customers' water demand, and leaking pipes are frequently cited as necessitating IWS. We propose a framework for understanding the persistence and operation of IWS. The supply system is represented by an average customer and a spatially averaged leakage rate. With this macroscopic hydraulic model, we relate customer demand satisfaction, source water availability, customer demand, and leakage. While this approach ignores the complexities of network topology, we find that the model approximates real systems well (calibrating to four intermittent reference networks achieved <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>&gt;0.94). The calibrated model is robust to moderate changes in demand and leakage (maintaining <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>&gt;0.83). Using the model, we show that the tipping point between satisfied demand and unsatisfied demand is a local optimum for utilities, which may explain the persistence of IWS. Beyond this point, the volume received by customers does not increase, but utilities must supply more water to the network. The generality of the proposed model enables its use when regulating and upgrading IWS. We demonstrate the latter by critiquing a performance‐based contract that was intended to improve an intermittent supply in India. Demand satisfaction has profound implications for hydraulics and human welfare. We propose the degree of demand satisfaction as a metric for evaluating IWS and for tracking the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6.1.</jats:p>",

Objectives were to investigate if increasing methionine (Met) supply during late-pregnancy affects developmental, metabolic, and immune parameters of the calf at birth and during the neonatal period. Calves born to Holstein cows individually-fed a basal control (CON; 1.47 Mcal/kg dry matter [DM] and 15.3% crude protein) diet with no added Met or CON plus rumen-protected Met (MET; Mepron® at 0.09% of diet DM) during the last 28±2 d of pregnancy were used. Liver biopsies were harvested at 4, 14, 28, and 50 d of age and used for metabolomics via GS-MS and activity of hepatic 1-carbon metabolism enzymes. Blood for biomarker analyses and innate immune function assays was harvested at birth (before colostrum feeding), 7, 21, 42 and 50 d of age. Whole blood was challenged with enteropathogenic bacteria (E. coli 0118:H8), and phagocytosis and oxidative burst of neutrophils and monocytes quantified by flow cytometry. At birth, MET calves had greater (P≤0.05) body weight (BW, 44.1 vs. 42.1±0.70 kg), hip height (HH, 81.3 vs. 79.6±0.53 cm), and wither height (WH, 77.8 vs. 75.9±0.47 cm). Differences persisted through 9 wk of age, resulting in average responses of +3.1 kg BW, +1.9 cm HH, and+1.8 cm WH in MET compared with CON. Average daily gain during the 9 wk was (P&lt;0.05) 0.72±0.02 kg/d in MET and 0.67±0.02 kg/d in CON calves. Despite similar rates of daily DMI, maternal supplementation with Met led to greater (P ≤ 0.05) overall hepatic concentrations of the 1-carbon metabolism intermediates adenosine, betaine, choline, glycine, and N,N-dimethylglycine in liver tissue. Among transsulfuration pathway metabolites, concentrations of cystathionine, cysteinesulfinic acid, hypotaurine, serine, and taurine were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in MET calves. There was a treatment × day effect for activity of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), methionine synthase (MTR) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) in liver tissue. Activity of BHMT and CBS increased in MET calves between d 4 and 14, with a peak at 28 d. Despite a linear increase from d 4 to 28, activity of MTR in MET calves was lower on d 4 and 50. Plasma concentrations of haptoglobin and activity of myeloperoxidase in both maternal groups increased (P ≤ 0.05) markedly between 0 and 7 d of age followed by a decrease to baseline at d 21 with responses being lower in MET compared with CON calves. In vitro phagocytosis in stimulated neutrophils was greater overall (P ≤ 0.05) in MET calves. Overall, data indicate that increasing the maternal supply of Met during late-pregnancy benefits calf growth in part through alterations in hepatic metabolism and innate immune response.</jats:p>",

ZnO and eugenol were used as additives and introduced into the membrane matrix via the additive blending method. The additives could improve the performance of the PSF membrane due to their hydrophilic nature. The water contact angle (WCA) of the PSF membrane decreased from 67.7° ± 1.2° to 52.8° ± 0.8° when the additive loading was increased from 0 to 5%-wt. The PSF membrane with 5%-wt ZnO and 5%-wt eugenol had pure water permeability and humic substance rejection of 83.8 ± 3.7 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 and 95.6%, respectively. In addition, the additives were able to improve antifouling properties, e.g. a recovery ratio (FRR) of 85.4% and relative flux reduction ratio (RFR) of 30.2%. In the antibacterial assay, the membrane displayed 3 mm and 10 mm inhibition zones against Escherichia coli and peat water microorganisms, respectively, probably due to antibacterial properties of the additives.</jats:p>",

Oil is transported to the contact portion in the form of fine oil droplets to form a lubrication film, thereby improving lubrication performance among matching pairs. A test for point contact sliding friction and wear was conducted under oil‐air lubrication conditions. Oil‐phase and pressure distributions near the contact zone were investigated through numerical simulation. This study aims to explore the effect of air velocity on sliding wear characteristics of a point contact. Results show that point contact sliding wear is considerably affected by air supply speed. The lubrication performance between friction pairs is optimal under appropriate air supply speed, which can enable the oil‐air pressure and oil‐phase volume fraction near the point contact area to obtain appropriate values that are useful to the spread of fine oil droplets. This process ensures that the sliding friction coefficient and specific wear rate can be reduced. The friction coefficient decreases to approximately 0.027, and the specific wear rate is 1.06 × 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/N·m. Under oil‐air lubrication, microfurrows appear on the worn surfaces of materials with the change in air supply speed. The shape of debris is mainly a flake or block with a few long strip abrasives.

Different crustal rocks were subjected to thermal treatment, expected to induce microfracturing, up to different target temperatures from 100 up to 900 °C. The rocks bulk and pore volumes, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> wave velocities, and frequency‐dependent electrical impedance were measured before and after the treatment. As the temperature of treatment increased, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> wave velocities and the electrical formation factor drop and pore and bulk volumes increase. As indicated by the microscopic images, this is consistent with the creation of microcracks. These created microcracks do not affect the properties in the exact same manner, and a strong effect of the initial porosity is observed for electrical formation factor. Extrapolating to low‐frequency field‐scale measurements in water‐saturated reservoir rocks highlights an interesting observation: Both seismic and electrical properties at the field scale might highlight similar variations with increasing damage in all rocks. The maximum amount of decrease expected for all rocks is about 1 order of magnitude in electrical formation factor and 40% decrease in <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> wave velocities. Finally, temperature proved to affect very differently the rocks of varying porosity and mineral content, in ways not fully covered by existing works. Porosity, by increasing the matrix compressibility, damps the degree of microfracturing and crack opening. The distinct behavior in calcite‐pure marble evidences a dominance of anisotropic of thermal expansion over isotropic expansion mismatch.</jats:p>",

The adsorbents (iron oxide, hydroxide, nano zero valent iron (nZVI), industrial waste, minerals, magnetite, goethite, zirconium oxide, etc.) are impregnated into alginate beads to produce the media. The biocompatibility, rough surface with large area, and amorphous and high water permeable bead structure improve arsenic adsorption efficiency while the regeneration process is simpler than the conventional adsorbents. In recent years, studies have reported laboratory-scale applications of alginate beads, encapsulated and impregnated with adsorbents, for arsenic removal from drinking water. The arsenic removal efficiencies were reported to be over 95% with a wide range of concentrations (10–1,000 parts per billion) and pH (3.0–7.5). However, commercial- and/or mass-scale applications have not been reported yet, due possibly to overall cost, complexity, reusability, and arsenic waste-laden sludge management. In this paper, research achievement on arsenic removal using alginate-based adsorbents has been reviewed. The review was performed in context to alginate bead development, adsorbent encapsulation and impregnation, application, performance, and regeneration. The advantages and limitations of the methods were analyzed and the scopes of future research were identified for mass scale domestic and industrial applications.</jats:p>",

This article addresses the hypotheses that left‐authoritarian citizens are less likely to vote, less satisfied with the democratic process and have lower levels of political trust when there is a left‐authoritarian supply gap. Using data for 14 Western European countries from the European Social Survey 2008 in the main analysis, it is shown that left‐authoritarians are less likely to vote and exhibit lower levels of satisfaction with democracy and political trust. A supplementary analysis of national election studies from Finland before and after the electoral breakthrough of the left‐authoritarian True Finns Party in 2011 indicates that whether left‐authoritarians participate less and believe less in the efficacy of voting is contingent on the presence of a strong left‐authoritarian party. This study illuminates how constrained party supply in a two‐dimensional policy space can affect voter turnout as well as political support, and has broader implications for the potential further rise of left‐authoritarian challenger parties.</jats:p>",

In this paper, three generating units are studied using Matrix Laboratory software with a novel approach for deciding the best strategy from the most economical strategy viewpoint. A scenario of different formulations is created for muti-player game, which then is solved with the help of zero-sum polymatrix game theory. A systematic tabular layout of revenues pertaining to each formulation in terms of mixed strategies is developed.

The influences of service level and profit distribution rate on the system’s profit are discussed. The theoretical results show that higher price adjustment speed will lead to the system lose stability with a larger entropy value. In the Stackelberg game model, the stability of the system increases as the service value and the recovery rate increases; in the centralized model, the stability of the system decreases with the increase of the service value and increases with the recovery rate increases.

The aquaporin inhibitor HgCl2 reduced root Lp most in nutrient-sufficient control plants. Exchange of low-nutrient for control media caused a rapid (20–80 min) and partial recovery in Lp, though cortex cell Lp did not increase in any of the root regions analysed. The gene expression level (qPCR analyses) of five plasma membrane-localized AQP isoforms did not change in bulk root extracts, while the formation of apoplastic barriers increased considerably along the main axis of root and lateral roots in low-nutrient treatments.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Decrease in root and cortex cell Lp enables the adjustment of root water uptake to increased root-to-shoot area ratio in nutrient-limited plants.

A protocol modified from a standard ISO protocol, which includes filtration, concentration, separation and detection steps, was tested and showed comparable recovery efficiencies (Giardia mean = 77.4%, Cryptosporidium mean = 61.8% from the modified protocol, compared with Giardia mean = 61.6%, Cryptosporidium mean = 69% from the ISO protocol) at a substantial cost reduction. This protocol was used for analysing 71 samples of potable water from different areas of Chandigarh, where sampling locations were divided into groups according to the population density, which also partially equates with the level of infrastructure. Samples were collected during (n = 29) and outside the monsoon season (n = 42). Of all samples analysed, 16 (22.5%) were Cryptosporidium- and/or Giardia-positive. Parasites per sample were low (1–10 (oo)cysts per 10 L), although one sample contained large numbers of Giardia cysts (&gt;1,000). Polymerase chain reaction analyses on the small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA), triose-phosphate isomerase (tpi), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and beta-giardin (bg) gene sequences on Giardia-positive samples and SSU rRNA on Cryptosporidium-positive samples tended to be unsuccessful, although Giardia cysts of Assemblages B and C were identified. No association with the season was detected, but an association with the location of water supply was identified. Samples from areas with the lowest infrastructure were not associated with higher levels of contamination, but samples from the middle level were significantly more likely to be contaminated than those from the highest level of infrastructure. Results indicate that even in a city with a well-developed infrastructure, the contamination of potable water with protozoan parasites remains a public health risk.</jats:p>",

The Energy Performance and Carbon Emissions Assessment and Monitoring Tool (ECAM) is applied in the present study in order to reduce indirect and direct emissions. Input data for the assessment included inter alia, population, water volumes, energy consumption, and type of wastewater treatment. The methodology focuses on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use that is directly associated with the utility operations covering the whole water cycle. The ECAM's Quick Assessment revealed that 89.7% of the energy is consumed in abstraction and distribution systems of water supply, whereas wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge consumed only 10.3% in Madaba. The detailed ECAM tool assessment results showed that total GHG emissions from the entire water and wastewater system in Madaba are approximately 28.122 million kg CO2/year. The water supply is the major contributor to GHG accounting for 62.4%, while 37.6% of GHG emissions result from sewage treatment, and are associated with treatment process requirements considered in this work, in addition to sludge transport from septic tanks to the wastewater treatment plant. The findings of this work can help the utility to undertake energy efficiency and GHG reduction measures.</jats:p>",

Fifty young bulls, with an average age of 7 ± 1 mo and initial body weight (BW) of 260.0 ± 8.1 kg, were used in this experiment. Four bulls were used as baseline reference animals and were slaughtered at the beginning of the experiment. Four bulls were fed at maintenance (12 g dry matter [DM]/kg of BW), whereas 42 bulls were divided into six groups (n = 7/group) and were randomly assigned to the following dietary treatments 105 (low [LO]), 125 (medium [MD]), or 145 (high [HI]) g crude protein (CP)/kg DM, LO to HI (LH), LO to MD (LM), or MD to HI (MH) oscillating CP at a 48-h interval for 140 d. At the end of the experiment, bulls were slaughtered and samples of the whole body were collected. All samples were lyophilized, ground, and composed as percentage of component of empty body weight (EBW) from each bull. A power model was used to estimate carcass, non-carcass components, and gastrointestinal content of the shrunk body weight (SBW), and CP and water present in the empty body, whereas an exponential model was used to estimate adipose tissue and ether extract (EE) present in the EBW. Nonlinear regression equations were developed to predict heat production from metabolizable energy (ME) intake and retained energy (RE). The net energy requirements for maintenance and ME for maintenance were 77 and 122.75 kcal/EBW0.75/d, respectively. The efficiency of ME utilization for maintenance was 62.7%. The equation obtained for net energy for gain (NEg) was: NEg (Mcal/EBW0.75/d) = 0.0535 × EBW0.75 × EBG0.7131, where EBG is the empty body gain, and the efficiency was 24.25%. Net protein requirement for growth (NPg) was: NPg (g/d) = 227.372 × EBG – 19.479 × RE. There was a linear increase for carcass, CP, and water present in the EBW as the animal grew. The EE deposition exponentially increased as EBW increased.</jats:p>",

Emerging vaccine platform technologies, such as RNA vaccines, outer membrane vesicle vaccines with genetically customizable membrane antigens (customOMV), virus‐like particle vaccines with genetically configurable epitopes (customVLP), and humanized yeast‐produced vaccines, as well as new intensified out‐scalable biomanufacturing processes will enable a decentralized manufacturing approach. This is anticipated to be faster to produce, flexible, and implementable at locations with high vaccine demand. In this work, we quantify the potential impact of these technologies on the Kenyan supply chain network. Here, we have employed techno‐economic modeling and mixed integer optimization to investigate the impact of novel vaccine manufacturing technologies on the profitability of supply chain logistics in Kenya. The model results indicate that: (a) manufacturing accounts for the highest proportion of the total supply chain costs, (b) the cost per dose of vaccines produced using emerging platform technologies can be an order of magnitude lower compared to the dose cost of inactivated polio vaccines, and (c) the use of intensified production processes contained inside isolators render small‐scale distributed manufacturing economically viable.</jats:p>",

The intensity of response and percentage of persons with a strong response to the 27-kDa, but not the 15/17-kDa, antigen were higher than found 20 years earlier. A strong response to both the 15/17- and 27-kDa-antigens was higher than reported in other countries, and the probability of persons having a strong response was greater in areas with surface water sources than river-bank infiltration. Few cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in spite of these high responses to Cryptosporidium antigens. These responses suggest a chronic low-level exposure from several sources that may be affording protection against symptoms and illness. Although strong serological responses were associated with surface water sources, drinking water is not likely to be the most important exposure for Cryptosporidium in the Czech Republic.</jats:p>",

Significant multivariate predictors of embolization (either partial or complete) were convexity/parasagittal locations (OR 5.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 28.54, p=0.060), meningohypophyseal trunk (MHT, OR 4.65, 95% CI 1.63 to 13.23, p=0.004), middle meningeal artery (MMA, OR 10.89, 95% CI 3.43 to 34.64, p&lt;0.001), and ascending pharyngeal artery supply (APA, OR 9.96, 95% CI 1.88 to 52.73, p=0.007).

Data were obtained through Label Insight’s Open Data database, which represents &gt;80% of all food and beverage products sold in the US over the past three years. Healthfulness and the level of processing, measured by the Health Star Rating (HSR) system and the NOVA classification framework, respectively, were compared across product categories and leading manufacturers. Among 230,156 food and beverage products, the mean HSR was 2.7 (standard deviation (SD) 1.4) from a possible maximum rating of 5.0, and 71% of products were classified as ultra-processed. Healthfulness and level of processing varied substantially by category (range: HSR 1.1–3.9; 0–100% ultra-processed) and manufacturer (range: HSR 0.9–4.6; 26–100% ultra-processed). The US packaged food and beverage supply is large, heterogeneous, highly processed, and generally unhealthy. The wide variability in healthfulness and level of processing demonstrates that opportunities exist, through reformulation or replacement, for large-scale improvements to the healthfulness of the US packaged food and beverage supply.</jats:p>"

Four feedings, with 6 days for every feeding and 20 mg/L initial uranium, were provided at 27.5 (±2.5) °C. After the four feedings, a uranium removal efficiency of 94% was obtained. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) showed that short rod bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in the granular sludge. X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of uranium on the granular surface. High-throughput sequencing was carried out for analyzing the bacterial diversity and community structure. The total data set comprised 8,290 high quality sequences, which could be divided into 605 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The library coverage was 0.96 and the alpha diversity indices of ACE, Chao1, Shannon and Simpson were 2,255.40, 1,346.12, 4.03 and 0.05, respectively. There were 13 bacterial genera present with a ratio of more than 1% of the total 124 genera, among which Desulfovibrio (16.48%), Clostridium IV (9.29%), Bacteroides (3.46%) and Citrobacter (1.41%) were assumed as the functional bacteria, with a cumulative proportion of 30.64% of the total bacterial population.

Short food supply chains (SFSCs) are now widely believed to be more sustainable in comparison to mass food delivery systems. To date, very little quantitative evidence exists on the impacts of various types of food supply chains. Using a cross-sectional quantitative approach, this study assesses the sustainability of distribution channels in short and long food supply chains based on 208 food producers across seven countries: France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Ten distribution channel types are used in this study. To provide a comprehensive sustainability assessment, a set of economic, social, and environmental indicators are applied. Indicators commonly used in the literature are used, supported by original indicators constructed specifically for the present study. In total, 486 chains are examined and the study confirms that individual producers participate simultaneously in several, short and long chains. Participation in SFSCs is beneficial for producers from an economic perspective. SFSCs allow producers to capture a large proportion of margin otherwise absorbed by different intermediaries. It appears, however, that ’longer’ supply channels generate lower environmental impacts per unit of production when measured in terms of food miles and carbon footprint. Finally, ambiguous results are found regarding social dimension, with significant differences across types of chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The stability of the values of cyclic feeds and the angle of the actual beginning of the fuel supply largely depends on the presence of the injection valve of the fuel pump section and its design features. The valve must reliably separate the discharge line from the pre-plunger space and, within certain limits, ensure the residual pressure in the discharge line between cycles. However, the installation of the valve causes a repeated reflection from the valve of the pressure impulses, that follow from the nozzle and leads to the appearance of additional injections or a sluggish fit of the needle on the sprayer seat. In order to eliminate negative consequences, double-acting injection valves are installed on distribution-type pumps, in which the pressure impulses are extinguished by transferring fuel through an additional non-return valve. The use of double-acting valves with non-return valves on distribution-type pumps ensures reliable unloading of the discharge pipe from the cut-off cavity. One of the main purposes of a non-return valve is to provide the necessary hydraulic density of the coupling pressure valve - non-return valve. Serial pumps are equipped with cross-shaped and round-shaped check valves in cross-section, which are designed to provide the same hydraulic tightness of the coupling pressure valve - non-return valve. In the course of research, the results of which are presented in the work, it was revealed that they have different sealing characteristics. In parallel, the characteristics of a triangular and square check valve in cross section were investigated. As a result of research, it was found that square valves have the best sealing characteristics. In the course of the research, it was also revealed that serial check valves of cruciform and round shapes do not provide their functional interchangeability, since they have different abilities to ensure hydraulic tightness of the interface with the discharge valve - non-return valve. Square-shaped check valves in cross-section are more technological to manufacture.</jats:p>",

Forty-two young bulls (initial BW of 260 ± 8.1 kg; age of 7 ± 1.0 mo) were fed ad libitum and were randomly assigned to receive one of six diets with different CP concentrations for 140 d: 105 (LO), 125 (MD), or 145 g CP /kg DM (HI), and LO to HI (LH), LO to MD (LM), or MD to HI (MH) oscillating CP at a 48-h interval for each feed. At the end of the experiment, bulls were slaughtered to evaluate carcass characteristics. Linear and quadratic effects were used to compare LO, MD, and HI, and specific contrasts were applied to compare oscillating dietary CP treatments vs. MD (125 g CP/kg DM) static treatment. Dry matter intake (DMI) was not affected (P &amp;gt; 0.26) by increasing or oscillating dietary CP. As dietary N concentration increased, there was a subsequent increase in apparent N compounds digestibility (P = 0.02), and no significant difference (P = 0.38) was observed between oscillating LH and MD. Daily total urinary and fecal N increased (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in response to increasing dietary CP. Significant differences were observed between oscillating LM and MH vs. MD, where bulls receiving the LM diet excreted less (P &amp;lt; 0.01; 71.21 g/d) and bulls fed MH excreted more (P &amp;lt; 0.01) urinary N (90.70 g/d) than those fed MD (85.52 g/d). A quadratic effect was observed (P &amp;lt; 0.01) for retained N as a percentage of N intake, where the bulls fed LO had greater N retention than those fed HI, 16.20% and 13.78%, respectively. Both LH and LM had greater (P &amp;lt; 0.01) daily retained N when compared with MD. Performance and carcass characteristics were not affected (P &amp;gt; 0.05) by increasing or oscillating dietary CP. Therefore, these data indicate that although there is no alteration in the performance of growing Nellore bulls fed with oscillating CP diets vs. a static level of 125 g CP/kg DM, nor static low (105 g CP/kg DM) and high (145 g CP/kg DM) levels; there may be undesirable increases in environmental N excretion when the average dietary CP content is increased. The results suggest that dietary CP concentrations of 105, 125 g/kg DM, or within this range can be indicated for finishing young Nellore bulls, since it reaches the requirements, reduces the environmental footprint related to N excretion, and may save on costs of high-priced protein feeds.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer considers carbon emission reduction and has fairness concern behavior. The retailer provides sales service in the traditional channel and considers fairness concern behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of different parameter values on the price stability and utility of the supply chain system emphatically using 2D bifurcation diagram, parameter plot basin, the basins of attraction, chaos attractor and sensitivity to the initial value, etc. The results find that the retailer’s fairness concern behavior shrinks the stability of the supply chain system more than that of the manufacturer’s fairness concern behavior. The system stability region decreases with the increase of carbon emission reduction level and the retailer’s fairness concern. The customers’ preference for the direct channel decreases the stable range of the direct channel, while it enlarges the stable range of the traditional channel. The supply chain system enters into chaos through flip bifurcation with the increase of price adjustment speed. In a stable state, the manufacture improving customer’s preference for the direct channel and the retailer choosing the appropriate fairness concern level can achieve the maximum utility separately. In a chaotic state, the average utilities of the manufacturer and retailer all decline, while that of the retailer declines even more. By selecting appropriate control parameter, the low-carbon dual-channel supply chain system can return to a stable state from chaos again. The research of this paper is of great significance to price decisions of participants and supply chain operation management.</jats:p>"

A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to address the optimal design of a bioethanol supply chain that maximizes both economic and social benefits. The ε-constraint method is employed to solve the model and a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained that shows the relationship between the two objectives. The developed model is applied to case studies in Liaoning Province in Northeast China. Actual data are collected as practical as possible for the feasibility and effectiveness of the results. The results show that the bioethanol supply chain can bring about both economic and social benefits in the given area and offers governments a better and more efficient way to create social benefits. The effect of the government subsidy on enterprises’ decisions about economic and social benefits is discussed.</jats:p>"

Here, we show how stratigraphy is being made in a lake that is heavily impacted upon by climate change and human activities. For one of the largest inner-Alpine catchments in the European Alps, we draw attention to how sedimentation rates are a product of non-stationary, reflexive, human actions. In Lake Geneva, we identify both a human-induced climate change (HCC) signature and the effects of a recent economic shock on sediment extraction upon sediment loading to and sedimentation rates in the lake. The HCC signature thus reflects the nature of climate change impacts in this basin, where sediment accumulation rates evolve with climate, but where economic conditions contribute to shifts in the supply of sediment to the lake. Following social theory, we call this glocalization because of the combined importance and inseparability of human impacts across different spatial scales. The nature of human impacts on sediment delivery to the lake mean that the influence of humans is unlikely to be captured in the long-term depositional record.</jats:p>"

It is urgent to study how to optimize the cooperation between e-commerce platforms and logistics service providers. Based on Stackelberg game theory, this research first studies the decision making of two-stage logistics service supply chains consisting of the e-commerce mall and the logistics service provider without cooperative distribution, in which decentralization and centralization are analyzed, respectively. Then, it is extended to the decision making of three-stage logistics service supply chains consisting of e-commerce malls, express delivery companies, and terminal distributors. The results show that the profit, sales volume, and logistics service effort of the centralized decision-making system are higher than those of the decentralized decision-making system, regardless of the two-stage or three-stage logistics service supply chain. Therefore, it is vital to formulate a reasonable profit distribution scheme based on revenue-sharing contract to achieve the cooperation among the partners of logistics service supply chain, so as to achieve a win-win situation in which all of their profits increase. Finally, a numerical example is presented to verify the results, and some issues are proposed for future research. </jats:p>",

Developing distributed generation resources, especially renewable energy resources, is one of the safest ways to solve such problem. These resources have been decentralised by being installed close to the houses producing few kilowatts. Therefore, there are no losses in transmission lines and provide response for demand. Based on their benefits, the use of such energy resources should be developed in the future, but its management and optimal use is a major challenge. This has become one of the main concerns ofenergy systems researchers. In the current study, an innovative model is provided as a strategic management. It is intended to optimise the operation in smart homes consisting of generation units such as a wind turbine, solar panels, storages, and un/controllable loads. The main objective of this optimisation management is to maximise microgrid profitability for 24 h.

On this basis, we propose a new distribution model which is suitable for the description of wind wave height during the growth stage, and the model parameters are acquired with the programming solution method.

A series of jets occurring in the vicinity of the south-western footpoint of the filament directly ejected cool and hot plasmas to filament height and supplied material for the filament. Some newly emerging flux is found in the vicinity of the south-western footpoint of the filament during these jets. In this paper, we mainly focus on the material supply for the formation of the filament. The plasma mass uploaded by the jets and the mass of the filament are estimated, which manifest the fact that the mass carried by the jets can supply sufficient material for the formation of the filament. We found two types of jets; one is H α jet, and the other is EUV jet. The significant finding is that some cool jets seen in the H α band but not in the SDO/AIA bands could also eject the cool material for the filament. These results suggest that cool plasma in the low atmosphere can be directly injected into the upper atmosphere and become the filament material by two types of jets. Moreover, the newly emerging flux with the non-potential field plays an important role in the appearance of the jets and the magnetic structure of the filament.</jats:p>",

Se propone un análisis del sistema de aprovisionamiento para los departamentos navales, en especial en relación con los proyectos de utilización de maderas novohispanas y bálticas en la construcción naval, y su valoración por los oficiales hispanos. Por otra parte, se presenta la dinámica de otorgamiento de los asientos de madera a los criollos novohispanos y, finalmente, se estudia el movimiento marítimo entre el Báltico sur y España para demostrar la valiosa participación de esta región en el sistema de pertrechos navales. A partir de lo anterior se ofrece una visión general del comercio global de suministros forestales de España, que perseguía la recuperación de su poderío naval.AbstractThe present article shows the progress of the research about the policy of forestry supplies, developed during the 18th century by the Royal Navy of Spain, in order to demonstrate its importance in the rivalry between the European maritime powers by the dominion over the seas of the World. For this reason, it is proposed to analyze different aspects of the provision system for the naval departments, with an approach to the projects of use the New Spain and Baltic wood in shipbuilding, and its recognition by the Hispanic officials. On the other side, it is presented the dynamics of granting to New Spain Creoles with wooden contracts and finally is studied the maritime movement between the southern Baltic and Spain to demonstrate their valuable participation in the naval supplies system. All these aspects demonstrate a general panorama of the globalization of forest supplies with only one purpose: the recovery of Spanish naval power.   </jats:p>"

The objective of the paper is to investigate and design of rural water supply scheme. The investigation was carried out during 2018-19 in Vadoli-Nileshwar village. Investigation was completed in three stages out of that first stage is to collect document related to scheme like detailed project report, second stage is to verify all documents in scheme and third stage is to verify physical assets of scheme like source well, raising main, storage reservoir and distribution network. Investigation was notified that Vadoli –Nileshwar water supply scheme is completed in 1981, scheme is designed for 2900 peoples with daily demand 40 lit/person/day. But due to increasing population, increasing daily demand and newly developed area water supply is insufficient. For solving this problem, scheme is redesigned in which raising main, storage reservoir, pumping machinery and distribution network is designed for 3700 peoples with daily demand of 115lit/person/day and 12 supplying hours. Scheme was designed by ‘Jaltantra’ software. It is expected that, if this revised design is considered, the problem of water availability to consumers will be solved. Spacing.

In this paper, a brief theoretical approach to evaluate the ventilation characteristics of a multi-intake-well air supply system was established, which was mainly derived from the Bernoulli equation and continuity equation. With this approach, an analysis of the ventilation characteristics of the Jinping-I project spillway tunnel was carried out. A comparison of the theoretical results and prototype data suggested the theoretical approach to be valid and practical. The value of the drag coefficient at the air-water interface should be calibrated before evaluation because the drag coefficient is crucial for the accuracy of theoretical results. In addition, the influences of certain structural factors of the spillway tunnel and air intake well on the ventilation characteristics of multi-intake-well air supply systems are investigated.</jats:p>"

In the current study, the effects of foliar spraying of exogenous ZnSO4·7H2O (0.2% in Quzhou and 0.3% in Licheng, w/v) and/or sucrose (10.0%, w/v) on maize (Zea mays L.) agronomic traits; concentrations of Zn, iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), total phosphorus (P), phytic acid (PA) P, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N); C/N ratios; and Zn and Fe bioavailability (as evaluated by molar ratios of PA/Zn, PA × Ca/Zn, PA/Fe and PA × Ca/Fe) in maize grains were studied under field conditions for two years at two experimental locations. The results confirmed that there were no significant differences in maize agronomic traits following the various foliar treatments. Compared with the control treatment of foliar spraying with deionized water, foliar applications of Zn alone or combined with sucrose significantly increased maize grain Zn concentrations by 29.2–58.3% in Quzhou (from 18.4–19.9 to 25.2–29.6 mg/kg) and by 39.8–47.8% in Licheng (from 24.9 to 34.8–36.8 mg/kg), as well as its bioavailability. No significant differences were found between the foliar spraying of deionized water and sucrose, and between Zn-only and “sucrose + Zn” at each N application rate and across different N application rates and experimental sites. Similar results were observed for maize grain Fe concentrations and bioavailability, but the Fe concentration increased to a smaller extent than Zn. Foliar Zn spraying alone or with sucrose increased maize grain Fe concentrations by 4.7–28.4% in Quzhou (from 13.4–17.1 to 15.2–18.5 mg/kg) and by 15.4–25.0% in Licheng (from 24.0 to 27.7–30.0 mg/kg). Iron concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with Zn at each N application rate and across different N application rates and experimental locations, indicating that foliar Zn spraying facilitated the transport of endogenous Fe to maize grains. Therefore, foliar Zn spraying increased the Zn concentration and bioavailability in maize grains irrespective of foliar sucrose supply while also improving Fe concentrations and bioavailability to some extent. This is a promising agricultural practice for simultaneous Zn and Fe biofortification in maize grains, i.e., “killing two birds with one stone”.</jats:p>"
