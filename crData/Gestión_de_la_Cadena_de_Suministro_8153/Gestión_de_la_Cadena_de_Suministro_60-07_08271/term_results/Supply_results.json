Variables that affect the extent of health effects of radiation include: quantity of material absorbed; distribution of radioactive material in the body; the half‐life of the material; and, the rate at which the material is excreted from the body. Various forms of potential sources of radioactive contamination of water supplies are discussed, along with methods for removal of radioactive materials from the water supply that include: natural processes of riverbed sedimentation, ion exchange capabilities of silts, the biologic processes of both plants and animals including some forms of algae, the natural filtration of water percolating down through the earth to an aquifer, and the ion exhange properties of minerals and clays; conventional treatment plant processes of coagulation and sedimentation, filtration, lime soda ash softening, and ion exchange; and, beds of steel, clay pellets, activated carbon, and cation‐anion‐exchange resins in series. Distillation units are also mentioned as capable of removing nonvolatile materials, but are expensive and limited in capacity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>THE municipal water system of Pasco, Washington, is typical in design of many systems for similar populations and climates. The system is quite unique, however, in that the Columbia River water being treated contains radioactive materials. The presence of radionuclides leads to some interesting considerations not usually found in public water systems. Of these, the radiation exposure of those drinking the water and the reduction of this exposure by removal of nuclides at the treatment plant are of particu‐ lar interest. The nuclides considered here come from the Hanford Atomic Products Operation (HAPO), which is one of the nation's major plutonium production facilities. The plant, located in southeastern Washington, has been operated since 1946 by the General Electric Co. under contract to the AEC. The Pasco treatment facilities are approximately 39 mi downstream from the nearest reactor. Richland, although farther upstream, obtains its raw water from the Yakima River and is therefore not of interest. Kenne‐ wick obtains water from the Columbia River through a collector system which would be more difficult to evaluate in terms of water plant efficiency. A small farming community, Ringold, utilizes Columbia River water for irrigation only. For these reasons, Pasco was chosen to illustrate the distribution of radionuclides in a municipal water system and the radiation exposure to those who drink treated or untreated river water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1958, Congress enacted new legislation providing for inclusion of water supply storage in Bureau of Reclamation and Corps of Engineers reservoir projects. This legislation, Title III of Public Law 85‐500, approved July 3, 1958, is known as the Water Supply Act of 1958. In it, a general policy is provided for including water supply in civil works projects. It is applicable to new projects and modifications of previously authorized projects. The act affects only municipal and industrial water supplies. Also specified are the basis for determining the interest rate on unpaid balances, the responsibility of the Secretary of the Treasury, and other terms and conditions concerning inclusion of storage in reservoir projects and repayment arrangements. The Water Supply Act of 1958 is an expression of an important new federal policy. The provision authorizing the inclusion of storage for anticipated demands can be the key to providing for future water needs in many areas.</jats:p>",
