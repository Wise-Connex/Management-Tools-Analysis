      "abstract": "<jats:title>Opening Paragraph</jats:title><jats:p>This paper investigates the relationship between marriage payments, household structure, and domestic labour-supply among the Barma of the Republic of Chad. Recently, Netting has noted that ‘…household composition among farmers varies with the type and amount of labor required for effective crop production’ (1974: 29). Netting is supported by evidence from Europe (Chayanov: 1966; Symes: 1972); Africa (Jones: 1949; Basehart: 1973; Netting: 1968; Reining: 1970; Udo: 1965); Asia (Barth: 1959; Befu: 1968; Leach: 1961; Moerman: 1968; Yang: 1945); South America (Webster: 1973); North America (Bennett: 1969); and the Pacific (Sahlins: 1957). Implicit in this literature is the realization that the household structural types prevalent in societies are those which provide adequate labour supplies in specific ecosystems with particular agrarian technologies. While this research indicates that differing agrarian societies require varying labour supplies, it does not in general show<jats:italic>how</jats:italic>they achieve these supplies. This paper demonstrates how marriage payments may operate to regulate different aspects of household structure to provide adequate labour to the Barma domestic unit.</jats:p>",

Amounts of sucrose in the cells of the endosperm fluctuated conspicuously from time to time, but there was no marked reduction in sucrose as the grain ripened, and in the final stages of ripening, as the grain lost water, the apparent concentration of sucrose increased. Amounts of sucrose and other soluble carbohydrate in the rachis were more or less steady throughout the grain's growth with, perhaps, an upward trend as the grain ripened. In the peduncle, sucrose remained steady throughout, but amounts of other soluble carbohydrate fell progressively with time. \n    At frequent intervals throughout development, isolated endosperm was cultured for 5 h in solutions of [14C]sucrose to evaluate changes in its capacity to absorb and metabolize the sugar. Amounts of [14C]sucrose absorbed increased progressively with the age of the grain. No marked changes associated with development were observed in the incorporation of radioactivity into the fraction (excluding sucrose) extracted from cultured endosperm with boiling ethanol, even after the grains had ceased growing. However, amounts of [14C]starch produced in the cultured endosperm rose to a maximum at about the mid-point of the grain's development, and then fell progressively to near zero in endosperm in which the deposition of starch had ceased. Although the trends for other insoluble radioactive material resembled trends for starch, radioactivity was incorporated into this fraction in endosperm no longer able to synthesize radioactive starch. \n    These results are taken as evidence that the normal developmental pattern of accumulation of dry matter in the endosperm is determined within the endosperm itself, rather than through the provision of precursors from the rest of the plant.</jats:p>"

The supply of labour will also be forecast and compared with labour demand. A labour demand equation will be specified and tested by the data of the period 1960-1974. Part I will discuss the specification of the model and data collection. Part II reports the regression results and Part III provides a projection based on average growth rate of variables in the labour demand equation. The final part compares the projected labour demand and labour supply for the period 1975-1985. Observations will be derived and implications discussed in the same section.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In the field, at a moderate phosphate level, application of water to the soil surface in the autumn increased yields although rainfall was above average and soil water was adequate for growth. At a high phosphate level there was no response to this surface wetting. In this soil, available phosphate (Truog) was confined to the 0-5 cm layer. In the glasshouse surface wetting increased yield and phosphorous uptake even though soil water was maintained at adequate levels below the immediate surface. Placement of phosphate at 8 cm depth where the soil remained wet for a longer time led to substantial yield increases over surface applied phosphate. In the field, a productive soil nearby derived from porphyry rock did not respond to surface wetting and yields were higher than those on the sedimentary soil. In the following moist spring, yields on the sedimentary soil were slightly better (P &lt; 0.01) than yields on the porphyry soil. Available evidence suggests that surface drying limits the uptake of surface applied phosphate on the sedimentary soil. Thus phosphate levels that would be adequate for growth are inadequate in the early autumn when evaporation from the soil surface is greatest. On the adjacent porphyry soil, surface applications were fully effective. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A central archaeological and historical problem is that of population. It is reflected in the question often posed by the student or visitor of an ancient city: how big was X?; how many people lived here? The reply is unlikely to be more than an informed guess and, in most cases, a mere hazard, exposing a fundamental lacuna in historical knowledge. The problem of population size is not simply of casual interest; it affects almost every aspect of a balanced picture of life in ancient times.</jats:p><jats:p>Explicit classical allusions to population figures survive in only a very few cases (Alexandria, for example, had more than 300,000 free inhabitants in the first century B.C., according to Diodorus). In their absence it is extremely difficult to assess the number of inhabitants of a city at a given time, a situation further complicated by the fact that in Roman times a city comprised not just a built-up area, perhaps defined by walls, but also a neighbouring territory which it owned. The inhabitants of the territorium were liable to be counted with the city dwellers, thus producing a definition of urban population which differs radically from our modern concept.</jats:p><jats:p>Despite the inherent difficulties, demographic studies have periodically occupied the attention of a number of archaeologists and historians, and in recent years two major works have appeared. In <jats:italic>The Economy of the Roman Empire</jats:italic> Richard Duncan-Jones devotes an important chapter to the size of cities. After reviewing the various methods used to calculate the size of urban populations, he puts forward figures of his own, based principally on the interpretation of epigraphic evidence. As one of his examples has a specific Libyan connection, it is worth summarising here. The town concerned is Oea (modern Tripoli). Duncan-Jones applies an approach first outlined in 1886 by J. Beloch, in examining ancient records of large-scale gifts for public feasts or cash hand-outs (sportulae). These records provide important clues to the size of the urban population at the time of the benefaction. In the case of Oea, two pieces of evidence have been preserved. The first is given by Apuleius in the <jats:italic>Apologia</jats:italic>, a speech prepared for his defence (in a trial at Sabratha) against a charge of winning his Oean wife, Pudentilla, by magic.</jats:p>"

Accessory testicular arteries may be found. At the spermatic cord they form a rete mirabile having 26.8 ± 5.0 and 29.3 ± 4.9 slender branches on the right and left sides, respectively. The arterial branches are intermingled with veins of similar caliber and number. Near the testis the branches of the rete reunite in a single vessel which then penetrates the parenchyma of the testis. Inside the testis the artery divides usually into two main branches that course toward the caudal pole. The rectal, scrotal and testicular temperatures were 32, 28.5 and 30.4 °C, respectively, appearing that an abdominotesticular gradient temperature exists in this animal. Whether this mechanism is thermoregulatory for the normal spermatogenesis cannot be inferred from the present work.</jats:p>"

The total production is also dependent on the oxygen concentration, but pure oxygen inhibits the total production by about 50% as compared with 21% oxygen. The high production in shake cultures, as compared with the low production in stagnant cultures, is probably the result of a better oxygen supply in the culture medium.
