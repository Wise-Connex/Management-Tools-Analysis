Integrated supply chain risk management provides supply chain organisations with a level of insight into their supply chains yet to be achieved.

Transnet fulfils a prominent role in South Africa’s maritime supply chains, but that role, in accordance with the declared policy of the Government, constitutes an impediment to restructuring the chains as competing entities under private leadership. The solution may be found in leadership by public-private partnerships.</jats:p>"

Such networks are subject to shifting strategies and objectives within a dynamic environment. In recent years, when faced with a dynamic environment, several disciplines have adopted the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) perspective to gain insights into important issues within their domains of study. Research investigations in the field of supply networks have also begun examining the merits of complexity theory and the CAS perspective. In this article, we bring the applicability of complexity theory and CAS into sharper focus, highlighting its potential for integrating existing supply chain management (SCM) research into a structured body of knowledge while also providing a framework for generating, validating, and refining new theories relevant to real‐world supply networks. We suggest several potential research questions to emphasize how a CAS perspective can help in enriching the SCM discipline. We propose that the SCM research community adopt such a dynamic and systems‐level orientation that brings to the fore the adaptivity of firms and the complexity of their interrelations that are often inherent in supply networks.</jats:p>",

Although the limits imposed by the legislation reflect the Italian situation, they do however conform to directives concerning the whole European Community and offer a response to international guidelines promulgated by, for example, the World Health Organization so they are also suitable for use in national contexts other than Italy. Moreover, a diagram is introduced for monitoring the quality of water destined for agriculture, in particular for irrigation and the special issue of soil protection. In this case, in the absence of specific national and/or European laws and/or Directives, reference was made to the standards of the California Water Quality Control Board. The parameters and the relative limits have been taken from such standards, to identify three quality classes of water for agricultural use with evaluation of use. Plotting such diagrams is very simple: they can be used for improving presentation and interpretation of chemical data and, most of all, to provide comparisons between different water resources or to evaluate possible changes over time. Some examples, reported in the text, will aid understanding their use and interpretation.</jats:p>",

Mainly this concerns their high alkalinity, low hardness and high contents in natural organic matter. Moreover the concentrations of arsenic, boron, ammonia and methane are elevated in many waters. Arsenic is present in the inorganic species arsenate(III) and arsenate(V), which are toxic to humans. Complex and expensive technology is required for these types of waters to produce drinking water for the public supply. Amongst others, the treatment process would have to include flocculation with high dosages of chemicals and for some waters also reverse osmosis, resulting in waste water amounts of up to 30%. The latter is critical since the exploited aquifer recharges very slowly. The Tisza River is an alternative resource, especially in the case that bank filtrate extraction could be implemented.</jats:p>",

As determined during the study period Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) varied from 4.6–6.5 mgC/L and from 2.8–3.7 mgC/L in Danube River and Danube bank filtrate respectively. As determined 11.2% of Danube bank filtrate DOC was bio-degradable. A substantial enhancement of biodegradability has been observed after the application of Ozone dosages ranging from 0.45 to 0.9 mgO3/ mgC. It was concluded that Danube bank filtrate itself is not amenable for bio-filtration but an enhancement of its bio-degradability by ozonation could make bio-filtration a reasonable and economical option for reducing of DOC content to the levels that provide low risk of excessive disinfection by-products formation and prevent bacterial re-growth in distribution networks of cities using Danube bank filtrate as the source water.</jats:p>",

In this area, numerous settlements were built and the agricultural production is present. The first aquifer was formed in gravel-sandy sediments, 20 m thick, of large permeability and it is naturally protected with clay-dusty roof, with thickness of about 5 m. The biggest problem is registered presence of nitrates in groundwater, above the valid MPL values for drinking water that is 50 mgNO3/l. Monitoring the state and problems of separate water sources, formed in this area, showed the considerable larger influence of settlements without sewage systems than existing agricultural production. Analysis showed that nitrates input by groundwater into the River Danube and the Black Sea is negligible. Considering the anthropogenic impacts in the wider surrounding of the water source, we came to conclusions that can be used for further planning the use of this and similar groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When analyzing solute transport in groundwater, it is necessary to introduce a variable coefficient of dispersion. It has been established that dispersion is affected by the medium, filtration rate and the size of the area. It has also been determined that an increasing travel distance increases the value of the coefficient of dispersion in the model/calculation applied. Horizontal heterogeneity and vertical layering of an aquifer make the definition of dispersion more difficult. This is particularly true of alluvial sediments, where sedimentation occurs under varying conditions and results in layering within a single lithofacial unit. In the analysis of substance migration through a layered aquifer using the conventional dispersion equation, a model of the hydraulically equivalent homogeneous aquifer was applied, including the concepts of hydraulically equivalent aquifer and coefficient of equivalent geometric dispersivity. This procedure is often applied in practice. Calculation results indicate that if a real layered aquifer is substituted in this manner by an equivalent homogeneous aquifer, it is necessary to increase dispersivity with increasing model size, in order to achieve calibration. It was concluded that increasing transverse dispersion in a layered medium increases the possibility of an effective substitution of a real multi-layered aquifer by an equivalent homogeneous aquifer. The justifiability of this approach should be evaluated for every case study.</jats:p>",

We have had an opportunity to monitor, in detail, the degradation of phenols at three locations. All three cases involved gravelly and sandy aquifers and aerobic conditions. A summary of the analytical methods applied, and basic results obtained is presented. This paper represents a short overview of the flow and results of the monitoring and five tests which were conducted at the three locations over several years.

The easy availability of input parameters for the model, the reliability of the output data, as compared with the results of monitoring various test sites in the Po valley, and the production of thematic maps, using GIS software, make the method a valid tool for the Regions when identifying zones vulnerable to nitrate pollution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The method is presented here with application to a test site of about 250 km2, situated in the lower Alessandria plain (Eastern Piedmont, Italy).</jats:p>",

In the Danube river basin more than 60% of the population depends on groundwater sources. Organic micropollutants play an important role in quality assessment since they might cause different toxic effects in humans. There are two groups of organic micropollutants: regulated and non-regulated. In recent years, a lot of scientific effort was made to quantify their risks. Their occurrence is site specific and depends on social and economic factors, industry, population density, environmental conditions etc. That is why legislation intervention is required both at national and international level. This paper presents a literature review on the presence and fate of organic micropollutants that have been recently investigated in numerous projects worldwide. Special attention is paid to their mobility and risk for groundwater resources. Data on Serbian groundwater quality is presented for the period 2004–2005. In comparison with knowledge in developed countries, one can conclude that there is a general lack of data. More data about organic micropollutants presence is required, as well as identification of the pressures which lead to quality deterioration. Future quality assessment should be based on evaluated risks made considering both experience from developed countries and local conditions.</jats:p>",

Vingåker was one of six Swedish municipalities whose district heating companies went bankrupt in 2004. The bankruptcy caused major disruptions in Vingåker, not least as a result of the unregulated legal framework that has long prevailed in the area of district heating, where there is essentially no consumer protection. </jats:p><jats:p> A distinguishing feature of Vingåker, and one that may be assumed to apply to other smaller municipalities as well, is the fact that the municipality was the totally dominant customer in the district heating system. In its negotiations, the municipality was able to exploit this position of strength by refusing to pay the district heating price set by the trustee in bankruptcy while still continuing to have district heat delivered. At the same time, the case of Vingåker also shows that, in their procurement processes, municipalities need to conduct a thorough analysis of the ownership structures of the bidding companies, and determine the extent to which each company is established in the industry. Yet another lesson to be taken from this case is that changes in external factors such as fuel costs and taxes, which are difficult for local actors to influence, create a need to draw up short-term contracts that allow for adjustments in the district heating rates. </jats:p>",

From the point of numerical modeling, there are two issues considering air sparging: modeling of air flow and distribution and modeling of mass transport and transfer. Several processes, which are commonly neglected, such as air channeling and pollutant advection by the water phase, are taken into account. The numerical model presented in this paper considers all relevant for mass transfer during the air sparging. Model includes hydrodynamics of air and water phase; calculated air volume content is divided into a number of air channels surrounded by the water phase, which is divided into two compartments. First compartment is immobile and it is in contact with air phase, while the second compartment is mobile. This “mobile-immobile” formulation is a common approach for description of solute transport by groundwater. Mass transfer between two water compartments is modeled as a first order kinetic, where the mass transfer coefficient, representing diffusion and advection in the water phase towards the air channels, is parameter needed to be calibrated. Sorption for both water compartments is considered.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The adopted model of contaminant evaporation at the air-water interface is verified by comparison with experimental results available from published sources.

The following examples of conceptual models elaborated in the 1990s with use of isotopes in the Upper Danube basin show how isotopes can be used to help understand: a) potential pathways and travel time of contamination from groundwater to the river from Southern Vienna basin; b) vulnerability of river/wetland ecosystems in the Regelsbrunn wetland; and c) delineation of Danube-originated and local groundwaters in the Pannonian basin. Isotope methods could be also used in other parts of the Danube basin. For example, because the groundwater inflow via tributaries can be important, we also propose longitudinal chemical and isotopical monitoring of the main Danube tributaries, e.g., the Tisza river, which drains the major part of the Great Pannonian basin. Finally, we argue that open questions highlighted in the previous Joint Danube Survey, especially those on the identification of hotspots of nutrient inputs could be addressed using isotope techniques, and therefore we recommend addition of isotopes to the sampling programme of the coming Joint Danube Survey in 2007.</jats:p>",

The insurance is designed to cover the financial needs of the water supplier in situations where the option is likely to be exercised. Insurance provides the irregularly needed funds for exercising the water options. The combined option contract – reservoir index insurance system creates risk sharing between sectors that is currently lacking in many shared water situations. Contracts are designed for a shared agriculture – urban water system in Metro Manila, Philippines, using optimization and Monte Carlo analysis. Observed reservoir inflows are used to simulate contract performance.

It is therefore critically important to characterize and model fate and transport of contaminants in both the vadose zone/residuum and the underlying saturated zone as part of remedial design for aquifer restoration. Residuum sediments usually contain a significant fraction of clay minerals and fluid flow is often predominantly in vertical direction. Groundwater modeling is useful when evaluating alternatives of contaminant mass removal in the vadose zone/residuum and their impact on the downgradient dissolved concentrations in the underlying aquifer. Two case studies illustrate applicability of such modeling. The first study includes modeling of the expected natural longevity of a residual DNAPL mass accumulation in the saturated residuum, and its comparison to the effects of remedial DNAPL mass removal. The second study includes modeling contaminant transport from a residual DNAPL source within the vadose zone to the saturated zone in the residuum and the underlying bedrock aquifer. The natural longevity of the unsaturated DNAPL source is modeled, focusing on resulting down-gradient concentrations in the residuum and bedrock aquifer. For comparison, two remedial actions are simulated; 90% mass removal and soil flushing.</jats:p>",

In this study, the potential effects of specific levels of atmospheric warming on water‐year streamflow in the Colorado River basin are evaluated using a water‐balance model, and the results are analyzed within the context of a multi‐century tree‐ring reconstruction (1490–1998) of streamflow for the basin. The results indicate that if future warming occurs in the basin and is not accompanied by increased precipitation, then the basin is likely to experience periods of water supply shortages more severe than those inferred from the long‐term historical tree‐ring reconstruction. Furthermore, the modeling results suggest that future warming would increase the likelihood of failure to meet the water allocation requirements of the Colorado River Compact.</jats:p>",

Given substantial increases in NHS expenditure, new national contracts for hospital doctors and general practitioners that involve increases in pay, and the gradual imposition of a ceiling on hours worked through the European Working Time Directive, knowledge of the size of labour supply elasticities is crucial in examining the effects of these major changes. This paper estimates a modified labour supply model for hospital consultants, using data from a survey of consultants in Scotland. Rigidities in wage setting within the NHS mean that the usual specification of the labour supply model is extended by the inclusion of job quality (job satisfaction) in the equation explaining the optimal number of hours worked.</jats:p><jats:p>Generalised Method of Moments estimation is used to account for the endogeneity of both earnings and job quality. Our results confirm the importance of pay and non‐pay factors on the supply of labour by consultants. The results are sensitive to the exclusion of job quality and show a slight underestimation of the uncompensated earnings elasticity (of 0.09) without controlling for the effect of job quality, and 0.12 when we controlled for job quality. Pay increases in the new contract for consultants will only result in small increases in hours worked. Small and non‐significant elasticity estimates at higher quantiles in the distribution of hours suggest that any increases in hours worked are more likely for consultants who work part time. Those currently working above the median number of hours are much less responsive to changes in earnings. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this article, we theorize business‐to‐business logistics relationships should be managed using cooperative and competitive postures. Based on data from 91 dyadic relationships using interorganizational information technology (IT), we find that performance gains accrue when parties share strategic information and customize IT; mutual trust enables IT customization and strategic‐information flows and equitable relationship‐specific investments positively impact IT customization, mutual trust, and performance. Among other scholarly and practical implications discussed, partners should compete on resources for IT customization and cooperate to share strategic information. Managers tend to think of relationships with firms as polar opposites and view them as entirely cooperative or entirely competitive. Our results support active balancing and understanding of both competitive and cooperative stances. Such an approach enables conditions for participation symmetry that yields greater performance gains.</jats:p>",

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic in drinking water. Within Europe, Hungary, Serbia and Croatia are likely most affected. Elevated arsenic concentration has been found in several wells used by the Water Supply Company in Makó, Hungary. Groundwater in southern Hungary typically contains also ammonia, methane, some iron and manganese. Situation is very similar in several other surrounding countries. There are intensive efforts to find affordable approach for treatment of such complex arsenic contaminated groundwater. UNESCO-IHE has been developing an innovative arsenic removal technology (IHE ADART), based on adsorption on iron oxide coated sand (IOCS) and an in-situ regeneration of exhausted adsorbent. The paper presents results from field-testing of the IHE-ADART technology in Southern Hungary. Two pilot plants have been operated at several arsenic-contaminated wells with arsenic concentrations from 20 to 260 μg/l. Very consistent arsenic removal below 10 μg/l was achieved at all testing wells and throughout the 18 months of continuous testing. In addition methane, ammonia, iron and manganese were removed highly effectively. Life cycle cost analysis showed that overall treatment costs would be below 0.10 Euro/m3.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two Austrian case study regions within the Danube basin have been selected for detailed investigations of groundwater and surface water quality at the catchment scale. Water balance calculations have been performed using the conceptual continuous time SWAT 2000 model to characterise catchment hydrology and to identify individual runoff components contributing to river discharge. Nitrogen emission calculations have been performed using the empirical emission model MONERIS to relate individual runoff components to specific nitrogen emissions and for the quantification of total nitrogen emissions to surface waters. Calculated total nitrogen emissions to surface waters using the MONERIS model were significantly influenced by hydrological conditions. For both catchments the groundwater could be identified as major emission pathway of nitrogen emissions to the surface waters. Since most of the nitrogen is emitted by groundwater to the surface water, denitrification in groundwater is of considerable importance reducing nitrogen levels in groundwater along the flow path towards the surface water. An approach was adopted for the grid-oriented estimation of diffuse nitrogen emissions based on calculated groundwater residence time distributions. Denitrification in groundwater was considered using a half life time approach. It could be shown that more than 90% of the total diffuse nitrogen emissions were contributed by areas with low groundwater residence times and short distances to the surface water. Thus, managing diffuse nitrogen emissions the location of catchment areas has to be considered as well as hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, which significantly influence denitrification in the groundwater and reduce nitrogen levels in groundwater on the flow path towards the surface water.</jats:p>",

Based primarily on transaction‐cost economics and supplemented by the resource‐based view, this study investigates how interorganizational governance (i.e., relational governance and virtual integration) can create value (i.e., information visibility and supply chain flexibility) in the supply chain context. The findings show that both relational governance and virtual integration benefit information visibility. Those results also support both direct and indirect (via information visibility) effects of relational governance on supply chain flexibility. Although failing to affect supply chain flexibility directly, virtual integration can still improve supply chain flexibility with its ability to enhance information visibility. Thus, interorganizational governance mechanisms emphasizing both control and collaboration can influence the gain from collaboration‐specific capabilities, leading to the competitive advantage of a supply chain. The results of the study suggest that firms can gain greater supply chain flexibility within existing interfirm relationships by enhancing information visibility through virtual integration and relational governance.</jats:p>",

In criminal defence work, this duty has been questioned in the debate about the causes of growth in legal aid spending: is it driven by lawyers (suppliers) inducing unnecessary demand for their services or are they merely responding to increased demand? Research reported here found clear evidence of a change in the handling of cases in response to new payment structures, though in ways unexpected by the policy's proponents. The paper develops the concept of ‘ethical indeterminacy’ as a way of understanding how defence lawyers seek to reconcile the interests of commerce and clients. Ethical indeterminacy suggests that where different courses of action could each be said to benefit the client, the lawyer will tend to advise the client to decide in the lawyer's own interests. Ethical indeterminacy is mediated by a range of competing conceptions of ‘quality’ and ‘need’. The paper goes on to question the very distinction between ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ in the provision of legal services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Glucose is the obligate energetic fuel for the mammalian brain, and most studies of cerebral energy metabolism assume that the majority of cerebral glucose utilization fuels neuronal activity via oxidative metabolism, both in the basal and activated state. Glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins deliver glucose from the circulation to the brain: GLUT1 in the microvascular endothelial cells of the blood—brain barrier (BBB) and glia; GLUT3 in neurons. Lactate, the glycolytic product of glucose metabolism, is transported into and out of neural cells by the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT): MCT1 in the BBB and astrocytes and MCT2 in neurons. The proposal of the astrocyte—neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis suggested that astrocytes play the primary role in cerebral glucose utilization and generate lactate for neuronal energetics, especially during activation. Since the identification of the GLUTs and MCTs in brain, much has been learned about their transport properties, that is capacity and affinity for substrate, which must be considered in any model of cerebral glucose uptake and utilization. Using concentrations and kinetic parameters of GLUT1 and −3 in BBB endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons, along with the corresponding kinetic properties of the MCTs, we have successfully modeled brain glucose and lactate levels as well as lactate transients in response to neuronal stimulation. Simulations based on these parameters suggest that glucose readily diffuses through the basal lamina and interstitium to neurons, which are primarily responsible for glucose uptake, metabolism, and the generation of the lactate transients observed on neuronal activation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Background: Between 1987–1997, the demand for allogeneic blood (whole blood and packed RBC) in the US decreased due to concerns about safety of the blood supply1. Paradoxically, these concerns also led to a decrease in the available supply. During this same period, collection of allogeneic blood declined from 13.6 million to 11.9 million units, resulting in a 48% reduction in the margin between available supply and demand.1 Although both supply and demand for blood has since increased, the margin has further declined to only 6.1% in 2004 (allogeneic collection: 14.8 million units; transfusion: 13.9 million units)2. This situation is further exacerbated by procedures used for qualifying fully screened units. In 2004, 240,000 units were rejected after screening, leaving a margin of only 648,000 units available (4.5% of the supply). Given the introduction and adoption of treatments that reduce transfusions, such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for patients (pts) with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA), in the past 15 years, periodic shortages in the blood supply due to this limited surplus have been moderated. Purpose: To estimate the impact of limiting the use of ESAs for CIA on the US blood supply.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: A modeling simulation was employed using a top-down approach to compare the number of RBC units transfused in ESA-treated pts to the number of RBC units that would be transfused if ESAs were discontinued or limited in the same population. The excess number of RBC units that would be required if ESA treatment in CIA pts was limited was contrasted with the available marginal blood supply from 2004 (latest data available). Model inputs included incident cases of CIA pts treated with ESA, transfusion rates from clinical trials, and volume of RBC units required for ESA-treated and untreated pts. Data were obtained from published literature or expert opinion where published evidence was unavailable. Estimates were developed for multiple ESA reduction scenarios, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using a range of +/–10% for each input parameter.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Under the base case scenario, it was estimated that 492,002 incident CIA pts received a total of 372,809 RBC units despite ESA treatment. The model predicted that up to a third of the marginal US blood supply would be required to cover the incremental demand for blood that would arise from a 25% decrease in ESA use (incremental RBC units transfused: 118,602 units, sensitivity range: 63,030–210,110 units). For ESA use reductions of 50% and 75%, the model predicted 37% (237,203 units) and 55% (355,805 units) of the marginal US blood supply would be required, respectively. In the case of total cessation of ESA use for CIA, the available US blood supply could be exceeded (incremental demand: 474,407 units, sensitivity range: 252,119–840,441 units).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: This current model of blood demand showed limiting ESA use in CIA pts imposes considerable pressure on the available US blood supply given the small margin between usable blood and transfusion demand. This added pressure on the blood supply does not consider additional exacerbations due to regional and seasonal variation in the number of available units as well as donation frequency variations.</jats:p>",

A recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 was grown in hydroponic culture to characterize the responses of seedlings to water deficit imposed by PEG 6000 and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seedling characteristics under both well‐watered and water‐deficit conditions. Generally, the two parents showed significant differences in plant height (PH), maximum root length (MRL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), root fresh weight (RFW), number of roots and root:shoot ratio based on fresh weight under both well‐watered and water‐deficit conditions. For two parents, PH and SFW were significantly inhibited under water deficit. However, the other four traits had larger values under water deficit. Among 26 and 34 QTLs detected for the six traits studied under the well‐watered and water‐deficit conditions, respectively, a total of 14 QTLs for SFW, PH, RFW and MRL (23% of total QTLs detected) were detected in similar or tight linkage regions in both conditions. Among 11 intervals on 7 chromosomes identified to harbor multiple QTLs, 8 intervals were found to affect related traits under the two water supply conditions and 3 intervals were observed to be water supply‐specific regions and had effects only under well‐watered conditions, suggesting that water supply‐specific regions or QTLs may be closely associated with the responses of lines to water deficit in the study. Several regions for the traits studied were also found to affect the root‐related traits in previous studies and might be used in marker‐assisted selection for drought‐resistant rice in breeding programs.</jats:p>",

To achieve these objectives, numerical tools are required to quantitatively model flow through porous saturated and unsaturated media. We have developed a general finite element (FE) model for underground water flow and specific algorithms for Ranney wells. Solutions for steady and unsteady conditions are obtained by using two basic models: global and local. The global model consists of 3D finite elements and 1D finite elements with the equivalent well permeability representing Ranney wells. The local models are generated around wells, using solutions for all quantities from 3D global model at a cylindrical surface which bounds the local model. The local model consists of a fine 3D FE mesh and 1D elements used to model each of the well screens. We developed a software for pre- and post-processing, Lizza, which can be used for easy modeling of complex engineering underground water flow problems with Ranney wells. The FE package PAK-P is used as the solver. This software can handle flow regions with general irregular boundaries. The flow region itself may be composed of layers of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy. Flow can occur in the vertical plane, the horizontal plane, or in a three dimensional region exhibiting radial symmetry about the vertical axis. The water flow model includes constant or time-varying prescribed head and flux boundaries, as well as boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions. At a soil surface, boundary conditions may change during the time evolution from prescribed flux to prescribed head type conditions (and vice versa). The model also include a seepage face boundary through which water leaves the saturated part of the flow domain, and free drainage boundary conditions. The results of modeling several real engineering projects (Belgrade Water Supply Center) are presented.</jats:p>",

Among the alternatives currently under development are higher methyl-tert-alkyl ethers, notably methyl-tert-hexyl ether (MtHxE) and methyl-tert-octyl ether (MtOcE). As was the case with MtBE, the introduction of these ethers into fuel supplies guarantees their migration into groundwater resources. In the present study, a screening-level risk assessment compared predicted well water concentrations of these ethers to concentrations that might cause adverse effects. A physicochemical model which has been successfully applied to the prediction of MtBE concentrations in community water supply wells (CSWs) was used to predict well water concentrations of MtHxE and MtOcE. The results indicate that these ethers are likely to contaminate water supply wells at slightly lower levels than MtBE as a result of migrating from leaking underground fuel tanks to CSWs. Because very little data is available on the physicochemical and environmental properties of MtHxE and MtOcE, estimation methods were employed in conjunction with the model to predict well water concentrations. Model calculations indicated that MtHxE and MtOcE will be present in many CSWs at concentrations approaching the concentrations that have caused widespread public health concern for MtBE. Based on these results and the possibility that MtHxE and MtOcE are potential carcinogens, testing of the toxicological properties of these ethers is recommended before they are used to replace MtBE in gasoline.</jats:p>",

Possible strategies include triaging of supply to prioritize support where transfusion cannot be deferred. However, few data concerning urgency of transfusion are available to inform planning. We designed a random sample survey to assess urgency of clinical need, and hence potential utility of triaging red cells (RC) in an emergency through restricting use only to urgent indications, for a regional population of approximately 5 million. An audit based on random sampling of units at point of distribution was used to assess state-wide RC use over time, and capture data in proportion to actual usage over both rural and metropolitan centers. Randomly selected RC units were tagged with a case-report form during production. Tagged units were distributed to hospital laboratories with routine supply. At time of issue for transfusion, the institutional laboratory completed and returned case report forms from the tagged units. Information regarding recipient demographics, indication for transfusion, urgency of supply, and (where issued to support surgery) urgency of surgery were obtained. Following an initial pilot study to refine the model, approximately 1000 tagged RC units (46% group O, 36% A, 13% B, and 4% AB; RhD positive 85% / negative 15%) of a planned 5000 total have been introduced to the state inventory. Three percent of units were not transfused. Major clinical categories of use included hematology (17% of overall use), gastroenterology (11%), orthopedic surgery (9%), non-hematological oncology (6%), gastrointestinal surgery (6%), cardiothoracic surgery (5%), obstetrics/gynecology (5%), urology (3%), trauma (3%) and pediatrics (2%); miscellaneous indications and anemia not otherwise specified constituted 10% and 22% of transfusions respectively. 18% of units were used in acute transfusion episodes (needed within 1h), 43% for urgent indications (1–24h), 33% semi-urgent (24h - 1 week) and 4% non-urgent. Of the 34% units allocated to support perioperative bleeding; only a quarter of procedures were elective. In 15% of cases the urgency of surgery was not stated. Thus, reporting institutions indicated that only 38% transfused units could have been deferred for more than 24h, and only 9% of total RCs were allocated to support potentially deferrable elective surgery. These early results suggest that triaging of RC supply in an acute shortage would only have a very short term impact on actual RC use, as the majority of RC use is already relatively urgent. Additional strategies for emergency blood contingency planning are required to meet priority clinical needs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional methods used to predict energy production and consumption analyse the relationship between cause and effect; such models thus tend to be complicated and not particularly accurate. Artificial neural network (ANN) methods are extensively used for prediction in non-linear systems; however, the back-propagation (BP) neural network (NN) method is not ideal for convergence and local minimum problems. The radial basis function (RBF) NN is capable of fast calculation and extrapolation, has a strong non-linear reflection function and is very adaptive. The objective of this paper is to apply a RBF NN to predict China's energy supply and demand. The core of the method is to process historic energy data as a static data series in order to simplify the model. All energy outputs depend only on historic data and the prediction requires a small calculation time. The results indicate that dynamic energy prediction based on a RBF NN shows good correlation with actual data and the method appears to be more appropriate for dynamic energy prediction than other models. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the combined effects of a constant water deficit and nitrogen supply (NS) on growth, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance (<jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) and transpiration, instantaneous and time‐integrated water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C) in durum wheat genotypes grown in pots under greenhouse conditions. Three water levels (40%, 70% and 100% container capacity), two nitrogen doses (high and low N) and four genotypes were assayed in a total of 24 experimental treatments. Water and nitrogen treatments were imposed 2 weeks after plant emergence. The growth, nitrogen content and Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C of the shoot and the gas exchange in the flag leaf were determined about 2 weeks after anthesis. As expected, both water and NS had a strong positive effect on growth. However, a reduction in water supply had low effect decreasing photosynthesis and transpiration, Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C and NUE and increasing WUE. On the contrary, increasing the level of nitrogen supplied had a significant negative effect on <jats:italic>g</jats:italic><jats:sub>s</jats:sub>, which decreased significantly the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations and Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C, and increased both instantaneous and time‐integrated WUE. In addition, a higher N level also negatively affected the instantaneous and time‐integrated NUE. The Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C of shoots correlated significantly and negatively with either instantaneous or time‐integrated measurements of WUE. Moreover, within each NS, Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C also correlated negatively with the integrated NUE. We concluded that under our experimental conditions, Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C gives information about the efficiency with which not just water but also nitrogen are used by the plant. In addition, this study illustrates that a steady water limitation may strongly affect biomass without consistent changes in WUE. The lack of effect of the different water regimes on gas exchange, WUE and Δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C illustrate the importance of how stress is imposed during growth.</jats:p>",

Above‐ground yield of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) concentration and pepsin‐cellulase DM digestibility of herbage were measured in two successive years. Species was the largest source of variability in yield of DM and DM digestibility of herbage, while CP concentration of herbage responded more to management factors. The highest mean DM yields and values of DM digestibility of herbage were achieved in spring for <jats:italic>Festuca arundinacea</jats:italic> and in autumn for <jats:italic>Phleum pratense</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Poa trivialis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Festuca rubra</jats:italic> had the lowest DM yield and DM digestibility values, respectively, regardless of seasons and treatments. For all species CP concentration in herbage increased in response to an increase in cutting frequency and N supply by an average of 46 and 34 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM respectively. Differences between years and seasons indicated the importance of plant phenology on nutritional variables and the influence of environmental factors on species performance. Species ranking was compared according to their annual digestible DM and CP yields. The results show that some grasses have a nutritive value which is comparable to that of forages selected for high yields.</jats:p>",

The incorporation of 5 mM [U-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]glucose into glyceride-glycerol, used to evaluate G3P generation via glycolysis, was reduced by ∼26–36% in liver slices of fasted and diabetic rats. The glycolytic flux was reduced by ∼60% in both groups. The incorporation of 1.0 mM [2-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]pyruvate into glyceride-glycerol (glyceroneogenesis) increased ∼50% and ∼36% in slices of fasted and diabetic rats, respectively, which also showed a two-fold increase in the activity phospho enolpyruvate carboxykinase. The increased incorporation of 1.0 mM [2-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]pyruvate into glyceride-glycerol by slices of fasted rats was not affected by the addition of 5 mM glucose to the incubation medium. The activity of glycerokinase and the incorporation of 1 mM [U-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]glycerol into glyceride-glycerol, evaluators of G3P formation by direct glycerol phosphorylation, did not differ significantly from controls in slices of the two experimental groups. Rates of incorporation of 1 mM [2-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]pyruvate and [U-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]glycerol into glucose of incubation medium (gluconeogenesis) were ∼140 and ∼20% higher in fasted and diabetic slices than in control slices. It could be estimated that glyceroneogenesis by liver slices of fasted rats contributed with ∼20% of G3P generated for glyceride-glycerol synthesis, the glycolytic pathway with ∼5%, and direct phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerokinase with ∼75%. Pyruvate contributed with 54% and glycerol with 46% of gluconeogenesis.
