      "abstract": "<p>This chapter focuses specifically on drinking water supply, which is divided into national, state, rural, and urban areas given the multiplicity of relevant instruments. The first section focuses on rural drinking supply. It reproduces the main national-level policy instrument in this area, the National Rural Drinking Water Programme Guidelines, 2013, select state-level legislation (panchayat acts) and instruments highlighting the push for reforms and privatisation in the sector. The second section focuses on urban drinking water supply. It reproduces extracts of a national statute and select state-level legal instruments. It also reproduces legal instruments seeking to foster reforms in urban water provisioning. The third section looks at drinking water supply in specific contexts and highlights select legal instruments concerning schools, post-disaster management, and work places. The last section highlights the issue of drinking water quality and quantity standards, a crucial dimension that has not been given yet the place it deserves in legislation.</p>",

CLSC, the integration of the forward and reverse supply chains, is an emerging area of interest as firms seek to reduce the costs of product returns, increase profits through value recovery, and meet more rigorous environmental standards. In CLSC, the original manufacturer will take the used product and remake it. CLSC deals with the uncertainty in the timing, location, quantity, and quality of returned products. CLSC integrates the returns of end-of-life products from end-users to retailers, manufacturers, and suppliers for refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling. The chapter argues that enhancing CLSC has the potential to reach strategic goals toward sustainability in global supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology, popularized by Bitcoin cryptocurrency, is characterized as an open-source, decentralized, distributed database for storing transaction information. Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The Liverpool Philharmonic Society lies fifth in line among the oldest concert-giving organisations in Europe. This chapter, tapping the Society’s archive, examines the fundamental internal and external hierarchies which governed and shaped the early development of the Society’s orchestra. To what extent were core values dictated by external supply and demand and to what extent by the personal interests of the leading figures in the Society? What conclusions can be reached about the elements of Liverpool’s activities that were independently governed by local demands? Probing the social expectations and financial structures that underpinned the Society’s regulations, committees, income, expenditure, venues, audience, performers, repertoire and programming is revealing. It allows us to contextualize the issues facing those who promoted ‘the Science and Practice of Music’ in this prosperous commercial port. The operational models established in these early years laid the foundation for a Society whose orchestra continues to the present day.</p>",

Produktbegleitende Sensoren können solche qualitätsrelevante Ereignisse laufend erfassen und weiterleiten. Das erlaubt eine zeitnahe Reaktion, zum Beispiel die sofortige Nachbestellung defekter Teile während des Transports. Eine ereignisorientierte Simulationsstudie zeigt, dass die Liefertreue erhöht und Lagerbestandsschwankungen verringert werden können.</p>\n          <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Environmental conditions such as heat, humidity or shock can cause quality defects in automotive components like electronic control units during transport. Mobile sensors accompanying these components can measure and communicate such quality-relevant events. This allows for timely reaction, e.g. the immediate reorder of defect goods that are still en route. A discrete-event simulation shows that this improves delivery reliability and reduces stock fluctuations. </p>"

As corporations' awareness increases on the jeopardizing impact they have caused to the deteriorating environment, more corporations have established a more eco-friendly operation. Greening the supply chain is one significant example of such moves. Realizing the green supply chain tendency in the industry, this proposed chapter focuses on highlighting the supply chain integration with business partners (suppliers, shippers, distributors, and customers) on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices. The chapter shows the literature supporting the important integration of GSCM as it enables corporations to gather collective strength, skills, and capabilities in achieving its ecological as well as business objectives. Both practitioners in companies and corporations might find this review useful, as it outlines major lines of research in the field.</jats:p>"

But at present, India's share in global farm trade is still very small even with such large production volumes. This is mainly caused due to lack of cold chain infrastructure which includes both storage and transportation facilities. The cold chain industry in India is still at a nascent stage and despite large production of perishables, the cold chain potential still remain untapped due to high share of single commodity cold storage, high initial investment (for refrigerator units and land), lack of enabling infrastructure like power &amp; roads, lack of awareness for handling perishable produce and lapse of service either by the storage provider or the transporter leading to poor quality produce. Cold chain systems are crucial to the growth of global trade in perishable products and to the worldwide availability of food and health supplies. </jats:p>"

Based on the analysis author has identified current challenges their supply chain is facing and how IT can help them to make their supply chain more responsive and reliable. IT framework which can address the supply chain challenges has also been proposed here. Second part of the paper deals with how retailers can help the industry to overcome these challenges. Pharma companies need to partner with pharmacies for a win-win situation and this partnership can address most of the challenges being faced by the industry. This partnership will help in various ways like getting accurate information across the entire chain at any point and at any location, Instant access to real-time demand by the end user, visibility of all handovers in the supply chain and helps in setting-up seamless collaboration between all parties. </jats:p>"

The maximum pressure drop at the pump end of the discharge line is significant for the safety assessment of the pipelines. In this study, the characteristics of the pump-stopping water hammer and its propagation in the pipelines are analyzed. The formula for predicting the maximum pressure drop is deduced based on the Method of Characteristics and the complete characteristics of the pumps. The application conditions of the formula and the solution procedures are presented as well. In addition, two engineering cases are introduced and the results calculated by the formula are compared with those resulting from the numerical simulation, and the agreement is satisfactory. The formula presented in this study is of simple form, practical and of high precision, and can provide a theoretical basis for the water hammer protection scheme of a long-distance water supply project.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global retail business has become diverse and latest Information Technology (IT) advancements have created new possibilities for the management of the deluge of data generated by world-wide business operations of its supply chain. In this business, external data from social media and supplier networks provide a huge influx to augment existing data. This is combined with data from sensors and intelligent machines, commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT) data. This data, originating from the global retail supply chain, is simply known as Big Data - because of its enormous volume, the velocity with which it arrives in the global retail business environment, its veracity to quality related issues, and values it generates for the global supply chain. Many retail products manufacturing companies are trying to find ways to enhance their quality of operational performance while reducing business support costs. They do this primarily by improving defect tracking and better forecasting. These manufacturing and operational improvements along with a favorable customer experience remain crucil to thriving in global competition. In recent years, Big Data and its associated technologies are attracting huge research interest with academics, industry practitioners, and government agencies. Big Data-based software applications are widely used within retail supply chain management - in recommendation, prediction, and decision support systems. The spectacular growth of these software systems has enormous potential for improving the daily performance of retail product and service companies. However, there are increasingly data quality problems resulting in erroneous tesing costs in retail Supply Chain Management (SCM). The heavy investment made in Big Data-based software applications puts increasing pressure on management to justify the quality assurance in these software systems. This chapter discusses about data quality and the dimensions of data quality for Big Data applications. It also examines some of the challenges presented by managing the quality and governance of Big Data, and how those can be balanced with the need of delivery usable Big Data-based software systems. Finally, the chapter highlights the importance of data governance; and it also includes some of the Big Data managerial practice related issues and their justifications for achieving application software quality assurance.</jats:p>"

Water consumption in facilities and buildings of the company was determined. Rainwater potentially harvestable from the roofs and maneuvering yard of the company was estimated based on a statistical analysis of the rainfall. Based on these data, potential water saving was determined. Characterization of rainwater was carried out to determine the treatment necessities for each water source. Additionally, the capacity of water storage tanks was estimated. For the selected treatment systems, an economic assessment was conducted to determine the viability of the alternative proposed. Results showed that current water demand of the company can be totally covered by using rainwater. The scenario where roof and maneuvering yard rainwater was collected and treated together resulted in being more economic than the scenarios where roof and maneuvering yard rainwater was collected and treated separately. Implementation of the rainwater harvesting system will generate important economic benefits for the company. The investment will be amortized in only 5 years and the NPV will be on the order of US$ 5,048.3, the IRR of 5.7%, and the B/I of 1.9.</jats:p>",

The term sustainability has been used in varying meanings in different disciplines. With this chapter, the authors propose to bring together an interdisciplinary framework for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). SSCM will be studied through literature surveys on the axes of both natural sciences, and social sciences, with an overarching goal of policy implications. Unlike quantitatively oriented natural sciences, integrating perspectives from the social sciences into a firm's overall sustainability strategy is still seen as a large undertaking by firms and can impede its sustainability. More practical and scholarly research needs to be conducted in this area, especially in terms of assessment and evaluation mechanisms. </jats:p>"

In 2000 and 2006, Italy and Belgium, respectively, introduced an allowance for corporate equity so that both firms and banks could deduct a notional interest on their equity from their taxable income. Because local firms were also affected by these reforms, we employ loan-level data from a credit register in a third country—Germany—to better identify the differential impact on lending by banks that were ‘treated’ by these tax reforms versus a control group of banks that were not. We find that the decrease in the cost of equity leads banks to raise their equity ratio, and to concurrently expand their balance sheet by increasing the amount of credit supplied in Germany. Conversely, the reversal of these reforms leads to a decrease in lending.</p>",

In supply chain research, the classic economic perspective—the business of business is to be profitable—still dominates, followed by coverage of the environmental dimension; the social dimension is underrepresented. Stakeholders, however, are calling for a <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TBL</jats:styled-content> perspective that simultaneously includes environmental, social, and economic gains. While there have been recent theoretical advances on how to characterize supply chains in terms of their structure, how to connect these insights into supply chain design for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TBL</jats:styled-content> sustainability has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to move the theory of supply chain forward into the sustainable supply chain management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCM</jats:styled-content>) research agenda. Toward that purpose, the paper analyzes the sustainable supply chain design (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCD</jats:styled-content>) at social businesses, incorporating the physical chain and the information and financial support chains. Four social businesses located in Haiti are used as cases of innovative supply chain structures for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TBL</jats:styled-content> sustainability. By analyzing the supply chain structures and boundaries of these social businesses, three supply chain configurations combining physical and support chains are presented.</jats:p>",

However, Australia’s future fuel supply will rely on a globalised supply chain in order to meet local needs. In response, BP has (among other initiatives) transformed its operations and maintenance approach to terminals and fuel distribution within Australia to guarantee a sustainable business model, offsetting the trend of high asset ownership costs and low efficiency.\nWhen it comes to terminal management, BP’s creation of Australian Terminals Operation Management (ATOM), a joint venture between BP and UGL, differentiates BP from its peers. This model has proven fundamental to maintaining a competitive position in the Australian fuel industry. BP’s unique approach to meeting customer demands through the ATOM business is a success story that comes from pre-empting and embracing change.\n</jats:p>"

The forecasting function in customer service drives the downstream resource planning processes to provide the best customer experience at optimal costs. For a mature, global organization, its existing systems and processes have evolved over time and become complex. These complexities result in informational silos that result in sub-optimal use of data thereby creating inaccurate forecasts that adversely affect the planning process in supporting the customer service function. For addressing this problem, the authors argue for the use of frameworks that are best suited for a big data ecosystem. Drawing from existing literature, the concept of data lakes and data value chain have been used as theoretical approaches to devise a road map to implement a better data architecture to improve the forecasting capabilities in the given organizational scenario. </jats:p>"

Global supply chains accommodate around 20% of total workforce. But, it is estimated, at any given moment that approximately three out of every thousand people on the planet are suffering in some form of forced labor, which is more prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for around 56% of the global total. Further, about 90% of the forced labor are exploited in the private economy. However, most of the successful corporates along with the governments understand the need to combat this global menace through strong legislation.

An equilibrium mathematical model is proposed for the liberalized tariff setting conditions based on a microeconomic monopolistic market model. This mathematical model allows for taking into account energy production and transportation costs as part of a single economic criterion and to determine the supply and demand equilibrium for heat energy. The search for an optimal solution to the developed mathematical model of the unified heat supply organization is based on the univariate relaxation method with the subsequent use of methods of redundant design and simple iterative schemes. The developed mathematical model fully reflect the current “rules of the game” between heat energy producers and consumers and allow a maximum consideration for the interests of all participants of the heat supply process under physical and engineering constraints on heat energy sources and heat networks.</jats:p>"

The challenge of feeding India's billion plus people is not really about agriculture and food production but getting the quality food to the concerned people in a right time. The biggest contributors to this waste are lack of temperature controlled transport and inadequate quality of cold storage facilities for both Farmers and Food sellers i.e. retailers. What India lacks, and needs, is a well-developed, world-class cold chain infrastructure. Without it, India's problems are vast and likely to grow. In this chapter, the authors tries to outlines the extent of Fruits and Vegetables waste in India (at various stages from farm to retail) and its ramifications on food production and safety. Authors also highlighted the challenges faced by cold chain sector in India and a roadmap for improvements. As Indian economy is based on agriculture, development of Cold Chain infrastructure from farm to retail points will play a crucial role. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the relationships between food and places and how these affect the organization and functioning of different supply chains. The theme is increasingly relevant due to demand trends and new production patterns, including globalization, that deeply affect the (re)localization of production. This is a conceptual paper extensively relying on previous studies done by the author and on evidence and concepts discussed in the literature; it does not present new in-depth case studies or any other original evidences. First, the different ways of conceptualizing and thinking the linkages between food and production places are discussed. Then, three chains that seek at delivering products for which the place of origin is important are compared: (i) short chains, where producers integrate the whole process in order to access the final consumer; (ii) geographical indications, where producers gather under a common name in order to build their reputation in connection with the place of production; (iii) retailers specialized in high quality foods, where advantages of large retailers are combined with the strong identity of products. The objective is to contribute understanding differences in the coordination modes and in the kind of governance at stake in each chain and to compare their strengths and drawbacks in terms of capacity to assure place-related quality and of delivering reliable information to consumers. Attention is also given to the role of farmers within the different chains, as these are usually strongly rooted in the place of origin but the weakest knots in the chain in terms of bargaining power. Vertical and horizontal coordination, together with collective actions, are essential for an effective alignment of the production process that can enhance quality and create/distribute value. The discussion also assesses difficulties and drawbacks related to sharing decisions and to managing common resources.</jats:p>"

Gaining competitive advantage by supply chain management means sharing the information as the evidence of trust between partners. Digital Supply Chains are based on technologies that enable increasing competitiveness mainly by delivering information in real time simultaneously to many supply chain partners. However the type and range of the information shared indicates the level of trust. Research results show that partners in supply chain were sharing information about inventory and transport activities. These are the main areas of competing by logistics and supply chain management. The aspect of partnership and cooperation was also raised in the research. Cloud computing had been willingly used in Supplier Relationship Management, Customer Relationship Management and Customer Service Management processes by the respondents.</jats:p>"

Today’s tremendously changing and competitive business environment imposes a significant challenge for firms to sustain a balance between their self-interest and the required interdependency existed among them within a supply chain. Built upon the extensive literature on the supply chain management, this paper theorizes and proposes a Sustainable Collaborative Governance Framework detailing adaptive decision-making and action mechanisms throughout supply chain lifecycle that will enable the whole supply chain proactively and resiliently respond to uncertainties or perturbations without undergoing significant changes to firms’ normal operations. The framework extends the understanding and practice of the sustainable supply chain management by focusing on its dynamic, elastic, holistic, uncertainty-handling and future-oriented characteristics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to reflect on experiences of professionals from a Dutch housing association and a contractor who perceive their relation as a successful supply chain partnership (SCP). Employing a narrative approach, this study shows the subgrouping in informal relations within and around the successful supply chain. The subgrouping shows examples of visible and hidden power dynamics. We conclude that, although the perception of success may have positive spin-offs, the members are not always positive about each other, SCP is applied to only a limited part of the client’s internal supply chain, SCP is applied in an arbitrary way that not always seems to be fair, and continuation of the success in the future is uncertain. The study provokes many practical interventions, but the main recommendation is to keep reflecting on informal relations to address some of the social issues.</jats:p>"

Supply chain partners are expected to know the proper measurement of emissions to solve this problem. This study aim is to review literature on how to measure LCSCM. In the past, the concept of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is practiced to promote and reduce environmental risks. However, GSCM is a driver or practice to achieve environmental outcome. The extended model of GSCM has currently practices in LCSCM through Carbon Footprint (CF) concept.

For the research purpose, the fuzzy DEMATEL and fuzzy MOORA methods are used for the integrated model construction. The main stages of the green supply chain are considered as the dimensions and the selected performance measures are listed as a set of criteria for each dimension. Accordingly, 21 food and beverage companies listed in Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST) are employed to measure the performance of green supply chain processes. It is concluded that low pollution is the most important criterion whereas alternatives has the least weight. Reverse logistic is also second most significant criterion which means that these companies give importance to reduce their costs. It is also found out that there is not a certain correlation between green supply chain management performances with the profitability of the firms. However, it can be seen that bigger firms have higher green supply chain management performance than the smaller firms. </jats:p>"

The concept of stress testing banks for capital sufficiency under conditions of plausible risks is by now an accepted governmental mandate. Stress testing corporations and municipalities, however is relatively new. The authors present a process for both corporate and municipal stress testing together with a review of legal considerations. Over time it is expected that stress testing corporations and municipalities will become as routine as an annual visit to the family physician. This chapter is designed to establish the ground work for stress testing corporations and municipalities, including supply chains and not-for-profit organizations. This discussion applies equally well to global supply chains. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the issue of minimizing the environmental burden of a real closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), consisting of a pallet provider, a manufacturer and several retailers. A simulation model is developed under Microsoft Excel™ (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, US) to reproduce the flow of returnable transport items (RTIs) in the CLSC and to compute the corresponding environmental impact. Multi-objective optimization, including some relevant environmental key performance indicators (KPIs), is then carried out exploiting the commercial software ModeFRONTIER™ (ESTECO S.p.A., Trieste, Italy), to determine the settings that minimize emissions of the CLSC. In addition, economic and strategic metrics are taken into account in the optimization, to make the analysis more comprehensive. Three scenarios are considered (one “base” scenario and two scenarios examined in a sensitivity analysis) with different relative importance assigned to the metrics subject to optimization. Results show that the asset retrieving operations contribute to the environmental impact of the system to the greatest extent, mainly because of the quite relevant distance between Company A and its customers. Conversely, emissions due to the purchase of new assets contribute to the total environmental impact of the system to a very limited extent. Because the analysis is grounded on a real CLSC, the results are expected to provide practical indications to logistics and supply chain managers, to minimize the environmental performance of the system.</jats:p>"

The paper gives a systematic background research and literature overview related to supply chain simulation with insights into the main simulation approaches and methods. Next, supply chain modeling and simulation methodology is described. It introduces supply chain Metamodel which enables modeling of both supply chain structure and dynamics. The main components like model database, process library, knowledge base, and execution engine are also described. The examples of various simulation scenarios are presented. Finally, the paper gives the main future research directions and concludes with a brief discussion of supply chain simulation importance and applications. </jats:p>"

Within these complex supply chain systems, shipping organizations, port authorities and import-export firms naturally a collaborator and cooperates with each other in the broader management context of maritime logistics. Meanwhile, increasing environmental concerns have forced global maritime organizations to implement sustainability in their operation. MGSCM is a recent focus within the sustainable supply chain body of literature with ample room for understanding its challenges and opportunities. With that in mind, the objective of this paper is to review the literature on the development of GSCM and conceptualizing the notion of MGSCM concept in maritime context derived from GSCM respectively. This paper is unique because it addresses the complex dimension of ‘‘sustainability'' in maritime supply chain and try to define it in line with existing GSCM context. The findings of this paper show that GSCM can be extended into maritime perspective to define MGSCM. </jats:p>"

Understanding social aspects, however, might be just as crucial to implementation of SCP as understanding managerial and intraorganizational dynamics. Therefore, this paper presents the results of a study in which a work floor professional together with a researcher tried to contribute to the implementation of SCP within the maintenance and refurbishment processes of a Dutch housing association. The results showed that stakeholders could not come to shared understanding of strategic needs, and that that pattern influences and was influenced by social aspects such as leadership and trust, which confirms the importance of explicit attention for social interactions at work floor level for successful implementation of supply chain partnering.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, the drivers for the implementation of the business intelligence and performance measurement systems are discussed. Review of the most important literature and research findings provides condensed view of the existing state of the art. Furthermore, the integrated supply chain intelligence system that enables creation of pervasive analytical systems for collaborative planning, monitoring and management of the supply network is described. The SCI system is robust and cloud-based, capable to handle big data analytical tasks. Its flexible and multi-layered architecture enables creation of adaptive supply chain intelligence systems by composing various analytical software components, services and tools. </jats:p>"

As more business is performed via the Internet, e-SCs are becoming an integral part of supply chain management SCM). With business via the Internet requiring different fulfillment approaches, traditional drivers of regular supply chains are no longer adequate for explaining how e-SC performance is driven. The task of SC professionals is more complicated than ever. This situation often leads to unsatisfied customers, which can force companies to close their doors. Therefore, understanding e-SCM performance drivers and their integration with ERP becomes a necessity. Little attention has been devoted to SCM performance driver evaluation. This article discusses the performance drivers of e-SCs and their integration with ERPs. SCM is among the most important factors to organizational success. Effective SCM can enhance competitiveness and increase profitability. Nevertheless, SCM professionals and other actors must understand the factors that undergird driver performance. </jats:p>"

Green supply chain is capable of increasing corporate value while considering its impacts on all processes of physical distribution, production, and environment. Managing a green supply chain is about finding the balance between economic and environmental benefits in global supply chain. GSCM recognizes the disproportionate environmental impact of supply chain processes in an organization. GSCM practices can manifest themselves from the process of selecting raw material to final consumption based on the aspects of reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery. The chapter argues that the multifaceted applications of GSCM have the potential to enhance organizational performance and gain sustainable competitive advantage in global supply chain.</jats:p>"

Business sustainability enables the integration of financial economic sustainability performance and non-financial environmental, social, ethical, and governance sustainability performance dimensions into the corporate culture, supply chain management and business models in creating shared value for all stakeholders. Business literature has provided mixed evidence of the tension, and possible link, between financial and non-financial sustainability performance dimensions and sustainability theories have yet to sufficiently address this tension. This paper attempts to fill this void by shedding light on the link between various dimensions of sustainability performance, their integrated effect on creating shared value for all stakeholders and their implications for supply chain sustainability. This paper examines the synergy between business sustainability and supply chain management by presenting a framework consisting of sustainability theories, sustainability performance dimensions, sustainability shared value concept, and sustainability best practices. Companies can use the suggested framework in integrating both financial and non-financial sustainability initiatives into their supply chain sustainability from production design, purchasing and inbound logistics, and manufacturing process to distribution and outbound logistics.</jats:p>"

Knowing the number of subsystems for water supply and their share of total water production, it is possible to calculate the dimensionless Pielou index. Similarly, the diversification indicators for networked water tanks (number and volume) and pressure pipelines of the second degree pumping station (number and flowability) can be determined. The work presents the calculation of diversification indices for selected CWSS in Poland. The presented methodology gives the possibility of three-parameter evaluation of settlement units with different water demand and different technical structure.</jats:p>"

It is found that both observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity contribute to the observed inter‐temporal persistence of married Australian women's labour supply, but the persistence remains even after controlling for these factors. It is also found that non‐labour income, age, education, health and the number and age of young dependent children have significant effects on married Australian women's labour supply.</jats:p>",

As a result, companies have started to embrace the concept of green supply chain which includes environmental issues rather than the concept of supply chain which is based on profitability. Green supply chain (GSC) has emerged as an important component of the environmental and supply chain strategies. In order to make a supply chain green, it is necessary to consider all activities in the supply chain such as raw material procurement, inbound logistics, transformation, outbound logistics, marketing, after-sales and appropriate product disposal. This paper aims to review different GSCM dimensions in the literature by explaining green supply chain concept and address the activities/practises that can be used to ensure these dimensions are green. </jats:p>"

El objetivo de este trabajo es determinar si estos programas sociales han tenido algún impacto en la jornada laboral de hombres y mujeres pertenecientes a los hogares beneficiarios. Según los enfoques de asignación de tiempo y los roles del hogar basados ​​en el género, se podría esperar un impacto diferente en cada uno de estos dos grupos. En términos econométricos, es bien sabido que las horas trabajadas son el resultado de un proceso de selección de la muestra que podría sesgar estimaciones ordinarias de mínimos cuadrados e incluso estimaciones de efectos fijos (dentro del grupo), que controlan el sesgo de heterogeneidad no observado pero no el sesgo de selección. Usamos el método de Kyriazidou (1997) para estimar un modelo de determinantes de horas trabajadas y encontrar impactos diferenciados por género; el programa de desayunos Qali Warma fomenta la oferta laboral femenina entre los menores de 25 y mayores de 40, mientras que Cuna Más lo hace solo para los menores de 25 años. En el caso de los hombres, el programa de desayunos Qali Warma también parece incrementar las horas trabajadas ( aunque en menor medida que para las mujeres), mientras que la versión de almuerzos escolares del mismo programa reduce las horas trabajadas, especialmente para los hombres mayores de 40 años.</jats:p>"

It will highlight an in-depth review of the 1MSC. The 1MSC concept is derived from the integration between all the key players in the end-to-end supply chain process. This is where the stakeholders have the same goals in ensuring that the end to end process of supply chain is achieved. The 1MSC can be considered as an umbrella that governs the whole supply chain process. The driving force behind the realization of this concept is the strong foundation of its supply chain which integrates different parties as one. This article introduces the concept of National Development Incubator (NDI) where it combines the primary supply chain elements to achieve sustainable business and supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

Many companies engaged in this industry unable to survive in the market. This is contrary to the natural conditions of Indonesia with abundant natural resources and plenty of commodity producers. Problems often arise in the field of supply chain risk which link to commodities in Indonesia, among others: price fluctuation, the scarcity of the commodity, supply and demand are not balanced, distribution and production costs are expensive, raw material commodities that are imported, and natural disasters. Companies which engaged in agricultural business have high risk of survival and not even grow. To overcome this challenges the this chapter intend to review supply chain management concept by look at risk consideration may arise in the business uncertainties. The lack of studies to investigate the risk factors in agribusiness makes this study contribute to the supply chain literature. </jats:p>"

Unfortunately, research that shows the policy gaps in the water supply sector of the country and measures to eliminate them in order to improve water supply sustainability in the country is lacking. This paper investigates the landscape of water service provision to rural communities in Nigeria using investigative and qualitative approaches due to the desire to explore the experience and opinions of previous workers/agencies in the region. Primary and secondary data were used in the study. Findings characterized the rural water supply landscape in the region. The community-based service providers are constrained by several policy gaps that negatively impact on the quality and sustainability of rural water supply in the country. Rural water interventions suffer from a high rate of failures due largely to weak institutional framework in the water supply sector. The paper recommends that for rural water supply sustainability to be improved in Nigeria all the stakeholders must work together to prioritize and address the policy gaps constraining service delivery simultaneously in the region. Working on one factor alone may not result in sustainable services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Este artículo analiza el efecto de los shocks en la oferta de préstamos sobre la actividad económica real de los países de la Alianza del Pacífico. El enfoque econométrico es un VAR de parámetro variable en el tiempo con volatilidad estocástica (TVP-VAR-SV), que se identifica mediante restricciones de signo. Los resultados de una prueba de trazas, pruebas t y la prueba de Kolmogorov-Smirnov revelan la existencia de cambios significativos en la distribución de parámetros a lo largo del tiempo, lo que respalda el uso de parámetros que varían en el tiempo. Los resultados indican que los choques en la oferta crediticia tienen un impacto importante en la actividad económica real en todos los países de la Alianza del Pacífico: alrededor del 1% en Colombia, México y Perú, y alrededor del 0,5% en Chile. Además, las perturbaciones de la oferta crediticia tienen un papel importante en el impulso de las fluctuaciones del ciclo económico, no solo en períodos de crisis, sino también en períodos de estabilidad. Su contribución al crecimiento del PIB es mayor que la de los choques de oferta agregada y tan alta como la de la demanda agregada y los choques de política monetaria. La evolución del impacto de los shocks en la oferta de préstamos sobre la actividad económica real muestra evidencia de heterogeneidad entre países, reflejando diferentes estructuras Önancieras entre los países de la Alianza del Pacífico. Además, al evaluar los efectos sobre diferentes medidas de la actividad económica, se estima que los shocks de oferta crediticia tienen un mayor impacto en la demanda interna, mientras que el impacto es similar cuando el modelo se estima para actividades no primarias. Finalmente, el análisis de sensibilidad indica que los resultados del modelo son robustos a diferentes especificaciones previas, a diferentes medidas de variables externas y a múltiples conjuntos de restricciones de signo. Además, al aplicar una identificación agnóstica, Los resultados indican que incluso dejando que la respuesta del PIB no esté restringida, su respuesta a los choques de la oferta crediticia sigue siendo positiva y significativa. Con esta especificación múltiple, el impacto de los shocks de oferta crediticia sobre el crecimiento del PIB oscila entre 0,8% y 1,2% en Perú y Colombia, y entre 0,5% y 0,8% en Chile. Estos resultados se acercan a la estimación de referencia y muestran solidez. En cuanto a México, se estima que el impacto de los choques de oferta crediticia varía entre 0.8% -3.5%.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability of supply of a given system with the use of warranty analysis, based on the Nevada chart. The reliability analysis performed is done in the following way: shipping and warranty return data of a given supply system are converted into a classic data form. Then, the life data analysis is performed, which allows to obtain the given reliability indicators and predict the future returns of the products and services. The paper consists of some useful reliability measures, that may be used in the assessment of reliability for the supply system. Used reliability indicators may be the basis for the development of the preventive tasks to reduce the future returns. The presented approach for reliability assessment of supply system discloses its applicability. Forecasting the future returns and determining the selected reliability measures may be applied in any supply system. It is valuable for the identification of the weakest product or service and it is necessary for developing further preventive activities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on the reliability of electricity supply at three different locations in Indonesia, namely in Sumatra, Timor, and Papua, through a comparison of reported indices of power reliability (SAIFI and SAIDI) and experimental results from user surveys and power measurements. The reason for this study is the lack of information about the actual, quantified reliability of power supplied by the main grid in Indonesia, while narratives of end-users indicate the reliability might be unsatisfactory. The study was executed using data from 114 randomly-selected respondents in the city of Pekanbaru in Sumatra, 65 in the city of Kupang in Timor and 26 in the city of Jayapura in Papua, totaling 205 respondents. These users experienced a higher unavailability of power delivered by the grid than expressed by the utility-reported SAIDI and SAIFI. Therefore, for this study, new indices are introduced, namely the Perceived (P) SAIDI and SAIFI, which are based on the frequency and duration of blackouts experienced by the users. It is concluded that the reported reliability indices do not always demonstrate the experience of the grid users. P-SAIFIs were 1.3 to 4.6 times higher in Pekanbaru and Kupang, respectively than the utility-reported SAIFIs for the same provinces. Also, P-SAIDIs were 2.6 to 3.9 times higher in Pekanbaru and Kupang, respectively, than the utilities’ SAIDIs. It is therefore not surprising that depending on the location, 14% to 65% of the users own a backup generator and that households are willing to pay $3 to $8 extra per monthly electricity bill or $1c–$3c per kWh for improved reliability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main hydrodynamic characteristics of an Offshore Vessel are mostly referring to motion behaviour in rough sea. For such kind of ships, good seakeeping performances are mandatory, and, besides dynamic positioning quality, maybe more relevant than purely propulsive issues. The seakeeping performances of a ship are strongly influenced by main geometric parameters selected since concept design stage. Means that, to improve the designers' ability to properly select the best preferred design, enhanced methods should be implemented in such a way to accurately determine seakeeping performances as function of the more significant geometrical parameters and non-dimensional ratios. In the present work a procedure, based on the determination of multiple regression models with different parameter combinations, has been developed to reproduce the vertical motions transfer functions of a generic supply vessel at different encounter angles and operational speeds. The regressions have been obtained from 2D strip theory calculations on a family of supply vessels, ensuring a sufficiently accurate estimate of heave and pitch motions since concept design stage. Besides, the transfer functions have been also determined with the application of a trained neural network and the results have been compared with regressions outcomes on a reference hull.</jats:p>"

Two of the research sites overlay the\nhorizontally layered, Silurian dolostone aquifer. The Cambridge site has a metolachlor pesticide plume detected nearly 1 km down-gradient at a municipal supply well 20 years after spills occurred. The Guelph site plume is TCE. The plumes were characterized in detail using high-resolution methods for\nidentifying hydraulically active fractures and variable matrix conditions. The 3-D plume concentration characteristics have been monitored for more than a decade using depth-discrete multilevel systems. The plumes have evolved to nearly stationary position (steady-state) after three decades due to\nthe combined effects of diffusion and sorption in the matrix with dispersion in a dense network of well-connected fractures. Degradation occurs in each of the plumes but is a secondary factor in terms of current plume extents. These research studies show that high resolution monitoring can be used\nto inform site conceptual models and decision-making by municipalities and regulatory agencies to allow these plumes to coexist within or proximal to municipal or private well fields without imposing excessive or arbitrary demands for subsurface source removal (i.e. remediation) or well\nabandonment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability implementation in new housing in Australia lags much of the developed world’s standards and implementation levels for residential sustainability. Various reasons for this are offered via a ‘blame game’ in a sector plagued by lack of demand, prohibitive costs, and poorly implemented existing energy efficiency regulations. Multiple gaps in traditional supply-led procurement theory inhibits sustainability’s implementation in the Australian mass production residential construction system. Once-off consumers are not the key demand actor due to their inability to demand sustainability in a system that limits consumers’ choice and demand. Warren-Myers and Heywood (2016) theorized that the mass-producing Volume Builders are the pivotal demand-side actor in mainstreaming sustainability in the Australian new housing system. This paper investigated the Volume Builders’ roles and relationships with traditional demand-side actors, housing consumers, and the supply-side’s subcontractors and suppliers, to identify the ultimate demand actor that drives the housing industry. The investigation used semi-structured interviews with Volume Builders. The results demonstrated Volume Builders’ dominance of the Australian residential mass production construction industry validating their pivotal role as a demand-side actor in a consumption-based demand and supply model. This identifies Volume Builders as the key actor who could then drive wide-spread adoption of sustainability innovation in Australian mass-produced housing.</jats:p>"

This study examines whether internal integration and external integration impact manufacturing related competitive capability. The findings indicate significant positive effects of internal integration on both supplier and customer integration.

Nowadays, the sustainability of processed products of passion fruit syrup is facing an increasingly competitive market. It is therefore necessary to measure the performance of a superior supply chain supported by the procurement of raw materials that are managed effectively and efficiently. Supply chain performance is an indicator of the success of agroindustry companies in running their business processes. Performance measurement of agroindustry supply chain is needed to control and to determine the performance position of agroindustry produced. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the conditions of the supply chain of passion fruit syrup agroindustry and to measure the supply chain performance of passion fruit syrup agroindustry in North Sumatra Province. The method for analyzing the conditions of the supply chain of passion fruit syrup agroindustry used a long-term relationship approach. To measure the performance of the agro-industry supply chain, the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) and AHP approach were used. The results showed that the supply chain performance of passion fruit syrup agroindustry in North Sumatra Province was 76.90% and categorized medium indicating that coordination among actors in the supply chain has not been well established</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changes in sediment supply and caliber during the last ~130 ka have resulted in a complex architectural evolution of the Y channel system on the western Niger Delta slope. This evolution consists of four phases, each with documented or inferred changes in sediment supply. Phase 1 flows created wide (1,000 m), low-sinuosity (1.1) channel forms with lateral migration and little to no aggradation. During Phase 2, the Y channel system began to aggrade, creating more narrow (300 m) and sinuous (1.4) channel forms with many meander cutoffs. This system was abandoned at ~ 130 ka, perhaps related to rapid relative sea-level rise during MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 5. Phase 3 flows were mud-rich and deposited sediment on the outer bends of the channel form, resulting in the narrowing (to 250 m), straightening (to a sinuosity of 1.22), and aggradation of the Y channel system. Renewed influx of sand into the Y channel system occurred with Phase 4 at ~ 50 ka, during MIS 3 sea-level fall. The onset of Phase 4 is marked by the initiation of the Y′ tributary channel, which re-established sand deposition in the Y channel system. Flows entering the Y channel from the Y′ channel were underfit, resulting in inner levee deposition that is most prevalent on outer banks, acting to further straighten (1.21) and narrow (to 200 m wide) the Y channel. The inner levees accumulated quickly as the flows sought equilibrium, with deposition rates &amp;gt; 200 cm/ky. Marked by the presence of the last sand bed, abandonment occurred at ~19 ka in the Y channel and ~15 ka in the Y′ channel and is likely related to progressive abandonment due to shelf-edge delta avulsion and/or progressive sea level rise associated with Melt Water Pulse 1-A. The muddy, 5-meter-thick Holocene layer has thickness variations that mimic those seen in the sandy part of Phase 4, suggesting that dilute, muddy flows continue to affect the modern Y channel system. This unique dataset allows us to unequivocally link changes in submarine channel architecture to variations in sediment supply and caliber. Changes in the updip sediment routing system (i.e. the channel “plumbing”) are shown to have profound implications for submarine channel architecture and reservoir connectivity.</jats:p>"

National supply policy is formulated and implemented for the regular supply of necessary goods and services in the country. Effective implementation of the policy depends on its structure as well as on the external factors from the prevailing situation in the country. In the present article an attempt has been made to highlight the basic features of the current national supply policy of Nepal and discuss the issues related with its effective implementation. Despite several elements proposed in the policy only few have the result oriented features. Many of the elements are ambitious as well as vague. Imperfection in policy implementation witnessed during the suddenly arrived difficulties as well as at the normal time. From the discussion it has been concluded that the policy has weaknesses in its structure, basically in maintenance of hierarchy of objectives and has been facing several unsolved practical issues. Economic Journal of Development Issues Vol. 23&amp;24 No. 1-2, (2017) Combined Issue, Page : 123-136 </jats:p>"

However, the desire for such practices is governed by external and/or internal factors. The challenge, therefore, for supply chain and operations managers is to design and develop an operations strategy that ensures the firms investments in such ‘green' initiatives. We develop a theoretical framework for resource allocation strategies for sustainable manufacturing operations that can be characterized as speculative, responsible, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation. This can aid managers in characterizing and controlling the firm's underlying operational processes and guide resource allocation decisions at strategic level.</jats:p>"

Successful SCM can provide the high level of business planning and decision support concerning supply chain-related activities that involve the coordination of organization-wide distribution processes, the sharing of information, and the integration of information. Information sharing and information integration through effective IS can significantly improve the way supply chains and their supply chain partners do business, especially in the perspectives of globalization and outsourcing, toward continuing to have an accomplished effect on supply chain operations. The chapter argues that advocating IS, information integration, and information sharing has the potential to increase supply chain performance and gain sustainable competitive advantage in global supply chain. </jats:p>"

The aim of this chapter is to provide researchers, business practitioners and university students a picture of the architecture of supply networks. By analyzing two main trends of studies in the field of supply network management, components of supply network are classified into structural and infrastructural factors. Also a comparison is made to identify the difference between supply network and traditionally factory-based manufacturing system. Based on the literature review, a conceptual framework is further proposed which describes the supply network from four essential perspectives: Role/function, Relationship/alliance, Configuration/reconfiguration, and Risk and crisis management. After presenting detailed models and decision making areas of each perspective, suggestions are given on some emerging topics.</jats:p>"

In order to mitigate the risks, a comprehensive security measures must be undertaken in the areas of technology, organization, governance, and culture, and integrate them into the company's established risk management processes. To ensure a resilient CSC, all members of the supply chain network must play a role to protect their respective systems from potential breach. </jats:p>"

We can make decisive steps towards sustainability in the fields of logistics services by improvement of logistics processes and/or application of new environment-friendly technologies. These steps are very important for companies because they have a significant effect on competitiveness. Nowadays significant changes are taking place in applied methods and technologies in the fields of logistics services as part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Most companies are not able to keep pace with these changes in addition to carrying out their main activities by using own resources; consequently, in many cases logistics services are outsourced in the interest of maintaining or increasing competitiveness. The currently applied outsourcing examination process contains numerous shortcomings. We have elaborated a new business model to eliminate these shortcomings, namely the basic concept for an outsourcing investigation system integrated in the electronic marketplace. The paper introduces the current process of logistics service outsourcing examination and the elaborated business model concept.</jats:p>"

Available information on Glu supply and metabolism was reviewed, based on an electronic literature search. In 22 cross-sectional global studies with 4,747 women, free Glu increases with lactation duration and contributes to about 38% of total and 63% of dispensable milk AA. Based on these data, a typical breastfed infant obtains a mean free Glu intake of 35.7 mg/kg body weight (bw; upper end of the normal range 134.6 mg/kg), while precisely collected longitudinal data indicate mean intakes of 40 mg/kg and upper range intakes of 70.2 mg/kg. Mean intakes with cows’ milk formula at median concentrations are 0.7 mg/kg (upper range 1.0 mg/kg) and with extensive protein hydrolysate formula 171.7 mg/kg bw (upper range 249.8 mg/kg bw), with no indication of untoward effects. Infants almost entirely utilize dietary Glu in splanchnic organs, with no appreciable effect on plasma Glu concentrations. Estimated free Glu intakes in breastfed infants are up to 4.5-fold higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) set by the European Food Safety Authority for the total population including infants, and the respective intakes of infants fed a formula based on an extensive protein hydrolysate are up to 8.3-fold higher. There is no reason to assume that feeding human milk or an extensive protein hydrolysate infant formula would be unsuitable or unsafe for infants. Setting an ADI below the range of the normal intake with a safe diet in generally healthy individuals, that is, below 250 mg/kg per day, seems inappropriate.</jats:p>"

Customer awareness has urged the manufacturers and suppliers to produce and supply more environmental friendly product. Social responsibility is the firms' obligations to ensure that their operation activities could reduce environmental impacts which can be harmful to the society. Environmental concern is the awareness on environmental preservation and conservation. Governmental legislation has been implemented to ensure the firms adhere to the government policies as to attain greener industrial practices. Waste management refers to the waste disposal system in order to reduce waste treatment costs, pollution and landfill issues. Therefore, the drivers are important elements in carrying out the closed loop supply chain in the Malaysian automotive industry. </jats:p>"

Increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall events is likely to increase the risk of flooding in rivers. The West Rapti River basin is one of the most flood prone and also one of the most dynamic and economically important basins of Nepal. This study elicits the willingness to pay (WTP) from the local people in the basin to reduce risks from possible floods due to CC. The WTP for flood mitigation in different flood hazard zones and flood scenarios were determined using referendum method and a face to face questionnaire survey. From a total of 720 households across all flood zones, a stratified randomly selected sample of 210 households was surveyed. The sample included households from a range of socio-economic backgrounds. The average WTP varied by flood hazard zone and within each zone, by CC-induced flood scenarios. The average WTP of respondents was highest for the critical flood prone zone, followed by moderate and low flood prone zones. Similarly, within each zone, the average WTP increased with increasing flood magnitudes due to CC. The variation of average WTP of respondents in different flood prone zones and scenarios indicate different levels of perceived severity. Moreover, the introduction of the concept of ‘man-day’ or ‘labour-day’ in WTP research is a novel and applicable methodological approach, particularly in the South Asian region. The findings of this study are useful for policy implications for the design of participatory flood management plans in the river basin.</jats:p>",

Rather than taking transport modelling frameworks as a starting point, as has been the case in the literature so far, we depart from a framework of logistics decisions. The framework is developed by combining elements of over a dozen existing frameworks from the supply chain management literature. Based on this comprehensive framework, we review freight modelling approaches from the literature. We find that freight modelling can be extended by taking into account previously uncovered areas of logistics decisions, such as those related to marketing or logistics systems forecasting and planning, as well as in areas that are well known from an optimization perspective but not from a descriptive perspective, such as routing and scheduling decisions. We conclude with a systematic listing of such areas, which can be used by researchers and transport modelling practitioners to develop further those transport models that take agent decision making as a starting point.</jats:p>"

Consequently, businesses, communities, and governments have been environmentally conscious and shown growing concern for sustainable development, particularly following the establishment of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). This chapter provides further insights into sustainability and supply chain research through adopting a stakeholder perspective to understand drivers and consequences of supply chain sustainability in the United Arab Emirates. The results indicate that pressures enforced by champions and customers are positively related to supply chain sustainability. However, the relationship between government pressures and supply chain sustainability is insignificant. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the impact of supply chain sustainability on the organizational sustainable performance is significantly positive. Supply managers can learn from these results in developing sustainable initiatives earlier along their supply chain through selecting and evaluating suppliers based on sustainability-related standards. In addition, environmental collaboration with customers and suppliers based on knowledge sharing and application may identify and reduce the total environmental impact. </jats:p>"

In web-based global business arena witnessing Industry 4.0, collaboration across SC partners has to be smart, innovative and socially responsible to form value-creating networks. After exploring various concepts related with SC collaboration, this chapter proposes a conceptual maturity model for SC collaboration in increasing levels of integrity and collaboration scope. The model is unique in: establishing a standardized conceptual base; providing a systematic, process-oriented holistic view for multi-partner SC maturity; offering precise mapping of SC processes onto stages with full process coverage; extending CPFR model; defining maturity stages for advanced, strategic collaboration types (like collaborative performance and risk management, collaborative systems assurance and development, collaborative innovation); explicitly incorporating smartness, innovation and social responsibility concepts; and treating relatively recent terminology such as “virtual networks” and “coalescence”.</jats:p>"

Widespread interest in the implementation of this concept determines the environmental activities which are undertaken by companies. For this reason, more and more organizations are interested in the introduction of an environmental management system (based on the requirements of the ISO 14000 family of standards). The involvement of companies in the implementation of the concept of sustainable development is also reflected in the propagation of this idea among business partners in the supply chain. Undertaking activities mitigating the negative impact on the environment is considered by many organizations an important criterion in the initial and periodic assessment of suppliers. Many companies, while working on developing of a strong and positive brand image among their customers, use environmental labels when promoting their products. In recent years, more and more companies implement the material flow cost accounting concept which takes into consideration the relationships in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Obviously, if realizing that there is the disruption risk, the members in a supply chain will adjust their decisions. For analyzing the influence, we consider a popular supply chain mode with dual channels, where one manufacturer has its direct sales channel and one traditional retailer channel. The manufacturer may suffer a supply disruption so that all ordered products by the retailer or the direct retail channel will be lost, and the members in supply chain will bear the corresponding disruption penalty from the customers. By considering four structures with different market power relations, the closed-form optimal price decisions of the four models are given. We found that the disruption factor improves the sales prices for any member structure as compared to the supply chain without the disruption. And the direct retail prices in the different modes are the same as each other, but the price of the traditional channel is influenced by the market share. And the sorts of the sales prices under different structures are given. We also conduct some extensive numerical analysis and compare the results under different structures. We observe that the expected optimal profits of considering the external penalty are smaller than those of no external penalty, and we give a sort of the optimal expected profits. And we also provide the effects of some parameters on the optimal decisions and the optimal expected profits.</jats:p>"

However, with increased global environmental and social concerns, in recent years, green aspects have been incorporated in supply chain decisions. These expansions lead to new research areas about green or sustainable supply chain management that includes applying various green practices in order to reduce negative impact on the environment or providing sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining network design of the green supply chains. In multi-objective frame of the proposed model, total profit maximization and environmental impact minimization objectives are considered in order to obtain best network configuration for economic and environmental performance of the green chain. The proposed model is validated with numerical experiments. Obtained results showed that the model can be used as a strategic decision tool in problems with multi and conflicting objectives.&#x0D;\nKeywords: green supply chain management, multi-objective modelling, network optimization.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) is an event-oriented GS1 standard that aims to enable tracking and tracing of products through the sharing of event-based datasets that encapsulate the Electronic Product Code (EPC). In this paper, the authors propose a framework that utilises events and EPCs in the generation of “linked pedigrees” - linked datasets that enable the sharing of traceability information about products as they move along the supply chain. The authors exploit two ontology based information models, EEM and CBVVocab within a distributed and decentralised framework that consumes real time EPCIS events as linked data to generate the linked pedigrees. The authors exemplify the usage of linked pedigrees within the fresh fruit and vegetables supply chain in the agri-food sector. </jats:p>"

E-tailers today are following many practices to handle these returns but the ‘predictability' factor is still missing from their approaches. This paper tries to fulfill that void. The framework suggested in this paper will help the E-tailers to predict the probability of a particular item being returned by a particular shopper.

Discrete event simulation allows complex supply chain models to be mapped in a straightforward manner to study supply chain dynamics, test alternative strategies, communicate findings and facilitate understanding of various stakeholders. The presented analyses confirm that discrete event simulation is well-suited for analyzing interconnected wood supply chain transportation issues on an operational and tactical level. Transport is the connective link between interrelated system components of the forest products industry. Therefore, a survey on transport logistics allows to analyze the significance of entire supply chain management considerations to improve the overall performance and not only one part in isolation. Thus far, research focuses mainly on biomass, unimodal truck transport and terminal operations. Common shortcomings identified include rough explanations of simulation models and sparse details provided about the verification and validation processes. Research gaps exist concerning simulations of entire, resilient and multimodal wood supply chains as well as supply and demand risks. Further studies should expand upon the few initial attempts to combine various simulation methods with optimization.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold><jats:sc>Abstract. </jats:sc></jats:bold>The demand for various products in the chicken processing industry necessitates several weight ranges of chicken supplies. Moreover, each chicken flock inevitably exhibits its own weight distribution owing to biological variations, seasonality, and random factors related to weather, pests, and other biological hazards. Therefore, in order to promote cost-effectiveness, a company requires guideline policies for average chicken size, based on production demand and chicken weight supply. In this study, we propose the use of simulation optimization to determine a mean chicken weight and chicken supply quantity by considering order frequency and volume. Empirical data from a studied company are used to illustrate the proposed framework. This article contributes to an improved understanding of the concept of chicken order and supply distribution and its effects on chicken processor profitability. Adopting a policy for appropriate chicken size and supply will benefit both the chicken processor and farmers. Likewise, the proposed concept of simulation optimization offers the potential to facilitate such a decision and yield cost-saving benefits to the chain.

The state and development of transport and logistics systems of the territories is inextricably linked with the investment climate and social and economic development, since it affects the mobility and dynamism of social and economic processes, forms additional advantages for the development of all types of business. That is why the study of the level of infrastructure provision of the transport and logistics system of the regions of Ukraine remains an important issue in modern conditions.\nPurpose. The article aims to develop the methodical tools for assessing the proportionality of the infrastructure provision of transport and logistics activities in the regions and the efficiency of the use of existing infrastructure objects.\nResults. The article deals with the essence and systematization of the main components of the transport and logistics infrastructure of the region. Under the infrastructure of transport and logistics activity of the region, it is proposed to understand the complex system of technical, organizational, economic, and informational and communication support for the implementation of transport and logistics services, which are concentrated in this region. The methodical approaches to carrying out of complex estimation of the infrastructure provision of the regions' development have been explored. The methodical approaches and analytical tools for estimating the imbalances of infrastructure provision and the efficiency of transport and logistics systems functioning in the regions are based on the calculation of the system of comparative indicators and parameters of transport and logistics activity in the regions and take into account the peculiarities of their geographical location and the corresponding competitive advantages (technical, organizational, financial, informational and specific).\nConclusions. The effectiveness of the development of strategic plans and programs for the development of transport and logistics infrastructure at both the national and regional levels requires a systematic picture of the state of the infrastructure in certain regions and the weaknesses in which major efforts should be directed to overcoming. In this context, the use of the author's methodological toolkit can be useful in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the regions, their clustering, and identifying the priority tasks of optimizing the transport and logistics system in the design process of transport sector plans and programs.</jats:p>"

The analysis of heat deficit indicators allows us to adopt a decision on the placement of additional control units to improve the regime controllability. The approach to the task of placing intermediate stages of regulation based on the construction of path matrices from final consumers in the direction of the reverse flow of the coolant is given. The model is implemented in the information-computational complex (ICC) “ANGARA-TS” for the calculation of the HHR of HPS, which is developed in the Melentiev Energy Systems of SB RAS.</jats:p>"

This review provides an overview about the history of ANNs and their applications and shortcomings in the drinking water sector. From the papers reviewed, it was found that ANNs might be useful modelling tools due to their successful application in areas such as pipes/infrastructure, membrane filtration, coagulation dosage, disinfection residuals, water quality, etc. The most popular ANNs applied were feed-forward networks, especially Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs). It was also noted that over the past decade (2006–2016), ANNs have been increasingly applied in the drinking water sector. This, however, is not the case for South Africa where the application of ANNs in distribution systems is little to non-existent. Future research should be directed towards the application of ANNs in South African distribution systems and to develop these models into decision-making tools that water purification facilities could implement.</jats:p>",

The ways of acceleration of working capital turnover at the stages of supply, production and marketing of goods and services have been identified. The necessity of applying the concept of supply chain management to working capital management has been justified. This allowed defining the management principles in the supply chain of an industrial enterprise. As a result, a method for optimization of enterprise current assets of an industrial enterprise as a central element of a supply chain has been offered. It has been proved that the presented method makes it possible to determine the effect of working capital acceleration both in the material and financial subsystems. A tool for realisation of this effect is the structuring of working capital by title deeds.</jats:p>"

The supply chain management is described qualitatively using supply chain basic model supported by integrated concepts of supply chain relationship, supply chain configuration, and supply chain coordination. The result of the study reveals that the supply chain management in coffee commodities includes suppliers, gatherers/manufacturers, exporters, and consumers. The distributors play the main role in determining product standards. The relationships between each of supply chain elements have been well established, utilized to distribute the products, and used as a feedback medium if there is a change in quality standards required in accordance with the needs of consumers. To ensure the sustainability of business activities in the supply chain, mutual commitment among the supply chain elements is required especially when it comes to determining the product quality standards and quantity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the first steps in water distribution systems (WDSs) design process is the pipeline routing, defined as geometrical projection of a designed network. The analogical step can also be found in designing of other elements of technical infrastructure, such as energy lines or roads. Moreover, the pipeline routing process influences pipe’s sizing and determinates investment, exploitation and maintenance aspects of the whole WDS. Despite its significant meaning, the routing process is still unsatisfactorily supported by mathematical methods and computer aided tools. Therefore, there are continuous researches of more effective pipeline routing and sizing methods. This paper presents a literature review about currently developed methods of network routing and methods of optimal pipeline sizing.</jats:p>"

The authors present sustainability issues in warehouses within three levels: macro, meso, and micro. In the macro level, they review the effect of warehouse location and construction on sustainability. In the meso level, they discuss how to deal with warehouse layout problem, the effects of aisle, and material handling equipment choices on sustainability. Last, they briefly present what warehouse managers can do for sustainable warehousing in a short amount of time. Hence, the authors aim to provide a holistic approach to make warehouses sustainable. Last but not the least, they also present supportive and strengthening theoretical and practical studies to resolve barriers in front of sustainable warehousing.</jats:p>"

The complementary aims are: a) to identify the topic set studied and to propose a criterion for classifying the literature, and b) to discuss the empirical evidence that identifies existing interrelationships. The analysis has enabled three main topics to be identified: a) adoption and implementation of lean management, b) development of supply chain management, and c) deployment of lean principles and practices across the supply chain. A number of more specific lines of research are also proposed that have been assigned to each of these three main research topics. Finally, a set of challenges and opportunities for future research are set out, along with a range of academic and professional implications that could be useful not only for the aerospace sector but also for other industrial sectors that share similar contingent factors. </jats:p>"

During the preparation for this publication, the main focus was put on finding the answer to the question whether we are able to observe these changes, define them and assess them. The correct identification and definition of the area of changes is only half of the success.

The coagulants used in the study were aluminium sulphate and pre-hydrolyzed polyaluminium chlorides PAX. Powdered activated carbons with trade names AKPA and CWZ were used for the enhancement of coagulation. Lowering the total organic carbon (TOC) content in water after the coagulation was in the range of 15–45%, and the oxygen consumption in the range of 27–63%, depending on the used coagulant. The largest reduction in values of those indicators were stated using PAX. In the surface water subjected to chlorination, presence of CHCl3 and CHCl2Br was demonstrated, and CHBr3 and CHClBr2 were not detected. CHCl3 and CHCl2Br concentration was equal to 65.3 and 7.4 μg/L, respectively. In the water subjected to chlorination after the coagulation process and after the process of coagulation enhanced with powdered activated carbon, CHCl3 concentration ranged from 55.8 to 39.8 μg/L, while CHCl2Br ranged from 7.8 to 9.0 μg/L. These were values by 13–35% lower than trihalomethane (THM) concentration obtained in untreated surface water subjected to chlorination. The lowest CHCl3 concentration were obtained in chlorinated water after prior purification with PAX-XL19 and powdered activated carbon CWZ.</jats:p>",

It was realized that the level of supplying drinking water to population and the efficiency of water supply systems do not fully meet the requirements. The quality of drinking water and sources of water supply in some regions do not meet the standard requirements. As a result, the recommendations on modernization, increasing the efficiency of water supply systems and improving drinking water use conditions were developed in the Republic.</jats:p>"

In Americas (ranked second globally in terms of natural disasters) between 2007 and 2016, disasters caused 255,033 deaths, 898,816 injuries and damages worth $470 billion (Disasters, 2017). In 2016 alone, natural disasters caused $175 billion in damage with 8,700 lives (Munich RE, 2017). The above numbers reflect the amount of physical destruction only but do not include indirect losses such as unemployment, environmental consequences, and business disruptions. Therefore, the full impact of these catastrophic events is much greater than these numbers suggest. Response to and management of disaster relief supply chain is different from that of commercial supply chain/logistics in many aspects. Since humanitarian relief efforts depend to a large extent on international donors and the donors usually respond well to emergency, a well thought out long term strategic plan to relive human suffering is not well established. But studies indicate that investment in the planning stage of humanitarian supply chain is much more effective and saves many lives than spending on the operation side of relief efforts.\\r This paper explores alternative ways to respond and manage humanitarian relief efforts utilizing the principles of commercial supply chain. More specifically, this paper addresses/outlines the process to improve relief outcomes by investing in the prepared stage of humanitarian supply chain.</jats:p>"

Collaborative regulation for improved supply chain resilience is the coordinated, consistent, and strategic activities that includes: effective, as well as regular coordination and interactions; knowledge and information sharing, verification, and periodical monitoring, as well as enforcement of collaborative approaches to policy and regulatory control mechanisms via coercive force of isomorphism. The arguments put forward, contribute to improving knowledge, by specifying the conditions in which supply chain resilience is stronger in highly regulated contexts.

It was established that the planning of the organization of ensuring environmental safety at sports facilities should take into account the main provisions of the concept of the system for ensuring the environmental safety of sports activities: methodological approaches, organizational principles, basic functions. This should take into account the conceptual provisions of environmental risk management: zoning areas used for sports activities according to the degree of environmental risk (acceptable, moderate, elevated, high); acceptance of the limits of acceptable risk (fully acceptable, partially acceptable, completely unacceptable); regular monitoring of environmental hazards with a forecast of their occurrence; environmental education for those involved in sports activities; development of economic and social measures to prevent the negative impact of environmental hazards in the field of sports; health promotion athletes. The plan for the organization of environmental safety in a sports facility should consist of the following main areas of activities: organizational; operational; repair and reconstruction; environmental protection; legal; educational and financial. Conclusions. Planning the organization of ensuring environmental safety at sports facilities should take into account the main provisions of the concept of the system for ensuring the environmental safety of sports activities: methodological approaches, organizational principles, basic functions, conceptual approaches to environmental risk management. In order to draw up a plan for ensuring the organization of environmental safety at a sports facility, it is first necessary to collect and analyze environmental information in the direction of environmental safety. The plan for the organization of environmental safety in a sports facility should contain the following main sections: organizational and planning measures; operational activities; measures for the construction, repair and reconstruction of environmental facilities; legal measures on environmental safety issues; environmental education and training, financial support for the organization of environmental safety; regulatory standard maintenance of environmental safety.</jats:p>"

The latter is normally fed at 60 Hz, so a frequency conversion is needed. Power can be taken from the public power grid available on shore. In order to reduce the environmental impact, this power system can be integrated with local, distributed generators that produce energy from renewable sources. Energy storage can also be added in order to smooth power peak demand and production from not programmable generators. The paper shows a system built around an Energy Box that manages the duty of all the power sources in parallel and provides the frequency conversion. A parallel on dc or ac side is considered, according to the power installed in a wide range from few MW up to 20 MW. The Energy Box is controlled by its own Power Management System in order to get a strong reduction of emissions, lower energy cost along with the best efficiency. An example of this technology is also shown.</jats:p>"

This study empirically validates the effects of the three critical constructs on overall supply chain risk exposure. The limitations of this study can be seen in the use of perceptual data from single informants and the focus on automotive firms in a single country. The detailed operationalization of the constructs sheds further light on the major risk sources, drivers, and mitigation strategies in supply chain networks. Clear evidence of proactive strategies in mitigating risks provides managers with a business case to invest in such initiatives.</jats:p>"

However, this disruption was not in isolation and coincided with substitutional interactions with the electricity market already dealing with transition.\nThis report develops context for the natural gas market, establishes the four major avenues of markets and then investigates eight fundamental supply and demand dynamics that are influencing the market in an interconnected fashion. The report concludes that all participants of the gas market must address the multiple dynamic drivers including economic consideration, government policy and regulatory engagement to avoid disorderly market transition.\n</jats:p>"

Losses cause not only additional operating costs but also generate negative social and ecological consequences. Water losses may have multiple possible reasons, differing in accordance to a water supply system. Therefore, there is a high need to individually analyze each water supply distribution system. The aim of this paper is to analyze and compare water losses in selected two group water supply systems, serving 5 000–10 000 consumers. Water balances, pursued in accordance to the methodology developed by IWA (International Water Association), enabled calculation of water losses indicators for both systems. The obtained results lead to evaluation of the condition of analyzed water supply systems and they suggest potential actions in order to minimize water losses. Moreover, the results indicate the great necessity for working out a reliable method for determination of unavoidable annual real losses in rural water distribution systems with no more than 20 connections per km.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Streszczenie</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Straty wody występują we wszystkich systemach dystrybucyjnych przez cały okres ich eksploatacji. Pociągają za sobą przede wszystkim dodatkowe koszty, ale wiążą się z nimi również negatywne skutki społeczne czy ekologiczne. Straty wody mogą wynikać z wielu przyczyn, których znaczenie jest inne w różnych systemach wodociągowych. Zachodzi więc potrzeba wnikliwej indywidualnej analizy pracy konkretnych sieci dystrybucyjnych. Celem niniejszego artykułu jest analiza i porównanie strat wody w dwóch wybranych gminnych wodociągach grupowych, obsługujących 5 000–10 000 odbiorców. W ramach badań sporządzono bilanse wody według metodyki zaproponowanej przez IWA (International Water Association) oraz wyznaczono wskaźniki strat wody. Uzyskane wyniki obliczeń nie tylko pozwoliły ocenić stan sieci oraz zaproponować podjęcie czynności zmierzających do zmniejszenia strat wody w systemie, ale również wykazały potrzebę opracowania miarodajnej metody wyznaczania strat nieuniknionych w wiejskich wodociągach, o gęstości przyłączy nieprzekraczającej 20 szt./km.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The design of the experiment was a split block with four replications. Main blokes contained full and stress irrigation water regimes while the sub mains comprised six plant densities of sunflower cultivar (Helianthus annuus L.). Results revealed that decreasing irrigation water regime to 65% of field capacity (FC) reduced daily and seasonal water supplies, yield, yield attributes and oil content of sunflower crop but increased water productivity. Increasing plant density reduced head diameter, seeds yield/plant and seed index. Combination of 50 cm row spacing with 15 cm inter row spacing under 100% FC and 60 cm row spacing with 15 cm inter row spacing under 65% FC produced the highest significant seeds yield and water productivity. In these combinations, using full irrigation requirement increased seeds yield by about 10% compared with the stressed one. However, the stress combination increased water productivity by about 38% compared with fully irrigation combination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) acquisition strategy is evolving from a technology/platform-based to a capability-based. Many of the ADF's legacy platforms were purchased &amp;lsquo;out-right&amp;rsquo; where the procurement included the technology/platform itself and an initial delivery of some support systems such as simulators, training devices, technical publications, design documentation and spare parts. This technology/platform-based acquisition approach gave the ADF the flexibility to contract sustainment activities but at the same time took on full responsibility of asset performance. A capability-based acquisition approach on the other hand limits the ADF's ability to independently manage sustainment activities but draws on expertise that are otherwise not available to ADF. The aim of this study is to evaluate the supply chain risks that the ADF faces as a result of adopting new capability-based platform acquisitions that are delivered with their own &amp;lsquo;specialised logistic support systems that integrate into bespoke global supply chains&amp;rsquo;. The research identified 15 supply chain risks. Local suppliers to ADF were surveyed to analyse and evaluate the risks. Most risks were found to be a medium to high levels and prompt attention to mitigate these risks would be required for both the ADF and industry partners urgently.</jats:p>"

Retail management focuses on the processes that go into ensuring consumers can obtain the products they want from their chosen retail store. Effective retail management helps company distributes the finished products created by the business to consumers in order to determine and satisfy what buyers want and require. E-tailing is a powerful marketing technique for the right product with the right message to the right person.

The review highlights that despite there is a growing research trend on the topic, different research gaps remain to be covered. These gaps concern the factors influencing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives, the classification of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives, the impact of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability on supply chain performance, the customer perspective in sustainable and energy-efficient supply chain, and the different technologies supporting the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives. The research gaps and the research questions identified offer the opportunity to identify areas of investigation to design future research directions and propose guidelines in the field of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

The lenses and the mirror were proposed to be attached to a basin-type single-slope active solar still because of their concentration effect for sunlight. After 24-hour performance monitoring, a higher yield was observed in the new style of solar still as compared with the conventional single-slope still. The lenses refract and aggregate the sunlight from three side walls, and one mirror set on the back of the evaporator can avoid sunlight loss. Model-3 with three lenses produced about a 21.03% yield increment, and an extra 8.77% yield was observed by adding one mirror in Model-4. The yield of the proposed solar still could reach the maximum freshwater production through Model-4 (adding three lenses and one mirror) of 0.8 kg/m2.d on 1/8/2016. Compared with the traditional still, there was a 29.8% increment in yield through Model-4 at 0.15 m water depth, and the production reached its peak at about 16:00.</jats:p>",

We summarize the approach of U.K. retailers to allergen risk assessment (RA) and risk management (RM) within the U.K. legal framework and explore public visibility of retailers’ allergen policies. RA and RM of allergens appear effective in curtailing retail-triggered severe food allergy reactions. However, allergen recalls remain high, precautionary allergen labeling (PAL) remains an area of confusion, and there is no consistent Web-based provision of information for consumers who have allergies. Resolution of PAL awaits an agreed-on threshold framework, but a key challenge is to engage with patients and gain their trust rather than thrust education at them. It would be helpful for retailers to publish their allergen RA and RM policies. A target should be agreed on between government and retailers for a reduction in the proliferation of PAL wording variants by a given date within the next 3 years. A further hurdle is potentially flawed allergen analysis—development of reference methods and reference materials are acknowledged needs. Laboratories should report allergen results in an informative manner, communicating uncertainty and caveats. Ideally a laboratory representative would be included on any incident control team. Efforts must continue to standardize preparedness for protecting and defending food and drink from deliberate attack.</jats:p>",

Since the early years of the nineteenth century, the issue of water supply had been examined by numerous Commissions and Committees, but they had failed to recommend any course of action leading to a comprehensive scheme. At the first Congress, in May 1878, twenty-four contributions were received in response to a call for views on how a national scheme might be implemented. It was agreed that a lack of information, was holding back action and a resolution was passed asking Government to establish a Commission to collect data on such things as rainfall, underground water and river flows. At a second Conference, in May the following year, the Society offered medals for dividing England and Wales into Water Supply Districts, receiving twelve submissions of which two were awarded silver medals. The submission of Frederick Toplis proposed a structure remarkably similar to that eventually adopted, almost 100 years later, in 1973. There had been no response to the resolution of the previous year, which was again supported without success. A third Conference, in July 1884, went over much of the ground covered previously. The three meetings were successful in that they brought together engineers, scientists and politicians, in a neutral environment, to discuss the ‘water question’, although disagreements between water engineers and geologists over the amount of underground water available were not resolved. They were unsuccessful in initiating Government action; the collection of rainfall data was not taken over by a Government Department until 1919, and it was not until 1935 that the systematic collection of data on both surface and groundwaters finally began.</jats:p>",

Major problems arise from mismanagement of water usage, such as the lack of proper upkeep practices and maintenance of plumbing fixtures in public buildings. The aim of this study is to analyze the existence of possible statistical correlations between water consumption data and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures in public administrative buildings. Ten public buildings were visited in Brazil while performing this research, in order to determine the per capita water consumption, flow rates, and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures. Flow rate data were obtained through field measurements by the gravimetric method and compared with the values set by Brazilian standards and environmental certifications. Consumption indicators were calculated, which showed variation from 16.6 to 69.3 L/user/day. The performed statistical analysis pointed out that there was significant correlation with variables related to construction and operating conditions of plumbing fixtures, such as the number of installed devices, number of leaks and defects found, in addition to devices with flow rate noncompliant to limits established by current legislation.</jats:p>",

These e-retailers offer a wide selection of customized services and so need an efficient management on every level and process.\nThe goal of the research was to explore a concrete approach to improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs and risks and to maintain the benefits of e-retailers and of its collaborators.\nOur contribution is a decision support system and a tool to improve operational resources allocation in B2C supply chains. Hence, we started by modeling operations and the different scenarios. Then we introduced an optimization model founded on the analysis of resource allocation in B2C supply chains and applicable on any B2C e-retailer. It helps in choosing the most optimal resources for each order. The model is based on a multi-objective optimization approach that takes into consideration the collaboration of resources throughout the supply chain operations process including dynamic costs and collaborator capabilities as well as associated risks and the quality of delivered services.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve this scale of transformation the sector recognises the need to explore and implement new ways of planning, managing and delivering construction projects. Collaborative planning in addition to using strategies such as those used in manufacturing industries are amongst the key enablers in increasing efficiency in construction. Transformation on such a scale also requires different supply chain and procurement frameworks. This paper provides insight into a supply chain simulation tool which has been designed to enable the construction industry to analyse, assess and compare the key performance indicators of different supply chain configurations. The supply chain simulation tool provides construction collaboration entities with the capability to explore the alternative scenarios, understand the associated implications of risk and uncertainty and then agree a solution for a project earlier than traditional approaches.</jats:p>"

A still-turbulent economy, new selling channels, advanced digital technologies, and increasingly demanding consumers all challenge retailers to find new ways of remaining relevant and competitive. The purchasing decision journey for consumers involves multiple steps, many of which are now being captured, digitized, and transformed into metrics and data. As this data becomes an implied derivative of essential retail and consumer technologies, the focus is shifting from how to acquire the data to how to extract insights from it— insights that can be turned into differentiation and competitive advantage for the retailer and a better shopper experience for the consumer. </jats:p>"

Computer simulations also offer a wide range of possibilities in the aspect of optimization of the district heating operation as well as prediction and analysis of network failure effects [3-6]. The paper concerns the simulation of a district heating network. The methods for the simulation of heating networks were characterized and simulations of district heating system were carried out. The effects of the failure were analysed at different values of outside temperatures and for different durations of failure. The value of compensation for undelivered heat was also determined. Simulations were carried out for an actual district heating system located in Rzeszow.</jats:p>"

For achieving success in the dairy supply chain, it is needed to focus on critical factors (CFs) that are necessary for an organization to achieve its corporate goals with continually improving the operational performance. In this context, the current study is an attempt to identify the critical factors causing low-productivity in dairy supply chains. After comprehensive literature review and pilot studies in some dairy industries located in northern region of India, a total of 32 critical factors have been identified. A structured questionnaire consisting of 32 CFs have been circulated and the data has been collected from select cooperative dairy units. Further, only eight major critical factors have been carried forward for AHP analysis based on the data collected. The factor having higher weightage score is considered as major CF. The findings of this study indicate that the poor logistics and transportation facilities is the most critical factor as productivity barrier in the context of coop. milk processing units in northern India. This research study would be useful for the dairy professionals &amp; managers of milk processing units to manage their production operations effectively by considering the identified CFs.</jats:p>"

These results are crosschecked by the insights from the bank lending survey. The conducted analysis shows there are both supply and demand-side factors that limit the possibility of intensifying household and corporate credit activity. However, a more pronounced drag seems to be coming from subdued demand, which is greatly influenced by the unfavourable domestic macroeconomic environment and, particularly, GDP developments. This suggests that it is not unusual that credit recovery is still missing but also confirms that the scope for monetary policy to stimulate lending is limited.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the evaluation of different processes used in water treatment, i.e. photocatalysis, MIEX®DOC and membrane processes, is made. It was found that the affinity of particular natural organic matter compounds to form chlorination by-products could be arranged in a series: hydrophobic fraction (HA) &amp;gt; hydrophilic fraction (FA). The applied treatment processes efficiently decreased the concentration of disinfection by-products (DBPs) precursors and characterized with different removal mechanisms. Water treated by means of photocatalysis (specific potential of ∑THM was 30 μg/mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for HA and 12 μg/mg DOC for FA) revealed lower affinity to form chlorination by-products in comparison with water undergone to MIEX®DOC process (specific potential of ∑THM was 38 μg/mg DOC for HA and 29 μg/mg DOC for FA). Moreover, combination of those methods with membrane processes efficiently reduced DBPs formation potential. In nanofiltration effluents DBPs potential were very low and equalled to 50 μg/L for HA and 15 μg/L for FA.</jats:p>",

Through this work, we seek to draw up an inventory of Moroccan companies supply chain. The objective is to identify the main risks, their relationship with the performance of the supply chain and to establish an overview of the risk management systems. For this reason, a research model was developed and concretized by quantitative data collected from 29 Moroccan companies. The analysis of the data show that the performance of the supply chain is strongly influenced by the importance of supply chain risk in particular the supplier and demand risks, and leads to insist on the importance of integrating a device adapted to the management of these Risks, especially in the upstream part of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management is a popular practice in any world class organization. The traditional supply chain was managed with the objectives to reduce cost without focusing on environmental and social dimensions. However with passage of time institutional pressures has directed firms to design supply chain network which takes care of environmental and social dimensions as well. Green supply chain management concept has evolved gradually over a period of time. The main reason behind evolution of green supply chain management is conservation of natural resources which human beings ignored for long. Published reports show that major portion of the energy is supplied by fossil fuels and thereby depletion of natural resources is occurring at an accelerating rate with time. Industrial manufacturing report also suggest that demand for manufacturing products is likely to double by the year 2050. This will result in high generation of pollutants and gases. If the greenhouse gases emissions remain unchecked, then it will create a catastrophic effect by 2050. Globally manufacturers and industry associations are now acting proactively to conserve the natural resources and curb greenhouse gases emissions. The level of popularity of green supply chain management can be estimated from the high research output in leading operations journals such as IJPE, IJPR, Resources, Conservation and Recycling Journals. Green supply chain management is a concept that is also gaining popularity in the South African region. For many organizations in this region it is a process to exhibit their sincere commitment to sustainability. However, if green supply chain management practices are to be fully adopted by all mining and minerals industry in South Africa, a demonstrable link between such measures and understanding the role of associated variables is necessary. This paper endeavors to develop a green supply chain management model for mining and minerals industry in the South African region. The approach extends the domain of green supply chain research and produce theories that have greater explanatory power than the current practices. For this purpose a conceptual model was developed from literature review and data collected using a structured questionnaire mailed to a sample of 174 firms which are leading edge ISO14001 certified mining companies in South Africa. Data analysis is further performed through exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis. This paper presents the first empirical evaluation of the link between green supply chain management practices amongst a sample of mining and minerals companies in South Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Trolleybus type power supply using a two-pole overhead catenary system has been used for over one hundred years. However, energy demand in this type of road transport is the lowest. The main disadvantage of this type of transport is the lack of flexibility. Road electric vehicles equipped with batteries, which are now more and more often being put into service, allow for autonomous run on the roads without overhead contact wires. Therefore, it is possible to use them in a more flexible manner. The main problem is a limited range of autonomous run and long charge time of batteries. The paper presents a concept consisting in the application of an overhead catenary for supplying electric and hybrid vehicles (including automobiles) when a vehicle is in motion (mobile charging). Electric trucks are equipped with controlled current collectors allowing for connection with an overhead catenary during driving. Application of this solution to automobiles is rather impossible, which prevents them from being supplied directly from a catenary. The basis of the original concept presented in the paper is the creation of automobile convoys supplied via a truck equipped with current collectors. A description of the proposed system and an algorithm of its operation are presented in the paper. The discussed transport system has significant advantages in comparison to completely autonomous electric vehicles: increased range of driving with lower capacity of batteries on board and flexibility of use, longer life-time of batteries, lower energy consumption. The paper compares the proposed system with the currently used ones, which employ charging of automobiles during stops, but also underlines the advantages of the first solution.</jats:p>"

Because of the multi-dimensional characteristics; the selection of appropriate SCCS in a given situation remains a challenging task for supply chain managers. This study explores relevant factors that influence this selection process. A structural model is proposed to capture relationships among these factors for development of Impact Relationship Maps (IRM) by applying Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Maximum Mean De-Entropy (MMDE) algorithm. A study has been conducted and the outcome leads to add significant value to the decision making process with knowledge on the roles of the factors and inter-factor relations which helps in taking meaningful decision on SCCS selection and implementation. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discuss an new type servo valve, aiming at two main defects of performance of globe valve which are commonly used in mine safety cabins in China, in order to bring up a better solution to replace old valves. On one hand, most of globe valves are manual ball valves whose oxygen content cannot be accurately controlled and can only be estimated by human respiratory sense, ended in large errors[1]. On the other hand, although in market there is oxygen-concentration test equipment, the separation of valve components and manual control switch, leads to complicated procedures and management inconvenience. For solving these problems, an innovative valve mechanical structure is designed, with its servo system bringing up. The proportional valve measures the room oxygen concentration in real time, closed-loop controlling of electric valve-opening, so that the concentration of oxygen in the ambient air is maintained at a desired level. The principle of this implementation is that an explosion-proof motor drives the roller cam to convert valve core into reciprocating linear motion, separating O-ring and valve body end-face to control valve core achieving the opening and closing functions. Since there is no relative motion between O-ring and valve body, it definitely avoids problems of uncontrollable particles caused by abrasion and ensures a high cleanliness of flow path. In addition, electric servo valve controls the precise oxygen concentration, automatically. Compared with manual air supply valve, this valve has advantages of high cleanliness, reliable sealing, easy assembly, maintenance, and automation. It provides a new technical approach for design of special industrial and mining value.</jats:p>"

The case pending before the German court thus poses the question of supply chain liability. Taking the lawsuit by the Pakistani plaintiffs against KiK in Germany as a case study, this article provides an analysis of the available legal grounds for such liability. Economic changes have ushered in linkages between purchasers and suppliers that call for strong principles of liability – principles that are already embedded in the law but which need fresh articulation and application. English courts have only recently recognised that under certain circumstances, liability might attach to a parent company under the tort of negligence for damage to third parties ostensibly caused by its subsidiary. The KiK case is testing the extension of such liability to certain supply chain relationships. Beyond that, the case is also testing the application of the rules on non-delegable duties and vicarious liability in the supply chain context. Even if the court disagrees with the claimants’ position, the novel arguments advanced in this case are likely to be the starting point for an important debate about the proper fit between traditional tort law and the fast changing commercial and employment relationships of the 21st century.</jats:p>",

However, it suffers with criticism on its effectiveness to sustain services and to protect environment. A transformation of approach to citizen engagement is promoted to achieve better development outcomes. Through case study in four villages, this study diagnosed what define and determine citizen engagement in Indonesian rural water supply and sanitation. Determinants of citizen engagement is synthesized by using narrative thematic analysis for the qualitative data and principal component analysis for 708 household survey data. It found that citizen engagement is an interrelation of structure, culture and process elements of social life. Sustainable service of rural water supply and sanitation should be seen as enriched and restructured management cycle with citizen engagement concept. The study offers an improved service delivery cycle of rural water supply developed by Lockwood and Smith in 2011. Method of analysis and the findings of this study demonstrate the integration of sociological and environmental science perspectives. It also provides input to strengthen rural water supply and sanitation programs, especially Pamsimas and STBM, the two biggest government development programs for rural water and sanitation in Indonesia.</jats:p>"

This supply is very important for securing whole year electricity production. This mostly depends on sea and weather conditions which limit vessels operation pattern. However, costs are the only factor used when selecting the appropriate vessel. In fact, there are several other factors that may influence vessel performance. When these factors are considered, selecting the appropriate vessel is difficult because of complex interaction between them. For such circumstances, a multi-criteria evaluation analysis is appropriate. The aim of this paper is to develop an evaluation and decision-making model based on a multi-criteria evaluation analysis to select an appropriate type of vessel for transporting coal. The model will integrate several independent items and combine them before making a decision. Several types of vessel will be selected and several important aspects contributing to vessel performance will be selected and identified.

In this work, we overview the state-of-the-art progress on the regeneration of NaBH4 from anhydrous or hydrated NaBO2 that is a byproduct of NaBH4 hydrolysis. The anhydrous NaBO2 can be regenerated effectively by MgH2, whereas the production of MgH2 from Mg requires high temperature to overcome the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Compared to that of anhydrous NaBO2, using the direct hydrolysis byproduct of hydrated NaBO2 as the starting material for regeneration exhibits significant advantages, i.e., omission of the high-temperature drying process to produce anhydrous NaBO2 and the water included can react with chemicals like Mg or Mg2Si to provide hydrogen. It is worth emphasizing that NaBH4 could be regenerated by an energy efficient method and a large-scale regeneration system may become possible in the near future.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, this rate is significant when the two groups are compared: manufacturing-oriented firms (88.3 percent) and service-oriented firms (85.6 percent), implying that risks in the manufacturing-oriented group have a greater effect on SC performance. While manufacturing-oriented companies should pay close attention to the operational and demand risks that adversely affect SC performance, they should treat information risk as an opportunity to improve. Service-oriented companies, however, need to manage supply risk which, in their case, can be attributed to a 51.2 percent variance in SC performance.

The dynamic monitoring of vehicle load is of great significance to stable driving. In order to resolve this problem, we present an algorithm that can calculate vehicle load on the basic of empirical mode transform (EWT) and a corresponding vehicle load dynamic testing platform. The relationship between the vehicle load and the suspension variables is the foundation of realizing load detection. To obtain it, we establish a two-degree-of freedom suspension dynamic model and analyze the dynamic characteristics of the suspension under various vehicle speeds and loads. We design a dynamic load detection device with overload protection to collect the dynamic signal of vehicle. The data processing algorithm of the vehicle load dynamic detection device is constructed based on EWT. In order to verify the effectiveness of the device, a model truck is taken as the test vehicle. Based on the DSP chip, the vehicle load dynamic testing platform is developed. In order to test the accuracy of the system, the calculation accuracy of the system is tested with different load at different speeds. The experimental results show that the system exhibits a high accuracy in the measurement experiment.</p>",

Meanwhile, online word-of-mouth (OWOM) can also play an important role in supply chain performance. On the basis of co-op advertising, this paper considers a single supply chain structure led by a manufacturer and examines a fundamental issue concerning the impact of OWOM on supply chain performance. Firstly, by the method of differential game, this paper analyzes the dynamic impact of OWOM and advertising on supply chain performance (i.e., brand goodwill, sales, and profits) under three different supply chain decisions (i.e., only advertising, and manufacturers with and without sharing cost of OWOM with retailers). We compare and analyze the optimal strategies of advertising and OWOM under the above different supply chain decisions. Secondly, the system dynamics model is established to reflect the dynamic impact of OWOM and advertising on supply chain performance. Finally, three supply chain decisions under two scenarios, strong brand and weak brand, are analyzed through the system dynamics simulation. The results show that the input of OWOM can enhance brand goodwill and improve earnings. It further promotes the OWOM reputation and improves the supply chain performance if manufacturers share the cost of OWOM with retailers. Then, in order to eliminate the retailers from word-of-mouth fraud and establish a fair competition mechanism, the third parties (i.e., regulators or e-commerce platforms) should take appropriate punitive measures against retailers. Furthermore, the effect of OWOM on supply chain performance under a strong brand differed from those under a weak brand. Last but not least, if OWOM is improved, there would be more remarkable performance for the weak brand than that for the strong brand in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The target population was all the 187 heads of procurement of the state corporations in Kenya. From the four strata, a sample of 127 was selected using simple random sampling. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Once collected, data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Quantitative data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.Results: In regard to inventory management system, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.561 on performance of state corporations. Second in regard to strategic sourcing, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.198 on performance of state corporations. With regard to supply base leveraging, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.112 on performance of state corporations. Lastly, in regard to the fourth objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.019 on performance of state corporations.Conclusion: Based on the findings, the study concluded that supply base leveraging, inventory management system, e-procurement and strategic sourcing have a positive relationship with performance of the state corporations.Policy Recommendation: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace strategic procurement management so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, industries are continually looking to implement new subsidiaries in different continents, in order to better fulfill their customers’ needs, generate the best products in the shortest time and cheaper than their competitors. Achieving these goals is no longer related to the company itself, but to all partners in the supply chain. This justifies the need for efficient and judicious management of the whole supply chain, through the collective intervention of all its actors. Needless to say, a supply chain is a system made up of a set of suppliers, producers, subcontractors, retailers, wholesalers and customers, between whom material, information and financial flows are exchanged. Management of these flows is becoming increasingly difficult and constitutes the main source of the supply chain complexity. In order to alleviate this problem and improve supply chain performance, it is necessary to model it, taking into consideration its characteristics, which make it a complex system. Hence, the scoop of this paper is to prove that supply chain is a complex system, by highlighting its most relevant characteristics that make it such a system. Complex means what is braided together or woven together. If we separate the elements, we get acquaintance elements, but we lose their interactions. Within this trend, our contribution subscribes with its ultimate purpose modelling supply chain as complex system.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management has become an effective tool now a day to survive in this competitive world. Organizations do their best to harvest profits by adopting better supply chain management practices for competitive advantage and organizational performance. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand the relationship among supply chain practices, competitive advantage, and organizational performance using structural equation modelling. This research conceptualizes and develops five secondary dimensions of supply chain practices (Use of technology, SC speed, Customer satisfaction, SC integration, and Inventory management). The research also identifies four primary competitive advantage components (Inventory management, Customer satisfaction, Profitability, and Customer base identification) and six primary organizational performance components (Financial Performance, Market performance, SC competencies, Customer satisfaction, Stakeholder satisfaction, and Innovation and learning). The data for analysis was collected from top 10 non-livestock organized retail players operating in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, New Delhi and, Gurgaon in India. The relationships in the proposed framework were tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that Indian retailers know that competitive advantage has high impact on SCP but they have less understanding in matching SCP and competitive advantage with organizational performance. </jats:p>"

We assume that each single supply chain is composed by a manufacturer, a wholesaler and a retailer. Besides, a new transshipment policy based on system dynamics (SD) is proposed in this paper, called the model of the cross-chain inventory transshipment between two enterprises from both the same tier and different tiers. The new proposed model is different from the model of the cross-chain inventory transshipment between two enterprises at the same tier and the model of the cross-chain inventory transshipment between two enterprises at different tiers, which have been researched by previous scholars. Some comparisons are made among the three models. It is proved that the new proposed model can improve the customer satisfaction level (CSL) and lower the total inventory level than the two other models existing currently.</jats:p>",

The paper discusses the results of simulating emergency modes, caused by short circuits in 10 kV and 0.4 kV grids of non-traction users, connected via energy routers to the railway power supply system. The studies were performed in MATLAB system. Simulation results showed that the application of controlled energy routers for the non-traction user power supply completely removes electric power quality problems, allows for reliable integration of distributed generation plants into the power supply system, and limits short circuit currents and reduces the depth of the AC failure.  </jats:p>"

As businesses are all moving into the e-commerce platform to gain market shares, they realize that electronic supply chain management (e-SCM) powered by enterprise resource planning systems (ERPs) are the new norms and no business organization can operate without both in the new world of e-commerce. Little attention has been devoted to e-SCM dynamic with ERP and the challenges they pose to organizations. In the e-commerce environment, e-SCM is among the most important factors to organizational success. Effective e-SCM can enhance competitiveness and increase market share leading a higher profitability.

Expansion of ventilation capacity in tunnel ventilated poultry facilities has resulted in increased water demand for EC systems. As water resources become more limited and costly, proper planning and design of water supply systems is critical to ensure demand is met during periods of heat stress which increase EC use and bird water consumption. Few estimates of EC water use in animal housing applications are available in the literature and available estimates are geographically limited or rely on extreme weather events. The goal of this analysis was to provide guidance for EC water supply design to accommodate estimates of peak demand, rather than average consumption rates.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper considers the application of the “Digital Railway” project at the traction substation. The “Digital Railway” project should become a centralized system uniting the programs for the control of railway elements. In the traction power supply system, the application of digital technologies is often understood as the application of data transfer protocols of the International Energy Commission “IEC 61850”. The substations that switched to this information protocol are usually called “digital”. An attempt to introduce the “digital substation” technology only by completing a set of corresponding equipment can give a negative result of its application. The efficiency achieved through the technical upgrading of equipment (reduction of losses for own needs, reduction of electromagnetic influence, reduction of analog signal input channels, reduction in the number of cable products used, and improvement of the measurement accuracy class) may not be sufficient to pay for the project. The qualitative integration of all involved services in a single information process of monitoring and controlling the digital substation will increase the efficiency of its application. As a positive experience when considering the use of digital technologies in traction power supply systems, one can cite the Automated system for monitoring the railway transport infrastructure developed and implemented by the staff of the Far Eastern State Transport University at a number of traction substations of the Far Eastern operating domain and at the 2ES5K “Ermak” electric locomotive. In addition, this system already has a support of IEC 61850 protocols.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Manufacturing companies often lack visibility of the procurement interdependencies between the suppliers within their supply network. However, knowledge of these interdependencies is useful to plan for potential operational disruptions. In this paper, we develop the Supply Network Link Predictor (SNLP) method to infer supplier interdependencies using the manufacturer’s incomplete knowledge of the network. SNLP uses topological data to extract relational features from the known network to train a classifier for predicting potential links. Using a test case from the automotive industry, four features are extracted: (i) number of existing supplier links, (ii) overlaps between supplier product portfolios, (iii) product outsourcing associations, and (iv) likelihood of buyers purchasing from two suppliers together. Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression are then employed to predict whether these features can help predict interdependencies between two suppliers. Our results show that these features can indeed be used to predict interdependencies in the network and that predictive accuracy is maximised by (i) and (iii). The findings give rise to the exciting possibility of using data analytics for improving supply chain visibility. We then proceed to discuss to what extent such approaches can be adopted and their limitations, highlighting next steps for future work in this area.</jats:p>",

There are very prominent features of the Aqua Augusta, some that are extraordinary when considering other great aqueducts in the Roman Empire. For example, the deep tunnels allowed access to a spring water source from a separate watershed, which resulted in transbasin diversion of the water supply. Each one of the prominent features was engineered to provide water to the public for various uses. The prominent structures included other shallower tunnels (with two major types of construction), hydraulic chutes, arcades (one to an island), baths (located along a well-traveled road), and storage reservoirs. Also, there is the epigraph discovered at the water source. Important villas that may have influenced the alignment of the aqueduct are also discussed.</jats:p>",

The authors have identified the enablers through a review of extant literature and further applied the popular total interpretive structural modeling (TISM)-based methodology. TISM is a well-articulated mental model interpreting both the nodes (indicating “what”) and links (indicating “how” and “why”). The mental model of the group is not well structured and is loosely defined, which serves as the basis for the theory building process. The authors finally obtained a hierarchy of enablers and findings show that innovation culture is the driving element in developing flexible systems in supplier networks. Supply chain practitioners must focus on developing an innovation culture within the boundaries of the organization and then integrate with specialist suppliers to ultimately build additional capacity for managing the fluctuations in customer demand and further manage supply risks.

The question arises as to whether the pressure being recorded at the end of the stub is an accurate representation of pressure in the pipeline. In this study, the influence of three parameters, including pressure transducer connection stub length, stub diameter and valve closure time, on the measurement accuracy of transient pressure is investigated through numerical simulation on a reservoir-pipe-valve-reservoir system. The results show that the larger the diameter of stub, the larger its influence both on the transient in the pipe and on measurement error; the measurement accuracy increases with an increase of the length of the stub only when the closure time of the end valve is less than the time for the water hammer wave to travel back and forth between the measurement point and the end point of stub. In contrast, when the closure time of the end valve is greater than the water hammer wave return time, the measurement accuracy will decrease with an increase of the stub length; the measurement accuracy is improved as the closure time of the end valve increases. As a result, in practice, diameter and length of connection stub for the pressure-transducer should both be selected to be as small as possible.</jats:p>",

The phosphorus and nitrogen release fluxes in the vessels with GCA (up to 2.9 mg m−2 d−1 for total phosphorus and 23.9 mg m−2 d−1 for total nitrogen) were considerably smaller than those in the vessels without GCA (up to 8.9 mg m−2 d−1 and 56 mg m−2 d−1, respectively), except in the case of phosphorus in the fall experiment, and thus the phosphorus concentration released from the vessel without GCA under anoxic conditions in the summer experiment was extraordinarily higher (over 1.5 mg l−1) than those in the other vessels (less than 0.31 mg l−1). Supplementary experiments with smaller columns indicated that the chemical effect of GCA was on a similar level with its physical effect and that the threshold phosphorus concentration for removing it was lower in freshwater than seawater. The chromium level slightly exceeded the standard for drinking water and the development of technology to suppress its release is a future challenge.</jats:p>",

This is a common generalization of the classical metric facility location problem and joint replenishment problem that coordinates the network design and inventory management decisions in an integrated manner. This coordination can represent significant economy for many applications, where network design and operational costs are normally considered separately. This problem is considered when the instances satisfy assumptions such as metric space of warehouse and retailer locations, and monotonic increasing inventory holding costs. In this work, we give a 2.77-approximation based on the randomized rounding of the natural mixed-integer programming relaxation. Also, we give a 5-approximation for the case that objective function includes retailer ordering setup costs. </jats:p>",

The synthesized control law for an electric drive realizes the prescribed motion and minimizes the required capacitance of the power source. It is achieved through optimal disconnection and connection to the power line of the drive at designated times of one of the power supply sections. Reduction of the required capacitance of the power supply is achieved through a fuller discharge of some of its sections in motion conditions requiring a low level of electrical voltage and saving high voltage in other sections for the respective motion conditions. A mathematical formulation of the problem and a method of its solution is proposed. An example of the implementation of the proposed method is considered.</jats:p>"

Source data was obtained by the direct interview method conducted by the authors with representatives of the Management Board. It was found that the Group is a unique example of vertical integration „forward” and capturing added value from the market by eliminating all intermediaries. It is a business model that covers the whole supply chain, i.e. from the field to the store shelves. The high quality of the products and the large variety of them make it possible to achieve high income and invest in further development. The Group has created new jobs in the local environment, disseminates good practices in orchards, production and processing, and through taxes and sponsorship contributes to the economic development of the local community.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The carbon tax legislation has been widely advocated as a cost-efficient law to push companies to reduce their carbon emission through their supply chain's (SC) activities. Based on a carbon emission reduction's target, different carbon taxation strategies have been implemented around the world. Generally, governments launch the carbon tax with a relatively low carbon price and plan to increase it incrementally over years adopting various strategies in a way to attend their emission reduction objective. The majority of developed mathematical models within green supply chain design (GSCD) under carbon tax legislation have ignored the dynamic aspect of this legislation. We believe that companies when designing their SCs have to consider not only the actual applied carbon price but also the eventual evolution of this carbon price over years. We aim to contribute to literature by studying the impact of the dynamic carbon tax legislations on the strategic decisions of a SC mainly the technology investment decision. Our objective is to illustrate that the dynamic modeling approach is more appropriate to study such strategic problems than static modeling. We develop a dynamic model of technology selection under progressive carbon tax legislation. Through a numerical example, we solve the dynamic model and we compare it with the static model. To do so, this static model has been tested under three different values of the carbon taxes mainly the launch carbon tax value, the average carbon tax value and the final target carbon tax value. We compare the efficiency of the used modeling techniques to guarantee a more visibility for the company and provide it with performant decisions that allow greening their SCs and saving its profit.</jats:p>"

The target population was all the 187 heads of procurement of the state corporations in Kenya. From the four strata, a sample of 127 was selected using simple random sampling. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Once collected, data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Quantitative data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.Results: In regard to inventory management system, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.561 on performance of state corporations. Second in regard to strategic sourcing, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.198 on performance of state corporations. With regard to supply base leveraging, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.112 on performance of state corporations. Lastly, in regard to the fourth objective, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence of 0.019 on performance of state corporations.Conclusion: Based on the findings, the study concluded that supply base leveraging, inventory management system, e-procurement and strategic sourcing have a positive relationship with performance of the state corporations.Policy Recommendation: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace strategic procurement management so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

Analytical methods of scientific research were used in this study. Analysis of modern water supply was carried out to identify the problems in this area. Nowadays, there have been negative trends in water supply, affecting the growth of cities, which were indicated by the authors as the modern conditions for the sustainable urban development. The problems of modern water supply are: limited access of the population to guarantee sources of water supply, an increased level of environmental pollution, and an inadequate financing in the field of water supply, whose purpose is to provide qualitative water supply services for the consumers. These specific features in a field of water supply complicate the implementation of sustainable urban development concept. Providing sustainable development is impossible without integrated consideration of socio-ecological-economic and natural factors. The result of the study consists in the necessity of taking into account the potential of city development in terms of water availability per person during the modeling sustainable urban development.</jats:p>"

HSC revolve around the essential dimension of Halal Integrity (HI), whereas traceability is seemed to be medium to assure integrity. Thus, a need is felt to identify the factors which are critical to the successful implementation of traceability in Halal Supply Chain Management (HSCM). Identified Twelve Critical Success Factors (CSFs) through an extensive review of literature and opinion of experts. Further, a contextual relationship among the CSFs is developed using Total Interpretive Structure Modelling (TISM) approach and derived a model. The structural model is analyzed using Fuzzy MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique and Classment-cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) approach to identify the importance of CSFs by driving and dependence power. The primary result indicates towards; that improving the HSCM with the higher level of Halal awareness. Assuring HI will enhance the consumer satisfaction which leads to a competitive advantage for the organization. Academic researchers, industrial practitioners and Supply Chain executives can understand the complex interrelationship of CSFs by visualizing the TISM. It can help the management, lobbies and government to develop the policies regarding the implementation.</jats:p>"

We assume that the demands accruing during the stock-out period are partially backlogged. The retailer replenishes the stock of main product from the supplier which adopts (0,M) policy. The complement product is replenished instantaneously from local supplier. The joint probability disruption of the inventory levels of main product, complement item at retailer and the main product at supplier are obtained in the steady state case. Various system performance measures are derived and the long run total expected inventory cost rate is calculated.

The water shortage in Dar es Salaam city affects communities in different wards of Kinondoni municipality. As a strategy to improve water access, this study assessed opportunities for application of rainwater harvesting (RWH) technologies, communities’ knowledge of this and their willingness to adopt RWH technologies, and challenges for installation and maintenance of RWH technologies in areas of Makongo, Mbezi, Msasani and Kimara wards of Kinondoni municipality. Data collection involved interviews, questionnaires and observation while the SPSS tool was used for data analysis. Also, laboratory tests for water quality parameters were conducted. Results showed that rooftop RWH systems with proper components and proper maintenance were found to provide better quality water for domestic use than other sources. Laboratory tests revealed that rainwater was better than other water sources. Lack of knowledge was the main factor that hindered adoption of RWH technology. Also, initial investment cost was among the reasons deterring its adoption. Therefore, to improve the adoption rate of RWH technologies there should be an integrated participation of different stakeholders to educate and support communities to address RWH technologies’ challenges. This can be supported by a proposed institutional framework.</jats:p>",

Before constructing a green supply chain, the first step is to assess the existing structure from the viewpoint of greenness. Hence, it is important to develop a systematic assessment approach and this study aims to analyze the existing literature by mainly clarifying the criteria and methods used in such assessment systems and provide directions for future studies. Moreover, this study also aims to provide a base for the academics and practitioners that are willing to develop a greenness assessment methodology for supply chains.

Due to the low resistance of cathode filament, an isolation transformer with large turn ratio is used. To obtain the ZVS operation, a parallel-resonant capacitor is connected to the primary of transformer. The capacitor, transformer and filament constitute a parallel resonant tank. Both the transformer leakage inductance and the transistor output capacitance are merged into the resonant tank. The resonant energy provides the ZVS operation of the inverter switch, and the secondary voltage drives the cathode filament. To verify the analysis, a prototype inverter is built and tested. Experimental results validate the circuit design.</jats:p>"

The paper first emphasizes the role and importance of knowledge management in contemporary organizations and heightened need for management of knowledge in organizations. In nowadays business environment, there is an intensive collaboration between organizations outside their boundaries and where supply chains are becoming important element, knowledge management represent an important tool for knowledge application process among supply chain partners. The paper examines usage of knowledge in frame of supply chain and outline potentials and possible drawbacks of knowledge utilization in supply chain. Results reveal that knowledge management is not among top used management practices worldwide and well-developed areas, like North America and well-developed parts of Europe, while knowledge management is higher ranked in emerging economies from Central and East Europe (i.e., Slovenia and Croatia) than other areas, like North America, Latin America, well-developed part of Europe.</jats:p>"

The chapter makes use of an online survey for data collection. 927 responses were collected in total during 2015. 92% of the respondents state that they believe in global warming. The results indicate that one-fourth of the consumers are not willing to pay anything extra if electricity is obtained from renewable sources. However, almost half thinks that they could pay 5% to 10% more. In terms of the importance placed by the consumers on different means of electricity generation by renewable sources, the highest importance is placed on solar energy, followed by wind, biomass, and hydroelectric. Policy makers in the public and private sectors can consider these results when making changes to the current energy generation and distribution infrastructure. </jats:p>"

In this paper, we empirically analyse, for the whole banking sector as well as for selected categories of banks, whether the reduction in loan volume was supply‐side‐driven. The results suggest that a credit crunch did not occur in Germany during the recent economic crisis. Apart from substantial policy interventions, our results offer two explanations: First, excess demand for loans dropped, as firms reverted to other external financing instruments, particularly industrial bonds. Second, those banks operating at the regional level only were not affected by the crisis. In this regard, the three‐pillar structure of the German banking system contributed to stable credit financing, as banks differ in their operating behaviours and in their customers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing blood supply chain has been an important task in the healthcare system because it has to confront not only blood demand and supply uncertainties but also complexities in blood inventory management. In order to overcome these challenges, it is essential to explore the possible risks that could occur in the blood supply chain and discover proper ways to manage these risks. Therefore, this research aims to investigate risks in blood supply chain by using a proactive risk management tool called ‘house of risk’ (HOR) model, in order to conduct risk assessment and evaluate risk management actions. A case study of blood supply chain risk management was analyzed, and the HOR model was incorporated to appraise the appropriate actions in the real situation. The results indicate that there are 30 risk events and 16 risk agents identified and assessed in the case study. The outcomes point out that lack of collaboration, insufficient information for decision-making, and limited information sharing are the top 3 risk agents that contribute to significant impact on blood supply chain management. Risk mitigation and management actions were evaluated and the results show that enhancing the collaboration is the most proactive action to manage risks in the blood service operations, followed by information sharing, and demand and supply statistical analysis. The study has recommended the outlines for improving collaboration between blood service organizations by using information system and technology to mitigate risks, complexities, as well as uncertainties in managing demand and supply in the blood supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, the CLSC is studied through quantitative models at three levels. The study at the first level analyses a generic closed loop strategic framework under various scenarios, capturing the implementation maturity of CLSC. In the second level, a quantitative model for multi stage integrated forward and reverse logistics network is analyzed. Finally in the third level of study, a microscopic view is taken in which a joint economic order quantity (EOQ) and economic production quantity (EPQ) model is studied to optimize value by using proper mix of newly purchased components /products with recycled components /products. The final control parameters may be utilized by policy makers, CLSC network designers or practicing managers for effective decision making and coordination.</jats:p>"

Solar energy is one of the most dynamically developing directions of use of renewable energy sources, especially the introduction of which are associated with climatic conditions and technical requirements of their application. The territory of Russia is located mainly in the cold climatic zone and in regions with a sharply continental climate in which the operation of water heating solar plants is justified and most rational in seasonal use, in this case, their technical operation is carried out mainly during the non-heating period of the year. In such installations, in a number of cases, it is possible to avoid the need to use “non-freezing” heat carriers, and therefore the thermal schemes of the plants are simpler in design and cheaper, since heat exchangers or bivalent storage tanks can be excluded to transfer heat from the antifreeze to the water of the heating circuit or hot water system.</jats:p>"

Most of the previous studies have been conceptual, theoretical, normative, or at best qualitative in approach, concentrating on identifying the elements of resilience. In spite of the proliferation of studies, an empirically validated quantitative study on justifying the measurement dimensions of supply chain resilience is rare, thus the need for further quantitative empirical studies. The context of the present study is the manufacturing supply chain of <jats:italic>halal</jats:italic> pharmaceuticals in Malaysia. A quantitative cross-sectional design was applied by means of self-administered structured questionnaire survey, using the Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management instrument (SCRAM<jats:sup>©</jats:sup> 2.0). The survey yielded usable responses from 106 manufacturing companies engaged in the production of <jats:italic>halal</jats:italic> pharmaceuticals in Malaysia. Descriptive statistics as well as partial least square-based structural equation modelling was used to analyze the survey data. This was facilitated by IBM SPSS statistics software (version 21.0), and Smart PLS 3.2.4 respectively. The results suggest that the psychometric properties of the supply chain resilience dimensions (vulnerabilities and capabilities) in the context of the present study are reliable and valid.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of emergency control is ensuring postemergency mode dead-beat stability and high quality of dynamic transitions for electrical network load-shedding. Control actions were formed by changing the vector of controlled parameters along a path corresponding to the shortest distance to the hypersurface of the limit modes. The dynamic processes quality when implementing the control actions was ensured based on the special settings of excitation and frequency automatic regulators. Based on computer-aided modelling, it is shown that the effective in-troduction of a postemergency mode to the stability region can be performed based on generalized equations of the limit loads while using the start algorithm ensuring mode’s entering the stability region’s neighboring boundary. The application of the fuzzy control algorithms for tuning regulators allows formation of a qualitative dynamic transition while load-shedding distributed generation plants in the postemergency mode.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managers often decide to integrate supply chains of collaborating firms. Whether such decisions are for competitive posture, cost saving or operational efficiencies, it is important to understand that supply chains integrate not only the flow of goods but also the information processes and assets and more often than not, the IT networks of the firms. Thus two developments occur. First, IT security losses of one firm collocate at the other firm's servers as information assets like demand forecasts are shared. Second, the Intranets of both firms get connected with the help of VPN or similar technologies, making it possible that a breach can travel from one firm to the other. This in turn makes IT security risks of SC firms strategically interdependent. This chapter analyzes such interdependent IT security risks and provides insights for SC and IT managers who are poised to collaborate with other downstream or upstream partner firms. </jats:p>"

In order to prove whether the nozzles work most efficient and a fire can be extinguished safely and precisely, 12 professional fire-fighters carried out simulated fire-fighting procedures under nearly realistic conditions. Throughout the entire test, the electromyographic activity (EA) from 7 muscles of the right hand-arm-shoulder system and one muscle of the left arm was recorded. Additionally, a special questionnaire had to be filled in to evaluate the subjective experiences when handling the nozzles. The EA – standardized through MVCs (Maximum Voluntary Contractions) – exceeded the limit for short-term static work for 3 muscles, especially when the pressure was 0.8 MPa and higher. The subjective ratings confirmed the measured physiological responses. Based on these results, the operating pressure for the fire water supply should not exceed 0.6 MPa (as compromise 0.7 MPa), in order to ensure safe and precise fire-fighting, and that the nozzles work most efficient.</jats:p>"

Its complexity make many research considered fruit in certain supply chain, called as Fruit Supply Chain (FSC). In FSC, customers tend to purchase products with a longer remaining lifetime and avoid the ones which give aging signal. Customer willingness to pay decreases once the product start to be deteriorated, which may cause slower demand for aging fruits. Consequently, retailers should enable discounted price for aging fruits products to retain or improve demand rate. Main purpose of this research is explaining how to maximize supply chain profit by applying dynamic pricing. A set of mathematical model is optimized on this research. It addresses dynamic pricing for FSC players to achieve better profitability. The result proves that dynamic pricing is urgent to be done which is signaled by increment of FSC Profit. FSC players can separate selling period into three periods, which are forward buying period, normal price period, and markdown price period as implementation of this scheme.</jats:p>"

The \"agricultural super docking\" mode is a direct connection between supermarkets and farmers (or cooperatives), what the supermarket needs and what the farmers produce. The green degree is used to indicate the quality level of health, safety and nutrition of agricultural products. The greater the green degree is, the better the quality of agricultural products is. In order to meet the needs of all consumers, the supermarket decide to carry out different management. That is to say, supermarket sells ordinary agricultural products and green agricultural products at the same time. This paper gives the consumer utility function for ordinary agricultural products and green agricultural products separately. We analyze the consumers’ choice behaviors based on the consumer utility function .We discuss the optimal decision of supermarket choosing one farmer and supermarket choosing two farmers based on Stackelberg game. It can be seen from the comparison that supermarket can get more profits when it chooses two farmer to order separately. Finally, a \"wholesale price + ordering subsidy\" coordination mechanism is proposed to realize supply chain coordination. .</jats:p>"

As it was observed in the research carried out on vehicles that use hydrogen fuel cell as a power source and electric motors as sole drive of the car there are some still not solved issues connected with their exploitation. Its working conditions may be unfavourable in case of external factors, which influence is not neutralized. In order to improve and stabilize the conditions additional components (active or passive) somehow cooperating with adequate space and operation environment of the cell are developed. This article is a response to the need for design of air supply channels for the hydrogen cell. The optimization subject is the proper channel shape in order to achieve the appropriate direction of the air stream inducing the forced exchange due to the high temperatures of propulsion heating the air around the cell and interrupting its working conditions. Especially important in this study, it is the fact that developed supply system is designed for high performance electric vehicle with very low air resistance. Accordingly, the critical requirement is to ensure the lowest possible influence on the vehicle aerodynamics keeping the performance of the air supply system. This type of multi-criteria optimization problem, combines the analysis of the geometrical relationships, the use of mathematical models that allow to designate the load states at specified operating conditions, and verification of endurance. It requires special methodology, coupling of used tools and advanced optimization algorithms.</jats:p>"

This community is rather greeted with water scarcity which is partly blamed on the failure to initiate and sustain water supply schemes. Forest destruction in favor of oil palm plantations by Pamol and small holder schemes have contributed to degrade the major water catchments thereby increasing stream erosion and siltation. This has altered the flow characteristics of streams. This paper proposes a model for sustainable water supply by indicating the opportunities that exist for internal and external actors to galvanise their resources to ensure adequate water supply in this fast developing rural community. It was observed that a major setback in the attainment of this goal remains the insufficient resources (material and financial) and the absence of a synergy among the key actors of Ekondo-Titi. The model recommends the strengthening of stakeholder synergy and where necessary, further support from external actors in the process of initiating and sustaining water development projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A review of the current world state of application of various heat supply regimes for public buildings is conducted. The efficiency analysis of the use of various renewable energy sources in combined heat supply systems is analyzed. An integrated heat supply system with successive heating of the coolant from low-potential renewable sources of heat (solar system) to high-temperature traditional heat sources (gas and pellet boilers) is developed. A mathematical model of the integrated heat supply system using renewable sources of heat is proposed. This model can be used to simulate the processes of heating rooms in the intermittent heat supply mode.\n\nThe dynamics of heating of premises with various heating devices: with natural convection (radiator) and forced convection (fan coils) is carried out. During the heating season (2016–2017), the operation modes of integrated systems of alternative intermittent heat supply (ISAIHS) are studied.\n\nThese studies are extremely relevant for solving the issues of rational use of energy resources. The proposed solutions show that the most effective use of renewable sources of heat can be only in an integrated approach to solving this issue. Also it should be noted the interaction of ISAIHS components: the heat source – the heating system – the characteristics of the building – the operating modes of the premises.\n\nAs a result of the research, the boundaries of the effective use of various heat generators in ISAHS are established. The influence of the type of heating devices and insulation of internal walls on the effectiveness of ISAIHS operation is revealed. The full-scale tests of a pilot installation of an integrated heat supply system are carried out.\n\nThe obtained results will help to use heat sources more efficiently with a two-period operation regime for new houses. This can be used to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings.</jats:p>",

Innovative retailers, in the face of with these threats, have embraced and implemented the omni-channel retailing approach, which is the next step in multi-channel. However, other players in the retail industry lag behind this change. The aim of this chapter is to establish the experiences of innovative retailers that have adopted omni-channel retailing in the context of risks, challenges and opportunities. The research data were obtained using questionnaire method from the retailers in Turkey, one of the developing countries. As a result of the study, it was found that retailers who would adopt the omni-channel retailing would have the opportunities to be able to dominate all channels, provide better services to the customers, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, keep in constant contact with the customers, get better customer recognition and increase sales volume. </jats:p>"

Whether the microgrid can achieve smooth switching from grid-connected to off-grid has great influence on the safety and stability of the power grid. In order to accurately evaluate the influence of the microgrid switch to the distribution network, it is needed to research on the distributed source modeling technology, and establish an accurate microgrid model. In this paper, using a 400V voltage grade microgrid system with PV, WT and PCS as an example, model the internal equipment and the microgrid control system, and establish a microgrid model for simulation. At the meantime, it carries out the microgrid switch testing, and compare with the measured waveform to verify the accuracy of the model.

Rural and agricultural water demand covers the basic types of water demand, including the population's living and economic needs, animal husbandry, the needs of public utilities, the needs related to the operation of vehicles and machinery, workshops, machines and other purposes, including the own needs of the water pipes, fire-fighting etc. The level of demand is also closely related to the factors influencing the level of individual water consumption. Taking into account the deficiencies in formal and legal regulations, the binding regulations concerning the operation of water supply systems in special conditions have been presented so far. Elements of the benchmarking study on unit water demand indicators in normal and special conditions in rural areas have also been taken into account, guided by the principles and numerical indicators for the calculation of water demand for drinking and business purposes.</jats:p>"

However, entrance and elevation of e-commerce focused logistic companies such as Chhotu, Mudita, Unicommerce and Delhivery seem to be promising and can be the real game changer. These companies offer solutions that address the various pain-points pertaining to the supply chain of e-commerce companies, which traditional and big supply chain &amp; logistic providers so far failed to do. This is a global phenomenon. Despite considerable improvement in recent past, many logistics providers still struggle to cope up with inadequate infrastructure leading to operational inefficiencies to support their services.

In interconnected logistics networks, operations are integrated from suppliers through 3rd party logistics providers to customers. There are different delivery models depending on the time and cost. In the last few years, a wide range of customers is willing to pay an extra fee for the same delivery or instant delivery. This fact led to the increased importance of the optimized design and control of first mile/last mile (FMLM) delivery solutions. Cyberphysical system‐based service innovations make it possible to enhance the productivity of FMLM delivery in the big data environment. The design and operation problems can be described as NP‐hard optimization problems. These problems can be solved using sophisticated models and methods based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms. This research proposes an integrated supply model of FMLM delivery. After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to formulate the problem of real‐time smart scheduling of FMLM delivery. The integrated model includes the assignment of first mile and last mile delivery tasks to the available resources and the optimization of operations costs, while constraints like capacity, time window, and availability are taken into consideration. Next, a black hole optimization‐ (BHO‐) based algorithm dealing with a multiobjective supply chain model is presented. The sensitivity of the enhanced algorithm is tested with benchmark functions. Numerical results with different datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and validate the usage of Industry 4.0 inventions in FMLM delivery.</jats:p>",

In this study, two river widening approaches, excavated and dynamic, are described for the case of moderately steep gravel-bed rivers in the Alpine foothills, with a focus on dynamic river widening. As most channelized rivers exhibit ongoing degradation due to the lack of sediment supply and efforts to restore sediment transport are increasing, the consideration of the response of river widenings to variable sediment supply is important. For this purpose, insights from regime theory are applied to river widening and several experimental flume and field studies on channel response to variable sediment supply are reviewed. Dynamic river widenings are expected to be morphologically active in weakly degraded rivers with sufficient sediment supply, while they may not be an appropriate restoration approach for highly degraded rivers due to persistent impairment of morphological activity.</jats:p>"

This study used the paradigm of constructivism with data collection technique through in-depth interviews and Focused Group Discussion (FGD). An evidence based policy was adopted to conduct a better outcome of the study to promote amendment of related VAT regulations. The results of the study indicate an inconsistency between VAT policy and Government Regulations, both Minister of Health Regulations and other Ministries Regulations on Drinking Water Supply System. The impact of the inconsistency was the tax dispute that ultimately causes a high cost of taxation on both sides as well as VAT treatment inconsistency within the drinking water providers (PDAMs) themselves.

All of them are paradigm changes as each significantly reshapes the orientation of the discipline in the source of competitiveness, risk concern, customer services, productivity, process management, externalities, costs, and other aspects of the disciplines. The author presents findings gained in the exploration of these fundamental changes and provides a comparison with a previous change of paradigm. The chapter proposes a transformation that the company supply chain system has to go through to re-establish its competitive position at the time of Industry 4.0. The chapter provides a case study of 3PL perception of Industry 4.0 based on in-depth interviews conducted among the major global 3PLs operating in the Czech Republic. </jats:p>"

The Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle is used for the control and continual improvement of the waste management process at the hospital where the study took place. By adapting and utilizing lean and statistical tools such as scatter diagrams, histograms, Pareto charts, fishbone diagrams, and control charts, waste can be identified and reduced or eliminated. The use of the statistical tools provides a visual presentation of the message that the team conveyed. They are especially useful to summarize the information that would normally require much time and effort to elucidate its complexity. Further, they provide a visual summation with still a great deal of details leading to increased satisfaction, efficiency, and creates competitive advantage. </jats:p>"

The study employed retrospective design. Respondents were selected using purposive sampling to arrive at the desired sample of the owners of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in selected states of the north-central Nigeria. The 5-point Likert scale was employed to allow for precise responses on some issues raised regarding their supply chain management. Given the data gathered and generally ranking the totality of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in terms of least performance based on the indicators used, the result shows that the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises performed least on Total Delivered Cost followed by Operating Costs, Performance to Plan, Inventory, Supply Variability, Demand Variability, and Customer Service. In order to succeed, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Nigeria, particularly in the north-central states need to be able to increase inventory velocity, achieve the shortest possible cycle times, continually improve their supplier performance and drive their sales and market share.</jats:p>"

Analyzing manufacturers' decisions on CSI under two supply chain structure settings including single-channel supply chain and competitive supply chain, the authors hope to design governance mechanisms to restrain the CSI performance of the manufacturers so as to provide a theoretic reference to the better fulfillment of sustainable development and social responsibility. Moreover, this chapter makes a simple extension on the asymmetry initial base demand, and the result is quite different from the symmetry initial base demand. It is found that an asymmetric CSI strategy can achieve equilibrium. A suggestion in this chapter is to intensify the competition in supply chain by supporting smaller enterprises and preventing complete monopoly. </jats:p>"

Scotchkote 169HB pipeline inner protective coating manufactured by «3M» production company (USA) and Subcote FLP coating by «Group POLYPLASTIC» Ltd (RF) were the objects of this investigation. The article presents general characteristics of alternative protective coatings. A methodical approach to determination of the protective coating hydraulic characteristics is described by the tests at a special patented small-sized bench through estimation of the coatings’ hydrophoby with the terms of hydraulic characteristics. Based on the obtained results the conclusions are made concerning the feasibility of application of organic coatings compared to non-organic ones (for example, cement-sand coatings). This will enable power savings due to a lower hydraulic resistance during the water transportation. Based on the experimental studies in static and dynamic conditions on a small-sized testing bench it was proved, that the Subcote FLP protective coating has hydrophilic properties. There are shown results of an automated processing of experimental data and comparison of the values of the coefficients of hydraulic friction, resistivity and roughness, which have been obtained at the large-sized and small-sized benches, as well as at a roughness indicator. Provision has been made of a possible and reasonable use of small-sized benches instead of large-sized ones for determination of hydrophoby and hydraulic parameters, which will considerably facilitate the traditional method of comprehensive estimation of the hydraulic performance of various types of protective coatings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impact of globalization and technological advancements on businesses is increasing, making innovation and differentiation essential for survival in competitive markets. Branding is a useful tool for business differentiation, which can be achieved by a strong brand personality. Sustainability, as a strategy integrated with branding, offers the opportunity to gain competitive advantage. Associating sustainability practices with brand personality and integrating them into the brand is important, especially for business-to-business (B2B) brands. However, research on B2B branding is still scarce. Drawing on the tenets of social identity theory, this chapter explains brand personality traits from a sustainability perspective for B2B brands. Based on a series of qualitative and quantitative studies, brand personality traits are identified for B2B markets concerning the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability. This analysis will support B2B managers aiming to promote an image of sustainability for their brands in an increasingly competitive industrial market. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The lowering of the temperature graph in the lower-level heat networks is often carried out by a mixture of coolant from the return pipeline at mixing pumping stations in order to maintain the set temperature of the mixed water. In this case, part of the heat carrier is not returned to the source of thermal energy, but it circulates in the circuits from the mixing station to the lower consumption nodes. The presence of such circulation flows leads to the absence of a stabilizing moment of the temperature field when it is calculated by traditional methods, as well as to the “looping” of the computational process and the impossibility of obtaining a solution. In work to overcome these problems, a new computational scheme for commissioning calculation is proposed, which is based on: (a) decomposing the calculation of the thermal-hydraulic regime into calculations of the hydraulic and temperature conditions; (b) using the conditional regulator of the ratio of the mixing station’s output costs in calculating the hydraulic regime; (c) fixing the temperature at the station’s output when calculating the temperature regime; (d) iterative calculation with correction of the setpoint of the ratio controller of the flow rate based on the calculation of the temperature regime.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, they examine the stationarity of the unemployment rates by using ADF unit root test and Fourier ADF (FADF) unit root tests. FADF unit root test is a recently introduced test whose power is not affected by the number, location, and form of the breaks. The results of the tests show that the unemployment hysteresis is valid for some of the countries. </jats:p>"

The data were gathered from conducted surveys with the food manufacturing companies in both countries, and tested by Structural Equation Modeling. The empirical results show that supply chain capabilities play an important role in business improvement in both countries. While, supply chain integration is considered as a critical factor for the Vietnamese food industry, human resource management is much regarded as important for the Thai food industry.

Progress enables complex and integrated monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT), continuous monitoring and real-time alerting. However, the adoption rate of these innovations is not fast enough due to the need of expensive equipment and a robust digital infrastructure. The use of inappropriate technology and the lack of standardization between different monitoring systems often causes data leakage during storage and transportation. The lack of a standard in the traceability tools also causes difficulties in merging the output preventing the formation of a seamless cold chain. This paper presents a decision support tool that helps practitioners to track and trace the perishable products at each stage of the supply chain. The tool gathers data from multiple sources with different data structures, merge the files and fill missing data with the aid of a routing tool and weather forecasting databases. The output of this tool is a unique file containing all the traceability data about the product during its life-cycle. The tool also visualizes the traceability data through the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) based on OpenStreetMap.\"</jats:p>"

Using the methodological approaches of system analysis of large-scale investment projects, which use expert methods to reduce the level of influence of risk factors and uncertainty, an analysis of the sensitivity of individual infrastructure projects to the influence of environmental factors was carried out. As a result of the study, it was shown that scenarios for the development of the external environment differently affect the infrastructure projects of different purposes that are allocated in the work. Each type of infrastructure projects has its own peculiarities: projects of transit value serve the trade and economic relations of European and Asian countries, infrastructure projects of regional importance contribute to strengthening trade and economic relations of border areas, and certain commercial railway lines provide access to mineral deposits. The findings can be used in forecasting the development of continental trade and economic relations, both in general and in individual industries, as well as in substantiating large-scale infrastructure projects that solve the problem of transport supply of international trade.</jats:p>"

One category of products that are sold using this structure is fashion product. However, selling fashion product using DCSC structure it still has shortcomings and challenges. Due to customer can not make a selection, viewing and researching product and quality inspaction product dierctly. Based on this, some enterprises provide product warranty sales system offered. Warranty as a guarantee given to customer to provide security and comfort for making purchases. Warranty gives impact on price of product, both online and offline. This leads to the need to do a calculation the optimum price considering money back warranty. Optimum price obtained in the model demand function using quadratic programming adressing the objective function in the form profit maximum in individual channel (Pw, Ps dan Po) as well as whole profit in DCSC by considering the value of money back warranty&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n(g). The result obatained is optimum price for two scenarios. There are optimum price in individual channel without money back warranty and optimum price in online channel with accomodate money back warranty.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nKeywords—dual channel supply chain (DCSC); money back warranty; optimization.</jats:p>"

Currently, conventional water treatment techniques do not have high capacity to remove herbicides; therefore, the need to study other techniques arises. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the removal of diuron and hexazinone herbicides present in water through a commercial filtration system. The study was carried out in a filtration system composed of the following sequence of filters: sand filter and coconut shell activated granular carbon, polypropylene filter 20 mm, activated carbon filter with silver salts, polypropylene filter 5 mm and reverse osmosis. The affluent contained an initial concentration of 12.06 mg mL-1 of hexazinone and 37.70 mg mL-1 of diuron. The samples were collected in all filters and subjected to the analysis of turbidity and presence of herbicides by high performance liquid chromatography. The filter set removed 99.31; 99.84 and 99.99% of water turbidity, hexazinone and diuron respectively at the end of the system. After the filtration process, the treated water presented adequate quality for public supply and human consumption. The technique employed in this study is easy to operate and has a low acquisition and maintenance cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) production in arable, Mediterranean-type climates is limited by heat waves and unreliable rainfall. Under climate change scenarios, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration will increase plant growth; however, the net effect of increasing occurrence and intensity of heat waves and drought is unclear. This study tested the response of combined acute high temperature (&gt;32°C) at the early pod-filling stage and (i) crop-available soil water, and (ii) elevated CO2 on three lentil genotypes in two experiments. The three lentil genotypes selected were commercial cultivar PBA Bolt and two landraces sourced from the Australian Grains Genebank, AGG 71457 and AGG 73838. High soil-water availability (0.42 Mg m–3) throughout the growing season increased yield by 28% compared with low soil-water availability (0.35 Mg m–3). Across contrasting water treatments, there was no difference in patterns of crop response to high temperature during the early pod-filling phase (5 days at 42°C daytime, 25°C night), where yields were reduced by 45%. A significant interaction between high temperature response and genotype was observed, where reduction in grain number was higher for AGG 73838 (0.20% per degree-hour &gt;32°C) than for AGG 71457 (0.07% per degree-hour &gt;32°C) or PBA Bolt (0.10% per degree-hour &gt;32°C). For heat and CO2 effects, there was no significant interaction between high temperature (3 days at 38°C daytime, ambient night temperature) and CO2 treatment on yield components. There was, however, an overall trend of increased biomass, grain number and yield due to elevated CO2. Although non-limiting soil water did not reduce the impact of high temperature in this study, the range in response across genotypes to high temperature supports opportunity for increased adaptation of lentil toward increasing yield stability under effects of climate change.</jats:p>"

Using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model, a vulnerability index of the water resources system was developed and used to carry out a vulnerability assessment on the Heihe River in the current year (2010) and the comparison year (2003). The PSR of water resource vulnerability included 11 indexes, which are domestic water quota of urban residents, rural water quota of urban residents, million yuan GDP water consumption, per capita water consumption, ecological water proportion, drought index, per capita water resources, water modulus, water quality grade, water saving irrigation rate, per capita GDP, respectively. The vulnerability of water resources was evaluated by the attribute recognition model. The results show that water resources in the Heihe River Basin were in a quite vulnerable state in both 2003 and 2010 according to the values of scenario A1 (not vulnerable) and scenario B1 (severely vulnerable). It is urgent to protect and restore the water resources system in the Heihe River Basin.</jats:p>",

The building energy standards and the main primary energy carriers being in use in Poland were taken as input data. The subject of analysis was a single-family house characterized by a utility energy demand of 47 kWh/(m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> year). An environmental impact analysis was made using the specification for LCA in damage categories encompassing human health, ecosystem quality and natural resources depletion. From the obtained results it has been found that coal-based technologies in Poland's building energy supply systems are capable of reducing the noxious environmental impact. An example of such a system is the effective heat distribution network with a coal-based cogeneration energy source. From the point of view of radical low emission reduction, an interesting solution is the effective heat distribution network with a gas-based cogeneration energy source. Nevertheless, forecasts about the development of renewable energy source installations in Poland indicate that a significant role in building heat supply systems will be played by solar systems and geothermal systems using heat pumps. Achieving the environmental acceptance of heat pumps in Poland's conditions requires a decisive intensification of efforts to increase the share of renewable energy sources in electric energy generation processes in the central electric power system and in local and individual systems, as well as the continuation of the processes of thermal insulation of already existing buildings.</jats:p>"

This chapter focuses on the fast fashion industry that represents a fascinating domain in which to investigate the management of customer relationships due to its particular features of short life cycle products, volatile demand, and high level of impulse purchase. In order to grow in the long term, fast fashion companies deal with a wide range of information to develop a good understanding of market trends. To date, few studies have examined CRM in the fast fashion industry, and thus, this research is addressed to contribute to filling this gap. The analysis of the key functions of fast fashion supply chains from a CRM perspective has been carried out and findings have highlighted an interesting strategic shift from simply meeting customers' needs to driving customers' behaviors.</jats:p>"

The ophthalmic artery can arise from the middle meningeal artery in 1% while ethmoidal arteries can be absent in 5%. The maxillary artery courses as 2 loops in the pterygopalatine fossa in 64% of cases where the descending palatine artery originates before the first loop or on its top so that caution is needed in controlling epistaxis. The sphenopalatine artery has different patterns of branching and may have more than 2 branches in 18% of cases. In 19% of cases, there is cross-circulation between both sides through the nasal blood supply. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Angiographic study of the nose is a very helpful tool for accurate knowledge of anatomical variations of the arteries with a tremendous effect on our surgical approaches and techniques for the management of different diseases in the nasal region, especially intractable posterior epistaxis.</jats:p>"

RTCSs are classified as critical process systems. The power supply system is required to provide a high level of power reliability so that a station equipment of an RTCS safely executes the rail traffic process. The article describes typical solutions of power supply of station equipment of RTCSs. Analysis of these solutions led to the development of assumptions and structures for the integrated power supply system of station equipment. Useful tools for the formal modeling of such systems can be Petri Nets. These nets are a graphical and formal tool for modeling, formal analysis, and design of discrete event systems. The basic element of the integrated power system which is described in the article is the Automatic Reserve Switching system (ARS system). The ARS controller Marked Petri Net (ARS controller MPN) that has been developed by the authors is presented here. The net was subject to reduction resulting in an ARS controller hierarchical simplified MPN. The article also presents the practical application of the ARS controller built using the hardware platform and graphical programming environment LabView National Instruments (NI).</jats:p>"

All issues discussed here are formulated by using degenerated linear programming models (<jats:italic>PL</jats:italic>). Below, it is noted that the linear dependence of binding constraints (<jats:italic>CO</jats:italic>) distorts standard postoptimization procedures in<jats:italic>PL</jats:italic>. This observed fact makes<jats:italic>postoptimization analysis</jats:italic>mostly unhelpful for an average analyst due to problems with the int erpretation of ambiguous sensitivity reports which are obtained from popular computer packages. In standard postoptimization methods, changes to single parameters of the right-hand vector<jats:italic>CO</jats:italic>are analyzed or referred to parametric linear programming that unfortunately requires prior knowledge of mathematically and economically justified vectors of changes of right-hand sides<jats:italic>CO</jats:italic>. Therefore, it is suggested that modifications are introduced to some of the postoptimization procedures in this work. For issues in the field of hydrology, the following were presented: interpretation and methods of generating justified vectors of changes of right-hand sides of limiting conditions. And so, the procedure of generating infinitely many solutions of the dual issue based on certain vectors orthogonal to the vector of right-hand sides of constraint conditions was demonstrated. Furthermore, the same orthogonal vectors were used to obtain nodal solutions of the dua0l model and the corresponding vectors of changes of the entire right-hand sides of the constraint conditions. Then, managerial interpretation was applied to this way of proceeding. The methods presented in the work serve to improve the functioning of the system of water supply.</jats:p>"

To explore water quality characteristics and to assess the impacts of natural and anthropogenic processes on urban river systems, we used multivariate statistical techniques to analyse water quality of a typical urban river in eastern China. Cluster analysis grouped the sites into four clusters which were affected by wastewater treatment plant effluent, untreated domestic sewage, tributaries and shipping, respectively. Cluster analysis provided scientific basis for optimizing the monitoring scheme. Three latent factors obtained from principal component analysis/factor analysis were interpreted as wastewater treatment plant effluent, untreated domestic sewage and surface runoff. Absolute principal component analysis indicated that most of the total dissolved phosphorus, nitrite, total dissolved nitrogen, and total nitrogen, Na, K and Cl resulted from the wastewater treatment plant effluent, most of the ammonia, dissolved organic carbon, sulfate and Mg resulted from the surface runoff. The pollution control measures for nitrogen and phosphorus were proposed based on the source apportionment results. The present study showed that the multivariate statistical methods are effective to identify the main pollution sources, quantify their relative contributions and provide useful water management suggesitions in urban rivers.</jats:p>",

Generally, under EPR, the government uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. Therefore, the green production framework under EPR is put up from the product life cycle perspective. Next, a supply chain governance framework is proposed to launch green supply chain when EPR policy is enforced. Finally, future directions of green production and green supply chain governance are developed. </jats:p>"

A renewable energy system is used to supply an off-grid connected house in Sfax, Tunisia. The algorithm computes recurrently the battery depth of discharge and diesel consumption of the diesel generator and then forecasts the photovoltaic subsystem output power every two minutes ahead. The estimated power is computed using an auto-regressive moving average model associated with a Kalman filter. During each calculation loop, hybrid system energy scheduling is accomplished considering criteria that guarantee the maximum use of generated renewable energy, minimum diesel generator operational time, and full-load need satisfaction during the whole day. Numerical simulations for two typical sunny and cloudy days in Sfax, Tunisia, are conducted in order to validate the algorithm and to compare the performance of managed system behavior with that of a standard unmanaged system. It is shown that the proposed energy management system could save fuel consumption by as much as 11.27% in the sunny day and 9.17% in the cloudy day.</jats:p>",

However, it is not clear if this mechanism of nutrient acquisition, termed ‘mass flow’, also operates in C4 plants. This is an important question, as differences in mass flow capacity may affect competitive interactions between C3 and C4 species. To test if mass flow can be induced in C4 species, we conducted an experiment in a semiarid seasonal savanna in South Africa. We grew six C4 grasses in nutrient-poor sand and supplied no nutrients, nutrients to the roots or nutrients spatially separated from the roots. We measured the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration, water-use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen gain and biomass. For all species biomass, N gain, photosynthesis and transpiration were lowest in the treatment without any nutrient additions. Responses to different nutrient positioning varied among species from no effect on N gain to a 50% reduction when nutrients were spatially separated. The ability to access spatially separated nutrients showed a nonsignificant positive relationship with both the response of transpiration and the response of WUE to spatial nutrient separation. This indicates that nutrient acquisition is not regulated by decreasing WUE in C4 grasses. Overall, our study suggests that under elevated CO2, when evaporative demand is lower, C4 species may be at a competitive disadvantage to C3 species when it comes to nutrient acquisition.\n</jats:p>"

Furthermore, BCT could guarantee a transparent and decentralized transaction system in businesses and industries. Even though general research has been done in the BCT, however, there is a lack of systematic analysis on current research challenges regarding how BCT is effectively applicable in supply chain management (SCM). A systematic literature review (SLR) of SCM based on blockchain does not exist yet. This work aims to explore and analyse the state-ofthe-art on the BCT applications for SCM.

By all means, conventional energy sources destruct the earth, living standards of environment, and health leading to unnecessary risks and high costs. Therefore, nations focus to find new solutions of renewable energy sources which are clean, healthful, smart, and affordable. This chapter explores one of the new forms of smart energy management systems for heating called “heat pump” and its development in Turkey. Heat pumps offer smart heating solutions for buildings that lower the imported energy costs in the economies. The study shows that as Turkey facing severe financial burdens, major factors still act against the progress of renewable energy investments and energy efficiency solutions. However, efforts to improve energy saving investments like heat pumps could be promising for cheap and smart energy source, if only Turkey sticks to a sound action plan developing public awareness and education. </jats:p>"

Personal characteristics include self-interest priority and sense of adventure. Moral justifications consist of denial of responsibility, and inequality hypothesis of self-deception process, and social acceptance. Operational aspects include: low-cost investment, free riding on luxury brands’ marketing effort, and invisibility from regulators. Finally, relationship management involves projecting image using volitional cues and interpersonal relationship with buyers. The themes regarding personal characteristics and morality are associated with their choice of counterfeit business. The other two themes are associated with the use of social networking sites for counterfeit business. Finally, some outcomes of online counterfeit retailing were revealed as value creation for the counterfeit buyers and value destruction for genuine brands’ customers.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study investigates different rationalization strategies and motives behind selling counterfeit products with a special focus on online platforms.

During the last decades, climatic changes, the decrease of raining, the increase of water harvesting from groundwater as well as the increase of population have intensified the importance of water in Tehran. Therefore, every change from water consumption to collecting, purifying and storing drinking water in the city reservoirs is highly critical. In the present study, the causes of delay in such projects have been determined based on experts' opinions about several concrete implemented reservoirs obtained by questionnaire and the related literature. Given to three classes pertained to such projects (employer, consultant and contractor), an initial questionnaire was provided to poll the experts' opinions and distributed among the sample of the study. In this regard, 45 Likert-scale questionnaires were equally distributed among three population; after gathering, the items with higher mean scores were selected for the main questionnaire (totally, 17 items). Using AHP method, the most important factors were identified and ranked through Expert choice Software. As the research findings revealed, failure of employer to pay to contractor timely, failure to obtaining the necessary permissions by employer before noticing to contactor to proceed, and uncertainty and buying project site by employer are the most important factors respectively.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the generation of a tactical-based landscape model to optimize biomass extraction, transportation, conversion and product production within a market system. The model considers various pathways including supply options at landings (burn, grind, chip, bale), centralized landings (grind/chip), biomass conversion facilities (biochar, briquettes, torrefied wood) and delivery to final market. The model solves a multi-period, multi commodity, multi-echelon combinatorial problem to maximize net present value using a genetic algorithm. The landscape is evaluated over a one year planning horizon with monthly time steps simulating a transportable conversion facility mobilization cycle. A hypothetical biochar facility located in Lakeview, Oregon was used as a case study. A sequence of scenarios are used to vary system inputs (logistics, product pricing and moisture management strategies) to put bounds around system viability. The results provide an economic framework to view the Pacific Northwest forest harvest residues processing, conversion and transportation supply chain options. System viability is largely dependent on market pricing, plant assumptions and conversion estimates while processing and transportation logistics are smaller, but important contributors for small scale biomass conversion faculty design configurations.

In designing a supply chain network to withstand changing events, it is necessary to consider the uncertainties and risks that cause network disruptions from unexpected events. The current research related to the designing problem considers network disruptions using Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) or Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) techniques. Both have a disadvantage that sample points or disruption locations are not scattered entirely sample space leading to high variation in objective function values. The purpose of this study is to apply a modified LHS or Improved Distributed Hypercube Sampling (IHS) techniques to reduce the variation. The results show that IHS techniques provide smaller standard deviation than that of the LHS technique. In addition, IHS can reduce not only the number of sample size but also and the computational time.</jats:p>"

The size of pollution particles extracted from ventilation filters was measured with the use of ANALYSETTE 22MicroTec plus laser particle sizer produced by FRITSCH. The results of measurements were generated with MaScontrol software for particle size analysis. In computing research results, the Fraunhofer diffraction theory was used. The comparison of the examined air particles’ size in an air supply canal allowed to determine the outside air dust size in Szczepin district on Długa street in Wrocław.

This is primarily caused by the work of ship’s autonomous generator sets. One way of reducing the air pollution emissions in ports is the supply of ships from electricity inland system. The main problem connected with the power connection of ships to the inland network is caused by different values of levels and frequencies of voltages in these networks (in various countries) in relation to different values of levels and frequencies of voltages present in the ship’s network. It is also important that the source power can range from a few hundred kW up to several MW. In order to realize a universal „Shore to Ship” system that allows the connection of ships to the electricity inland network, the international standardization is necessary. This article presents the current recommendations, standards and regulations for the design of „Shore to Ship” systems.</jats:p>",

Efficacy of strategic activities designed to capture these advantages is investigated empirically in a case study of the Tonghui Agricultural Cooperative in Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region of China. Information from interviews, on-site visits, evaluation of cooperative, member and partner information, and participation in the advising process are used to evaluate the impact of efforts to re-engineer the supply chain for independent farmers through cooperative organization. Specific examples of marketing channel development and operation for Wallace melons and mutton represent implementation of strategic plans. The case also reviews the cooperative’s credit system, designed increase access to and reduced cost of funds for members, use of alternative market venues, and horizontal expansion through tourism.</jats:p>",

The increased health awareness has prompted people to eat healthy and stay fit. In this regard, the food sector has seen tremendous demand in terms of good quality vegetables/fruits, cereals, with hygiene, nutrition, proteins etc. With the consumer willing to pay an extra premium for the quality expected, it has been observed that the producers are still offered low prices for a good quality produce whereas the intermediaries grab a huge share of the price paid by the consumer. This research tried to understand the supply chain with the farmers in focus and explored the influence of farmer demographics and the supply chain issues on the performance of the organized retail. Linear regression analysis was used to test the linear relationship of supply chain issues with organized retailer performance. The outcome of the study implies that independent variables like demographic characteristics and supply chain issues had no control over the retailer’s performance.</jats:p>"

The authors infer that although organizations are willing to be committed to sustainability, their efforts are still limited. In addition, organizations in the sample seem to be dedicated to sustainability in order to conform to the regulations and reduce risks for investors in this stage. </jats:p>"

Meanwhile, some relevant sub-criteria are included as well. Based on existing literature review and managerial interviews obtained from leaders in the southern region of India, these issues are compared and ranked. In this chapter, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted to identify the importance of these considered criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, the chapter concludes with a presentation of rankings and priorities of the proposed seven criteria. Given the obtained results and recommendations, it would be helpful to establish a useful method for selecting the best supplier based on CSR. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, in China, the issue of poor quality construction has drawn much public attention. This problem is related not only to poor quality control on the part of the construction firm, but also to the use of inadequate materials and inexperienced subcontractors, that is, to poor quality assurance in the construction supply chain. The purpose of this article is to examine supply chain quality management (SCQM) in the construction industry. Using a case-study approach, this research focuses on a Chinese medium-sized private enterprise in order to determine the most efficient way to conduct a high-quality project when collaborating with material suppliers and subcontractors. To this end, we replicate and extend the SCQM practices to help develop a more refined SCQM conceptual model relevant to the construction industry. Based on the different perspectives of managers and engineers, two frameworks are presented to illustrate (1) the correlation between SCQM and purchasing function (PF), and (2) how to work with material suppliers and subcontractors; the proposed models also show how these aspects will influence and control the quality of projects. Although constrained by the limitations inherent in case-study methodology, this article consolidates the work in one particular area of supply chain management. It also succeeds in meeting two core challenges, namely to explicate the interaction between SCQM and PF, and to provide guidance to construction firms on how to deal with SCQM issues with material suppliers and subcontractors. </jats:p>",

By considering blood’s demand that characterized as stochastic, therefore information and communication among stakeholders are considered as important cycle in supply chain. This research is objected to design interactive communication model based on information technology with android as platform to create effective customer-supplier relationship to support Customer Relationship Management or better known as CRM. The methods that suggested in designing its information system are Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach, Kano Model and Morphological Chart. From mentioned methods, attributes of design and specification priorities of purposed android system technology design are established. Attributes of design will be adjusted with customers’ requirements derived from customer voice that will further be integrated with technical responds in QFD. Technical responds will provide priorities on each design’s attribute of android information system and will be forwarded to the specifications determination by using morphological chart. Later, work flow of design system will be generated by using Data Flow Diagram (DFD). The result of the research will demonstrate the design of information system technology based on android that already adjusted with the requirement of donors as means of communication between suppliers and customers in blood supply chain.</jats:p>"

The stages of BSCM consisted of blood collecting, production, inventory, and distribution. The main challenges in BSCM are related to shortage, outdate, and supply chain cost which needed to minimize. Naturally, problems in BSCM are complex, it is not an easy task to find the solution. This complexity brought by several factors as follows: its inflicted risk, the uncertainty of supply and demand, blood nature as perishable commodity, demand uniqueness, and cost occurred. This research purposes was to review of various research related to BSCM and highlight opportunities to develop further research in blood supply chain (BSC). The result of this research is a suggestion on various possible future research to be explored in BSC, for example, developing an adaptive inventory model to support blood supply chain management that could be responsive toward demand fluctuation and developing collecting strategy to minimize shortage, outdate and incurred cost in supply chain level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a structural equation model for analyzing the relationship between four latent variables: infrastructure, production processes, transport benefits, and economic benefits within the supply chain for wine from La Rioja, Spain, by incorporating 12 observed variables. The model proposes six hypothesis that were tested using information gathered from 64 surveys completed by managers of several wineries in the region. The WarpPLS v.5® software (Version 5.0, Script Warp Systems, Laredo, TX, USA) was used to execute the model and analyze the direct, indirect, and total effects among latent variables. The results show that the control of production processes is a direct source of economic and transport benefits because of its higher explanatory power of those variables. Similarly, infrastructure is a direct source of transport and production benefits, and some of them are given indirectly. In addition, infrastructure does not have a direct effect on economic benefits; however, there were indirect effects given through production process and transport benefits. Infrastructure is a very important variable because of its influence in the final performance, but also because of its high environmental impact. Finally, economic benefits were explained in 43.8%, 19.1% belonging to production process, 21.1% coming from transport benefits, and 3.7% from infrastructure.</jats:p>"

However, it has been discussed that SCRM lacks typological approach by several authors underlining this fact through their frameworks. In response, this review examines various perceptions, notions, definitions, drivers and sources of Supply Chain Risk (SCR), in order to identify major SCRM frameworks. This analysis is required in order to identify the main issues that needed to be addressed in the field of SCRM. Thus, the objective of this paper is to classify these frameworks so as to identify news issues, opportunities and directions for further study and researches.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Higher internal timber demand compared to the supply capacity of forest has been attributing to scarcity of timber within Community Forest Users’ Groups (CFUGs) and subsequently posing risk to the sustainability of forest. It is therefore becoming crucial to examine the factors behind such high demand to supply ratio and quantify their relationship to help in optimum allocation of forest resources to the community. In this study, we selected potential variables that could affect the internal demand-supply (DS) ratio in a community forest users’ groups, examined their correlation with it, and develop a parsimonious model that could explain the relationship between them using linear regression technique and Akaike Information Criterion methodology. The correlation coefficient analysis showed that household density (0.75) had very strong relationship whereas other predictor variables such as, growing stock per hectare (0.35), percentage of households involved in agriculture (0.37), area of forest (-0.39), percentage of timber yielding species in a forest (-0.56), and percentage of rich household (0.62) in a CFUG had weak to fair relationship with DS ratio. Among the four different models designed with the top three highly correlating variables, the third model utilizing household density and percentage of timber yielding species proved to be most parsimonious model. The developed linear model is of high relevance for forest officials in rational and scientific formation of community forest users’ group and handover of forest resources to such groups. International Journal of EnvironmentVolume-6, Issue-4, Sep-Nov 2017, page: 42-55</jats:p>"

A gas turbine process with a heat recovery boiler, a gas and steam turbine combined cycle process and a high temperature heat pump system recovering waste heat are analysed. The aim is to provide heat as 4 bar(abs) saturated steam. The economic analysis bases on the comparison of the consumption-related costs of heat, the capital-related costs of heat, and the operation-related costs of heat. The results show that the heat pump system has higher exergetic efficiency than the gas turbine or the gas turbine combined cycle process. For the consumption related costs, the economic calculation shows that the operation of a heat pump, working with a coefficient of performance of four and for a natural gas price of 25 ?/MWh, is the cheapest way of heat production as long as the electricity price is lower than 45 ?/MWh. For the period from January 2013 until June 2016 the total costs of heat, based on real gas and electricity prices from the European Energy Exchange, are calculated and analysed. The results show that the share of heat provided by the heat pump system varies between 45% and 76%. Especially in 2013 and 2014, the economic conditions for operating heat pumps were very good. Since October 2015 the natural gas prices have seen a decrease which favours industrial heat supply with combined heat and power systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Renewable energy, produced with widely available low-cost energy resources, is often included as a component of national strategies to address energy security and sustainability. Market and political forces cannot disrupt the sun or wind, unlike oil and gas supplies. However, the cost of renewable energy is highly dependent on technologies manufactured through global supply chains in leading manufacturing countries. The countries that contribute to the global supply chains may take actions that, directly or indirectly, influence global access to materials and components. For example, high-purity polysilicon, a key material in solar photovoltaics, has experienced significant price fluctuations, affecting the manufacturing capacity and cost of both polysilicon and solar panels. This study developed and validated an initial system dynamics framework to gain insights into global trade in polysilicon. The model represents an initial framework for exploration. Three regions were modeled—China, the United States, and the rest of the world—for a range of trade scenarios to understand the impacts of import duties and non-price drivers on the relative volumes of imports and domestic supply. The model was validated with the historical case of China imposing an import duty on polysilicon from the United States, the European Union, and South Korea, which altered the regional flows of polysilicon—in terms of imports, exports, and domestic production—to varying degrees. As expected, the model tracked how regional demand shares and influx volumes decrease as a duty on a region increases. Using 2016 as a reference point, in the scenarios examined for U.S. exports to China, each 10% increase in the import duty results in a 40% decrease in import volume. The model also indicates that, under the scenarios investigated, once a duty has been imposed on a region, the demand share from that region declines and does not achieve pre-duty levels, even as global demand increases. Adding additional countries and other components in the photovoltaic supply chain (panels, cells, wafers) to this model could enable policymakers to better understand the relative impact of trade measures across the entire photovoltaic module manufacturing supply chain and the conditions that encourage industry evolution and competitiveness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable development of agglomerations requires efficient and ecological transport systems, i.e. electrified transport. In order to achieve the required results of operation of electrified urban transport, especially energy efficiency, it is required to closely examine the existing power supply systems. The biggest share of urban traction systems in Poland belongs to tram systems (in 15 agglomerations and cities). Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in modernisation of the existing lines and construction of new ones. Enhancement of RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) and energy efficiency of supply systems is a necessary requirement, due to fact that new, modern tram rolling stock with higher power poses significant challenge for the existing, in many systems, old power supply infrastructure. Furthermore, due to low driving-range of autonomous vehicles equipped with batteries and a need of frequent charging of storage devices, catenary supplied urban transport will dominate in the areas of its use. In addition, it might be helpful in developing hybrid vehicles supplied both from a catenary and from energy storage devices (charged during run under catenary) on sections without catenary. The paper presents parameters characterizing tram power supply systems in Poland. The analyses carried out for many tram lines have shown that even at relatively low investments for modernisation of the tram power supply system, it is possible to obtain fast return (energy saving due to improvement of efficiency of recuperation and the resulting reduction of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emission). Other advantages of modernisations include: enhancement of standards in supply of modern trams with higher power and improvement of reliability due to the reduced risk of disturbances and damages.</jats:p>"

To understand the impact of parasitic capacitances and incorporate them into the design of an optimised power supply, this approach theoretically analyses a boost‐based resonant converter, considering switch capacitance and analysing the impact of the transformer turns ratio on the system's electrical efficiency. The theoretical loss analysis shows a considerable variation in efficiency for different transformer turns ratios (between 38 and 90%). At low turns ratios, most of the losses are caused by switching, whereas at high turns ratios, the conduction losses outweigh the switching losses. The impact of the transformer stray capacitance is analysed via simulation and the optimised converter is used for the experimental validation of the theoretical study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inventory management remains a key challenge in supply chain management. Many companies recognize the benefits of a good inventory management system. An effective inventory management helps reaching a high customer service level while dealing with demand variability. In a complex supply chain network where inventories are found across the entire system as raw materials or finished products, the need for an integrated approach for managing inventory had become crucial. Modelling the system as a multi-echelon inventory system allows to consider all the factors related to inventory optimization. On the other hand, the high criticality of the pharmaceutical products makes the need for a sophisticated supply chain inventory management essential. The implementation of the multi-echelon inventory management in such supply chains helps keeping the stock of pharmaceutical products available at the different installations. This paper provides an insight into the multi-echelon inventory management problem, especially in the pharmaceutical supply chain. A classification of several multi-echelon inventory systems according to a set of criteria is provided. A synthesis of multiple multi-echelon pharmaceutical supply chain problems is elaborated.</jats:p>"

However, due to the credence good nature of CSR, when considering product quality dimension, firms can only signal their quality through advertising or labeling. These signaling mechanisms may be exploited by some dishonest firms who claim to be green (“greenwashing”). Many critics argue that greenwashing needs to be regulated because it deceives the market and discourages firms from going genuinely green. In this article, instead of focusing on the ethical side of this issue, we try to explore the market outcome from an economic perspective. We show that regulating greenwashing may not necessarily increase the positive environmental externality of green products. In particular, even if greenwashing is regulated, firms may not act green when the additional CSR cost is too high or when the corresponding CSR issue is not as important. On the other hand, we find that allowing greenwashing may incentivize some firms to go genuinely green as long as there are some informed customers in the market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Remanufacturing of returned products has been increasingly recognized in industries as an effective approach to face environmental responsibility, government regulations, and increased awareness of consumers. In this paper, we address a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) in which the manufacturer produces the brand-new products, as well as the remanufactured goods while the retailer sells these products to customers. We consider several different scenarios: the manufacturer and the retailer adopt a steady-state price or a dynamic price with reference quality effects in a centralized case; either, neither or both the manufacturer and the retailer price dynamically with reference quality effects, respectively, in a decentralized model. We solve the problem with the retailer recycling the sold copies and deduce the optimal pricing strategies while the manufacturer in charge of recovering the used items in such a CLSC. The result shows that dynamic pricing strategies are much more profitable for the supply chain and its members when compared with pricing statically; the dynamic pricing strategies with time-varying quality characterized by reference quality are more suited to a long-term and cooperative closed-loop supply chain. Moreover, the optimal recycling fraction relies on the recovery cost coefficient and proves to be uniform despite adopting a dynamic price and quality in all distinct cases.</jats:p>"

In food industry, the quality of the food products declines over time and should be addressed in the supply chain operations management. Managing food supply chains with operations management methods not only generates economic benefit, but also contributes to environmental and social benefits. The literature on this topic has been burgeoning in the past few years. Since 2005, more than 100 articles have been published on this topic in major operations research and management science journals. In this literature review, we concentrate on the quantitative models in this research field and classify the related articles into four categories, that is, storage problems, distribution problems, marketing problems, and food traceability and safety problems. We hope that this review serves as a reference for interested researchers and a starting point for those who wish to explore it further.</jats:p>"

This sector is now faced with a paradox, which is to reduce costs, related to the decline in government subsidies and an increase in the quality of care required by the regulatory bodies, while maintaining the level of care. This paradox can be resolved through the optimization of the hospital supply chain. Despite hospital supply chains having a great impact on hospital budgets, many opportunities for optimization exist to improve the healthcare quality. This chapter aims to analyze the distribution of drugs within a hospital in the line of supply chain management. The SCOR model was selected as the framework for this analysis. Then, potential failures that can arise in logistics processes are identified. After reviewing the literature regarding the hospital supply chain and the performance measurement, a framework is proposed with key performance indicators that can be applied in hospital supply chains to measure and monitor their performance.</jats:p>"

The importance of sustainable food supply chain management is to overcome the wastage in food manufacturing industries. In the present research, we identified eleven challenges in the SFSCM on the basis of literature review and expert opinion. The approach is an integration of fuzzy with DEMATEL which can be used for dividing the challenges into cause and effect group. Fuzzy DEMATEL method has continuously been used for the analysis of challenges and is the novel approach for decision making. Thus, this method can be implemented in many fields including automobiles, food industries, retail market etc. From the fuzzy DEMATEL results, it can be confirmed that the Safety and Security is one of the most influencing challenge and has the strongest association with other challenges. </jats:p>"

At the pre-project stage, there is often a situation when the parameters of structures have not yet been determined, and capital investments must be evaluated. Methodological approaches to determining the cost of gasification facilities and the estimated model of cost calculations at the stage of investment justification with the help of enlarged indicators that improve the accuracy and validity of calculations at the stage of pre-design studies are substantiated. It is shown that the enlarged indicators used at the stage of investment justification form the regulatory basis for determining the cost of gasification facilities, for estimating capital costs, as well as for evaluating the effectiveness of investments in the selection of project options. The object of the study adopted electrically welded steel pipes and polyethylene pipes for gas pipelines. Evaluation and forecasting of the cost of gas distribution systems in the article are proposed using regression models depending on time and diameter of the pipe. The regression dependences of the cost of steel and polyethylene pipes of all standard sizes and confidence intervals for the cost of pipes allow to estimate also possible errors of the forecast cost estimation.</jats:p>"

Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods (e.g., tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods) has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, interorganizational, often internationally spanning supply chains. Recent adoptions of the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies give promise at better supply‐chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain, as many favored use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies, as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.</jats:p>",

The safety of rural water supply safety is the direct and realistic interest-related problem that the rural masses most concern. In the new era, we should further strengthen the safety work of rural water supply, gradually promote the integration of urban and rural water supply, and effectively solve the increasingly serious safety-related demand of water supply of villagers and the contradiction caused by uneven and insufficient development of urban and rural water supply. Binxian County is located in the water shortage area in the west of China. The management model of \"urbanizing rural water supply\" that the county explored to establish has effectively solved the problem about the construction, operation and maintenance of rural water supply project. It accords with the development idea of rural water supply in the new era, and its successful experience can be duplicated and popularized in Shaanxi Province and even in the whole country.</jats:p>"

There exists a large potential in optimizing supply-chains for many companies and therefore the supply-chain optimization problem is of great interest to study. To be able to optimize the supply-chain on a global scale, fast models are needed to reduce computational time. Previous research has been made into the aggregation of factories, but the technique has not been tested against supply-chain problems. When evaluating the configuration of factories and their inter-transportation on a global scale, new insights can be gained about which parameters are important and how the aggregation fits to a supply-chain problem. The paper presents an interactive proof-of-concept model enabling testing of supply chain concepts by users and decision makers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Fiumi Uniti and Savio rivers are two small sandy-bed river systems which sediment yield contributes feeds part of the Emilia-Romagna beaches (Italy). Since the twentieth century the northern Adriatic coast has been affected by well-known beach retreat phenomena. As the sediment supply of these local rivers is not well known, an analysis of bed-load transport rates for the last 10 kilometres of the river has been done. Multiple analysis, supported by direct field measurements of the 2005-06 and 2017 years (still ongoing) have been realized. Complementary hydraulic investigation and modelling have been performed. Repeated bed-material samplings have been carried out during different flood conditions, obtaining a significant number of observations. Aiming at defining the behaviour of sediment-transport in these two rivers, this paper focuses on the analysis of threshold sediment transport condition. Several formulae available in literature were used to test the field measurements. All these criteria seem inappropriate to predict the threshold conditions for bed particle entrainment in terms of the value of bed shear stress. The inaccurate estimation given by these formulae is due to the fact that they do not consider natural grain-shape factors or are mainly suitable for gravel-bed rivers.</jats:p>"

Thus, this chapter reviews the literature on RFID adoption in supply chain/logistics management from 1995-2015. We identify current trends in the literature, drawing on the three levels of decision making, that is, strategic, tactical, and operational. We suggest that more research needs to be conducted with regards to the intangible benefits of RFID, the use of RFID big data for achieving higher performance, and to shift the focus from the ‘what' and the impacts on performance to the ‘how' and the ways RFID is adopted and assimilated in organizations and supply chains. Finally, the managerial implications of our review as well as the limitations and future research directions are outlined. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on assessing the crisis preparedness of healthcare facilities as a new module of crisis management information systems. The crisis is widespread around the world, and it is essential that the medical facility is ready. The first part of the thesis deals with the introduction to the given issue and the crisis preparedness of the population. The second part of the paper deals with the analysis of extraordinary events and crisis situations around the world. The impact of emergencies on healthcare facilities is described in this part. The third part of the thesis deals with the emergency survival of the population. The following part describes the methods used in this research. The heuristic analysis of preparedness is one of the most valuable methods. The next section presents the results of the work according to the chosen method. In this section, we will find the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated medical facilities. At the end of the thesis is proposed a new module for evaluation of medical facilities. This module can be applied as part of crisis management information systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urgency of the research. Current trends of distributed generation development in Ukraine indicate a rapid generation in-crease from renewable energy plants. Most developed countries gradually refuse from the fossil fuels use and invest more and more to the “green” energy. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed study of the operation conditions of distributed energy sources due to their instability, as well as the processes that arise in distribution electric networks with diverse types of distributed energy sources.\nTarget setting. In the producing process of power energy by distributed energy sources due to the increase in their num-ber, there are situations where several renewable sources of energy operate to only one system of buses. Thus, such distributive networks acquire the features of a local power system, which complicates the control process of such systems, and also there is a problem with the electricity supply of consumers.\nActual scientific researches and issues analysis. The analysis of publications suggests that in literature more attention is paid to studying the operating modes of solar power plants, or small hydroelectric power plants. However, almost no attention was paid to the study of their cooperation work.\nUninvestigated parts of general matters defining. Only a few works are devoted to the study of the cooperation of the diverce sources of distributed energy sources in the local electrical systems. That is why, their impact on power distribution networks and on the grid in general has not been studied extensively.\nThe research objective. In this article was considered the influence of asynchronous generators on small hydroelectric power plants on the operation modes of distribution electrical networks, and were investigated the processes that are occurring in local power systems with different types of distributed energy sources.\nThe statement of basic materials. Based on the research results, was developed a computer model of a such system in the PS CAD software environment. Two solar stations and one small hydroelectric power station with an asynchronous generator were connected to the power supply. It was shown the simulation of two modes of operation: a joint operation of a small hydroelectric power station, two solar power stations and a power supply center; a joint operation of a small hydroelectric pow-er plant, two solar power stations and a power supply disconnected.\nConclusions. As a result of computer simulation, it is shown that by switching on a small hydroelectric power plant with an asynchronous generator in the case of an emergency shutdown of centralized power supply, it is possible to restore the work of solar power plants, and thus partially or completely restore the power supply of consumers.</jats:p>"

Their impact on flood processes is critically important for flood control, but has not been well documented. The Qinhuai River Basin was selected as the study area. A Hydrologic Engineering Center – River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic model was developed to simulate and predict storm flood processes and the associated impact of polders. The study shows that the HEC-RAS model is capable of simulating the impact of polders on flood processes in the Qinhuai River Basin. The polders increased the water level outside of the polders. The polders in upstream watersheds have a greater impact on the water level than polders close to basin outlets when individually distributed. The maximum water level at Dongshan section shows an increasing trend for different sized flood with the increasing number of polders in the basin, and a linear increasing trend associated with urbanization. The smaller the flood scale is, the greater the maximum water level changes.</jats:p>",

Feeding mode (single pulse, constant feeding; different incubation temperatures) caused strong variations in cytoplasmic carbon and nitrogen cycling, suggesting generalistic adaptations to variations in food availability. To study the influence of intraspecific size to foraminiferal carbon and nitrogen cycling, three size fractions (125 – 250 µm, 250 – 355 µm,&amp;gt;355 µm) of A. tepida specimens were separated. Small individuals showed higher weight specific intake for phytodetritus, especially for phytodetrital nitrogen, highlighting that size distribution within foraminiferal populations is relevant to interpret foraminiferal carbon and nitrogen cycling. These results were used to extrapolate the data to natural populations of living A. tepida in sediment cores, demonstrating the impact of high abundances of small individuals on phytodetritus processing and nutrient cycling. It is estimated, that at high abundances of individuals in the 125 – 250 µm size fraction, Ammonia populations can account for more than 11 % of phytodetritus processing in intertidal benthic communities.</jats:p>"

An extensive literature review was conducted to examine research and practice with respect to the concurrent implementation of green, lean, and global supply chain strategies. The applied literature analysis identifies that lean not only serves as a catalyst but is also synergistic for green. Lean is beneficial for green practices, and the implementation of green practices, in turn, also has a positive influence on existing global business practices (Dües, Tan, &amp; Tim, 2013). The chapter provides an assessment of existing academic research on the relationship and links between lean and green supply chain management practices. Existing explanatory frameworks are explored and discussed, primarily based on objectives including: (a) identification processes where lean practices are synergized with a go-green philosophy of business, (b) advocating green practices as an essential element in the lean value chain, and (c) developing a green-lean framework based on existing literature for competitive advantage for business firms.</jats:p>"

The system of equations in the model of thermal conductivity for the solid walls and Navier-Stokes equations for gas are solved. The article examines the possible versions of the calculation of the turbulent regime in the geometrically simple air region by means of conducting the simulation within the framework of algebraic models (Van Driest and Prandtl-Reichardt), and k-? model. On the basis of the obtained results the authors made a conclusion about the possibility of applying the algebraic model of Prandtl to describe the integral characteristics of turbulent flows in the conditions of natural convection in a geometrically simple area when the air heated by the heat source is moved by the lifting force. Besides, the temperature fields for a typical real object of heat supply are simulated in the article. The values of the dimensionless heat exchange coefficient at the air-wall interface are determined. The comparative analysis of two quite significantly different approaches to determine the average temperature in the heated room, i. e. the traditional balance approach and the approach based on the considered system of partial differential equations is executed. It is concluded that the balance models of the calculation of the temperature regime can adequately describe real temperatures of heat supply objects only for very large values of the characteristic times of the processes in question.</jats:p>"

Subregional case studies in Quincy, California; Lakeview, Oregon; Oakridge, Oregon; Port Angeles, Washington; and Warm Springs, Oregon, are evaluated to characterize the potential economic viability of these novel transportable designs. A mixed integer program is used to characterize the supply chain from residue extraction to market optimizing transportation, production, and plant mobility in order to minimize the supply chain costs. Regional variations including log specifications, energy rates, trucking, and logistic capacities are considered within the model and supporting analyses to differentiate regional costs and market viabilities. It was found that the optimal transportable design included facility movement on a 1 to 2.5 year frequency depending on product and region with biochar being the most likely to be economically viable. Regional feedstock composition and availability was the biggest indicator of lower cost production. Supply chain costs varied by 5%-10% depending on product and region being produced. Transportation and mobilization were found to account for 15%-30% of the overall supply chain cost. Quincy, California, and torrefied wood were found to have the lowest of these costs due to low move frequency and high wood availability while Port Angeles, Washington, with briquettes was the highest. With regards to fuel price sensitivity, torrefied wood was the most sensitive as its conversion process was most energy intensive (±12%-13%) and biochar least sensitive (±3-5%).Transportation accounted for 5% to 30% of the fuel price variation due to diesel prices depending on product and region. When including grid-connectivity, cost reductions were approximately 6%-7% for biochar, 27%-29% for briquettes and 33%-38% for torrefied wood. These findings indicate biochar as the most likely candidate for a transportable conversion system given its relatively low power consumption, high allowable moisture content, and low product transportation cost. Quincy, California, was found to be the most desirable sub region with the lowest overall production costs attributed to its high input quality feedstock and relative accessibility; its higher grid-connected power cost also makes transportable options relatively more attractive than other off-grid locations. Port Angeles, WA had the highest production costs and lowest grid-energy costs. Our results indicate that a rise in diesel price, while incentivizing transportable conversion facilities due to more cost effective transportation, would be more than offset by the higher cost energy consumption during the conversion process when compared with grid-power with the potential exception of biochar. Overall, we see a transportable operation with grid-power would likely be the difference between an economically viable supply chain and one that is not.

As a result, theoretical research have relied on arbitrary growth models to generate network topologies supposedly representative of real‐world SCNs. Our study is aimed at filling the above gap by systematically analysing a set of manufacturing sector SCNs to establish their topological characteristics. In particular, we compare the differences in topologies of undirected contractual relationships (UCR) and directed material flow (DMF) SCNs. The DMF SCNs are different from the typical UCR SCNs since they are characterised by a strictly tiered and an acyclic structure which does not permit clustering. Additionally, we investigate the SCNs for any self‐organized topological features. We find that most SCNs indicate disassortative mixing and power law distribution in terms of interfirm connections. Furthermore, compared to randomised ensembles, self‐organized topological features were evident in some SCNs in the form of either overrepresented regimes of moderate betweenness firms or underrepresented regimes of low betweenness firms. Finally, we introduce a simple and intuitive method for estimating the robustness of DMF SCNs, considering the loss of demand due to firm disruptions. Our work could be used as a benchmark for any future analyses of SCNs.</jats:p>",

By analysing the double pulse test circuit and taking into account the parasitic parameters, the effects of different gate resistances (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic> <jats:sub>g</jats:sub>) and the capacitance between gate and source (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic> <jats:sub>gs</jats:sub>) on the switching characteristics of the SiC MOSFET are summarised. Also, a phase‐shifted full‐bridge power supply based on SiC device is designed, which can be changed from 270 V direct current (DC) to 220 V alternating current (AC)/50 Hz, which consists of two stages. The first stage is the phase shifted full bridge ZVS DC/DC converter, which will boost the 270 V DC to the 350 V DC; the latter is a single‐phase full bridge inverter, and the 350 V DC will be converted to the 220 V AC/50 Hz. The power supply uses the SiC MOSFET as the switch tube, which can reduce the switching loss, improve the switching frequency and reduce the volume of the transformer. A rectifier circuit using a SiC Schottky diode, with almost no reverse recovery process, greatly reduced the transformer side parasitic oscillation and improved the efficiency of the power supply. In this study, the design method of the parameters of the power supply is described in detail. Finally, the rationality of the design of the power supply parameters is verified by MATLAB/Simulink simulation and experimental prototypes.</jats:p>",

The article presents an analysis of current requirements for water supply installations in public buildings and residential buildings included in Polish legal acts. In addition, statistical data on the size of the fire are presented and real water consumption in the activities of fire protection units during events. These data were obtained from the SWD PSP program, which is the basic tool for supporting the actions of rescue and fire-fighting units. It turns out that for the objects in question statistically the largest amount of fires are small fires, where relatively little water is used. On the basis of the comparison of the actual water consumption needed to extinguish the fire by the fire department with the requirements in force in relation to the analyzed buildings, too restrictive requirements for these facilities were noticed. Appropriate efficiency of the external hydrant network ensures the possibility of carrying out extinguishing activities. In connection with the above, one should consider the legitimacy of applying high requirements for the efficiency of fire protection installations in facilities.</jats:p>"

This indicates that an internal failure (by travel agency) should be recovered internally to increase the behavioral outcomes for travel agency.

This means that the doer of the failure and/or recovery (the party responsible from the failure and/or recovery) may have an impact on behavioral outcomes. However, previous literature has neglected to focus on the important issue of which entity/party performs the failure and/or recovery, and the effect on behavioral outcomes.

The aim of the study was to develop a strategy for managing this sector, which allows for precise monitoring of water consumption and reducing water loss. In the course of the research, water consumption metering was carried out using counters, the operation of the devices was assessed taking into account the accuracy class and installation features. It is established that the actual value of water consumption is below the standard. The water consumption decreases with an increase in the percentage of installation of water meters and with an increase in the number of tenants in an apartment. The need to bring the general house and intra-apartment meters to the same accuracy class and regulate the installation position of the water meter was identified. Based on the optimization of conditions, the program management of water supply systems by means of zoning territories and the installation of ’’clever’’ meters was proposed. Approbation of the water supply management strategy allowed within the project to reduce water losses by 20% and use the technological reserve for the modernization of the water supply system.</jats:p>"

There is an information about the negative effects of trihalomethanes (THM) on the human organism. The examples shows that, the concentration of trihalomethanes in the drinking water exceeds the standards several times in water treatment according to the traditional technology with the use of chlorine. The aim of the work was to study the dynamics of THM changes in the stages of purification in the comparison with the water quality, the reagent treatment modes and technological parameters to assess the barrier role of existing water supply stations. It was found that the standard degree of the purification achieves with chromaticity, turbidity, permanganate oxidation, bacteriological parameters. At the same time, the prechlorination of water with a temperature of 1 ° C and a chromaticity of 67-71 °C leads to the formation of chloroform in the amount of 40-61 µg/l, and postchlorination at the final stage of the full cycle contributes to an increase in the concentration to 192-215 µg/l.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper considers the issue of supplying autonomous robots by solar batteries. Low efficiency of modern solar batteries is a critical issue for the whole industry of renewable energy. The urgency of solving the problem of improved energy efficiency of solar batteries for supplying the robotic system is linked with the task of maximizing autonomous operation time. Several methods to improve the energy efficiency of solar batteries exist. The use of MPPT charge controller is one these methods. MPPT technology allows increasing the power generated by the solar battery by 15 – 30%. The most common MPPT algorithm is the perturbation and observation algorithm. This algorithm has several disadvantages, such as power fluctuation and the fixed time of the maximum power point tracking. These problems can be solved by using a sufficiently accurate predictive and adaptive algorithm. In order to improve the efficiency of solar batteries, autonomous power supply system was developed, which included an intelligent MPPT charge controller with the fuzzy logic-based perturbation and observation algorithm. To study the implementation of the fuzzy logic apparatus in the MPPT algorithm, in Matlab/Simulink environment, we developed a simulation model of the system, including solar battery, MPPT controller, accumulator and load. Results of the simulation modeling established that the use of MPPT technology had increased energy production by 23%; introduction of the fuzzy logic algorithm to MPPT controller had greatly increased the speed of the maximum power point tracking and neutralized the voltage fluctuations, which in turn reduced the power underproduction by 2%.</jats:p>"

The research results showed that the PI water level difference feedback control algorithm can make the change trend of water level of multi-pool close and reduce the rate of water level decline, and thus prolong the continuous delivery time of pools with offtake delivery demand under sudden upstream water interruption. Moreover, the PI water level difference method has good robustness and can be applied to more complex combinations of inflow and delivery changes. This study provides another way of thinking for the regulation of the gate in the case of sudden upstream water interruption.</jats:p>"

This OSOSM system can provide a continuous supply of oxygen and monitor the peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of patients who accept radiotherapy and use an active breathing coordinator (ABC). A clinical test with 27 volunteers was conducted. The volunteers were divided into two groups based on the tendency of SpO2 decline in breath-holding without the OSOSM system: group A (12 cases) showed a decline in SpO2 of less than 2%, whereas the decline in SpO2 in group B (15 cases) was greater than 2% and reached up to 6% in some cases. The SpO2 of most volunteers declined during rest. The breath-holding time of group A without the OSOSM system was significantly longer than that of group B (p &lt; 0.05) and was extended with the OSOSM system by 26.6% and 27.85% in groups A and B, respectively. The SpO2 recovery time was reduced by 36.1%, and the total rest time was reduced by 27.6% for all volunteers using the OSOSM system. In summary, SpO2 declines during breath-holding and rest time cannot be ignored while applying an ABC. This OSOSM system offers a simple and effective way to monitor SpO2 variation and overcome SpO2 decline, thereby lengthening breath-holding time and shortening rest time.</jats:p>"

However, it is increasingly getting scarce due to poor rainfall and inefficiency in use of available water. To improve the reliability of agricultural water supply, there are arguments to the effect that water needs to be privatised and treated as an economic good with an efficient price scheme. But what farmers, in reality, think about this idea of privatising irrigation is vital as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. This study therefore assessed the perception of farmers towards privatising irrigation supply using cross-sectional data collected from 240 randomly sampled famers from different households in four communities in the Nandom District. With descriptive statistics involving simple frequencies and measure of association, perceptions of farmers were analysed. The study revealed that farmers generally perceived privatisation will ensure wider provision of irrigation schemes in remote locations, make operators respond better to farmers’ needs as well as ensure service sustainability. Farmers, however, were concerned about affordability of irrigated water to the resource poor farmers when it is privatised. They were of the view that, priority might be put on profit maximisation at the expense of social welfare in a market oriented irrigation system. The study therefore recommends that the Government of Ghana, under the ‘One-village One-dam’ flagship initiative should encourage and regulate private investment in the supply of irrigation to ensure affordable and sustainable supply of the services to interested farmers. </jats:p>"

As industrial players are under pressure but mostly unprepared to take back products after their usage, logistics network design becomes an even more important issue. To allow for a maximum of flexibility and efficiency, we consider an integrated design of the forward/reverse logistics network using full delivery graph. We apply a Memetic Algorithm with a novel population generation to find a near optimal solution for large size problems. The effect of different parameters on the behavior of the proposed Metaheuristic Algorithm is investigated. Using the experimental work to find the best parameters for this problem is the outlook of these researches.</jats:p>"

There are uncertainties about the quantity, quality, and variety of returned EOL products, and these uncertainties lead to fractional disassembly yields. Since the main input to the system is EOL products, their quantities to be acquired is important, and should be determined such that they satisfy all the demands. The designs are evaluated based on four criteria: total profit, procurement cost, purchase cost, and disposal cost using goal programming (GP). A numerical example using EOL dryers is considered to illustrate the implementation of the proposed model. </jats:p>"

Robustness is a key index of the stable operation for the supply chain network. We investigate a fuzzy robust strategy to realize the robust operation of the supply chain network with the production lead times and the ordering lead times under the uncertain customer demand. A discrete switched model of the dynamic supply chain network with the lead times and the uncertain customer demand is established based on T‐S fuzzy systems. Then a fuzzy switched strategy is proposed to control the switching actions among subsystems. Furthermore, by introducing the inhibition rate <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>, a fuzzy control strategy for the dynamic supply chain network is put forward to suppress the impacts of the lead times and the uncertain customer demand on the operation of the dynamic supply chain network. The fuzzy robust strategy composed of the fuzzy switched strategy and the fuzzy control strategy can guarantee the robust operation of the supply chain network at low cost. Finally, the simulation researches show the advantage of the proposed fuzzy robust strategy through the comparisons with the common robust strategy.</jats:p>",

An automated slamming detection and classification algorithm is proposed to extract slamming incidents from expansive full-scale data. This method is based on image processing of scalograms which are produced by continuous transforms, using the Morlet wavelet. Slams are classified based on the time of incidence.

Importantly, we identify a condition where there is no power conflict in the green supply chain, which indicates that the manufacturer is willing to drop its power while the retailer is willing to possess power resulting in a “power equilibrium”. Also, heterogeneous environment awareness of consumer considerably affect the value of channel integration. Overlooking heterogeneous responses would result in either undercutting or overestimating the benefit from channel integration.</jats:p>",

Nineteen years of intensive discussion have been held until the legal framework for the implementation of Agenda 21 of 1992 on the environmentally sound management of solid waste could be announced. The principle of shared responsibility for the product lifecycle, which reaches manufacturers, importers, distributors and traders, consumers, and holders of public solid waste management services, is the central theme of the law and undoubtedly innovates on the issue, placing Brazil alongside countries such as those of the European Union and Japan. However, a serious problem that distances them is to achieve large population densities with the benefit of municipalization of the process of control of urban waste. The rate of effective management of solid wastes is relatively low at the municipal level compared to the countries mentioned. </jats:p>"

This study discusses a supply chain where one common manufacturer uses two different channels to sell product. The bounded rationality expectation has been applied to explore the decision‐making mechanism in finalizing the wholesale prices and sales commissions for the manufacturer and retailers. In addition, the dynamic features of the system are simulated by 2D bifurcation diagram, the largest Lyapunov exponent, attractor variation, and time series. The simulation results suggest that if the adjustment speeds of the wholesale prices and sales commissions change drastically, the system would fall into a chaotic state. If the consumers prefer the online channel, the wholesale prices and sales commissions may be raised and vice versa. However, too strong preference of each channel will make the system appear to have a considerably periodic fluctuation, even chaos. In the meantime, the parameter adjustment method can help make the periodic or chaotic system go back to stability. Therefore, the significance of this study is with a practical meaning to make better pricing strategy for players in dual‐channel selling supply chain system.</jats:p>",

An ontological approach using the KOD method (Knowledge Oriented Design) has been implemented to clearly identify relationships between the concepts of supply chain, risk, vulnerability and disturbances (critical scenarios). As a result, conceptual models of supply chains facing risk situations and critical scenarios are proposed. From the resulting conceptual models and mathematical models proposed in the literature, a multi-stage supply chain model using ARIMA models incorporating the randomness of the demand has been elaborated. In order to adapt this model to scenario criticality, constraints on orders and inventories have been taken into account. Under critical disturbances on information flows (demand) and physical flows (quality of the product supplied), constraints can be reached and supply chain behaviours can evolve toward critical dynamics or even become unstable. Supply chain vulnerabilities has been assessed and discussed.\"</jats:p>"

Many researches try to use more detailed environmental flow management strategies to improve ecological flow regime. However, ecological flow regime not only is influenced by environmental flow management strategy, but also by three kinds of parameters, including reservoir capacity, reservoir inflow and water supply yield. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how ecological flow regime is affected by different reservoir capacities, reservoir inflows and water supply yields and to find a proper reservoir capacity, reservoir inflow or water supply yield under which the optimal ecological flow regime is the best and could not be improved. In this paper, an environmental flow management strategy, which is Four-period release approach (FP), is developed. Besides, social benefit and ecosystem needs are satisfied simultaneously. The results show that changing reservoir capacity, reservoir inflow or water supply yield could improve ecological flow regime.</jats:p>"

We have established the relationship between the dimensions of the heated near-surface layer of the material and the thickness of the film layer of the liquid that evaporated when the thermal decomposition reaction was suppressed in forest combustible materials. Typical times of suppression of the thermal decomposition reaction of typical forest combustible materials are given when the water film on the surface evaporates. The influence of the mutual arrangement of droplets on the surface of the forest combustible material and the temperature of the outer vapor-gas mixture on the times of suppression of its pyrolysis is revealed. The results can be used to develop technologies for extinguishing fires, containment of flame sources and combustion front.</jats:p>"

Different methods were used to collect necessary data from a case study village, including literature review, observations, questionnaires and water quality measurement of freshly fallen and harvested rainwater samples. Moreover, domestic water demand and water supply from such a system were compared, and economic feasibility of applying this system was checked. The results revealed that harvested rainwater is a viable resource that can contribute considerably to minimizing water shortage.</jats:p>"

The article presents the results of computer simulation in the Fazonord software complex of the traditional 2x25 kV traction system, as well as systems with coaxial cables and Woodbridge symmetric transformers. Simulation results showed that the use of cables contributes to a significant increase in the level of voltage on current collectors of electric rolling stock. Use of modified Woodbridge transformers makes it possible to reduce the imbalance coefficient by the reverse sequence on high voltage buses of traction substations. However, the reduction is insignificant and depends on the modes of movement of trains in adjacent inter-station zones. The biggest positive effects occur in the integrated application of balancing transformers and coaxial cables.</jats:p>"

Semi-structured interviews were carried out with mangers of medium and small business enterprises. Results show that sustainability is present in both; however, not fully completely obeying the sustainability tripod concept. The medium-sized company has a higher development of its environmental practices and could be considered as a focal company between the supply chain and their suppliers. Small businesses have to develop strategies, especially in terms of providing legal compliance to maintain their partnership with suppliers. None of them performed literature practices of a Green Supply Chain, but the first company, medium sized is ahead in terms of sustainable practices.</jats:p>"

This paper has the goal of improving water treatment efficiency and reducing water treatment cost based on comparative studies by applying two types of distributed database query optimization methods, including the system for a distributed database (SDD‐1) and all reduction algorithms. The approach involves the components of partial relations and deletes the database components that are unrelated to a query, using only attributes related to a query. Thereby, the realization process becomes simple, with a small amount of transmitted data. The results show that the validity and convenience of all reduction algorithms involve the whole query process. An algorithm is independent of the chart of static characteristics and can realize all reduction states without depending on analyzing the benefits from intermediate semijoin results, which will ultimately contribute to reductions in the transmission of useless data in the network and communication costs. Implementation of the query optimization strategy can improve water treatment efficiency, reduce water treatment cost, lower water treatment expense, and implement effective communication.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The evaluation of a supply chain is a major priority of companies; it is a task that remains difficult due to the complexity of these systems [1]. This evaluation involves a selection of performance measurement indicators, which are appropriate to the management of this chain. It is then necessary to have a structured approach and adequate methodological tools [2]. Indeed, we propose in this paper a practical method that will model in the first place a Moroccan automotive supply chain, according to the SCOR<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>model (Supply Chain Operations Reference), proposed by the Supply Chain Council. This method will also identify at each level the appropriate indicators for the performance evaluation depending on the strategic vision. In this context our research problem is made, it is interested in the contribution of the business modelling to improve logistics performance. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work that proposes a case study believed to be easy to understand, practical and suitable for the automotive sector. In short, this study is a real application leap to resolve the problematic unanswered of practical SCOR<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>model using an industrial application in the Moroccan automotive sector.</jats:p>"

The industry includes the designing of the VLSI chips, manufacturing of those chips, system integration and the distribution of the VLSI chip. With this the industry has raised the bar among its vendors to provide best possible IC solutions and a highly secure product. The authors thus present this chapter in calculating views on risk involved in this area which are prone to security risks and at the same time focuses on the VLSI supply chain with references to a recent survey that illustrates various ways to handle those risks. In the absence of an effective security mechanism, a varlet here viz. an intellectual property (IP)provider or an integrated circuit design industry, an EDA company, a foundry lab, a distributor of chips or a system integrator, may easily lead to design IP theft or tampering with a designed IC. Since these risks compromise the security system for the VLSI chips, this leads to have a sound security system for an apt risk management. </jats:p>"

The demand increases linearly for times when a product is launched and when with new substitute available demand decreases exponentially. The inventory of every player is subject to deteriorate after a fixed life time. The deterioration rate under the retailer is lower in comparison to manufacturer. Under two level trade credit, manufacturer offers delay period to settle the account to the distributor and the distributor also offers some credit period to the retailer. Interest is charged if the account is not settled in a given stipulated time period. The cost of the integrated inventory system is minimized with respect to a number of shipments from the manufacturer to the distributor and the distributor to the retailer and each player's replenishment times. A solution procedure is worked out to obtain the best possible decision for the player of the supply chain. The results are validated with the numerical examples for different scenarios.

It has prioritized a harm reduction perspective instead of a prohibitionist one. Nevertheless, this latter perspective also persists in some parts of the policies and strategies used to deal with this phenomenon in Brazil. This study aims to analyze the structure of the drug policies in Brazil. It is a documental search of Brazilian mental health legislation (laws, decrees, and ordinances) regarding alcohol and other drugs since 2001. The analysis focused on prevention, assistance, and supply control axes. There was a predominance of assistance, which focuses on development of treatment services. Documents have focused more on crack cocaine than on other drugs which have more impact on public health. Scientific evidence competes with partisan political issues and values and the opinions of different actors. The results suggest that it is necessary to have a solid scientific foundation, clearer technical operational aspects, and an evaluation strategy for mental health services to systematize and analyze the implemented policies.</jats:p>",

HSC performance depends largely on the ability to meet the needs of the sufferers which contradicts with current performance measures that focus on input metrics such as donations and expenditures rather than output metrics. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature by examining refugee service performance as perceived by refugees themselves. We examine the impact of information sharing and information quality on HSC service performance. We further draw on social capital theory to investigate how the dimensions of social capital influence information sharing and information quality. Data collected from 276 refugees in Zaatari camp in Jordan provide support for our proposed model. Our paper makes two contributions. First, we extend current literature on HSC performance by examining the impact of information sharing and the quality of the information shared on the beneficiaries’ perception of HSC performance. We therefore focus on output metrics rather than input metrics. Second, we apply a social capital theoretical lens to investigate how social ties and relations influence information sharing and information quality in HSC. We also offer theoretical and practical implications for academics and stakeholders in the field of HSC. </jats:p>",

Generally, the resonant frequency of a TPSS, which is the crucial information for resonance suppression, cannot be accurately obtained through model‐based methods due to the TPSS complexity. This study proposes a direct measuring method that harmonic currents at different frequencies and amplitudes are injected into the TPSS by a harmonic generator (HG). Then, the resonant frequency can be identified by measuring the harmonic response. The HG based on a single‐phase cascaded H‐bridge converter and its control algorithms are developed. Both simulations on a railway system model and experimental results on an equivalent resonant circuit are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Firstly, we perform a systematic literature review on inaccuracy in demand information sharing and its impact on supply chain dynamics. Secondly, we model several SC settings using system dynamics and assess the impact of such information inaccuracies on SC performance. More specifically, we study the impact of four factors (i.e., demand error, demand delay, demand variability, and average lead times) using three SC dynamic performance indicators (i.e., bullwhip effect, inventory variability, and average inventory). The results suggest that demand error has a negative impact on SC performance, which is exacerbated by the magnitude of the error and by low demand variability scenarios. In contrast, demand delay produces a nonlinear behavior in the supply chain response (i.e., a short delay may have a negative impact and a long delay may have a positive impact), being influenced by the supply chain configuration.</jats:p>",

Next, the order decision is represented in binary numbers 0 and 1, in which 0 stands for “no order” and 1 for “order.” The analysis uses the genetic algorithm, sets the objective function, and undergoes testing and assessing the individual fitness function, encoding, decoding, crossover, mutation, and selecting parameter. Moreover, inventory cost of construction supply chain is processed and optimized in Matlab. The research establishes a research paradigm on supply chain management of component manufacturing and materials supply. This study concludes the ordering strategy on construction material, identifies the optimal order points and order batches, and provides recommendations for further research.</jats:p>"

Using two‐population evolutionary game theory, the performance of supply chain members under financial risk environment is modeled. Further, the proposed financial risk game model is applied to simulation cases of global supply chain. Based on the theory analysis and simulation results, it is shown that the cooperation strategy is the optimal evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for all supply chain members, when facing the high financial risk. The financial risk‐sharing coefficient can be regarded as an adjuster that affects risk ESS of both suppliers and manufacturers under the low financial risk setting. By reducing the financial risk‐sharing ratio of one supply chain player, his intention of adopting cooperation strategy would be enhanced. Finally, it is observed that financial risk sharing approach may lead to the alignment among supply chain members. Therefore, setting up an effective financial risk‐sharing mechanism is beneficial to realize sustainable development of global supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most important characteristics of aircraft power system are power density, reliability, availability and power quality. The traditional more electric aircraft (MEA) 28 VDC network is used to power the core electronic system. However, the 28 VDC network in modern MEAs such as B787 or A380 is a centralised power network obtained by transformer rectifier unit (TRU), battery charge and rectifier unit (BCRU) or two‐stage power conversion (AC/DC + DC/DC) from 230 VAC, 400–800 Hz variable frequency input. The traditional centralised architecture is of low‐power density and low fault tolerance. Furthermore, compared to distributed power network, the centralised architecture is of less availability inherently, therefore a single‐stage, isolated, low‐power and high‐power density power supply is required to achieve the distributed 28 VDC network. In this study, a three‐phase single‐switch discontinuous mode AC–DC flyback converter is proposed. The converter directly rectifies a three‐phase, 400–800 Hz, 230 VAC network into a 28 VDC network. The operation modes of the converter are analysed. A prototype is carefully designed and implemented using high‐frequency planner transformer and SiC MOSFET techniques, aiming at higher performance. Experimental results demonstrate the practicability and high performance of the proposed power supply system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the energy problems in Indonesia is uneven electrification ratio. According to PT. PLN (Persero) East Java Distribution, Madura Island has the lowest electrification ratio in East Java, which is 59.02%. At present, Madura gets their electricity supply from Java Island through 2 high voltage sea cable circuit 150.000 volts with 2x100 MW capacity. However, that’s not enough to fulfill the Madura electricity demand. This research aims to develop a dynamic model of the hydroelectric power system in order to increase Madura’s electrification ratio. In this research, we use a dynamic system model to analyze both technical and economical aspect of developing the hydroelectric power system. A dynamic system model approach is a part of the concept which means it articulate the problem as a comprehensive system and relation between each element of it. We hope this research can pull the trigger of energy independence which is correspond with local resource especially in the eastern island of Indonesia.</jats:p>"

These data are analyzed in order to forecast the behavior of the demand. The author adapts an alternative approach for managing inventory during cycles with different levels of demand in order to develop a system that minimizes both excessive inventories and stock out events. Additional experiments take place regarding the parameterization of emergency deliveries in order to configure whether their usage is beneficial.

We analyze the impact of trade-in strategy on equilibrium decisions and chain members’ profits when retailing is competitive. We show that, as for the manufacturer, he prefers the case where trade-in is implemented by himself due to the direct benefits from remanufacturing, and the case of single retailer implementing trade-in strategy is the most unfavorable for the environment. We also show that, if the net value of a used product is sufficiently large, the retailer only selling products benefits from the case of the manufacturer implementing trade-in strategy because the manufacturer can coordinate both the forward and reverse flows, and Model M dominates Model TR for the retailer who undertakes both product sales and trade-in strategy. Moreover, a larger trade-in rebate can be achieved when two retailers simultaneously conduct trade-in strategy due to the intense competition between two retailers.</jats:p>"

There are about 11.14% of the population served by community based water supply (CBWS). In line with the SDG’s, The Government of Indonesia’s program to have 100% coverage of water supply. The limitation on PDAM coverage has led the increase number of CBWS. This tendency has raised the question on the sustainability of CBWS. This paper presents the sustainability evaluations of some CBWS in Salatiga using Rapfish method. In the method, sustainability is evaluated using multi-dimensional scalling based on aspects of ecological, technological, social, institutional, and economical. The strategy to improve sustainability is identified using SWOT analysis. The study performed at 4 (four) CBWS at Kecamatan Sidorejo, Salatiga. It represents the CBWS using deep water sources and spring water sources. It shows that all CBWS analysed are barely sustainable on the dimension of ecological, technological, and social. The dimension on institutional and economical are in the status of no sustainability. Therefore, the CBWS need some improvement and reinforcement especially on institutional and economical.</jats:p>"

The ashes are used in the production of cement, concrete, aggregates, adobe, brick, and insulation material, in the construction of dam and road, and in geotechnical applications. Construction material is a form of cementitious materials based on ash as source material and it is an environmentally friendly choice against Portland cement releasing a large amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere during energy intensive manufacturing process.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The drug shortage crisis in the last decade not only increased health care costs but also jeopardized patients’ health across the United States. Ensuring that any drug is available to patients at health care centers is a problem that official health care administrators and other stakeholders of supply chains continue to face. Furthermore, managing pharmaceutical supply chains is very complex, as inevitable disruptions occur in these supply chains (exogenous factors), which are then followed by decisions members make after such disruptions (internal factors). Disruptions may occur due to increased demand, a product recall, or a manufacturer disruption, among which product recalls—which happens frequently in pharmaceutical supply chains—are least studied. We employ a mathematical simulation model to examine the effects of product recalls considering different disruption profiles, e.g., the propagation in time and space, and the interactions of decision makers on drug shortages to ascertain how these shortages can be mitigated by changing inventory policy decisions. We also measure the effects of different policy approaches on supply chain disruptions, using two performance measures: inventory levels and shortages of products at health care centers. We then analyze the results using an approach similar to data envelopment analysis to characterize the efficient frontier (best inventory policies) for varying cost ratios of the two performance measures as they correspond to the different disruption patterns. This analysis provides insights into the consequences of choosing an inappropriate inventory policy when disruptions take place.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Malaysia, chlorination is used for drinking water disinfection at water treatment plants due to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. However, the use of chlorine poses potential health risks due to the formation of disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs). THMs are formed due to the reaction between chlorine and some natural organic matter. The objective of the study is to analyze the level of THMs in the water supply in Perlis, Malaysia. The water samples were collected from end-user tap water near the water treatment plant (WTP) located in Perlis, including Timah Tasoh WTP, Kampung Sungai Baru WTP, Arau Phase I, II, III, and IV WTPs. The THMs were analyzed using a Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that the water supply from Timah Tasoh WTP generates the most THMs, whereas Kuala Sungai Baru shows the fewest amounts of total THMs. In conclusion, the presence of THMs in tap water has caused great concern since these components can cause cancer in humans. Therefore, the identification of THM formation is crucial in order to make sure that the tap water quality remains at acceptable safety levels.</jats:p>"

Sustainable supply chain (SSC) risk management is a supply chain strategy that aligns economic goals with a supply chain's ecological course of actions. In this chapter, an attempt is made to prioritize and manage the risks linked to SSC. The analysis has been done by combined Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approach, which helps in distinguishing the priority of risks and revealing of the impacts of risk. Initially, the recognized risks are analyzed to know their priority using AHP technique. Next, the uncertainties related to the risks are explored. This is followed by a risk evaluation procedure to access the disruption impacts of these risks using MCS approach. This methodical approach helps in understanding of the probable risks and consequences to emerge in SSC. </jats:p>"

It is less known that water movement is affected by nitrogen supply in leaves. This study investigated whether the expression of aquaporin and water transport were affected by low-N (0.7 mM) and high-N (7 mM) concentrations in the hydroponic culture of four rice varieties: (1) Shanyou 63 (SY63), a hybrid variant of the indica species; (2) Yangdao 6 (YD6), a variant of indica species; (3) Zhendao 11 (ZD11), a hybrid variant of japonica species; and (4) Jiuyou 418 (JY418), another hybrid of the japonica species. Both the photosynthetic and transpiration rate were increased by the high-N supply in the four varieties. The expressions of aquaporins, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), and tonoplast membrane intrinsic protein (TIP) were higher in high-N than low-N leaves, except in SY63. Leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) was lower in high-N than low-N leaves in SY63, while Kleaf increased under high-N supply in the YD6 variant. Negative correlations were observed between the expression of aquaporin and the transpiration rate in different varieties. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between transpiration rate and intercellular air space. In conclusion, the change in expression of aquaporins could affect Kleaf and transpiration. A feedback effect of transpiration would regulate aquaporin expression. The present results imply a coordination of gas exchange with leaf hydraulic conductance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to fill up the gap that the previous research has never explored, the deferred payment supply chain with a risk-averse supplier. To this end, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) was adopted as a criterion to measure the influence of retailer’s deferred payment on supply chain performance. According to this criterion, the retailer’s optimal order quantity and the supplier’s optimal wholesale price per unit product were investigated under decentralized decision-making. Then, the existence of a unique optimal strategy was discussed for risk-averse supplier and retailer, and the values of risk-averse, initial capital, and wholesale price were calculated in detail. Finally, the theoretical results were testified through a numerical example. It is concluded that retailer’s optimal order quantity is negatively correlated with the wholesale price, initial capital, and degree of risk aversion, so that the retailer can benefit through proper risk aversion; the supplier’s expected profit decreases with the increase in the degree of risk aversion, yet the optimal wholesale price is determined by the degree of risk aversion of supplier and retailer. The research findings shed valuable new light on how to manage a supply chain involving risk-averse supplier and retailer.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of interfering influence of traction vehicles on railway traffic control systems is a serious problem posing a threat to railway traffic safety. This issue is gaining in importance as more and more vehicles equipped with traction inverters are put into service. Current harmonics generated by traction vehicles equipped with voltage source inverters can be controlled in such a way that they do not exceed the limits imposed by railway operators. One of the current harmonic control techniques, proposed by the authors, is the use of a combination of SHE (Selective Harmonic Elimination) and SHM (Selective Harmonic Mitigation) techniques to control the traction voltage source inverter. In this article, the author present the results of investigations on the influence of supply voltage fluctuations on the efficiency of shaping techniques of the current harmonic spectra taken from the DC network by VSI traction drive system, using the SHE and SHM modulation techniques. Regarding the fact that in 3 kV DC electric traction systems, fluctuations of the vehicle's supplying voltage are accepted in a wide range, it is necessary to determine the influence of voltage changes on the proposed modulation techniques. The research object is a simulation model of traction drive which consisting of an asynchronous motor fed by a voltage source inverter. The simulation model was verified by the means of measurements performed at a low scale laboratory stand. Analysis of the tested techniques when supplying voltage is fluctuating, allows to evaluate their usefulness in real operating conditions. The results obtained for SHE and SHM techniques were compared with SPWM modulation.</jats:p>"

Some new managerial insights are obtained as follows: Regardless of the two supply chain members’ bargaining forms, the optimal price, the maximal demand, and the maximal profit decrease as the self-price sensitivity decreases. The industry holds advantage in getting higher profit when the supply chain without online retailing channel is led by the retailer.

Conventional treatment processes have been found to be inefficient in removing the two most commonly detected algal T&amp;O compounds, geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), though granular activated carbon (GAC) and biological activated carbon (BAC) contactors have achieved high T&amp;O removal rates. Literature on the performance of GAC and BAC for T&amp;O removal in full-scale treatment plants, however, is limited. This review collates and assesses pilot-scale and full-scale studies which focus on removal of geosmin and MIB, with the aim of understanding the factors which influence T&amp;O removal and determining knowledge gaps in the use of GAC and BAC. Age and empty bed contact time (EBCT) were found to have a significant impact on GAC performance, with removal efficiency decreasing with increased age and increasing with longer EBCTs. BAC contactors have achieved higher removal rates than non-biologically active GAC contactors and were not impacted by age, EBCT and/or carbon type. From these observations, implementation of BAC for T&amp;O removal would be favourable; however, further investigations are required to understand full-scale performance of BAC and service life modelling.</jats:p>",

The capacity of AA in the adsorption of fluoride from water was found to be 17.75 mg/g. The maximum efficiency of fluoride adsorption was 96% at the optimum condition (C = 5 mg/L, pH = 7, t = 20 min and adsorbent dosage = 5 g/L). Based on the results, it can be concluded that conversion of AS to AA can be a method for recycling of AS. Also AA can be used for adsorption of fluoride from aqueous solutions. So AS as a substance harmful to the environment turns into AA as a usable material in water treatment.</jats:p>",

This paper offers insights into how the three forecasting methods affect the bullwhip effect considering the market share under the ARMA(1,1) demand process and the order‐up‐to inventory policy. We also discuss the stability of the order with the theory of entropy. In particular, we derive the expressions of bullwhip effect measure under the MMSE, MA, and ES methods and compare them by numerical simulations. Results show that the MA is always better in contrast to the ES for reducing the bullwhip effect in our supply chain model. When moving average coefficient is lower than a certain value, the MMSE method is the best for reducing the bullwhip effect; otherwise, the MA method is the best. Moreover, the larger the market share of the retailer with a long lead time is, the greater the bullwhip effect is, no matter what the forecasting method is.</jats:p>",

The aim of the current study is to describe and evaluate the bacteriological quality of 2,844 swimming pool and jacuzzi/spa water samples in northern Greece during the 2011–2016 period. Bacteriological quality of recreational water includes heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms and Escherichia coli according to Greek Hygienic Regulation. P. aeruginosa is a significant agent of opportunistic infection in aquatic environments and was also examined in the aforementioned samples. We aimed to indicate the importance of including P. aeruginosa as a recreational water quality indicator in the revised Hygienic Regulation. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0. The quality of all types of swimming pools was evaluated as excellent since less than 5% was found not to meet the regulations. Considering the presence and concentration of P. aeruginosa, the number of samples that would not meet the standards would differ significantly (18.9%). P. aeruginosa was detected in a larger amount of samples (15.2%) than E. coli (0.6%), which indicates that P. aeruginosa should be assessed as an important factor.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the vertical distribution patterns of naidids in GAC filter beds and assessed the effect of an additional sand bed, located below the GAC bed, in preventing naidids from being present in effluent. The results indicated that the vertical distribution data of naidids in the GAC filter bed were well fitted by a Gaussian distribution, and the location of peak population density was mainly affected by downward flow. Backwashing experiments revealed that additional pressure air scouring shifted the distribution pattern of naidids in the GAC filter bed, resulting in a significant enhancement in naidid removal efficiency. Additionally, the addition of a sand bed exhibited pronounced interception and inactivation effects on naidids, suggesting that it may be a very promising technology for preventing naidids propagated in GAC filters from being present in the effluent.</jats:p>",

A dual channel supply chain model is introduced to control the quality of products with more profit using buyback contract by reducing lost sale costs. Manufacturer sells product through retail and e-tail channel, i.e., by dual channel. Demand of products depends on e-tail price, retail price, demand sensitivity, advertisement of retail channel, service level of e-tail channel, and delivery cost e-tail channel. This delivery cost has inverse impact on demand of e-tail chain. This study finds the maximum profit for each case and compares results when advertisement and service level are not present in supply chain. The model is solved for centralized and decentralized ways for RC (retail channel) using Stackelberg game policy, EC (e-tail channel), and DC (dual channel). Numerical results give that the model obtains maximum profit at optimum point. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the effects of key parameters of the model. </jats:p>"

The model is based on insights from the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing network approach and the complex systems theory perspective. To demonstrate its applicability, an explanatory case study regarding a Portuguese reverse logistics cooperative supply chain network is presented. Face‐to‐face interviews and forms were used to collect data. The findings show that the establishment of appropriate levels of business interoperability has helped to reduce several non‐value‐added interaction processes and consequently improve the operational performance of the Valorpneu network. Regarding the research implications, this paper extends the current knowledge on business interoperability and an important problem in business: how business interoperability gaps in dyadic organizational relationships affect the network of companies that the two companies belong to—network effect. In terms of practical implications, managers can use the proposed model as a starting point to simulate complex interactions between supply chain network partners and understand better how the performance of their networks emerges from these interactions and from the adoption of different levels of business interoperability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ocean acidification is hypothesized to limit the performance of squids due to their exceptional oxygen demand and pH-sensitivity of blood-oxygen binding, which may reduce oxygen supply in acidified waters. The critical oxygen partial pressure (Pcrit), the PO2 below which oxygen supply cannot match basal demand, is a commonly reported index of hypoxia tolerance. Any CO2-induced reduction in oxygen supply should be apparent as an increase in Pcrit. In this study, we assessed the effects of CO2 (46-143 Pa; 455-1410 μatm) on the metabolic rate and Pcrit of two squid species - Dosidicus gigas and Doryteuthis pealeii - through manipulative experiments. We also developed a model, with inputs for hemocyanin pH-sensitivity, blood PCO2, and buffering capacity that simulates blood oxygen supply under varying seawater CO2 partial pressures. We compare model outputs to measured Pcrit in squids. Using blood-O2 parameters from the literature for model inputs, we estimated that, in the absence of blood acid-base regulation, an increase in seawater PCO2 to 100 Pa (≈ 1000 μatm) would result in a maximum drop in arterial hemocyanin-O2 saturation by 1.6% at normoxia and a Pcrit increase of ≈0.5 kPa. Our live-animal experiments support this supposition, as CO2 had no effect on measured metabolic rate or Pcrit in either squid species.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research is focused on the development of a low-cost solar water heater (SWH) system by utilizing solid waste material as part of system elements. Available technologies of the solar water heater systems, heat collectors and its components were reviewed and the best system combinations for low cost design were chosen. The passive-thermosiphon system have been chosen due to its simplicity and independency on external power as well as conventional pump. For the heat collector, flat plate type was identified as the most suitable collector for low cost design and suits with Malaysia climate. Detail study on the flat plate collector components found that the heat absorber is the main component that can significantly reduce the solar collector price if it is replaced with recycled solid waste material. Review on common solid wastes concluded that crushed glass is a non-metal material that has potential to either enhance or become the main heat absorber in solar collector. A collector prototype were then designed and fabricated based on crashed glass heat collector media. Thermal performance test were conducted for three configurations where configuration A (black painted aluminum absorber) used as benchmark, configuration B (crushed glass added partially) that use glass for improvement, and lastly configuration C (black colored crushed glass) that use colored glass as main absorber. Result for configuration B have shown a negative effect where the maximum collector efficiency is 26.8% lower than configuration A. Nevertheless, configuration C which use black crushed glass as main heat absorber shown a comparable maximum efficiency which is at 82.5% of the maximum efficiency for configuration A and furthermore have shown quite impressive increment of efficiency at the end of the experiment. Hence, black colored crushed glass is said to have quite a good potential as the heat absorber material and therefore turn out to be a new contender to other non-metal heat absorber such as plastic and rubber.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of high-speed and heavy-haul railways throughout China, modern large power locomotives and electric multiple units (EMUs) have been applied in main railway lines. The high power requirements have brought about the problem of insufficient power supply capacity (PSC) of traction power supply systems (TPSSs). Thus, a convenient method of PSC assessment is meaningful and urgently needed. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed based on the Thévenin equivalent in order to calculate the PSC. In this algorithm, node voltage equations are converted into port characteristic equations, and the Newton-Raphson method is exploited to solve them. Based on this algorithm, the PSC of a typical high-speed railway is calculated through the repeated power flow (RPF). Subsequently, the effects of an optimized organization of train operations are analyzed. Compared to conventional algorithms, the proposed one has the advantages of fast convergence and an easy approach to multiple solutions and PV curves, which show vivid and visual information to TPSS designers and operators. A numerical analysis and case studies validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, which can help to optimize the organization of train operations and design lines and enhance the reliability and safety of TPSSs.</jats:p>"

Examples of implementation of projects for creating heat supply systems in different regions of Russia are presented, from the southern (Krasnodar Territory) to the northern (Yakutia). A methodology for converting data for direct and diffuse solar radiation of NASA by taking into account the results of measurements of weather stations, which provides the possibility of their practical use, is presented.

Methodical approaches to the development of solar collectors structures based on the results of comparing the energy consumption for their production with the amount of energy produced by them during their lifetime are considered. A comparative analysis of solar design methodology in Russia and in Europe has been performed.

Presently maximum line speed is 200 km/h while maximum train speed is 250 km/h. Speeding up limit for 3 kV DC traction is estimated to be around 220-230 km/h. Already present in Poland trains for 250 km/h are equipped with three electric power supply systems: 3 kV DC used in Poland, 15 kV 16,7 Hz AC used in Germany, and 25 kV 50 Hz AC foreseen to be used in Poland on high speed lines. Introducing 25 kV 50 Hz AC traction power supply will be associated with safety challenges, which have to be taken into account already during constructioning, starting even at the predesigned phase. Two key questions arise. First of all question regarding methodology, which should be used for safety level acceptance and secondly how to ensure that all safety aspects will be taken into account. Answering first question for railway safety experts seems to be easy – let’s apply risk assessment and evaluation methodology described by EU regulation under Railway Safety Directive. The challenge is however to define risk acceptance criteria which will be required, and that is analysed in the paper. The second challenge is even more challenging. Author proposes using 10-by-10 safety matrix which was defined by the author in previous publications [9, 10]. Its concept as well as principles for its application for new type of power supply is also presented in the paper.</jats:p>"

It is a comfortable, economic and ecological means of transportation. Thus, a stable and fast growth of this solution. One of its components is the power supply system. It should allow functioning of the whole transportation system, maintaining the following criteria: energy efficiency and modernity. These criteria have contributed to creation and modernization of power supply systems. Where it comes to DC systems, such an investment includes: replacing 6-pulse rectifiers with 12-pulse rectifiers and raising rated supply voltage. In this article, the authors have presented research results, based on measurements of electrical energy parameters before and after a modernization of a suburban transportation traction system. These parameters have been divided into two groups. The first consists of parameters mentioned in the EN50160 norm. Another group consists of parameters not mentioned in the norm. What has been presented are waveforms and graphs showing these parameters. In the final part of the article a discussion on reasonability of introducing new, modernized traction power supply system for suburban transportation has been performed.</jats:p>"

Considering that the network platform’s service level obviously influences product sales, an e‐supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and a single network platform is constructed. In this setting, four models of whether fairness concern is considered by the different dominant parties are investigated, and optimal decisions of the four models are compared and analyzed to study the impact of fairness concern. The findings show that when fairness concern is not taken into account, the profits when enterprises are dominating system are higher than when they are not dominating system. When fairness concern is considered, the dominant enterprise’s fairness concern is beneficial to increase the subordinate enterprise’s profit, but it will reduce its profit. And when the network platform dominates system and considers fairness concern, the sales price and the service level are the highest, indicating that consumers can get an enjoyable shopping experience. To sales price, it is negatively correlated with the fairness concern coefficient if manufacturer dominates the system, while it is positively correlated with the fairness concern coefficient if network platform dominates the system. Regardless of who has the fairness concern, fairness concern can improve the service level and increase consumer stickiness.</jats:p>",

The method in designing KPIs using a triangulation method, ie combining of theory (literature study) with field surveys and validate with the opinion of the expert (expert judgment) as well as compatibility with existing regulations (Indonesian sustainable palm oil / roundtable on sustainable palm oil). There are 29 proposed KPIs for measuring SCM’s sustainable palm oil in Indonesia based on literature and expert judgment. In order to obtain a more precise performance, then the importance level of KPI will be measured using Analytic Hierarchy Analysis (AHP) method. According to the preferences of some managers of palm oil using AHP method showed that the economic factor is the most dominant indicator (62,92%), followed by environmental (18,93%) and social factors (18,15%). In subsequent studies, the results of the KPIs will be used to measure the index of sustainability in the palm oil’s supply chain industry in Indonesia.</jats:p>"

In addition, a novel contract is developed to coordinate the supply chain. Firstly, the optimal strategies of the pricing and advertising are given in the decentralized and centralized scenarios by applying the differential game theory. Also, the comparison analysis concerning on the optimal strategies is proposed in two decision scenarios. It is shown that the centralized scenario could lead to the higher advertising effort of each member and a lower retail price. Next, we construct the state‐dependent contract with hope to coordinate the supply chain and then improve the performance of the supply chain. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the impacts of the price‐elasticity index of demand and the effectiveness of the number of retailer’s platform users onto the feasible region of the corresponding contract.</jats:p>",

The results show that an excessive price adjustment speed will hurt the system’s stability as well as profit of the supply chain. A high level fair caring for retailer will push the system to fall into chaos earlier, while a higher level fair caring for manufacturer will enlarge the stability region of the system.

With the use of a model developed by the authors, simulations of the profitability of the sourcing in low-costs countries (Bangladesh, China) have been conducted. The model takes into account the specificity of the apparel industry, parameters of cargo, value of goods, and demand characteristics. If freight rates for maritime transport services were to increase significantly, the profitability of production in the Far East compared to local or regional production would be lower particularly for cheaper products. The level of these freight rates is not the main factor of the efficiency of this strategy. Simulations revealed, that changes of costs of production has greater impact on this profitability. In the garment market the possibility of quick response to demand is often more important than costs. The calculations were made on the basis of data obtained from Polish companies, which order production in countries with low production costs and transport garment in containers by sea and from transport and logistics operators.</jats:p>"

The essentials of the applied methods and also the mechanism of their integration with the up-to-date information technologies are described. In combination they make it possible to calculate operating conditions of heat supply systems (HSS) of arbitrary size and structure. The applied approach is based on the multi-level arrangement of data and single-and multi-level calculations. The latter, in turn, are based on application of the methods of equvalenting and decomposition of both the calculation schemes and problems. The methods for multi-level adjustment thermal-hydraulic calculations take into consideration all requirements for feasibility of conditions and are realized as the informationcomputing system (ICS) “ANGARA-TS”. The problems to be solved using the ICS and the technology for development of operating conditions are presented. The ICS is applied to sets of real HSS of big towns to develop conditions and adjustment measures. The composition of the solved tasks implemented in the ICS, the technology of development of operating conditions and an example of a multilevel modeling of the thermal-hydraulic conditions of the HSS in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky are presented.</jats:p>"

Using the latest officially released emission data, which is production based, we take a consumption perspective to estimate the non‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for China in 2012. The non‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> GHG emissions, which cover CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, amounted to 2003.0 Mt.

Urban consumption (30.1%), capital formation (28.2%), and exports (20.6%) derived approximately four fifths of the total embodied emissions in final demand. Furthermore, the results from structural path analysis help identify critical embodied emission paths and key economic sectors in supply chains for mitigating non‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> GHG emissions in Chinese economic systems. The top 20 paths were responsible for half of the national total embodied emissions. Several industrial sectors such as <jats:italic>Construction, Production and Supply of Electricity and Steam</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Manufacture of Food and Tobacco</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Manufacture of Chemicals</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>and Chemical Products</jats:italic> played as the important transmission channels. Examining both production‐ and consumption‐based non‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> GHG emissions will enrich our understanding of the influences of industrial positions, final consumption demands, and trades on national non‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> GHG emissions by considering the comprehensive abatement potentials in the supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of today ’s pattern of globalization and a huge amount of information, a smart supply management chain is required. Naturally, statistics and operations research are used for optimizing supply and demand objectives. However, the new context brings out new opportunities at descriptive, predictive and prescriptive levels for supply chain network design, logistics and distribution and strategic sourcing. The key question is still how to capture and to use information. One striking example can be taken from social media, where their use allow to gain insight into the perception of consumers and to capture a real time overview of consumer reactions, regarding one or more specific events. In this regard, different modern approaches, such as IoT or Quantum neural network, are developed. In the same line of thought, we propose an analytic approach, based on KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM with the use of Twitter data in chicken supply chain management. Results identify the main concerns related to chicken products and allow to the development of a consumer-centric supply chain. The proposed approach can be extended to other topics such as anomaly detection and codification of customer intelligence.</jats:p>"

Based on the construction of a miniature hydraulic model based on BP neural network analysis, through the correlation analysis of the flow change of 5 positions and the pressure monitoring point change of 17 positions when the pipe network bursts, the artificial neural network deep learning is further used to diagnose the position of the pipe network where the pipe burst is located.

Powering high-lift systems electrically have a strong impact on the design requirements for the electrical power supply of the aircraft. The active high-lift system of the reference aircraft design considered in this paper consists of a flexible leading-edge device together with a combination of boundary-layer suction and Coanda-jet blowing. Electrically driven compressors distributed along the aircraft wings provide the required mass flow of pressurized air. Their additional loads significantly increase the electric power demand during take-off and landing, which is commonly provided by electric generators attached to the aircraft engines. The focus of the present study is a feasibility assessment of alternative electric power supply concepts to unburden or eliminate the generator coupled to the aircraft engine. For this purpose, two different concepts using either fuel cells or batteries are outlined and evaluated in terms of weight, efficiency, and technology availability. The most promising, but least developed alternative to the engine-powered electric generator is the usage of fuel cells. The advantages are high power density and short refueling time, compared to the battery storage concept.</jats:p>"

In order to solve the resultant MINLFP model, the constrained non-linear programming model is reformulated as an unconstrained one using penalty terms. Two meta-heuristics, namely simulated annealing (SA) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), are applied to solve the relaxed unconstrained model. Numerical results show that ICA can reach better solutions in comparison with SA. However, SA has the ability of providing more robust solutions which are converged to a good solution.

The dietary treatments were (1) milk and commercial starter diet (MS) control, (2) milk and starter diet supplemented with oat hay at 2 weeks (MSO2), and (3) milk and starter diet supplemented with oat hay at 6 weeks (MSO6). Starter feed and oat hay were provided ad libitum, and 2 L of milk was provided twice daily. Samples were collected at 64 days of age. Supplementing with hay increased the dry-matter intake; P &lt; 0.05). The height, body length, heart girth and cannon bone circumference were similar among the three treatments (P &gt; 0.05). The concentrations of serum glucose (P = 0.07) and β-hydroxybutyric acid; P &lt; 0.05) were lower in the MSO6 group than in the MS and MSO2 groups. Rumination time was longer, and time spent on non-nutritive oral behaviour (such as e.g. licking surfaces, tongue rolling, wood-shaving consumption) was lower for hay-supplemented calves than for the control (P &lt; 0.05). Although ruminal pH of hay-supplemented calves was significantly higher than that of the control, total rumen fluid volatile fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different among treatments. Calves in the MSO2 group had a smaller ratio of empty weight to slaughter weight (P &lt; 0.05) and a larger total digestive tract weight (P &lt; 0.05); the empty gastrointestinal tract weights were similar among the three treatments, suggesting that MSO2 calf weight gain may have resulted from intestinal chyme accumulation. Compared with the control, hay-supplemented calves had reduced rumen papilla width and epithelium thickness (P &lt; 0.05), and no discernable plaque formation. Hay supplementation in the diet of preweaning calves improved the overall dry-matter intake, improved rumination, reduced non-nutritive oral behaviours, improved rumen pH, and ensured healthy rumen development; furthermore, productivity and rumen development were better in calves supplemented with hay from the second week.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the latest evolution of the modern supply chains creates crucial cyber-risks and cyber-security challenges. Nowadays, supply chain risk managers need methods and tools for control, analysis, risk mitigation and managing of their cyber vulnerabilities. In this context, cyber-risk modeling and analysis in supply chain has become one of the major research subjects. The first part of this chapter provides a survey of the field and investigates the use of Petri Nets as a tool for modeling and performance analysis of supply chains, as well as their great potential for supply chain risk analysis. The second part of this work is dedicated to our contributions for modeling and performance evaluation of supply chain networks by using discrete event dynamic approaches. Based on the modeling and performance analysis power of Batch Deterministic and Stochastic Petri nets (BDSPN) for supply chain and logistic systems, two original risk-modeling approaches are introduced for this emerging research topic.</jats:p>"

The EPC project is usually applied in petroleum work. One of the important aspects of success key in this project is the supply chain management (SCM). The high level of complexity of work as well as the integration of the construction phase needs to be mapped how the supply chain in this project. This paper used Value Stream Mapping (VSM) method to explain the procurement processes for easier understanding and problem identification. It is illustrated in the procurement process behaviour within a specific period from the total production time. This paper describes a case study performed on EPC 1 Banyu Urip Project. VSM presented real-time data to deliver the processes, material, and any other constraint relevant to the procurement process on EPC projects. Based on a case study on pipe material, the procurement process from upstream to downstream took 21 weeks. It was a waste of time to look for solutions. The recommended solutions use the local vendors, involve suppliers early and provide input into engineering designs, and good communication between supply chain participants.</jats:p>"

For maintenance of repair, repair-diagnostic complexes are equipped with means of power supply, sets of spare property and accessories and operational documentation. Repair-diagnostic complexes can be represented using a three-phase multi-channel queuing system. The study of such a system with the distribution functions of the service time of applications different from the exponential makes it difficult to use analytical models. The developed simulation model of the repair and diagnostic complex allows to evaluate the characteristics of its functioning, the most important of which is the average service time of the application in the system, as well as to determine the required number of channels on each site. The developed model can be aggregated into a general model of research into the operation of complex technical systems for supplying oilfield facilities.</jats:p>"

Our model minimizes the total costs comprising fixed opening cost of plants, collection, disposal centers, and transportation costs of products among the nodes. As supply chain network design problems belong to the class of NP-hard problems, a novel league championship algorithm (LCA) with a modified priority-based encoding is applied to find a near-optimal solution. New operators are defined for the LCA to search the discrete space. Numerical comparison of our proposed encoding with the existing approaches in the literature is indicative of the high quality performance of the proposed encoding.</jats:p>"

The water hammer protection of air vessel due to pipe burst in long distance water supply system was discussed in this paper. According to analysis of the process of the pipe burst, the mathematical model of underground pipe burst and air vessel were established. A new air vessel installation that was installed in the middle of the pipeline was proposed. The new air vessel installation was simulated by method of characteristics. Then it was compared with the conventional air vessel when the pump trip and the pipe burst occur respectively. The results show that both the conventional air vessel and the new air vessel can effectively protect the water hammer duo to the pump trip. Moreover, when pipe burst occurs, the conventional air vessel cannot achieve the safe operation of the long distance water supply system. However, under the same air vessel type parameters, the new air vessel installation can effectively protect the water hammer pressure.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to explore the impacts of lateral transshipments on the stability, bullwhip effect, and other performance measurements in the context of a two‐tiered supply chain system composed of one supplier and two retailers. In particular, we developed a unified discrete‐time state space model to address two different scenarios of placing orders. Analytical stability results are derived, through which we found that inappropriate lateral transshipment policies readily destabilize the supply chain system. Moreover, the lead time of lateral transshipments further complicates the stability problem. Theoretical results are validated through simulation experiments and the influences of system parameters on performance measures are investigated numerically. Numerical simulations show that lateral transshipments help improve the customer service level for both retailers. It is also interesting to observe that the demand of the two retailers can be satisfied even if only one retailer places orders from the upstream supplier.</jats:p>",

First, we formulate this problem as a nonlinear integer programming model to optimize facility location, inventory control, and vehicle routing decisions simultaneously in such a system. Second, we develop a novel heuristic approach that incorporates simulated annealing into adaptive genetic algorithm to solve the model efficiently.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the gradual deepening of environmental problems and the increase in consumer awareness of environmental protection, many enterprises have already begun to pay attention to green supply chain management. However, the price of green products is higher than that of nongreen products, which is an enormous challenge for many small‐ or medium‐sized enterprises. To study the pricing and coordination of green supply chains under capital constraints, a model consisting of a manufacturer and a capital‐constrained retailer is established; the manufacturer invests in green products and provides a deferred payment contract. Setting the situation without capital constraints as a benchmark, this study explores the impact of the retailer’s capital constraints on the manufacturer’s product greenness design; an interesting result shows that deferred payment can help encourage the retailer to order more products and improve the profit of the manufacturer and the efficiency of the entire supply chain as well as the product’s greenness level simultaneously. However, the profit of the retailer will be hurt by the deferred payment contract. Therefore, to guarantee the profit of the entire channel and to make the two agents obtain a win‐win outcome, a new two‐way revenue‐sharing contract is designed to coordinate the green supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rivers inherently show heterogeneous sediment sizes and can also show a strong sediment supply variability in time because of natural episodic events or as a consequence of human activities, which alter the characteristics and dynamics of alluvial bars at the macro-scale. The impact of the combination between sediment size heterogeneity and sediment supply variation, or even with other forcings (i.e. hydrology, channel geometry) remains poorly documented. In this work, a physics-based numerical model is applied on a trained reach of a sandy-gravel bed river to investigate the combination of these parameters on bar morphodynamics. The morphodynamic computations are performed with a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic solver, internally coupled to a sediment transport and bed evolution module, which estimate the transport of graded sediment and model bed stratigraphy, respectively. A 1 km long reach of the Loire River at Bréhémont (France) is selected to conduct the numerical investigations. The interaction between several forcing mechanisms induces highly complex bar morphodynamic processes in this area.A comprehensive set of high-definition data is available, which allows to study the river morphodynamics for a succession of three flooding events and a period of low flows. Based on this model, a variety of scenarios is presented with the aim of exploring the implications of sediment gradation, geometrical and boundary forcing effects on in situ bars morphodynamics.</jats:p>"

The experiment took 12 months and was conducted on 72 adult male rats. They were randomized into 9 groups. Eight groups received cadmium in drinking water (as CdCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) at 5 or 50 mg Cd/dm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and/or zinc (as ZnCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) at 30 or 60 mg Zn/dm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The control group received regular water. In the sublingual gland of all animal groups, levels of oxidative parameters were measured. The oxidative stress index was calculated as a TOS/TAS ratio. Cadmium exposure at 5 mg and 50 mg Cd/dm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> induced oxidative stress in the sublingual glands of the rats.

First, the Stackelberg game method and the Bertrand game method are used to optimize the pricing decisions with the goal of maximizing the profits of the food processing factory and retailer. The analysis shows that the food quality information service level is positively correlated with the price of the factory’s own channel, and the influence of the food quality information service level on the price of the food processing factory’s or the food retailer’s own channel is stronger than its influence on the price of a competitor’s channel. Second, the food supply chain members’ pricing decisions are analyzed using the case analysis method by considering practical problems in the food supply chain. The results indicate that the food processing factory should use the Stackelberg game to make pricing decisions. However, it is optimal for the food retailer to make pricing decisions under the Bertrand game, and the total profit of the food supply chain is optimized under centralized decision making. Finally, we use both the quantitative discount mechanism and the Stackelberg game method to analyze the profits obtained by the food processing factory and retailer. The results indicate that the food processing factory should implement a quantitative discount mechanism when the quantity discount coefficient is greater than 0.4, and the retailer should implement a quantity discount mechanism when the quantity discount coefficient is in the range of 0.25 to 0.4.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain (SC) sustainability has become a global issue. To develop sustainability focused SC networks, the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is of great significance. An effective information system and management can help not only in improving better customer service and in cost control, but also can assist planning to achieve the three pillars of sustainability (ecological, economic, and societal development), thereby enhancing business efficiency. This paper aims to identify and evaluate the drivers relevant to ICT for sustainability initiatives in SCs. The drivers are finalized through a literature survey and use of the Delphi technique. The finalized drivers are analyzed by a procedure using the fuzzy DEMATEL approach. The research findings suggest that “Government support systems and subsidies”, “Knowledge and awareness of ICT tools and techniques,” and “Information systems network design” drivers have the most significant influences in the implementation of ICT for incorporating sustainability in SCs. This work may help practitioners and researchers in strategic decision-making and in formulating effective plans for the implementation of ICT and for incorporating sustainable concepts in SCs.</jats:p>",

We obtain an analytical expression for the impact measure under a beta‐distributed initial loss (generalizable to any continuous distribution supported on the interval [0,1]), under a breakthrough scenario (in which a fraction of the initial production loss reaches a focal company downstream as opposed to containment upstream or at the originating point).

Significant water intake and production of sewage necessitate the application of technological solutions limiting the negative impact on the water environment. For this reason, Tauron Group's power plants for replenishing losses in cooling circuits use beside surface water, water from inactive mining plants. Due to the increased content of chlorides and sulphates in relation to surface water, mine water show significant corrosion properties. However, they are characterized by a relatively stable chemical composition mainly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the geological environment. The surface water quality is affected by many factors, such as seasons, thaws, rainfall, or the presence of pollutants from sewage disposal. The relative stability of the chemical composition of mine water allows for easier determination of chemical dosage during treatment process. The paper presents a stability assessment of the chemical composition of waters used to supplement circuits based on data from 2007–2017.</jats:p>"

Therefore, one of the main messages of the article is the thesis that oil and related issues were at the center of the US Middle East foreign policy. It was determined that the main components of the US strategy were maintaining access to oil resources in the Middle East and strengthening their positions in the region, which was stipulated by the factor of intersystem confrontation. The doctrinal foundations of the American oil strategy in the region were determined. The evolution of political processes in the Middle East, which led to the destruction of the foundations of the global energy supply system, was examined.\n\nIt is shown how dynamic changes in international politics and the world economy influenced the transformation of American politics in the Middle East with elements of balancing between the countries of the region, for which oil and energetics, in general, have become the main factor in foreign policy. It was the study of political and economic processes in their dynamics that allowed the author to highlight critical moments in international politics and economics.\n\nImportant place in the article is devoted to the activities of American oil companies, their economic relations with the governments of the Middle East countries, which became the subject of political confrontation between these countries and the U.S.\n\nBased on the given facts, it was established that the US policy to maintain the status quo in the Middle East had been actually stopped in the early 1970s. Instead, it was not formed the clear long term course of foreign policy, which could provide the interests of the USA and its allies in the field of economics and energetics.</jats:p>"

We assume that the consumer perception towards the remanufacturing products is uncertain and limited. We carry on theoretical analysis of this model and perform numerical simulations from the perspective of entropy theory. Results show that a precipitous speed of recycling price adjustment of the manufacturer or the third‐party will both lead the system into a chaotic state and cause the entropy of the system to increase. The system is sensitive to initial conditions in this chaotic condition. Focusing on the harmful effects of chaotic system, we introduce adjustment parameter to efficiently control the chaos. The results have a strong reference value to practical problems, so it has a great value in both theory and application.</jats:p>",

This study uses integration methods. (HOR), and Analytic Network Process (ANP) with pareto diagrams and method-based ratings. The SCOR method is used to map supply chain activities and classify supply chain activities. Meanwhile, the HOR method is used in identifying risk events and risk agents, as well as assessments based on the assessment of the FMEA method. The output of the HOR method is the ARP score used for the priority of the risk agent. Pareto diagrams are used in the priority of risk agents that must be immediately addressed based on the ARP score. The ANP method is used to determine the priority of mitigation actions.

Combined with the equality constraint conditions for maximum temperature rise conservation, inductance conservation, and structure function of the reactor, the optimization design curves and results are achieved based on the initial design parameters. According to the design results, the temperature field simulation model of the reactor is established, and the results verify the correctness of the optimization method. Compared with the design method of ‘equal height and heat flux’ and thermal‐electromagnetic character without considering the change of encapsulation number, the proportionality factor of metal conductor usage is 0.73 with the optimization method. It shows that the optimization method can significantly improve the utilization ratio of the conductor. Meanwhile, the influence of regularity on the electromagnetic efficiency, thermal efficiency, and other parameters is also obtained. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

If the retailer pays off all accounts at\n   the end of the first credit period, then he/she can utilize the sales\n   revenue to earn interest until the inventory cycle time. On the other hand,\n   if the retailer cannot pay off the unpaid balance at the end of the first\n   credit period, then he/she can decide to pay off the unpaid balance either\n   after the end of the first credit period or after the second credit period.\n   Here, in this situation, the retailer reduces the financed loan from\n   constant sales and revenue received gradually and he/she still can utilize\n   the sales revenue to earn interest when he/she pays off all accounts.\n   Maximizing the profit is used as the objective to develop the inventory\n   model. Based upon the obtained properties of the optimal solution, two\n   theorems are developed to determine the optimal replenishment policy.\n   Finally, computational developments are presented in order to illustrate\n   numerically the main theoretical results which are proven in this article by\n   using some mathematical solution procedures.</jats:p>"

However, its limited availability in soil combined with the energetic and environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilizers motivates research into molecular mechanisms toward improving plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We performed a systems‐level investigation of this problem by employing multiple ‘omics methodologies on cell suspensions of hybrid poplar (<jats:italic>Populus tremula</jats:italic> × <jats:italic>Populus alba</jats:italic>). Acclimation and growth of the cell suspensions in four nutrient regimes ranging from abundant to deficient supplies of carbon and nitrogen revealed that cell growth under low‐nitrogen levels was associated with substantially higher NUE. To investigate the underlying metabolic and molecular mechanisms, we concurrently performed steady‐state <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C metabolic flux analysis with multiple isotope labels and transcriptomic profiling with cDNA microarrays. The <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C flux analysis revealed that the absolute flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) was substantially lower (~threefold) under low‐nitrogen conditions. Additionally, the flux partitioning ratio between the tricarboxylic acid cycle and anaplerotic pathways varied from 84%:16% under abundant carbon and nitrogen to 55%:45% under deficient carbon and nitrogen. Gene expression data, together with the flux results, suggested a plastidic localization of the oxPPP as well as transcriptional regulation of certain metabolic branchpoints, including those between glycolysis and the oxPPP. The transcriptome data also indicated that NUE‐improving mechanisms may involve a redirection of excess carbon to aromatic metabolic pathways and extensive downregulation of potentially redundant genes (in these heterotrophic cells) that encode photosynthetic and light‐harvesting proteins, suggesting the recruitment of these proteins as nitrogen sinks in nitrogen‐abundant conditions.</jats:p>",

A mathematical model with dual objectives of minimizing total cost and environmental effects simultaneously is developed to determine the number and locations of facilities and optimize the flows among different kinds of nodes and routes of trucks as well. A novel multiobjective hybrid approach named NSGA-II-TS is proposed by combining a known multiobjective algorithm, NSGA-II, and a known heuristics, Tabu Search (TS). A chromosome presentation based on natural number and modified partially mapping crossover operator for the LRPFT are designed. Finally, the computational effectiveness of the hybrid approach is validated by the numerical results and a practical case study is applied to demonstrate the tradeoff between total cost and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission in the LRPFT.</jats:p>"

The main scientific contributions developed by the most representative authors, such as Matsuno, Ken, &amp; Mentzer (2000) and Tucker (2011), have been taken into account. A further research gap refers to the specific challenges facing family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within supply chains (Schulze-Ehlers, Steffen, Busch, &amp; Spiller, 2014). </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of LNG for the production of additional energy is topical today. Very often LNG is used for gasification of settlements and industrial enterprises. LNG makes it possible to gasify objects remote from main pipelines for long distances by creating an LNG reserve directly from the consumer, avoiding the construction of expensive piping systems. However, in this case, there are large losses of cryoproduct and its low-potential heat. In this article, we propose a technical solution for compensating for the loss of cryoproducts during storage using an installation consisting of two circuits, one of which is a loss compensation loop and the other is a circuit for generating additional energy. The conducted researches showed that the use of this system allowed to return the previously used for liquefying electric power in the amount of 24%.</jats:p>"

As one of the key requirements of active network management (ANM), efficient power supply restoration solution to guarantee network self-healing capability with full consideration of DG uncertainties is demanded. This paper presents a joint power supply restoration through combining the DG local restoration and switcher operation-based restoration to enhance the self-healing capability in active distribution networks considering the availability of distributed generation. The restoration algorithmic solution is designed to be able to carry out power restoration in parallel upon multiple simultaneous faults to maximize the load restoration while additionally minimizing power loss, topology variation and power flow changes due to switcher operations. The performance of the proposed solution is validated based on a 53-bus distribution network with wind power generators through extensive simulation experiments for a range of fault cases and DG scenarios generated based on Heuristic Moment Matching (HMM) method to fully consider the DG randomness. The numerical result in comparison with the existing solutions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed power supply restoration solution.</jats:p>"

Annual data on water supplies, water consumption, system data, and cost data for the years from 2010 to 2014 was collected from the Public Authority for Electricity and Water (PAEW) and the analysis was done using the American Water Works Association (AWWA) audit software to determine water losses including real and apparent losses, NRW, water balance, and the cost. The results indicated that the average of apparent loss, real loss, and NRW from 2010 to 2014 was approximately 19.5%, 21%, and 40 % respectively. It was estimated that the average annual cost of NRW between the years 2010 and 2014 was approximately 9.4 million USD, which was approximately 33% of the total revenue budget. In conclusion, there is a need for the development of water management systems to provide the best management practice system to further minimize NRW problems in Oman.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Cities are increasingly depending on energy‐intensive water sources, such as distant rivers and the ocean, to meet their water demand. However, such expensive sources could be avoided using alternative local sources of water such as wastewater, rainwater, and stormwater. Many cities do not have robust accounts of those localized water resources, as estimating those resources requires comprehensive accounting in complex urban water systems. In this article, we investigate whether an urban metabolism evaluation framework built on the urban water mass balance can help analyze these resources, especially in a rapidly growing developing city. We first refined the water mass balance equation developed by Kenway and his colleagues in 2011 for a developing country context with the inclusion of some significant components such as system loss. Then, we applied the refined equation for the first time to Bangalore city in India, a developing country, for the year 2013–2014 as a real case example, which is a rare water mass balance analysis of its kind. The refined equation helped analyze Bangalore's urban water system. The total available wastewater, stormwater, and rainwater were 656 gigaliters (GL). The gap between water demand and supply could be met if 54% of this recycled potential were harnessed. Wastewater had enough potential (362 GL) to replace the whole centralized water supply from the Cauvery. A scenario analysis showed that the gap between water demand and supply in 2021 can be met if 60% of total recycled potential is utilized. This approach can be used to help other cities identify the potential of alternative water sources and support integrated water planning and monitoring water metabolic performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to determine the impact caused by demand variations in the supply chain, and how capacity, inventory, process or workforce operational policies can mitigate this impact, and help management achieve a competitive chain in order delivery, a Discrete Events Simulation Model was developed to observe the behavior of the queues and a Simulation Models of Continuous Processes or Systems Dynamics, to test operational policies. Managing a Supply Chain represents an important challenge, especially considering the need to make it competitive, consequently, having a balanced supply chain configured allows better understanding the existing relationships between the operational policies and the underlying structure, and their link with the behavior dynamic system without creating incompatibilities. It was demonstrated in this study that the use of operational policies in the Supply Chains integrated by PyMES as tools to improve competitiveness in the delivery of orders and the convenience of applying these operational policies in a combined manner as a way to avoid imbalances in the system, such as: Accelerated growth in the level of pending orders that causes a deterioration in the credibility of the chain and consequently a decrease in orders. With this demonstration, one of the most important contributions of this work was achieved: Contribute to reduce the uncertainty in the decision making of the chain administrator, because it can quickly analyze which combination of operational policies is better is more effective in the face of a change on demand and before putting it into practice.</jats:p>"

Using a stock-flow model, we compare a baseline scenario with scenarios that incorporate an exemplary technological innovation: a novel aluminum–cerium–magnesium alloy. We find that the introduction of the novel alloy demonstrates that even low penetration rates can exceed domestic cerium production capacity, illustrating possible consequences of technological innovations to material supply and demand. End-of-life vehicles can, however, overtake domestic mining as a source of materials, calling for proper technologies and policies to utilize this emerging source. The long-term importing of critical materials in manufactured and semi-manufactured products shifts the location of material stocks and hence future secondary supply of high-value materials, culminating in a double benefit to the importing country. This modeling approach is adaptable to the study of varied scenarios and materials, linking technologies with supply and demand dynamics in order to understand their potential economic and environmental consequences.</jats:p>"

The land cover of a certain area is a significant factor affecting the watershed hydrology. This also affects the quantity of water supply within the watershed. This study assessed the impacts of the changing land cover of the Ipo watershed, a part of the Angat-Ipo-La Mesa water system which is the main source of Metro Manila’s water supply. The environmental impacts were assessed using the interaction of vegetation cover changes and the output flow rates in Ipo watershed. Using hydrologic modelling system, the hydrological balance using rainfall, vegetation and terrain data of the watershed was simulated. Over the years, there has been a decreasing land cover within the watershed caused mostly by deforestation and other human activities. This significant change in the land cover resulted to extreme increase in water discharge at all streams and rivers in the watershed and the water balance of the area were affected as saturation and shape of the land terrain changes.</jats:p>"

A fractional‐factorial design of experiments is performed to analyze the effects of capacity, quality, delivery time, and interest rate on profit and system performance. The model is formulated as a mixed‐integer linear programming problem and solved by using well‐known commercial software. The usage of factorial experiments combined with mathematical optimization is a novel approach to address supply chain network design problems. The application of the proposed model to a case study shows that this combination of techniques yields satisfying results in terms of both its behavior and the obtained managerial insights. An ANOVA analysis is executed to quantify the effects of each factor and their interactions. In the analyzed case study, the transportation cost is the most relevant cost component, and the most relevant opportunity for profit improvement is found in the factor of quality. The proposed combination of methods can be adapted to different problems and industries.</jats:p>",

The efficient demand forecast system is a useful method to accomplish prior goals, improve customer satisfaction and reduce out of stock conditions for products. The main idea behind this study is to predict the demand of products for future and increase the sales revenue of grocery retailing industry by using two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). In this study, the dataset of a supermarket located in Pakistan is used which comprises of the actual demand of the past year. The results specified that SVM ensured a better-forecasted quality rather than ANN.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The zygomaticus major (ZM) is important for the human smile. There are conflicting data about whether the zygomatic or buccal branches of the facial nerve are responsible for its motor innervation. The literature provides no precise distinction of the transition zone between these two branch systems. In this study, a definition to distinguish the facial nerve branches at the level of the body of the zygoma is proposed. In the light of this definition, we conducted an anatomical study to determine how the source of innervation of the ZM was distributed. A total of 96 fresh‐frozen cadaveric facial halves were dissected under loupe magnification. A hemiparotidectomy was followed by antegrade microsurgical dissection. Any branch topographically lying superficial to the zygoma or touching it was classed as zygomatic, and any neighboring inferior branch was considered buccal. The arborization of the facial nerve was diffuse in all cases. In 64 out of 96 specimens (67%, 95% CI: 56% to 76%), zygomatic branches innervated the ZM. Buccal branches innervated ZM in the other 32 facial halves (33%, 95% CI: 24% to 44%). There were no differences in respect of sex or facial side. All facial halves displayed additional branches, which crossed the muscle on its inner surface without supplying it. In 31 specimens, a nerve branch ran superficial to ZM in its cranial third. According to our classification, the zygomaticus major is innervated by zygomatic branches in 67% of cases and by buccal branches in 33%.  Clin.

Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) has been described as a sensitive marker of iron‐deficient erythropoiesis, before Hb decreases. It is a relatively cheap, rapid, and easy‐to‐perform measurement in a drop of whole blood. To assess the utility of ZPP measurement in donor management we examined whether ZPP and Hb levels among first‐time donors differ from repeat donors. We further explored whether ZPP increases over subsequent donations at a donor population level and whether increasing ZPP levels coincide with decreasing Hb levels and donor deferral.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>We included first‐time (n = 4983) and repeat (n = 3533) whole blood donors from the ZPP and Iron in the Netherlands Cohort (ZINC) study.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper discusses the measures adopted by Sara-tov City Council in 1914–1917 to counter the food crisis characterized by the shortage of foodstuff and inflation. The author identifies foodstuffs that have been strongly affected by the crisis (grain and its derivatives (flour and bread), meat, and sugar). It is necessary to divide the concept of supply into intra-urban rationing (distribution of goods in the city) and extra-urban rationing (the delivery of goods to the city). The author emphasized that the extra-urban supply was carried out by the City Council with the assistance of the high-rank officials of a province. The main activities related to the distribution of goods among the residents of Saratov included the introduction of maximum prices of (tariffs on) products through compulsory regulations, food rationing, attempts to create municipal enterprises (bakeries, abattoirs, and dairy farms), the imposition of restrictions on the production of certain goods. The author concludes that the above-mentioned events have had a negative impact on the financial situation of the city.</jats:p>",

We implemented a 3-year WASH project in two urban slums in Uganda with a focus on safe drinking water and improvement in sanitation. The project implemented community and school interventions in addition to capacity building initiatives. Community interventions included home improvement campaigns, clean-up exercises, water quality assessment, promotion of drinking safe water through household point-of-use chlorination, promotion of hand washing, and support towards solid waste management. In schools, the project supported health clubs and provided them with “talking compound” messages. The capacity building initiatives undertaken included training of youth and community health workers. Project evaluation revealed several improvements in WASH status of the slums including increase in piped water usage from 38% to 86%, reduction in use of unprotected water sources from 30% to 2%, reduction in indiscriminate disposal of solid waste from 18% to 2%, and increase in satisfaction with solid waste management services from 40% to 92%. Such proactive and sustainable community interventions have the potential to not only improve lives of slum inhabitants in developing countries but also create lasting impact.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The risk management for agricultural products supply chain is more complex than that for typical manufacturing supply chain. Agricultural production is vulnerable to severe weather such as heavy rain, cyclones, and cold wave, which challenges the matching of random output with random demand for agricultural products supply chains. The goal of this paper is to design an effective risk transfer mechanism for managing severe weather risks so as to ensure the stable operation of the agricultural products supply chain. We study the coordination of two‐level agricultural products supply chain with a single company and a single farmer under the influence of severe weather. Taking rainstorm weather as an example, this paper designs a risk transfer mechanism based on weather index (rainfall) insurance: “rainfall index insurance + revenue sharing + risk transfer fee.” It is found that this risk transfer mechanism can overcome distortion of the farmer’s agricultural investment level under the influence of severe weather. When the contract parameters meet certain conditions, using the risk transfer mechanism can achieve the supply chain coordination and a win‐win situation. More importantly, weather change does not affect the Pareto improvement of the company and the farmer under the risk transfer mechanism. In addition, we also find that the company can incentivize the farmer to purchase weather index insurance and use the insurance market to shift the severe weather risk encountered during the agricultural production to protect the company’s and farmer’s income and the stable operation of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main challenges in medicine is to guarantee an appropriate drug supply according to the real needs of patients. Closed‐loop strategies have been widely used to develop automatic solutions based on feedback variables. However, when the variable of interest cannot be directly measured or there is a lack of knowledge behind the process, it turns into a difficult issue to solve. In this research, a novel algorithm to approach this problem is presented. The main objective of this study is to provide a new general algorithm capable of determining the influence of a certain clinical variable in the decision making process for drug supply and then defining an automatic system able to guide the process considering this information. Thus, this new technique will provide a way to validate a given physiological signal as a feedback variable for drug titration. In addition, the result of the algorithm in terms of fuzzy rules and membership functions will define a fuzzy‐based decision system for the drug delivery process. The method proposed is based on a Fuzzy Inference System whose structure is obtained through a decision tree algorithm. A four‐step methodology is then developed: data collection, preprocessing, Fuzzy Inference System generation, and the validation of results. To test this methodology, the analgesia control scenario was analysed. Specifically, the viability of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) as a guiding variable for the analgesic process during surgical interventions was studied. Real data was obtained from fifteen patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Proper supplier selection to meet production demand is a major aspect of all manufacturing and process industries. Green supplier selection has been one of the most critical factors for environmental protection on account of increasing consumption levels and for sustainable development as well. This paper aims at developing an applicable methodology for green supplier selection for the process industry. In this study, both economic and environmental criteria are considered and a comprehensive weighted grey incidence decision approach for green supplier evaluation and selection in a process industry is proposed. First, an overall green supplier selection index system for process industries is considered; then a weighted grey incidence decision‐making model with improved grey incidence coefficients and weighted degree of grey incidence is provided. Improved grey incidence coefficients are defined using transformation sequences of the initial data. To eliminate the ill effects from the use of equal weights, the maximum entropy method is used to determine the weights of the improved grey incidence coefficients. An application example is proposed with the data collected for the chemical processing industry, which provides acceptable results in determining the better supplier. In the end appendix, some theory regarding the weights for grey incidence coefficients is proposed. The empirical results indicate that the model is of great practical value for green supplier selection in the process industry.</jats:p>",

This chapter is based on the EU Project “Implementation of ECVET for Qualification Design in Drinking Water Treatment Plants and Sanitation for Pure Drinkable Water-PUREH2O” that contributes to the recognition and transparency of qualifications at the EU level and provides an innovative model for competencies for the potable water sector. The main dilemma that PURE-H2O intends to tackle is the lack of mutual recognition of qualification that is often impaired by national restrictions by applying EUROPASS, European/National Qualification Framework (EQF/NQF), and the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) instruments. The aim of the project is to enhance the quality and performance of VET system improving education in drinking water supply and development. This project could also be achieved through promoting creativity, innovation, and transfer of EQF/NQF principles in education of the main target group in the sector. </jats:p>"

Furthermore, offer of delay payment is advantageous for retailers as they do not have to pay the supplier immediately at the time of procurement. In this chapter, we study inventory policies with trade credit from a single supplier to two retailers. We consider the item with deterioration as loss of utility is the real situation of items like fruits, vegetables, juices, ice-creams, etc. To reduce deterioration of the item, vendor spends capital on preservation technology to preserve the item. Here, time dependent quadratic demand is discussed which is suitable for the items whose demand increases primarily and afterward it starts to decrease. Formerly, we present the centralized inventory system in which supplier and retailers willingly take joint decision. Succeeding, we address the decentralized inventory system in which a supplier and both retailers take individual decisions. </jats:p>"

These waste‐rock piles pose environmental risks because their weathering (i.e., sulfide oxidation) may generate acidic and metal‐laden drainage. However, the reaction and transport limitations controlling sulfide oxidation remain poorly described at field scales. Here, we present comprehensive multiyear data from two instrumented boreholes in an operational waste‐rock pile at the Antamina mine in Peru. Localized but significant (∼20 m) sections of reactive waste rock with up to 20% (w/w) sulfide existed at depths of up to 100 m in the pile, and their oxidation with rates of up to 1 × 10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup> kg S m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> completely consumed pore‐gas O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and generated temperatures &gt;40°C. Using mass‐transport calculations, we show that advective rather than diffusive O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ingress controlled the sulfide oxidation rates in reactive regions of the waste‐rock pile. Sulfide weathering rates in the less reactive zones of the pile were not limited by O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ingress, independent of the gas transport mechanism, with the exception of fine‐grained waste rock at or near complete water saturation. Our results demonstrate the pronounced effects of physical and mineralogical heterogeneity on O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to waste‐rock piles and controls of gas transport on waste‐rock weathering rates.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the study of water supply dams in Malaysia using the Storage Yield Reliability (SYR) model. The model is a linearized regressed equation with five independent variables comprising of hydrological and physical properties of the reservoir system, namely dam inflows and its statistical moment properties, reservoir storage capacity, and designated return periods or probability of non-exceedance of low flow. A total of twenty eight water supply reservoir schemes were selected for comparison in this study. Seventeen and eleven reservoirs respectively operated under direct supply (DS) and regulating reservoir (RR) modes. The estimated SYR yields were compared to the known water treatment plant (WTP) capacities of these reservoir schemes. Out of five variables, catchment area (indirectly proportionate to dam inflows) and storage capacity are positively correlated to the estimated SYR yields. The SYR model adopted in this study could provide quick yield assessment for all the twenty eight DS and RR reservoir schemes in Malaysia. In summary, the multivariate regression model SYR approach can be used as the first screening process of DS and RR operation mode reservoir yield estimation in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

The water from the public water\n   supply is alkaline (?calcic?, ?bicarbonate water?) and very hard, due to the\n   increased Ca content.

The maintenance of the cell water status and protection of cellular components against dehydration are important for drought tolerance, and the N status of plants affects the regulation of various respective metabolic processes. A 2‐year pot trial with 17 potato cultivars was conducted under a rain‐out shelter including two water regimes and two N‐levels to investigate genotypic differences concerning osmotic adjustment (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content>) and relevant biochemical traits in relation to nitrogen (N) supply. Drought stress resulted in a rapid decrease in the leaf osmotic potential. The N, protein and proline contents increased under drought, while the N protein/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N<jats:sub>K</jats:sub></jats:styled-content><jats:sub>jeldahl</jats:sub>ratio decreased. Initially, total soluble sugars increased at both N‐levels but dropped back to the control level at high N‐availability under prolonged drought while remaining high in N‐deficient plants. Results indicate that potatoes have only a limited capacity of active<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OA</jats:styled-content>and that increasing sugar and proline concentrations are rather associated with the protection of cellular components. High N supply promoted the N protein/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N<jats:sub>K</jats:sub></jats:styled-content><jats:sub>jeldahl</jats:sub>ratio at short‐term drought and enhanced proline accumulation. Significant genotypic differences were observed for all investigated traits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper, considering risk aversion and fair concern, establishes a dynamic price game model of a dual‐channel supply chain in which dual‐channel retailer sells products through traditional channel and online channel and the online retailer only sells products through online channel. The stability of the system and the influences of different parameter values on utilities are analyzed emphatically using game theory and nonlinear dynamic theory, such as 2D and 3D bifurcation diagram, parameter plot basin, chaos attractor, and sensitivity to initial value. The results find that the system is more likely to lose stability and fall into chaos with the customer demand fluctuating greatly. The system enters into chaos through flip bifurcation with the increase of the price adjustment speed; adjusting the risk‐aversion levels or the fairness concern levels of the two retailers can make the system be in a stable state or delay the occurrence of system instability. When the system is in chaos, the average utility of the online retailer will decrease and one of the dual‐channel retailers will increase. Using the state feedback control method, the system can return to a stable state from chaos by selecting appropriate control parameters. The research of this paper is of great significance to the decision‐makers’ price decision and supply chain operation management.</jats:p>",

Fast and precise location of faults is important for restoring power supply systems. In this paper, considering the interference of information uncertainty to fault diagnosis under different weather conditions, a fault diagnosis model based on Bayesian network is proposed. The model inherits the capability of processing uncertain information of a Bayesian network and divides the information into historical information and evidence information. The uncertainty of historical information is reduced by modifying the parameters through improving parameter learning formulas, while that of evidence information can be reduced by logical judgment. A fault simulation model based on Monte Carlo method is used to generate simulation data for parameter learning, and a case study confirms the correctness of the proposed fault diagnosis and fault simulation models. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The effectiveness of a business depends to a great extent on\n   the ability to use the environment in the procurement of resources necessary\n   for functioning. The aim of the research is to identify the main problems in\n   forest management in the South Morava Forest Area (SMFA), in the production\n   and sales of beech roundwood, as well as to determinate the characteristics\n   of the companies and the organization of the raw materials procurement\n   process. The data were collected in the period 2014- 2017, by surveying 13\n   representatives of small and medium enterprises and 1 large company and\n   interviewing 5 employees of Forest Estate ?Vranje? (Public enterprise\n   ?Srbijasume?). The current situation in the SMFA is characterized by an\n   unfavourable structure of beech coppice forests, inadequate forest openness\n   and low wood mobilization from private forests. Analyzed companies are,\n   mostly, micro and small (79.0%), founded (64.3%) less than 10 years ago, and\n   50% of them are engaged in sawmill and wood processing. All companies\n   purchase and use beech technical roundwood. Wood raw material is purchased\n   from the public and private sectors. Transport of raw materials is carried\n   out through intermediaries (92.9%) and on ?bad? and ?very bad? (71.0%)\n   infrastructure. However, the majority (92.9%) of them are ?partially\n   satisfied? and ?satisfied? with the quantity and quality of delivered raw\n   materials. There is a significant presence (86.0%) of enterprises, which, in\n   addition to technical roundwood, procure and use other wood products\n   (fibreboards and other reproduction materials) from suppliers from other\n   regions. Based on the analysis of all collected data, places for improvement\n   of wood raw materials procurement and the weaknesses of existing supply\n   chains have been defined, as well as the proposals for improving the\n   organization of the procurement of wood raw materials at SMFA.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper formulates two groups of multiperiod production and ordering models with call and bidirectional option contracts for a two-party supply chain consisting of one followed supplier and one dominant retailer, respectively. Based on dynamic programming theory, we characterize the optimal policy structures for two partners in each period. We also provide an approximation for the corresponding policy parameters evaluation in two cases. Then, we investigate the impacts of different option contracts and the demand risk on the decisions and performances of two members. Our results suggest that, whether concerning call or bidirectional option contracts, the optimal policies for two members always follow a base stock type. When the price parameters are the same for different option contracts, the service levels of both the system and the retailer are higher with call option contracts than with bidirectional ones, whereas the retailer’s inventory risk is lower with bidirectional option contracts than with call ones. Under the same conditions stated above, call option contracts can always benefit the supplier, but not the retailer. Owing to the retailer’s dominant position, call option contracts are better choice for the supply chain if the option (exercise) price is low (high), while bidirectional option contracts are more suitable choice for the supply chain if the option (exercise) price is high (low). In addition, an increase in the demand risk would prompt the supplier to increase his production quantity and the retailer to reduce the initial firm order quantity, either with call or bidirectional option contracts.</jats:p>"

There were many combined location-inventory design models in this field, but these models are under the assumptions of adequate capacity facilities, invariable lead time, unique product, and uncorrelated retailer’s demands. These assumptions have a big gap in the practical situation. In this paper, we design a combined location-inventory model for deteriorating products under capacitated facilities, stochastic lead time, multiple products, and correlated retailers’ stochastic demands assumptions. These constraints are near to actual supply chain circumstance. The problem is modeled as conic quadratic mix-integer programming (CQMIP) to minimize the total expected cost. We explain how to formulate these problems as conic quadratic mixed-integer problems, and in order to obtain better computational results we use extended cover cuts. Simultaneously we compare our method with the previous Lagrange methods; the result is that the new CQMIP method can get better solution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product quality and pricing, as the important competitive tools, play a key role in attracting consumers. In a supply chain, the decisions on product quality and pricing are usually interlinked and would influence the cooperation relation between the members, especially when they are fairness-concerned and have different bargaining power. However, linking the quality and pricing decisions to the decision-makers’ behavioral factors such as fairness concern draws a little attention in the literature of supply chain management. This paper incorporates the members’ fairness preference and bargaining power into the product quality and pricing decisions in a two-echelon supply chain, where the supplier offers core components with a certain quality level to the downstream manufacturer, who subsequently sells the final products in the end market. Both the supplier and the manufacturer are assumed to be fairness-concerned by adopting Nash bargaining solutions as their fairness reference points. We use game-theoretic models to analyze the equilibrium product quality and pricing strategies under the setting of integrated and decentralized supply chain, respectively. Detailed comparisons and sensitivity analysis are further conducted to examine the impacts of members’ strengths of fairness concern, bargaining power, and decision structure on their equilibrium product quality and pricing strategies and corresponding payoffs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industrial systems, such as logistics and supply chain networks, are complex systems because they comprise a big number of interconnected actors and significant nonlinear and stochastic features. This paper analyzes a distribution network design problem for a four‐echelon supply chain. The problem is represented as an inventory‐location model with uncertain demand and a continuous review inventory policy. The decision variables include location at the intermediate levels and product flows between echelons. The related safety and cyclic inventory levels can be computed from these decision variables. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to find the optimal design of the distribution network. A linearization of the nonlinear model based on a piecewise linear approximation is proposed. The objective function and nonlinear constraints are reformulated as linear formulations, transforming the original nonlinear problem into a mixed integer linear programming model. The proposed approach was tested in 50 instances to compare the nonlinear and linear formulations. The results prove that the proposed linearization outperforms the nonlinear formulation achieving convergence to a better local optimum with shorter computational time. This method provides flexibility to the decision‐maker allowing the analysis of scenarios in a shorter time.</jats:p>",

Indonesia is also an option for industrial sector because Indonesia is a strategic area besides the cost in Indonesia is quite low. Increased industry will cause environmental damage due to the waste generated and the resources used. environmental damage is increasingly felt, so the government makes the regulation that is Law No.3 of 2014 which contains one of them is the industrial obligation in protecting the environment. the current perceived environmental damage makes people increasingly concerned about the importance of maintaining the environment so as to make changes in product specifications demand. Rules and changes in demand, the industry must implement the aspect of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). SSCM has an understanding that is integrating financial, environmental, and social in the supply chain. In the implementation of sustainable supply chain required Key Performance Indicator which aims to monitor and measure the performance of companies in the application of sustainable. KPI obtained from the implementation of the SCOR model is by mapping the business process of the company in SCOR model, so that obtained 14 KPI in accordance with the company's business processes and support the sustainable implementation. KPI obtained is verified on the company to obtain KPI that can be applied at this time and got 8 KPI selected which then done weighting using AHP, weight is used to calculate the sustainable performance of company. In performing monitoring and performance measurement tools are needed in monitoring. currently the company has not monitoring system so that company can not monitor and measure performance well which resulted barrier of company in applying of sustainable supply chain.</jats:p>"

The optimal bargaining power allocation was found to be strongly related to the ability to convert and monitor technology, with the bargaining power gradually shifting to the manufacturer as the technology improved.

In this study, we analyzed a 5‐yr dataset of stormflow events across nine agricultural fields in the lower Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, to determine if edge‐of‐field surface runoff and tile drainage losses (total and dissolved reactive P) were limited by transport mechanisms or P supply. Field sites ranged from clay loam, silt loam, to sandy loam textures. Findings indicate that biogeochemical processes (P supply) were more important for tile drain P loading patterns (i.e., variable flow‐weighted mean concentrations ([<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>f</jats:sub>]) across a range of flow regimes) relative to surface runoff, which trended toward a more chemostatic or transport‐limited response. At two sites with the same soil texture, higher tile [<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>f</jats:sub>] and greater transport limitations were apparent at the site with higher soil available P (STP); however, STP did not significantly correlate with tile [<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>f</jats:sub>] or P loading patterns across the nine sites. This may reflect that the fields were all within a narrow STP range and were not elevated in STP concentrations (Olsen‐P, ≤25 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). For the study sites where STP was maintained at reasonable concentrations, hydrology was less of a driving factor for tile P loadings, and thus management strategies that limit P supply may be an effective way to reduce P losses from fields (e.g., timing of fertilizer application).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Core Ideas</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used metrics to evaluate controls on edge‐of‐field phosphorus losses.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We examined a 5‐yr database of stormflow events (all seasons, including winter).</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Tile P runoff trended toward being more supply limited than surface runoff.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this paper, a two-dimensional fluid model is built up for numerically simulating the methane needle-plane discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure. Spatial and axial distributions of electric intensity, electron temperature and particle densities are obtained. Reaction yields are summarized and crucial pathways to produce various kinds of charged and neutral particles are found out. Simulation results indicate that axial evolutions of CH3+ and CH4+ densities, electric intensity and electron temperature are similar and closely related. The CH5+ and C2H5+ densities first increase and then decrease along the axial direction. The CH3 and H densities have nearly identical spatial and axial distributions. Particle density distributions of CH2, C2H4 and C2H5 are obviously different in the area near the cathode but comparatively resemblant in the positive column region. The CH3+ and CH4+ are produced by electron impact ionizations between electrons and CH4. The CH5+ and C2H5+ are respectively generated by molecular impact dissociations between CH3+ and CH4 and between CH4+ and CH4. Electron impact decomposition between electrons and CH4 is a dominated reaction to produce CH3, CH2, CH and H. The reactions between CH2 and CH4 and between electrons and C2H4 are critical pathways to produce C2H4 and C2H2, respectively. In addition, the yields of electron impact decomposition reactions between electrons and CH4 and reactions between CH2 and CH4 account for 52.15% and 47.85% of total yields of H2 respectively.</jats:p>"

The paper investigates the impacts of carbon trading price and consumers’ environmental awareness on carbon emissions in supply chain under the cap-and-trade system. Firstly, it analyzes the centralized decision structure and obtains the requirements to coordinate carbon emissions reduction and order quantity in supply chain. Secondly, it proposes the supply chain coordination mechanism with revenue-sharing contract based on quantity discount policy, and the requirements that the contract parameters need to satisfy are also given. Thirdly, assuming the market demand is affected by consumer’s environmental awareness in addition form, the paper proposes the methods to determine the optimal order quantity and the optimal level of carbon emissions through model optimization. Finally, it investigates the impacts of carbon trading price on carbon emissions in supply chain. The results show that clean manufacturer’s optimal per-unit carbon emissions increase as the carbon trading price increases, while nongreen manufacturer’s optimal per-unit carbon emissions decrease as the carbon trading price increases. For the middle emissions manufacturer, the optimal per-unit carbon emissions depend on the relationship between the carbon trading price and the carbon reduction coefficient.</jats:p>"

Particularly, the empirical evidence to investigate the impacts of suppliers’ fairness on the relationship quality and the factors that affect the suppliers’ fairness is missing, and therefore this knowledge gap needs to be filled by new research. Herein, we conducted a survey of 450 agricultural product suppliers and systemically analyzed the impact of antecedents on fairness perception and the impact of fairness perception on relationship quality. In addition, we developed a structural equation model and found that information sharing and price satisfaction had significantly positive effects on procedural fairness and distributive fairness, respectively. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that procedural fairness is more important in improving the relationship quality than distributive fairness. However, supplier dependence is another important impact factor, and it greatly decreases the positive effects of suppliers’ fairness on relationship quality. In summary, the study results provide several managerial implications and extend our understanding of the importance of suppliers’ fairness in the relationship quality, which involves product development with respect to the supplier’s performance.</jats:p>"

When multichannel structure can be chosen, the manufacturer has three pricing strategies in direct market: <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> keeping the price high with a small discount, no customers choose the online store; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> keeping the price high with a moderate discount, only the loss-neutral customers choose the online store; <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math> keeping the price low with a big discount, all customers choose the online store. Consumers make up their decisive selections through comparing the price and channel attributes. We introduce utility function for analyzing the market demand and then identify the optimal pricing and channel strategy to maximize the manufacturer’s profit. Finally, the rationality and validities of the proposed model are illustrated by numerical examples, and sensitivity analyses of the parameters are also presented.</jats:p>"

In order to evaluate it, a quality risk evaluation indicator system for the food supply chain is constructed based on an extensive literature review in this paper. Furthermore, a mathematical model based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model (FCEM) and failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) for evaluating the quality risk level in the food supply chain is developed. A computational experiment aimed at verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of this proposed model is conducted on the basis of a questionnaire survey. The results suggest that this model can be used as a general guideline to assess the quality risk level in the food supply chain and achieve the most important objective of providing a reference for the public and private sectors when making decisions on food quality management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of trade credit and quantity discount in supply chain coordination when the sales effort effect on market demand is considered. In this paper, we consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a single retailer ordering a single product from a single manufacturer. Market demand is stochastic and is influenced by retailer sales effort. We formulate an analytical model based on a single trade credit and find that the single trade credit cannot achieve the perfect coordination of the supply chain. Then, we develop a hybrid quantitative analytical model for supply chain coordination by coherently integrating incentives of trade credit and quantity discount with sales effort effects. The results demonstrate that, providing that the discount rate satisfies certain conditions, the proposed hybrid model combining trade credit and quantity discount will be able to effectively coordinate the supply chain by motivating retailers to exert their sales effort and increase product order quantity. Furthermore, the hybrid quantitative analytical model can provide great flexibility in coordinating the supply chain to achieve an optimal situation through the adjustment of relevant parameters to resolve conflict of interests from different supply chain members. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model.</jats:p>"

        "Home &gt; All Content &gt; Vol 49, No 1 (2018) Value Chains for Nutrition in South Asia: Who Delivers, How, and to Whom? Cover Page Edited by: Mar Maestre and Nigel Poole February 2018 Volume 49 Issue 1 There is currently much talk of the private sector role in nutrition, and whether the state can ‘shape’ the market to deliver better nutritional outcomes.  This issue of the IDS Bulletin presents research findings in this area, developed by the consortium of research partners under the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) programme.  The IDS Bulletin aims to analyse existing (or potential) agri-food value chain pathways for delivering nutritious foods from agriculture to vulnerable populations in South Asia. It discusses the role of both public and private actors in making these value chains more effective in achieving sustained increased consumption of nutrient-rich foods.  In comparing the different pathways, this set of articles warns against the assumption that increasing the supply of certain products will directly lead to increased consumption. It highlights how, in South Asia, interventions or policies that try to enhance these pathways often struggle because of a mix of supply, distribution, marketing, and consumption challenges.  This IDS Bulletin argues that the key to sustainable food systems might be a ‘food sovereignty’ approach. This calls for awareness at all levels of decision-making – public, private and civil society – in the promotion of nutrition-sensitive value chains, emphasising the need for a stronger government role in shaping agri-food value chain pathways. By looking at the limits of what business can and cannot achieve in a given market environment, the IDS Bulletin provides insights to policymakers about how to create an appropriate institutional environment that shapes how these value chains operate for the benefit of nutritionally vulnerable target groups.
